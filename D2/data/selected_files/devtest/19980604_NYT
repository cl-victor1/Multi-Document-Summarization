GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We had barely gotten over the carnage in Jonesboro, Ark., when a
young gunman sprayed a high school cafeteria with a barrage of
bullets in Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   When he was done, 24 students had been hit. Two died. Police
have accused 15-year-old Kipland Kinkel of killing those students,
and his parents, who were shot earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And so the speculation begins anew. What is this world coming
to? Why are kids so violent? And why aren't we doing a better job
of socializing them?
</P>
<P>
   But despite what appears to be a wide and growing tide of
violent juvenile crime, statistics show declines at the local,
state and national levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are horrible events that shock us, and should shock
us,'' said Alfred Blumstein, professor of operations research and
public policy at John Heinz School of Public Policy and Management
at Carnegie Mellon University. ``But a few incidences a year,
however distressing, are still short of a tide.''
</P>
<P>
   A study released in January by the Texas Criminal Justice Policy
Council bears that out, showing a significant drop in violent
juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, violent and weapons offenses by Texas juveniles dropped
12 percent, despite a 1.4 percent rise in the juvenile population.
</P>
<P>
   And in May, the Department of Public Safety reported a 2.4
percent drop in juvenile arrests statewide last year, the first
decrease since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Violent offenses such as homicides, aggravated robbery and
sexual assaults have been declining in Tarrant County for the past
several years, said Carey Cockerell, director of Tarrant County
Juvenile Services.
</P>
<P>
   Cockerell attributed the local decline to better community
programming, such as the Tarrant County Advocate Program, YMCA,
Boys and Girls Clubs, community policing and efforts that ``put
resources with kids and their families in their neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   If children are more violent, he said, it is because ``we
haven't provided the right skills for kids to deal with conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that a lot of adolescents do not have
appropriate role models who care about them enough to set limits,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cockerell and others blame the media for the growing negative
perception of juveniles and say that media coverage might encourage
juveniles to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What never gets conveyed is, we're still talking about a very
small minority of kids that commit the most heinous crime,'' said
Judy Briscoe, chief of staff at the Texas Youth Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At least one major newspaper _ the ``Chicago Sun-Times'' _
agrees that teen-agers are influenced by the news they see and
read, and accordingly opted to change the way it covered the
Springfield shooting. Instead of running the story on the front
page, Editor in Chief Nigel Wade decided to play it on Pages 2 and
3. On the front was a message to readers explaining the newspaper's
``concern that more prominent coverage might harm or frighten
vulnerable children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some children see only the front page of a newspaper, in a
box, on the street, on the porch or over the breakfast table,''
Wade said in a ``New York Times'' column. ``I did not want to take
the risk that another front-page story about another school
shooting might cause some unbalanced 15-year-old to add one more
disaster to the recent series.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Briscoe says, children do seem more violent
than they were 20 years ago. But so are adults, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1973, when I got into this business, the predominant
offense for which kids were committed was stealing and then
disobedience (running away,)'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, 35 percent of our kids are committed for violent
offenses, but children aren't doing anything adults aren't doing.
Our youth violence is a microcosm of what's going on in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumstein, however, is not convinced that youths are more
violent. They just have more access to lethal weaponry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the access to the weaponry that results in the tragic
consequences, because youth have always fought with each other,''
he said. ``But when it's a battle with fists, the dynamics run much
more slowly. With a gun it evolves very rapidly, too fast for a
third party to intervene. That also raises the stakes and
encourages others to arm themselves, thereby triggering a
pre-emptive strike: `I better get him before he gets me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although schools have been the focal point of much of the
tragedy, a survey of major North Texas school districts shows that
few weapons were confiscated from students this past year.
Arlington had the highest number, with five. Fort Worth officials
confiscated four, and none was found in the Hurst-Euless-Bedford
district.
</P>
<P>
   Cecelia Speer, director of student affairs, said the Fort Worth
school district has seen a dramatic drop in the number of guns
confiscated. The district has gone from a high of 69 guns in
1991-92, to 39 guns in 1992-93, to 24 in 1993-94, and down into the
single digits. The number crept back up to 10 during 1996-97, but
dropped again this year to four (one of which was confiscated from
a nonstudent).
</P>
<P>
   What is most shocking is the number and power of the guns
students have been using in their crimes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jonesboro shooting, investigators found 22 spent shell
casings in the copse of trees from where the suspects _ a
13-year-old boy and an 11-year-old boy _ are believed to have shot
at their schoolmates. Five casings were from a .30-06 rifle.
Fifteen were from a .30-caliber rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I find astonishing is not that a 13-year-old
kid is angry at his girlfriend,'' said Blumstein, ``but that he has
access to the arsenal that he is reported to have had.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would favor some type of punishment _ civil or
criminal _ for people who give children access to guns, just
bartenders are liable for letting someone become drunk if that
person commits vehicular homicide.

DISNEY SAID TO BE EYEING NET SEARCH SPECIALIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Widespread rumors have emerged that Walt Disney
Co., as part of its strategy to compete aggressively on the World
Wide Web, is in talks to make a major investment in Internet search
specialist Excite Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising Age reported this week that Disney is in talks to
buy up to 40 percent of Excite, the second-most-popular search Web
site behind Yahoo! Inc., as part of a plan to make all Disney Web
sites available through an umbrella entry point that could be
called D Guide or Go Online.
</P>
<P>
   Buying 40 percent of Excite would likely cost Disney at least
$800 million. Excite spurned an unsolicited $1.68 billion buyout
bid at $72 a share two weeks ago from Zapata Corp., a Houston-based
fish-meal processor trying to diversify onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Excite officials declined to comment on the Ad Age
report, which was sourced to an unnamed executive familiar with the
discussions. Analyst Abhishek S. Gami of William C. Blair said
speculation about a Disney-Excite alliance have been ``floating''
around Internet chat rooms recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea if the rumors are true but I would never say
never,'' Gami said. ``Excite would represent a great distribution
vehicle if Disney felt the time was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Excite, of Redwood City, currently generates traffic of 40
million pages viewed daily and themes its site in red and yellow,
as opposed to Yahoo's more subdued blue and gray. It offers both
the Excite and WebCrawler search engines and services for
electronic commerce, direct marketing and classified ads.
</P>
<P>
   Deal speculation started after Chairman Michael Eisner announced
in April that Disney wanted to become a ``gatekeeper'' to the Web.
Disney operates several prominent sites, including Disney.com,
Daily Blast subscription service, ESPN Sportzone, ABC.com and
ABCNews.com and recently agreed to buy the two-thirds of Web
publisher Starwave it did not already own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney has been doing a pretty good job of providing
content,'' Gami said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Excite, it has lost more than $100 million since its 1995
start-up, including a $6 million loss in the 1998 first quarter
that was less than analysts expected. Revenue more than tripled to
$23 million from $7.5 million in the 1997 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Excite has alliances with America Online, Intuit, Netscape,
Prodigy and Tribune Co. Its stock price hit $91 in April after
Yahoo's first-quarter earnings prompted a surge in Internet stocks
but fell back in recent weeks and closed Wednesday at $55, off
$1.125.

 AIR FORCE FIGHTER FLYBY IS ULTIMATE MILITARY HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
 LD-WRITETHRU-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA DERUYTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Air Force fighter flyover that thrilled onlookers
at Barry Goldwater's memorial service represents the ultimate
military tribute for an American patriot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wednesday's ``Missing Man'' formation led by Lt. Wade May
and performed by the 62nd fighter squadron was unusual, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The formation, in which one F-16 jet departs from a four-ship
formation up into the sky, symbolizes the loss of a fallen airman.
</P>
<P>
   Flyovers are typically performed by Air Force pilots during the
funeral services of four-star generals and military personnel who
die in active duty, said 1st Lt. Barry Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force granted a flyover for Goldwater, who retired in
1967 as major general in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, out of
respect.
</P>
<P>
   The flyover service ``was a tribute to an Air Force officer and
patriot,'' said Maj. Eric Schnaible at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of a deceased pilot can make a formal request for
a flyover in writing. The person considered the next of kin must
write the request.
</P>
<P>
   The request, along with a biography of the deceased and proof of
military services, is sent to Texas, which forwards the materials
to the Pentagon for review. The Air Force Chief of Staff then
decides whether to approve or decline the request.
</P>
<P>
   Schnaible said to qualify for a flyover, the individual must
have served in the military, but the Air Force makes some
exceptions for public officials.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pentagon records, the formation originated prior to
1935 from the British Royal Air Force, which used it upon returning
from a mission to tell ground officials how many losses were
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was used in 1935 during a review by King George V
and eventually evolved into a traditional part of RAF ceremonies
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded American use of the flyover was in 1938
during the burial of Maj. Gen. Oscar Westover, Army Air Corps Chief
of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Today, flyovers are sometimes allowed during other ceremonies,
such as during the anniversary of Pearl Harbor and other patriotic
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formation is a solemn tribute, so (the Air Force) is
careful to limit the number of events it is used for,'' said
Schnaible. &QL;

Emily Post's ``Etiquette.'' The stamp _ a 1920s place-setting with
Lafayette Towle silver, a goblet and hand-painted Copeland Spode

   The topic for the column became ob vious Wednesday morning,
sitting in the third row at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, watching
working men and woman walk slowly past the casket of Barry
Goldwater, some of them stopping, some of them reaching out to
touch the flag-covered coffin, gently, the way a par ent touches a
sleeping child.
</P>
<P>
   Any hack worth his weight could see it. The thing to write about
on the day of the funeral of this completely original American man.
. .was a former world-class wrestler from Poland.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, a man only lies in state if he stood for
something.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater stood for fairness, for indi vidual rights, for
liberty, for all that things Roman Wroclawski seeks, but so far has
been denied.
</P>
<P>
   His time is running out. He may soon be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Goldwater wasn't one to stand on ceremony _ even a big
public funeral _ when a regular guy was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Wroclawski came to the United States about four years ago on a
visitor's visa, bringing with him his wife and two chil dren. He
had been the world Greco-Ro man champion in 1982. Afterwards,
combining his fame in Poland with new-found worldliness, Wroclawski
wrote a book critical of his country.
</P>
<P>
   It got him accused of treason.
</P>
<P>
   As his lawyer, Marshall Whitehead de scribes it, ``Roman rose
above the masses. He was decorated by the pope himself. He was a
world champion. He had tasted freedom and he decided to ex press
himself about it. That made him some powerful enemies. They're just
waiting for him back there, unless we al low him to remain. But
instead of wel coming him, our government is trying to throw him
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republic's Bob Petrie has written several articles about
Wroclawski's case. But they've washed over like a sand cas tle by
wave upon wave of Goldwater cov erage.
</P>
<P>
   The senator wouldn't have liked that.
</P>
<P>
   Wroclawski works here as a wrestling coach. Earlier this year,
was supposed to appear before an immigration judge at a political
asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer at the time, former Arizona Gov. Raul Castro, got a
letter notifying him of the hearing. But it was lost and Wroclawski
wasn't told about the court date. Because he didn't show up, the
judge ordered him to be deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the government's rules and regulations,''
Whitehead said. ``But I'm afraid they're looking only at proce
dures and not at substance. This wasn't Roman's fault. To send this
family back without even a hearing seems to go against everything
we stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's lawyers argue that the wrestling coach _ who
doesn't speak English well _ is responsible for his law yer's
mistakes and should be shipped back to Poland.
</P>
<P>
   It could happen June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, however, Whitehead was told he'll have a
chance to argue be fore immigration Judge Dean LeVay on
Wroclawski's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   An ``emergency hearing'' is scheduled for Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge decides to reopen Wro clawski's case, he and his
family can stay in the country and fight for asylum. If not,
they'll have to leave. All of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What rubs me the wrong way about this,'' Whitehead said,
``what should rub ALL of us the wrong way about this, is that the
man didn't have a chance to pres ent his case. As it is, we're
punishing him for the mistake of an attorney. That's can't be
right. That isn't what this country is about. All we're asking for
is a fair shake. That's why generations of immi grants like the
Wroclawski's have come here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also why the story of the foreign wrestler should be told
on this day. Not just because Wroclawski needs help. Not just
because it's right. But because I read in the paper this week about
the head of another family who left Poland in search of a better
life in America. This man was called ``Big Mike.''

STARS STAY ALIVE WITH A 3-2 OVERTIME VICTORY OVER RED WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He wanted one more playoff game, No. 191 in a career
evenly split between excellence and endurance. Guy Carbonneau, the
captain of the 1993 Stanley Cup Montreal Canadiens, showed in one
frenetic sequence why he won the Selke trophy as best defensive
forward in that championship year.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old's hustle also kept the Dallas Stars alive in the
Western Conference finals, as he scored the tying goal at the end
of regulation and the Stars came back to win, 3-2, in overtime
against the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Just 1 minute 25 seconds from elimination, Carbonneau dived to
the ice, saved and centered the puck, only to scramble to his feet
and get it right back from Sergei Zubov. He was nearly at a right
angle from Red Wing goalie Chris Osgood when he feigned and fired
the shot from that almost impossible angle.
</P>
<P>
   His riser somehow wedged into the foot-wide space between
Osgood's head and the left pipe to catch the front corner of the
net, and the 16,928 fans went wild. The Stars had a new life in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to score,'' Carbonneau said. ``I just wanted
to get it in front of the net where our guys were.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just 46 seconds into overtime, Jamie Langenbrunner, who was 6
when Carbonneau played his first National Hockey League game,
slapped a shot from just inside the red line, about 70 feet from
the goal, underneath an all alone and unexpecting Osgood.
Langenbrunner's shot knuckled, bounced twice on the ice, hit
Osgood's stick, rolled over and slid slowly into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit my stick and curved up,'' Osgood said. ``I knew it was
in as soon as it got past me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanenbrunner said he was trying to dump the puck for a line
change at the end of his shift. ``We just want to shoot at him at
all angles,'' he said, ``and I unloaded one on him.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a Game 6, in Detroit, as the Stars cut the Red
Wing' series lead to three games to two. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played a lot of these games,'' Carbonneau said, ``and I
know enough that no one wants to end their season right now. We
have plenty of time to play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series that had not experienced a single lead change, Igor
Larionov changed that with 16:20 left in the second period by
whistling a goal past Stars' goaltender Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas outshot Detroit, 14-6, in the first period, and the Stars
were the first to score in a series where whoever put the first
points on the board went on to win. They scored with 8:53 left by
doing what they failed to do in Game 4 _ winning a faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau was quickest on the draw and found Craig Ludwig on
the point. Ludwig launched a missile dead on at Osgood, who managed
to knock it down with his knee pad. But Stars forward Mike Keane
was there to easily bury the rebound past the prone Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of nursing the 1-0 lead with its focus on hard
checking, Dallas relaxed with 32 seconds left in the period and
allowed a careless goal. Larry Murphy's shot deflected off Tomas
Holmstrom in front of the net. Holmstrom, Stars defenseman Craig
Muni and Belfour crashed into each other and the puck skipped over
the helpless Belfour. &QL;

OLD GUY GIVES LIFE TO STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars remain alive because there's still life in
Guy Carbonneau's 38-year-old legs.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps because when you're playing in your 190th playoff
game, when you're in the postseason for the 19th time, when you've
been to the Stanley Cup Finals three times and hoisted the Cup
twice, you know it's truly not over until the final horn sounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was Carbonneau's impossible, incredible, hustling, amazing
goal when all seemed lost that sent Game 5 of the Western
Conference finals into overtime last night.
</P>
<P>
   Without that goal, Jamie Langenbrunner doesn't score in the
first minute of overtime and the Stars don't defeat the Detroit Red
Wings, 3-2, at Reunion Arena. Without Carbonneau's goal, the Stars
aren't packing for a return trip to Motown for Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to let your teammates down,'' said Carbonneau,
who also assisted on the Stars' first goal by winning a faceoff in
the Red Wings' end. ``We've had a great season, and nobody wanted
it to be over tonight. That's what keeps you going. Instead of
playing golf together, we still want to play hockey together.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what gave Carbonneau the energy to make the play of the
night, and perhaps the series.
</P>
<P>
   There was less than two minutes left when Carbonneau found
himself on his rear end in the corner behind the Detroit goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went down behind the net, and fell down a little bit,''
Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Down, like the rest of the Stars who were on the verge of
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Down, but not done.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau poked his stick and hit the puck, knocking it away
from a Red Wings player and keeping it alive. Even though he was in
his 27th shift and his 16th minute _ virtually the same as a
youngster like the 22-year-old Langenbrunner _ he quickly scrambled
to his feet and headed for the front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The puck skittered past with a Red Wings player in hot pursuit,
but Carbonneau dived headlong, poking it out to Sergei Zubov at the
blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Carbonneau got up. Zubov passed the puck to him, and
Carbonneau turned and fired. The puck deflected off the stick of
Red Wings defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom and beat goalie Chris Osgood
high to the glove side, just sneaking the puck inside the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The goal tied the score with 1:25 left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great effort by him,'' Langenbrunner said. ``That
gave us a big boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner praised his teammate with a big smile. Carbonneau,
the stoic French-Canadian, merely shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were desperate,'' Carbonneau said. ``We kept working hard,
and trying for a break. We just got it at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Break'' might be the right word. Osgood called it a lucky
goal, and Carbonneau didn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to score,'' he said. ``I was trying to hit it
where someone could get a rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you're playing in you're 190th playoff game, when you
know what it takes to win a Stanley Cup, and when your legs
suddenly feel about 10 years younger, you tend to make your own
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of player those things happen to,'' defenseman
Darryl Sydor said.

ARIZONA SENIORS SUE NURSING-HOME OPERATORS ANDOTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, they believed it was a renegade family of nursing-home
operators that swindled them out of their security.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a group of Valley seniors saysa multibillion-dollar
Japanese company is as much at fault as the Vernon Will family.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four seniors filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Maricopa County
``Superior Court against companies believed to be subsidiaries of
Nomura Securities Co., Japan's biggest brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Nomura Asset Capital Corp., Nomura Holding
America Inc. and Nomura Securities Co. helped Will and his company,
Camelot Campus of Care, to commit acts of fraud and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Will is president and director of WilCare Corp., which filed for
reorganization last year.
</P>
<P>
   The suit asks for at least $2 million in damages as well as
requiring the seniors' claims to be addressed before Nomura's
liens.
</P>
<P>
   The seniors say the suit can help recoup their losses after
WilCare, the company that sold them guarantees of lifetime housing,
filed for bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   After WilCare filed, residents learned that their deposits,
which ranged from $41,000 to $88,000, were gone. The residents had
been told the money was refundable and held in reserve, but Will,
WilCare president, said they had been depleted to keep the company
going.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Camelot Campus of Care in Peoria and Park Regency
Village in Chandler worried about being penniless and homeless.
</P>
<P>
   They grew even more worried when they heard that Will and his
family had been in legal and financial hot water before: filing for
bankruptcy reorganization for as many as nine nursing homes in
California; three revocations of nursing-home licenses; and
indictments on Medicare fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Woods, the state Attorney General, also had Will in his
gun sights as well. Will, his son, Douglas, and Joseph Ganzenhuber
were indicted by a state grand jury in November on 35 counts,
including fraud and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   The three pleaded innocent and are awaiting trial. Ivan Mathew,
Will's attorney, has not seen the suit and declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as WilCare's bankruptcy case unfolded, creditors'
attorneys learned of a deal between Vernon Will and Nomura Asset
Capital Corp. that transferred property worth $17.4 million and the
residents' deposits to a new corporation owned wholly by Will.
</P>
<P>
   The new corporation couldn't be touched by any of WilCare's
creditors, including the residents, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Nomura required Camelot to pay the new
company $29,000 a month extra. The move drained cash out of the
existing company for Vernon Will's benefit, said Robert Kinas, one
of the lawyers for the residents.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura knew that the residents' deposits were being siphoned
away, Kinas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it make them responsible to the lifetime residents for
the harm that they have caused them? Our answer is certainly `yes,'
'' Kinas said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lorenzen, representing Nomura, said his client would
have never conspired with Will to defraud the residents.
</P>
<P>
   In applying for a $13 million loan from Nomura, Will's company
never revealed the deposits. The deposits were not transferred to
the new company, Lorenzen said. &QL; 
The Camelot and Park Regency complexes now are managed by a
court-appointed trustee, who is working to sell both places. &QL;

FORDS, HONDAS, TOYOTAS LEAD IN CONSUMER RANKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When it comes to quality, Fords, Hondas and
Toyotas are tops with consumers, according to a widely watched J.D.
Power and Associates analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Those three companies placed the most models in Power's annual
Initial Quality Study, released Wednesday, which tracks the number
of problems owners of new vehicles experience within the first
three months of purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The study was introduced in 1987 and, as usual, Asian and
European manufacturers placed more models on the list than domestic
manufacturers. But domestic manufacturers are building better cars
now, said George Owens, the study's product director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality as a whole continues to improve and while a gap still
exists, domestic automakers seem to be working hard to close it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study ranked the best model in each class and the top two
finishers and ties.
</P>
<P>
   Cracking the study for the first time, Chrysler nameplates swept
the important midsize car categories. The redesigned Concorde was
named best premium midsize car and the Cirrus best entry midsize
car.
</P>
<P>
   Most new models typically encounter break-in problems but
Chrysler apparently avoided this pitfall with the Concorde, the
L.A.-based market research firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Power said the Concorde's performance was especially noteworthy
because the car's designers relied heavily on virtual design and
very little physical mock-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Ford and Honda products made the list while Toyota
accounted for six. Five General Motors models were ranked and
Nissan placed four. Chrysler and BMW had three each.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's Lexus LS400 received the award as the best premium
luxury car and the top score in the survey. It's the fifth time in
the past six years the model won best in class.
</P>
<P>
   This year, J.D. Power made major changes in the study, which
means the findings cannot be compared directly to previous year's
results. The number of potential problem areas consumers were asked
to address was expanded to 135 from 89, and included features such
as air bags and anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the industry average per 100 problems hit 176 this
year, nearly double the 1997 results. This was expected to happen,
Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to pick up on anything that could be a possible issue
for consumers. When we started 10 years ago, some of these things
were just on the drawing board as dreams and now they are on the
most standard of vehicles,'' he said.

JAZZ WIN GAME 1 IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ There were almost too many things on Utah's
side. Ten days' rest. Home-court advantage. And Michael Jordan
wagging his tongue more from exhaustion than spite.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone, John Stockton and the Jazz extras were more
comfortable than confident going into Game 1 of the National
Basketball Association finals. But they eventually found their
range from the perimeter and, more important, they found Jordan on
the defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   The combination added up to an 88-85 victory in overtime and a
1-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton dominated the overtime. After he fed Malone for a
driving layup to open the period, he then scored Utah's last 7
points.
</P>
<P>
   A tough fallaway jumper by a triple-teamed Jordan pulled the
Bulls within 84-82, but Stockton responded with 9.3 seconds left,
hitting a runner in the lane while tightly covered by Steve Kerr.
Toni Kukoc's long 3-pointer put the Bulls within a point with 5.4
seconds to go, but there was Stockton again, closing the scoring
with two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to inbound the ball the length of the court because they
were out of time outs, the Bulls managed to get an open 3-pointer
by Scottie Pippen as time expired, but it wasn't close.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to topple a champion with one punch, but the
Jazz staggered the Bulls enough to make Game 2 a major concern for
Jordan's club. The teams meet again here Friday night before the
series shifts to Chicago for Games 3, 4 and 5 beginning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Longley tied the game, 79-79, with 14.3 seconds left in
regulation, hitting a tough lean-in jumper after Jordan was forced
to pass the ball. The play climaxed a wild final five minutes of
regulation in which the Bulls came back from a 7-point deficit to
tie the game on a Pippen 3-pointer with 2 minutes 34 seconds left.
Pippen's shot, which made the score 75-75, silenced the building.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone, after suffering through one of the worst shooting
nights of his career, hit two consecutive jumpers to put the Jazz
on top, 79-75, but the Bulls would not wilt. Pippen made two free
throws with 51.8 seconds left in regulation and Longley's shot
forced the Jazz to call time out and set up a potential
game-winning play. After a non-shooting foul by the Bulls, Bryon
Russell inbounded the ball with 7.3 seconds left and Stockton's
jumper bounced high off the rim, forcing the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Utah went from a mediocre first half _ after which it led, 45-40
_ into a productive third quarter. Jordan was his usual awesome
self, scoring 33 points. Employing up-and-under moves in the post
and picturesque step-back jump shots from the perimeter, he had 20
points by halftime and made the Jazz work on defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone (21 points, 13 rebounds) and especially Stockton (24
points on 9-of-12 shooting, 8 assists) were too much. Solid play
off Utah's bench from Howard Eisley, Shandon Anderson and Chris
Morris nearly led to the Jazz blowing the game open in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls caught their breath and came back on the shoulders
of you-know-who.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had not played in 10 days since knocking out the Los
Angeles Lakers in four straight games in the Western Confeence
finals. If the Bulls looked fatigued early, Utah was unpolished and
rusty.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was atrocious from the field. Perhaps he was feeling the
strain of last season's finals, in which he missed several crucial
free throws to help the Bulls win in six games. Maybe the taped and
misshapen middle finger on his shooting hand was bothering him more
than he let on before the series began.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, his marksmanship prevented Utah from ever pulling
away from Chicago. He missed 13 of his first 17 shots. With 6
minutes 59 seconds left in the game, the Bulls trailed by only
69-65 and could finally see daylight in this Utah dungeon.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had forged an 8-point lead at the end of the third
quarter, but could never put the Bulls away. Jordan and Pippen
seemed to have prepared a plan: keep it close and see what happens
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's 67-59 lead after three quarters was a direct result of
Chicago's inept offensive play. Toni Kukoc was only 2 of 9 from the
floor through three quarters, and the Bulls had shot only 43
percent as a team up to that point.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman was expected to start for the Bulls, but the club
announced before the game that he had suffered torn ligaments in
his right thumb during Game 7 of the Indiana series. Instead, Kukoc
got the nod and the Bulls suffered physically for it.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was getting position inside, nearly setting up a pup tent
in the middle of paint. But he missed often, hitting only 4 of 14
shots before the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls Coach Phil Jackson went to his bench after the third
quarter, hoping to give Jordan the rest he needed to take care of
business in the final minutes. It worked for a while _ Scott
Burrell, Jud Buechler and Steve Kerr did a good job of preventing
the Jazz from taking over the game _ but eventually Utah wore
Chicago down.
</P>
<P>
   While Malone struggled from the field, Stockton more than
shouldered the scoring responsibility. He had 13 points at
halftime, dropping in jump shots from 15 to 18 feet out and also
making some improbable runners in the lane with hands in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's Bryon Russell also made his shots, filling the lanes on
the fast break or spotting up around the 3-point arc. Russell,
Morris and Shandon Anderson threw the Bulls off their game by
pushing the ball up the court in transition in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It worked until Jordan caught fire. For all the talk about his
having one foot on the court and the other on the ninth hole of a
retirement-community golf course, he was dazzling once more.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting double teams with ease and grace, he kept going to the
up-and-under move. First, he would use a pump fake and then step
between two defenders until he was inches from the rim for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   When he grew bored with those tactics, he simply stepped back
and fired off one foot while leaving his defender flailing at air.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the court, Malone and the rim were not
getting along. He kept missing so often that the Jazz crowd seemed
to want someone else to shoot the ball. &QL;

STARS SURPRISE RED WINGS, 3-2, IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Hold last call, the Stars are thinking about ordering
up another round.
</P>
<P>
   With the season about to close on the Stars last night, Guy
Carbonneau scored with 1:25 remaining to tie the score in
regulation and Jamie Langenbrunner fluttered in an 80-foot shot 46
seconds into overtime to win it, 3-2, and push this best-of-seven
Western Conference finals to Game 6 tomorrow in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars still trail 3-2 in the series but appear to have new
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live to fight again another day,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Few people in the capacity crowd of 16,928 at Reunion Arena or
in the national television audience on ESPN believed it was
possible. The Red Wings had held a 2-1 lead since the 3:40 mark of
the second period, and it appeared that nothing the Stars could do
would break that stranglehold. In fact, Game 5 had the same look as
the two losses that came before it for the Stars. They had
dominated statistically, but found a way to trail on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars outshot the Red Wings 14-6 in the first period and
even scored the first goal _ a refreshing change after they had
trailed by four goals in Game 3 and two goals in Game 4 before
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Mike Keane pushed the marker across on a perfect
play set up by the Stars' Montreal Mafia. Three former Canadiens
players were involved as Carbonneau won the faceoff back, Craig
Ludwig put a shot on goal and Keane shoveled in the rebound with a
backhand for a 1-0 lead at the 14:16 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Stars made that one glitch, the Red Wings jumped
all over it. Ludwig took a needless retaliation penalty, and Tomas
Holmstrom cashed in with a power-play goal _ an ugly bouncing puck
that was originally shot by Wings defenseman Larry Murphy and
ricocheted off bodies, gloves and Holmstrom's stick until it
trickled past Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' center Mike Modano said. ``We felt we
were playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration hit its peak at the 3:40 mark of the second period
as Wings center Igor Larionov, who had been dormant for the series,
threw a 40-foot shot from the left wing that inexplicable slid past
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one I'd like to have back,'' the Stars goalie said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   So would Stars fans, who mockingly cheered Belfour minutes later
for making a save on a 70-footer. They didn't know how prophetic
they would be.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour turned up his intensity and helped carry the Stars
through a depressing second period. But even with that and a
revived Stars attack in the third period, it appeared the season
was over.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting image came seven minutes into the third period when
Modano had a Darryl Sydor rebound on his stick and the right side
of the net wide open. He fired the shot two feet to the right, and
it appeared the Stars would get no luck in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been one I remembered all summer,'' Modano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, Langenbrunner continued his scoreless curse
in the playoffs when his redirected shot skittered past Osgood and
off the right post.
</P>
<P>
   But then the game swung on an amazing play by Carbonneau with
the Stars trying to get Belfour off the ice with under 1:30
remaining. Carbonneau drove hard into the offensive zone and dove
to the ice to prevent the Red Wings' Murphy from getting possession
of the puck. Carbonneau then jumped up to deflect a puck away from
Red Wings defenseman Nick Lidstrom to Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov
at the point.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov held the puck, Carbonneau recovered his composure and
stood up in the right circle. Zubov sent a pass to Carbonneau, and
Carbonneau whistled a shot that luckily deflected off the stick of
Lidstrom past Osgood to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I don't know what I was doing,''
Carbonneau said. ``I just wanted to keep the puck alive.''
</P>
<P>
   That made Langenbrunner's goal almost anticlimactic. Two shifts
into the overtime, the Stars' scoring line had survived a Red Wings
rush and was looking to get off the ice. Langenbrunner took a pass
from Mike Modano and instead of just dumping in off the end boards,
he sent a fluttering shot at Osgood, who previously had surrendered
long-distance goals in the playoffs to Al MacInnis of the St. Louis
Blues and Jeremy Roenick of the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood tried to play the puck with the inside of his stick, but
instead deflected it behind him and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about putting it on him,'' Modano said. ``He's
good at handling the puck, but he doesn't seem to like the low
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally caught a break.''
</P>
<P>
   And pushed closing time at least one game further into the
season.

INJURY HAMPERS RODMAN'S EFFECTIVENESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The Bulls' enigmatic Dennis Rodman became a
curiosity once again. After Coach Phil Jackson spent three days
pumping up his enigmatic forward to play well against Karl Malone,
Rodman surfaced from the locker room with a mystery injury on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had planned to start Luc Longley on Malone, and bring
Rodman off the bench to irritate the Jazz star in Game 1 of the
finals. But because of strained ligaments in his right thumb,
Rodman's ability to bother Malone was in question. Rodman had
energy against a cold-shooting Malone at times, but he was not his
usual self, at least at first.
</P>
<P>
   He was very hesitant in going for rebounds, not wanting to stick
his right hand into the fray. But the more Malone struggled, the
more Rodman got into the mix. Rodman played a key role in keeping
the Bulls in this game down the stretch. He leaped up to slap a
fingeroll by Malone away with two minutes left in regulation, using
his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then in overtime, Rodman's intellect came through when he called
for a timeout while Longley was tied up for a loose ball. That
saved the Bulls a possession. Rodman also had a steal on John
Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   All of this effort kept Malone in check. He was an awful 9 of 25
from the floor, but did have 14 rebounds. It was left to Stockton
to make the game-breaking basket, as he hit a runner with 9.3
second left in overtime. In the end, Malone still out-muscled
Rodman to several rebounds, but Rodman grabbed 10 and helped the
Bulls stay close.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no mention of Rodman's injury until game
time, it apparently occurred in Game 7 of the Bulls' series-ending
win against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be able to rebound like I want to,'' Rodman
said before the game. ``I can't grab the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It almost seemed like Rodman was planting an excuse. Rodman
struggled against Malone in last year's final and was unable to
force Malone out of position and get around his bulky frame for
rebounds. Even so, the Bulls were counting on Rodman this time.
Michael Jordan made that clear, as did Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very big for us if he can do well,'' Pippen
said. ``We need him to play at the level that we know he can. We
need him to get back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was needed right away after Longley found himself in foul
trouble early. But where was Rodman? With 4 minutes 3 seconds left
in the first quarter, Jackson searched for Rodman. But he was in
the locker room working out, and did not expect to be needed so
soon. Jackson had to go to Dickey Simpkins until Rodman surfaced a
few seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the game, Rodman was not especially effective, but
Malone was not taking advantage of the mismatch. Malone seemed to
be rusty after a 10-day layoff leading up to this game. He had no
rhythm, and hit just 3 of 8 shots in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was the benefactor of Malone's frustrations, and was able
to sneak around him down the stretch for a couple of rebounds.
Rodman smiled at Malone's inability to score. This matchup was
working out much better than he expected. Suddenly, his thumb
didn't seem such a hindrance.

BIZARRE GOAL HAS OSGOOD SEEING RED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He had explained this goal before. Another game,
another player, another time, maybe, but it was the same goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't see it at first,'' Osgood said of Jamie
Lagenbrunner's game-winning goal that came 46 seconds into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It curved, hit the inside of my stick,'' Osgood continued. ``I
knew when it hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner had been heading to his bench for a shift change,
overtime had just begun and his legs were fresh. He decided to
launch a final shot.
</P>
<P>
   He was standing at center ice where the Star turns from green to
gold when he released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the other games, and we've seen what kind of goals
can go in,'' Lagenbrunner said.
</P>
<P>
   The puck was bouncing, from its side to flat to back on its
side, changing trajectory a couple of times. The puck looked to be
heading wide, said Stars players after looking at the replay.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood said he just wanted to tip Langenbrunner's bouncing puck
to a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just curved and hit the inside of my stick,'' Osgood said
again.
</P>
<P>
   The curved stick turned the puck just enough that it trickled
inside the post. The red lamp lighting just 42 seconds into
overtime of Game 5, allowing the Stars to stave off elimination for
at least another game with a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel lucky,'' Langenbrunner said. ``You don't
count on any of those going in like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the luck that the Stars said Osgood has had with him all
series. It was the luck that finally went the Stars way in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got two lucky bounces tonight,'' Osgood said of
Langenbrunner's overtime goal and Guy Carbonneau's tying goal with
1 minute, 25 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   So he walked away once again shrugging his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood's last trip from Reunion Arena had ended similarly, a
funny bouncing goal in Game 2 providing a Stars margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   He had taken this same walk on that night, offered the same
explanation and had just as few answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never do anything the easy way I guess,'' Osgood said.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed last time when he said it. This time he didn't laugh.
The series just got a little tighter, he knows that. The pressure
on him just got a little more, he knows that too. There is also a
bit of history here.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood has a problem with letting goals that seemed destined for
anywhere but the back of the net end up just there.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix center Jeremy Roenick slipped a blue-line shot past him
in that playoff series. Blues defenseman Al MacInnis released a
shot at center ice that found a way past Osgood in that playoff
series.
</P>
<P>
   And now add Langenbrunner to that list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' Osgood said, a word-for-word repeat of his
post-Game 2 thoughts. ``It's not something that I wanted to happen.
I'm going to go home and be'' angry.
</P>
<P>
   He was angry because he had played well, even if his teammates
behind him hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed weak link heading into the playoffs had been
especially strong in the third period when the Stars were pressing
the attack, and the Wings seemed to be just waiting for the final
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris played well enough to keep us in there,'' Wings winger
Brent Gilchrist said. ``Too bad we couldn't hang on, and that's
what we were doing _ hanging on.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood was hanging on too, and then came the shot from center
ice. The bouncing, juggling puck that hit his stuck just a little
funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' Osgood said again, the words sounding all too
familiar.

Settled in as Astro, Alou candidate for team triple crown
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ Say this for Moises Alou: He knows how to make an
impression.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he needed to earn any brownie points with his new
Astros teammates. His reputation for clutch hitting preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   But it's pretty easy to earn acceptance on a new team when you
lead the club in hitting, home runs and RBIs. Alou may be the new
guy, but over the first two months of the season, this has been his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I wasn't as happy as I am now,'' said Alou,
whom the Astros acquired in a trade with the Florida Marlins during
the offseason. ``I wasn't used to being in Houston and playing with
these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot to get adjusted to playing with a new team. At
the same time, I never felt like a new guy, because I was proven. I
didn't have to show anyone what kind of player I was.''
</P>
<P>
   But just in case anyone had forgotten, Alou has been dropping
reminders in ballparks throughout the league with his red-hot start
at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Wednesday night's game against the Padres, Alou had hit
safely in 20 of his last 23 games with a whopping .432 (35-for-81)
batting average during that stretch. The streak has consisted of
more than just a hit here and there. Alou produced multiple hits in
12 of the 23 games and delivered three hits on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was driving in enough runs early in the
season, but I feel like I'm doing much better now,'' said Alou, who
is hitting .349 with 11 homers and 49 RBIs. ``I'm getting a lot of
two-out hits, which is something I feel like I'm supposed to do. It
also helps to be on a club like ours where there are so many
weapons in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lineup is as good as any in the league. I had some tough
stretches in Montreal because it's tough when the other team says,
`We're not going to let Alou beat us.' But here, our lineup is so
good, there are a lot of guys who they don't want to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou, the National League's Player of the Week for the period
ending this past Sunday, is a notorious fast starter. He's a career
.335 hitter in April with a .285 average for May. Alou exceeded his
expectations this May, when he hit .327.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only had one bad start in my career,'' he said. ``I've
had a lot of good Aprils and some good Mays, but this is the best
May I've ever had. I'm happy with that because I think it shows
that I'm improving and maturing as a ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know myself, and I know I can also get very cold at the
plate. But if it happens, I know I won't panic, because that's
something that's always been a part of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros third baseman Sean Berry played with Alou for four years
in Montreal, so seeing Alou on a tear is nothing new for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mo gets hot, he can carry you,'' Berry said. ``When he's
hot like this and seeing the ball, it doesn't matter where they're
pitching him; he's going to hit it. He's just so aggressive. He's
not up there looking for a walk. He's looking to do some damage.
I've seen him get it going like this a lot of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou doesn't like hitting cleanup; he prefers hitting fifth or
sixth. But he no doubt earned some points with manager Larry
Dierker when he asked to be inserted into the No. 4 spot in the
lineup _ the place no one has seemed to want over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't hit fourth a lot, but I felt like me hitting fourth
would make our lineup and our team better,'' Alou said. ``I would
prefer to hit lower in the order, but that might not be what's best
for the team. I thought we would be better with me hitting fourth,
so I asked (Dierker), and he decided to give it try. I think it's
worked out well.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for the trade that brought Alou to Houston.

HARDER STARS WORKED, THE LUCKIER THEY GOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The easy and obvious thing is to write off last night's
rub-your-eyes climax to the Stars' 3-2 overtime heart-stopper
against the Red Wings to pure luck.
</P>
<P>
   Who could argue, really?
</P>
<P>
   A deflection off a Detroit defenseman's stick ties the score at
2 with 85 seconds left in regulation, then 46 seconds into
overtime, a no-prayer, throw-it-in shot to set up a shift change
takes a crazy bounce and winds up in the Wings' net.
</P>
<P>
   Instant Stars mob scene at the Detroit blue line. Cue the
fireworks. Bedlam and euphoria reign at deliriously stunned Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But to give all the credit to a four-leaf clover or somebody's
lucky horseshoe wouldn't paint a picture of how hard the Stars
worked for this, how important it was, how desperate they'd become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted this season to end,'' sighed 38-year-old center
Guy Carbonneau, who had yanked the Stars' season from the precipice
with his improbable goal with the clock ticking down in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   And so this Western Conference finals series is headed back to
Detroit for a Game 6 that surprises almost no one and shocks
everybody, because the defending Stanley Cup champion Wings had
this one in the bag and let it get away.
</P>
<P>
   That could be an interesting development for a team whose
players were so cocky at their skate-around yesterday, they spent
most of the time chatting with Detroit reporters about their
``next'' series, all but forgetting that they still must beat the
Stars one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win Game 5 to bring it back,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said of the series that had all but slipped away, ``and I'll bet
five minutes after we we're back in the dressing room. our guys
were already focusing on the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't waste any energy, positive or negative, on this
emotional state. You can only think about playing the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotional was the only way to feel when Carbonneau, spinning,
checking, skating with a demonic energy no 38-year-old should
possess, found himself with the puck on his stick 15 feet from the
Wings' goal.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't waste any time, cutting loose with a low sizzler that
hit defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom's stick and came off the ice like a
rising line drive. It found space just under goalie Chris Osgood's
glove and the Stars, who had trailed 2-1 since early in the second
period, took a deep, satisfying breath for the first time in more
than 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to create a chance,'' Carbonneau said. ``You're
desperate in that situation. I was just trying to shoot it at the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck? Sure. The same kind that the Wings had on their first
goal, when Tomas Holdstrom _ or was it Stars defenseman Craig Muni?
_ got a piece of Larry Murphy's shot and tipped it past Eddie
Belfour just before the end of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   That erased a 1-0 Stars lead built when a charging Mike Keane
chipped in a rebound off Craig Ludwig's point-blank shot with 5:44
remaining in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early in the second period, Belfour, who was brilliant
otherwise, coughed up the softest of goals, flat missing Igor
Larionov's unobstructed, routine shot from 25 feet out. How soft
was it? Like a mother's good night kiss and it almost sent the
Stars off to dreamland for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played by best yet, and I'm looking forward to that
on Friday,'' Belfour said. ``I haven't been good and lucky at the
same time in this series. I'm due.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Stars emerged for the final period, Hitchcock
gathered his troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt after the second period that we're trying too hard to
hit a home run,'' he said. ``We just said, `Look, stay tight with
our game plan. If it takes the last shift of the game to tie it up,
so be it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It almost did.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was the same for overtime. Play tight defense, check
hard, wait for the right opportunity. Don't do anything rash.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't a home run swing Jamie Langenbrunner took when he
came charging across the center line and cut loose with a shot that
came bouncing in on Osgood. It just turned out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were definitely looking to (shift) change,'' Langenbrunner
conceded. ``We were going to keep (the shifts) short and hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this night, luck and the Stars' work ethic joined hands
at 777 Sports Street. Osgood reached out to corral the crazily
bouncing puck with his stick. It took another odd hop, caromed off
the heel of the stick, and nestled oh so sweetly into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those last two goals,'' Hitchcock said, wiping sweat off his
forehead. ``Those were the breaks we needed. We live to play
another day.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Maybe they did lucky.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it's about time. Now, they need to stay that way.

ANALYSIS: WILL LEWINSKY'S LAWYERS SEEK TO CHART NEW COURSE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 9th thru 12th grafs for insert containg remarks by Ginsburg
on Wednesday night) (See also LEWINSKY-LAWYERS) 
(sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky's new team of lawyers has inherited
a legal strategy built on two seemingly irreconcilable goals. The
aim was to head off an indictment of their client, without putting
her in a position of becoming the witness who threatened to topple
a president.
</P>
<P>
   The unappealing set of possible options _ to become either
history's next John Dean or its next Susan McDougal _ has been
guided almost exclusively by the protective instincts of Ms.
Lewinsky's parents. Divorced and not always of one voice, Ms.
Lewinsky's father and mother have struggled since the outset of the
inquiry nearly five months ago to spare their daughter from either
the pain of an indictment or the agony of a protracted impeachment
proceeding where she would become the president's accuser-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that tightrope that William Ginsburg, a close friend
of Ms. Lewinsky's father, walked for the last four months, wobbling
between the president and the prosecutor as he sought to steer
clear of either an impeachment effort or an indictment, and
ultimately falling off this week.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good criminal lawyers, the new legal team, Plato
Cacheris and Jacob Stein, are moving quickly to see if there may be
room for a deal that averts an indictment. The pair spent a good
part of Wednesday meeting with two other lawyers who have been
working on the case, familiarizing themselves with the history of
the inquiry in preparation for a possible new round of talks with
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sign that the two defense lawyers may be tacking to a
different wind when, moments after they were appointed on Tuesday,
their first decision was to pay a private courtesy call to the
independent counsel's office. Lawyers said they wanted to announce
their appointment to the prosecutors before they would learn about
it on the news.
</P>
<P>
   The two defense lawyers, according to participants at the
meeting, did not explicitly hold out the prospect of a new deal.
But it was clear that they understood from decades of experience
that by simply setting an initial tone of courtesy and
conciliation, they had begun to build a new reservoir of goodwill
that could be useful as the process moves along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape changed yesterday,'' said one lawyer in Starr's
office. ``This was an honorable thing to do. It didn't surprise any
of us at all because these are two experienced and
independent-minded lawyers who are looking after the best interests
of their client.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a statement that one of Starr's lawyers would ever
have made about Ginsburg, who alienated prosecutors days into the
inquiry when he kept them waiting by a telephone for hours,
neglecting to return a call as the investigation began to become
public. Prosecutors would later complain that Ginsburg, a
California specialist in civil malpractice cases, had little
understanding of how a criminal inquiry worked.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg, speaking to reporters on Wednesday night in Los
Angeles said he had told Ms. Lewinsky and her family 7 to 10 days
ago that he wanted to stop representing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My strategy his a wall,'' he said. ``It no longer was
working.''
</P>
<P>
   That was partly due, he said, to ``my strained relationship with
Ken Starr.'' He added: ``My aggressive, outgoing strategy had lost
its effectiveness. It was time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   In another contrast to Ginsburg, who seemed to revel in his ties
to the Lewinsky family, the two new lawyers are able to offer an
arms-length and dispassionate expertise that associates of Starr
say could lead to a serious new round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Any new thaw in the frosty relations between prosecutors and Ms.
Lewinsky's lawyers does not bode well for the White House, which as
a political matter had an ally in Ginsburg. Not only did he
regularly criticize Starr, but he also occasionally would make
statements undermining Ms. Lewinsky, statements that could prove
useful to the White House were she to ever testify against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides on Wednesday would not comment on the new
legal team or about any future agreement between Ms. Lewinsky and
the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains far from clear whether a deal with the
prosecutors can be reached as long as Ms. Lewinsky holds to a
strategy of not wanting to be seen as injuring the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's bind is in no small part of her own making. What
has made her lawyers' job so difficult is that prosecutors have
seen two faces of her.
</P>
<P>
   One, on the tapes recorded by her one-time confidante, Linda
Tripp, presents the picture of a young woman acknowledging she will
lie under oath to protect the president, urging Ms. Tripp to lie
and describing steps that may have been taken to conceal evidence
subpoenaed by the lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit, according to people who have heard the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The other, presented by Ginsburg in a series of proposals on the
testimony his client would be willing to offer prosecutors, shows
Ms. Lewinsky as acknowledging that she had sex with the president
but not being urged by anyone to lie about it, according to lawyers
familiar with the proffers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the proposals were rejected because prosecutors
apparently came to believe the Linda Tripp tapes. As a result, the
investigators have spent months attempting to corroborate every
important and mundane detail mentioned on them. The process will
enable them to exert enormous pressure on Ms. Lewinsky to
ultimately acknowledge what she said on the tapes in a criminal
settlement or, failing that, to use the corroborative evidence as
the backbone for an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Her new lawyers made clear on Wednesday that, while talks may
resume soon, they are prepared to fight an indictment if no
agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolute misimpression to think that we were only
brought in to cut a deal,'' one of them said. ``We know how to try
a case just as well as to settle one.''

UCLA FRESHMAN BENEFITS FROM SUNNY SKIES, REGULAR WORKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shakedia Jones couldn't wait to leave Illinois for
a warmer climate after high school.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA freshman sprinter, training for a full season for the
first time, has emerged as a contender for a national title in the
100 and 200 at the NCAA Championships in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Jones made her presence in stunning fashion at the USC-UCLA dual
meet last month, clocking 11.11 and 22.84 seconds in the 100 and
200 to produce the Nos. 2 and 3 all-time junior marks.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100, Jones crushed her high school best of 11.74. In the
200, Jones took off a whopping eight-tenths of a second off her
high school best of 23.62 to set a national dual-meet record. Jones
also ran a leg on the Bruins' 400-meter relay that timed 43.49 for
another national dual-meet and Pacific-10 Conference record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got to a university and practiced seriously with good
weather, I thought I would improve a little bit each year,'' Jones
said. ``I thought it would be a four-year thing. I didn't think my
times would improve drastically.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones won a record 15 Illinois State titles at Waukegan High,
located in a suburb of Chicago, and did not lose a race in four
years. She captured the 100 and 200 all four years as well as the
400 her junior season. Jones also won six indoor titles.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the 1996 and 1997 Junior Olympic 200 champion, came to
UCLA with respectable credentials, but her development this season
has taken her to another level. In the 100, Jones ranks third in
UCLA history behind Gail Devers, the 1992 and 1996 Olympic gold
medalist, and world-record holder Florence Griffith-Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I am amazed because she has been hitting those
times in practice,'' UCLA women's coach Jeannette Boldon said. ``I
am surprised she has run so fast so soon. I thought those were
times we would see next year.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jones, her arrival to Los Angeles couldn't come sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to stay close to home,'' said Jones, who picked
UCLA over Georgia and Florida. ``Warm weather was my main
criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois outdoor season ran only seven weeks from April to
the May. Jones, who typically got a late start on track while
playing on the basketball team, also was forced to practice indoors
for much of the track season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was so unpredictable,'' Jones said. ``In June, it
would be 30 degrees and snowing. We would be wearing our tights and
turtlenecks and everything we had on outside. Even though I didn't
expect so much rain here, the sun is the aspect I love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had serious practice five or six days a week,'' Jones
added. ``Once I got over that I was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Her breakthrough at the UCLA-USC meet, though, was unexpected by
Jones _ and USC's Torri Edwards, the 1996 Pac-10 champion in the
100 and 200. Jones knocked off Edwards in both sprints, pushing the
USC junior to a school-record 11.11 in the 100 and a personal-best
22.88 in the 200. Jones proved her victories were no fluke, turning
back Edwards to win the 100 in the Pac-10 championships at Stanford
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get out and stay strong because she comes on at
the end,'' Edwards said about Jones. ``She's a completely different
sprinter than she was at the beginning of the year. I can't believe
the improvement she has made.''

NOMO'S NEW CLUB: ANGELS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The list of teams speaking to the Los Angeles
Dodgers about deposed right-hander Hideo Nomo has been narrowed to
four, including the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers executive vice president Fred Claire would not name the
clubs, but according to sources, they are the Angels, Texas
Rangers, Seattle Mariners and Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Orioles rejected a trade that included closer
Armando Benitez for Nomo, who was designated for assignment on
Monday. The Dodgers have less than a week to trade him, then three
more days to see if he clears waivers. If no deal is made by June
10, Nomo will become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle remains in the picture even though the Mariners rejected
a deal Tuesday that would have brought left-hander Randy Johnson to
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels just placed right-hander Jack McDowell on the 15-day
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Claire said he would not have a problem dealing with the Angels
despite their close proximity to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is not who the other team is, but whether
a trade can help the team,'' Claire said.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Luke: Matt Luke, the first baseman/outfielder
who also was designated for assignment, could return to the Dodgers
organization if he is not claimed on waivers by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although a favorite of Claire, Luke was the odd man out when the
Dodgers acquired veteran left-handed hitting Jim Eisenreich. The
club elected to stay with struggling veteran Thomas Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had 10 days to trade Luke or pass him through
waivers. Because he never has been taken off a 40-man roster in his
career, Luke is not eligible for free agency. If he clears waivers,
he will be outrighted to Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Left fielder Todd Hollandsworth was scratched
Wednesday because of lingering soreness in his left shoulder.
Hollandsworth has struggled at the plate since ending a hitting
streak at nine games Saturday. Eisenreich replaced Hollandsworth
and singled in the fourth inning.... Catcher Charles Johnson has
agreed to wear a mini video camera on his mask during Saturday's
nationally televised game in Seattle.

<P>
   So far, series foundation is made of bricks
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ It was a game for the ages. Stone, I think.
</P>
<P>
   The opening match of the NBA Finals resembled basketball the way
a leggy supermodel resembles a porcupine.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't ballet or poetry. It was construction work with bad
grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Grunting, straining, heavy lifting and bricks. Tons of bricks.
Enough to build a skyscraper. Or a very tall monument to
ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   You know what they say in sports: Somebody has to lose.
Eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen shoots 7-for-19, Michael Jordan 13-for-29, Toni
Kukoc 4-for-12, and those are the three big guns in the Chicago
attack. It's a wonder they didn't take a couple of toes off with
that kind of errant aim.
</P>
<P>
   So it was the Bulls who ultimately went down 88-85 in overtime,
perhaps only because the clock ran out before the Jazz could put up
a few more misses.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone shoots 9-for-25, Jeff Hornacek 2-for-10, Greg Foster
1-for-5. And the Jazz is the team with a 1-0 lead in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure wasn't pretty,'' said Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is a pig in lipstick. But after waiting nearly 1{ weeks
for the Finals to finally begin and having so much extra time to
think about the tremendous opportunity before them, this Utah bunch
was willing to cuddle up to just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   You had the Jazz shooting 44 percent as a team. You had the
Bulls shooting 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the problem? Did the Bulls have too little rest
after going the distance in their seven-game war with Indiana in
the Eastern Conference finals? Or did the Jazz have too much rest
after sweeping the Lakers in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a little of both,'' said Jazz guard John Stockton. ``I
know they had to be very tired after what they went through, and
I'll tell you, sitting around for 10 days and trying to keep
yourself sharp physically and mentally is almost impossible. You
have to do whatever you can.''
</P>
<P>
   In Stockton's case, as usual, he did everything he could and
rescued the Jazz when the night was on the verge of slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Stockton who has been bothered by a bad back
since way back in the first round of the playoffs against the
Rockets and has spent almost as much time on the bench as on the
floor through the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was when the Jazz needed him, when Malone was
struggling, when his team was teetering. He scored 24 points, dealt
eight assists and was the bullet in the Jazz gun that finally shot
down the Bulls in the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   After a Hornacek steal from Pippen, Stockton barreled the length
of the floor and converted a layup and a three-point play that
briefly gave Utah breathing room at 84-79.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls came back. The Bulls always come back. And as the
clock ticked down inside 10 seconds, it was Stockton again with the
ball and the game in his hands as he skittered down the lane. He
took off just inside the foul line and lofted an arching
nine-footer over the outstretched arm of Steve Kerr. It hit nothing
but the bottom of the net and the middle of the Bulls' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   There was a desperate trey by Kukoc that got it back to 86-85.
There were two more free throws by Stockton. There was a heave at
the buzzer by Pippen that didn't hit the rim.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that had drama. Just not much in the way of
artistry.
</P>
<P>
   How many times in the Finals do you see see Jordan get caught
holding the ball for a 24-second violation in the last minute of
overtime? How often do you see Jordan miss a driving shot on the
inside when the outcome is in doubt? His Airness scored 33 points
but looked earthbound.
</P>
<P>
   There were errors from Malone, the Mailman, who returned to the
big stage of the Finals and once again did his impersonation of
Cliff Clavin from Cheers or Newman from Seinfeld or some other
belovedly inept postal employee.
</P>
<P>
   Malone missed from the outside and from the inside. He missed
early, and he missed late. He missed 14 of the first 18 shots he
took in the game before finally roaring down the lane in the fourth
quarter for a pair of slam dunks and then dropping in a fadeaway
from 15 feet and a straight-up jumper from 19 in the last 1:42.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have good rhythm the whole night,'' Malone said.
``But they kept running my plays, and you have to remember that the
game lasts 48 minutes. In the playoffs, I'd like to win and hit all
my shots. But I don't care about the shooting percentage as long as
they go to me and I can hit the big ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Give the kid at the carnival enough tries, and he'll eventually
hit something.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz knows this. The team that wins Game 1 of the Finals has
won the title 80 percent of the time. Utah also knows something
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play better in the next game,'' said Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   It would sure be hard to play worse.

ASU ADVANCES TO FINAL  
 MURPHY'S AMBITION FINALLY PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ It was a defining moment for a coach who has spent
the past four years stuck between a Brock and a hard place _ his
own fierce ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after his team beat Long Beach State, 14-4, Wednesday,
Arizona State Coach Pat Murphy paused and sighed, inhaling the
moment that had just befallen him.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are advancing to the College World Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through so much to get to this point,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy longed for this. He wants success for the players he
believes have given so much. And he has struggled living in the
shadow of the late Jim Brock, who brought the Sun Devils so much,
including two national championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not done,'' said pitcher Richy Leon, who allowed three
runs and eight hits in six innings. ``We know we still have a task
at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Sun Devils' post-game enthusiasm was tempered. The
players shook hands, but there was minimal celebrating. Maybe they
just wanted to get out of the 39-degree (wind chill) conditions.
</P>
<P>
   This is ASU's first trip to the championship since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils will meet either Louisiana State or Southern
California for the title. The Tigers would advance by beating the
Trojans today. USC must beat LSU on back-to-back days.
</P>
<P>
   A Sun Devils-Trojans confrontation would pair college baseball's
two greatest powers. Only USC has appeared in more finals (13) and
won more titles (11) than ASU (nine finals, five titles).
</P>
<P>
   ``A cold night in Omaha turned out to be an even colder and
drearier night for Long Beach State,'' 49ers Coach Dave Snow said.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive thing about ASU is the ease at which it has
advanced through this tournament, outscoring opponents, 34-16.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, it's surprising this team arrived in Omaha in maroon
and gold instead of black and blue.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils grueling schedule resulted in several beatings.
Six straight losses in mid-March. Midweek road games against powers
such as Oklahoma. Three straight losses at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   There were questions. Could this team survive without the the
power hitters of other big-name programs? Would the pitching hold
up? Was Murphy's tough schedule the way to go?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes and yes.
</P>
<P>
   Their postseason has been defined by unlikely heros _ Greg
Halvorson, Dustin Delucchi _ gutsy efforts _ Mikel Moreno, Rudy
Arguelles _ and an ace, Ryan Mills, who has not let thoughts of a
professional career get in the way of dominating performances.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been defined by a coach who is enjoying the fruits
of his labor. A coach who often operates on instinct, even when it
is not necessarily a popular decision. A coach whose tough
scheduling looked like a bad idea at times, but in the end proved
to be the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought I was blowing smoke, but I knew that
type of schedule would help us,'' Murphy said. ``I knew it was
going to make us better.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon, often the forgotten pitcher in ASU's rotation, did exactly
what Murphy wanted Wednesday, and once again, Leon did it his way:
not with blazing 95 mph fastballs, but with off-speed pitches and
wise decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, the ESPN guys were giggling and saying, `Look
at this guy's numbers,' but you never judge Richy by his numbers,''
Murphy said. ``You just look at what he's done in the big games,
what he did in the regionals, what he did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon gave up his first hit in the third and his first run in the
fourth, a home run by catcher Bryan Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ASU jumped out to an early lead and not surprisingly, it was
Moreno, a walking spark plug, who got things going with a home run.
</P>
<P>
   It was all ASU from there. The Sun Devils scored four runs in
the second, two in the third and had a 7-0 lead after three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State freshman Jeff Leuenberger lasted just 2 innings
after allowing seven runs (five earned) and seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Kramer picked up the save after allowing just one run and
three hits in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils got home runs from Moreno, Willie Bloomquist and
Andrew Beinbrink.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomquist demonstrated why he belongs at the top of the order.
He was 5 for 6 with four RBIs and three runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't feel like I was swinging that bat that well,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delucchi and shortstop Michael Collins had three-hit games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the class of the bracket,'' said Snow, whose team was
eliminated from the tournament. &QL;

Malone able to avoid a painful replay
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ The whole scene must have looked eerily familiar
to Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Chicago Bulls, the defending world champions.
</P>
<P>
   Malone and the Jazz in the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   And Malone couldn't find his game.
</P>
<P>
   Try as he might, Malone couldn't hit a basket, as jumper after
jumper clanged off the rim. The ``Mailman'' wasn't delivering when
the Jazz needed him.
</P>
<P>
   But when it counted most, Malone finally located his touch,
dropping in a pair of jumpers in the final minutes of regulation,
then opening the overtime period with a layup to help spark the
Jazz to an 88-85 victory Wednesday night at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Malone must have been sweating, though.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was just last year that he stood at the free-throw
line with a chance to put the Jazz ahead late in Game 1 of the
Finals. Malone, just named the league's Most Valuable Player,
clanked both _ and then watched Michael Jordan nail a last-second
jumper for a two-point victory.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Malone, who missed 16 of his 25 shots, was able to
come through.
</P>
<P>
   Malone scored 10 of his 21 points and grabbed six of his
game-high 14 rebounds in the fourth quarter and overtime. He knew
it was just a matter of time before his shots started dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to do was stay within the offense,'' Malone said.
``That's something we've been doing all year long. I've had a lot
of games where I didn't start out shooting the basketball well,
throughout the playoffs. But Jeff Hornacek kept telling me that
it's a 48-minute game _ he didn't mention the overtime _ and that I
should keep shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that the whole night that I took maybe three tough
shots. All the rest were within the offense. And if they're there
on Friday, I'll take those shots. It's just part of it. I didn't
shoot the basketball like I wanted to, but other guys came through
and we were able to get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, and in one of those alternate-reality types of
situations, it was Jordan who made a crucial mistake in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two minutes to play and the Bulls trailing by two
points, Jordan was caught with the ball in his hands and the
24-second shot clock winding down. Unsure what to do, Jordan hung
on to the ball too long. Turnover, Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, however, was making his move.
</P>
<P>
   After draining a 15-foot jumper with 1:42 left, Malone came back
with a 19-footer with 57 seconds remaining to give the Jazz a
four-point lead. The Bulls forced overtime, but Malone got the Jazz
started with a power layup and Utah never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Just what John Stockton, who fed Malone on all three baskets,
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around that guy a long time, and even when he has
rough starts, he comes through,'' Stockton said. ``In fact, he hit
two huge shots for us down the stretch in regulation when we seemed
to be just kind of going through the motions and kind of lost out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a couple of big shots _ that's the type of player he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone shrugged off the late heroics, feeling he did nothing
different than when he was missing the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (the late baskets) were in the offense,'' Malone said.
``My main thing throughout these playoffs has been to try and stay
within the offense. Down the stretch, we ran the same plays. I had
those shots early on but wasn't hitting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But down the stretch, we ran those plays, and they're really
not designed for me to pass it. I was wide-open, and I was able to
get some good looks at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I would have felt bad if we would have lost the ballgame
and I didn't shoot the ball really well. But down the stretch, you
can't be afraid to take the next shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the Jazz rolled up 62 wins during the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll still go to Karl Malone,'' said coach Jerry Sloan. ``I
kept thinking he had a couple of low shots there, as we got a
little bit of a lead at the end of the ballgame. He missed a
couple, (and) they (the Bulls) got back into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of it _ you have to keep working to do it. We've
gone to him so many times, and we'll do it again.''

DEVILS' BELIEF IN SELVES BECOMES INFECTIOUS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ With his team in the College World Series, Pat
Murphy has a lot on his mind. During the last practice, the Arizona
State coach sat in the dugout, staring off into the distance, deep
in thought. He looked as if he were searching for an answer, which
in fact, he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Gilligan's first name?'' Murphy asked.
</P>
<P>
   A trivia buff, Murphy couldn't remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collins will know,'' the coach said, brightening. To prove it,
he put the question to his shortstop. ``Hey, Collins, what was
Gilligan's name. On ``Gilligan's Islan''d?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie,'' Mike Collins replied.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was correct, of course, which should come as no
surprise. Whether the game is TV trivia or baseball, the Sun Devils
seem to have all the answers.
</P>
<P>
   In Omaha, this team that back in March was only four games above
.500 has been unstumpable, and unstoppable. Florida State couldn't
beat the Sun Devils. No. 1-ranked Miami couldn't either. Long Beach
State never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   On a breezy, October-like night, with the wind chill in the 30s,
the Long Beach coach stood on the dugout steps and watched his team
quickly fall behind 5-0 . . .7-0 . . .8-0 . . . With his gray
moustache and receding chin, Dave Snow resembles the cowboy actor
Slim Pickens, who uttered the immortal line in ``Blazing Saddles,''
``What in the wide, wide world of sports is goin' on here?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's going on. ASU is playing its best baseball of the
season. Solid pitching. Good fielding. Great hitting. The Sun
Devils think they're the '27 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   When you're playing well, baseball is a simple game. See the
ball. Hit the ball. That's what they did again Wednesday night,
slapping out 18 hits, including three homers, to bury Long Beach,
14-4, and advance to the national championship game for the first
time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Can they win it all?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, why not?
</P>
<P>
   Half of winning is believing you can win, and right now these
kids, who have won six in a row, believe that center-field sign in
Rosenblatt Stadium is meant for them. ``College World Series,'' the
message reads. ``Where Dreams Come True.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting is as contagious as the measles. And the entire ASU team
is infected. In three games, the Sun Devils have scored 34 runs.
With each run, each win, their confidence has grown.
</P>
<P>
   Can they do it?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a group of winners,'' Murphy said, ``you've
got a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Go down the lineup. You can take your pick of winners. Leadoff
man Willie Bloomquist collected five hits, including a home run.
The All-America second baseman scored ASU's 12th run when he raced
home after a wild pitch _ Long Beach had six, a Series record and
slid headfirst across the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Mikel Moreno led off the scoring with a solo home run, Andrew
Beinbrink knocked one out. Left fielder Dustin Delucchi collected
three hits. So did Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Richy Leon gave the Sun Devils six strong innings as
a starter. This year the senior has played second base and
shortstop and stepped in as the designated hitter. Leon is ASU's
utility man, which means he does everything except repair phone
lines. In games Leon has started, the Sun Devils are 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   Although destiny is a cliche in sports, you have to wonder if
maybe this is meant to be ASU's year. The Sun Devils' three
opponents committed 10 errors. One of them led to Long Beach's
undoing when the 49ers shortstop dropped a routine pop-up in the
second inning and two ASU runs scored. The Sun Devils sent nine
batters to the plate in that inning.
</P>
<P>
   Now ASU faces its toughest test. It must wait. The Sun Devils
don't pay until Saturday. They will face either Southern California
or Louisiana State, the two-time defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   Can ASU win it?
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``We said all along we didn't come here just to show up,''
Murphy said. ``I said it so many times I believe it now.''
</P>
<P>
   So do his players.
</P>
<P>
   What a story. What a year. &QL;

Malone, Stockton 
leave Bulls in rare 
spot after opener
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The Utah Jazz's dynamic duo of Karl Malone and
John Stockton has put the Chicago Bulls in a predicament they
haven't seen since 1991 _ down 1-0 in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Malone shook off a subpar showing for most of the game to make
numerous key plays late, then Stockton converted a crucial
three-point play and the clinching, running, 10-foot jumper with
9.3 seconds left as the Jazz took a hard-fought 88-85 overtime
victory over the Bulls in Game 1 at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Los Angeles Lakers won Game 1 in '91, then got
swept in the next four, have the Bulls fallen behind in their five
marches to NBA titles during the past seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If their dynasty is to continue, it will do so in
come-from-behind fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have asked for a better game or a better
opportunity to win one on their home floor,'' Chicago coach Phil
Jackson said. ``We sort of feel like we let one slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent the Bulls felt they had wasted a silver-bullet
effort out of their arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when the exhausting, thrilling opener was done, the
Jazz thought it had taken a major step toward proving the Bulls'
dynasty is, indeed, crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   If Utah had any doubts it can get this job done, the Jazz erased
them Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Or did it? Judging from Utah's analysis of the performance,
maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an awfully good win for us,'' said Jazz coach Jerry
Sloan. ``I didn't know if we were going to be able to hold them off
because we had a terrible time trying to score in a stretch or two.
And we had a terrible time trying to guard them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fortunate. I don't have anything to jump up and down
about after that. I think we had to have a little bit of luck to
win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Stockton: ``We're going to have to execute a lot better to
beat this team on Friday (in Game 2).''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but a whole lot of execution in crucial moments should
have given some positive vibrations to the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the way the Jazz survived the lid-lifter was
reminiscent of another battle-toughened team's mode of operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch the Bulls, they've won a lot of games through the
years just like this,'' Malone said. ``When the playoffs come, you
just want to win. You don't care how or if it's by one point or a
whole bunch of points.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had precious little room for error in Game 1,
particularly in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz scored the first five points of the extra period, then
fell back on two clutch defensive stands to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   Up 84-82 with under two minutes to go in the overtime, Utah
forced a shot-clock violation with 1:18 to go when Michael Jordan,
who had 33 points, let the 24-second clock expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mental lapse,'' Jordan said. ``I never really noticed
the clock. Nobody really noticed the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson said: ``We had no one in front of Michael to tell him
the clock was running down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a human error, the kind nobody expects from Jordan. It
was one of 15 Chicago turnovers, which led to 21 Utah points, many
of them of the fast-break variety. Utah had 21 fast-break points to
six for the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chicago shot-clock snafu, Stockton turned the ball
over because of Steve Kerr's deflection, then Chris Morris tipped
the ball away from Luc Longley on Chicago's end and Bryon Russell
recovered in time to call a timeout with 28.4 seconds left. That
set up Stockton's heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Though Toni Kukoc hit a 3-pointer with 5.4 seconds left,
Stockton nailed two free throws with 3.5 showing and Pippen's
3-pointer at the buzzer was long.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scintillating end to a great Finals game.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks started when it was tied at 75. Malone had missed
16 of 22 shots to that point. But he first nailed a 16-footer over
Longley, then, after a Jordan miss, stepped out to 20 feet and
swished a jumper for a 79-75 Jazz lead with 55.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't over. After Pippen made two free throws, Malone
passed out of the double-team to Bryon Russell, who missed a
3-pointer with 36 seconds showing.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had plenty of time to set up a tying play. Two in
fact. First Jordan missed, but Pippen rebounded with 23.6 seconds
left and called timeout before falling out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan found Longley on the left side of the paint and the big
Australian's 8-foot push shot banged off the glass and through the
net, tying the score with 14.3 ticks to go.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had a foul to give and took it with 7.3 left and
Stockton's desperation 20-footer hit off the back iron as the
buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime took on a Jazz tint quickly as Malone scored on a
layup. Then Jeff Hornacek tipped the ball away from Pippen and
Stockton converted a three-point play with 3:23 to go for an 84-79
Utah lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the Jazz's defense that saved it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Malone must have been having a flashback. Midway
through the fourth quarter, Malone was looking at a 4-for-17
shooting ledger, bringing back the horrid memories of the Finals
from last June, when he was a disappointment, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   They say postal workers have trouble with canines. This Mailman
obviously was allergic to these so-called underdogs, which the
Bulls fashioned themselves as when the series began.
</P>
<P>
   But the doldrums didn't last all night.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz endured a miserable stretch when it went 5:20 without
scoring in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   During that entire drought, Utah lost exactly four points off
its lead, which stood at 69-65 for what seemed like an eternity as
both defenses dug in.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Malone snapped to life. After a Steve Kerr miss, the Jazz
got a fast break that ended as Jazz breaks often do _ with Stockton
feeding Malone for a slam.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, after Jordan made just one of two free throws,
Malone drove an alarmingly wide-open lane for a dunk with 4:41 left
for a 73-66 Utah lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had one push left. After an exchange of points, Jordan
hit consecutive midrange jumpers and, after Malone missed, Pippen
rebounded and then fired in a 3-pointer with 2:36 left to tie the
score at 75.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had put themselves in precisely the kind of
opportunistic situation they'd hoped for going into Game 1. Now the
question was whether they could finish it.
</P>
<P>
   They came up just short.

DH STANDS AT CROSSROADS  
 25-YEAR-OLD RULE TO SPREAD TO NL OR VANISH, SOME SAY 
</HEADLINE>
 HITTER-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   The purists have been shaking their heads in disgust for more
than 25 years. The designated hitter, they say, simply is not
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they love to point out, the very first item in the
official baseball rule book states, ``Baseball is a game between
two teams of nine players each . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Add a DH and you're looking at 10 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I like the National League style, where you earn
what you get,'' San Diego outfielder Tony Gwynn said. ``If you ask
me now, I like the game without the DH. But I might be nearing a
stage of my career where I could have a DH job waiting for me soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, though, I hate it. I think it's a better brand of
baseball without the DH.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks will be in Oakland this weekend, getting their
first taste of the DH, introduced into the American League in 1973.
It immediately became one of the most significant and controversial
changes the game has seen.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Yankees' Ron Blomberg first hit in place of the
pitcher, the debate has raged between those who love it and those
who loathe it.
</P>
<P>
   As baseball nears the next century, it's becoming increasingly
evident that something is going to happen to either eliminate the
designated hitter from the AL or adopt it in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming belief is that the DH may die in the next few
years. Of course, strong opposition will come from the players
union, which must give its approval though collective bargaining
for a change that drastic.
</P>
<P>
   The union's argument against killing the DH is that a dozen or
so high-salaried players will be eliminated from the game. Players
such as Edgar Martinez, Paul Molitor and Harold Baines, none of
whom possesses great defensive skills, could be forced into
retirement or significantly reduced roles.
</P>
<P>
   One possible remedy that has been mentioned is allowing rosters
to expand from 25 to 26, a move that could appease the union and
bring about the elimination of the DH.
</P>
<P>
   The other side, as Gwynn pointed out, is that baseball is a game
in which a player should be required to earn what he gets, and
playing the field in order to get your at-bats was required of the
game for the first century.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what they do, I wish the game had the same rules in
both leagues,'' Gwynn said. ``The fact that one league has one set
and the other another is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Many baseball fans prefer watching a Molitor or Baines continue
playing late into his 30s or early 40s. And it's doubtful a Dave
Winfield or Carl Yastrzemski would have reached 3,000 hits without
the benefit of the DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at where most DHs bat, and it's in the (No.) 3, 4 or
5 spots in the order,'' said Colorado Manager Don Baylor, a former
MVP and one of the finest designated hitters toward the end of his
playing career. ``You're talking about some great hitters who have
added a lot to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Some will argue that if a player can hit, a manager will find a
spot for him in the field, no matter how poor his defensive skills.
</P>
<P>
   Like most everyday players who are asked to make the adjustment
to the DH, Baylor fought the move in the beginning when he was with
the California Angels.
</P>
<P>
   He said he resisted ``until (Coach) Dave Garcia pulled me aside
and asked me to put myself in the manager's spot. We had Joe Rudi
and myself as left fielders. Garcia asked me who I'd rather have in
left if I was the manager. From that point on, I never fought it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another argument made by the purists says there is less managing
in the AL, where taking a pitcher out of a game requires no
juggling of the lineup in order to make double-switches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree,'' said former Texas and Boston Manager Kevin
Kennedy, who was reared in the NL style in the Dodgers system.
``Sometimes it's harder to decide when to make a pitching move in
the AL. In the NL, if you're down three runs in the fifth and the
pitcher is due up, the decision is almost made for you. You
pinch-hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The DH was instituted on an experimental basis at a time when
the AL was lagging behind the more powerful NL in the early 1970s
in attendance and glamour.
</P>
<P>
   American League owners voted 8-4 to approve the DH while the NL
vetoed the idea, which was first attempted in the Triple-A American
Association in 1969. Then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn pushed strongly
for the DH, believing sagging offenses could use the boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the designated hitter has killed the game or the
sport,'' said Geronimo Berroa, who in the past three years has
emerged as one of the top DHs. ``For players like me and Molitor
and Baines, it's been great and I think fans haven't minded seeing
the extra offense. Whether it stays, who knows?'' &QL;

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Team sports involve trust and combinations:
Johnny Unitas to Raymond Berry. Joe Montana to Jerry Rice. Tinker
to Evers to Chance.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, it was Utah's John Stockton and Karl Malone
versus Chicago's Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when Malone found himself mired in a wretched
9-for-25 shooting slump, Stockton implored the Mailman to ``shoot,
shoot, shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight possessions without either team scoring, and Utah
leading by 69-65, Stockton finally waved his hand and effectively
said, let's get back to basics: pick and roll. Stockton found
Malone, and the Mailman dunked it down. Three possessions later
Stockton and Malone collaborated on back-to-back plays.
</P>
<P>
   On one, Malone hit a 15-foot jumper, and the next time he took a
pass from Stockton and knocked down a 19-foot jumper to give Utah a
79-75 lead with 56.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   On Chicago's three previous possessions, Jordan had hit a
17-foot jumper and a 20-foot jumper and then Pippen had tied the
score with a 24-foot 3-pointer. And so it went, back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Tinker. Evers. Chance.
</P>
<P>
   In the moment of truth, with the game on the line, Chicago
trailing by 2 points, Jordan once again took the ball and took the
drive and drew the double team. But this time instead of hitting
Pippen, he found a wide-open Luc Longley, who hit a short shot to
send the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime belonged to Stockton. He had the first basket, then
made a steal, scored, drew a foul by Jordan and completed a 3-point
play. This effectively catapulted Utah to a victory in what may
well be the most important game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's victory in Game 1 may have eased, at least temporarily,
the insecurities of a city that is desperately pulling for its team
to win its first championship. The yearnings were evident earlier
in the day, on a gorgeous afternoon in a city known for its
laid-back veneer.
</P>
<P>
   Fans converged on the downtown Gallivan Center, where a variety
of booths had been set up for their participation.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 o'clock the audience had grown to 150. This was the moment
of truth: they had come to watch five fans vie for the right to win
two pairs of tickets to Game 1 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a promotion by KFAN radio, fans were asked what they
would do, how far they would go, how desperate they were to win
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Postma took out a jar containing 15 goldfish that he
planned to devour. ``I just figured that 15 is the number of
playoff games we have to win to win the championships,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he went up to do his thing, Postma said, ``I'll eat
the first 11, then the last four I'm going to chew up, like the
Jazz are going to chew up Chicago tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   As he gulped, fans chanted, ``Blair, Blair, Blair,'' then
``U-tah, U-tah.''
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly a marriage in Salt Lake City, a confluence of
purpose surrounding basketball: fans are as desperate to win
championship tickets as the players, especially Malone and
Stockton, are to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   The sense in Salt Lake City, if you go by what you hear and
read, is one of supreme confidence that 1998, finally, is Utah's
year:
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we've got them where we want them,'' Postma
said of the Bulls before swallowing the goldfish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final contestant of the day was a man known only as Dale; no
one expected him to top Postma. Until he announced was going to eat
a Dennis Rodman sandwich, and produced two slices of white bread
with worms in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   There were shrieks from those at the front, howls of disgust
from those in the back. But everyone applauded wildly for Dale,
even as they averted their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So Postma and Dale were hands-down winners. They sat next to
each other last night, rooting with 19,000 others as Utah stopped
the Bulls, &QC; 88-85, perhaps the beginning of the end of Chicago's
dynasty.

D-BACKS SUFFER NIGHTMARE OF FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
Rockies 3, Diamondbacks 2 
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Diamondbacks left fielder David Dellucci said he
probably will dream about it, but there will be no way to change
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Back, back, back . . . he reached up for the ball hit by
Colorado's Vinny Castilla, felt something make contact with his
glove . . .
</P>
<P>
   He looked in it and nothing was there. The ball had hit the
yellow line on top of the fence and bounced over for a two-run home
run, giving the Rockies a come-from-behind 3-2 victory with nobody
out in the bottom of the ninth Wednesday night at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The home run on a 1-1 curveball from right-handed closer Gregg
Olson was Castilla's sixth in six games against the Diamondbacks
this season and his 22nd overall, and helped the Rockies (25-34)
avoid the embarrassment of a third straight loss at home to the
expansion Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The shot came with Larry Walker at third base as the result of a
leadoff double and a stolen base. In the top of the ninth, Walker
had saved what could have been a big insurance run for Arizona when
he threw Dellucci out at the plate after catching a fly ball to
right field by Karim Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks (19-40) still can win the four-game series with
a victory today at 5:05 p.m. They move on to the Bay area on Friday
to begin a three-game interleague series with the Oakland
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Willie Blair started for the Diamondbacks and
pitched his best game of the season. He gave up only a
second-inning run on six hits through eight innings before Olson
(1-3) took over in the ninth in an attempt to earn his eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough one,'' Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter
said. ``Willie pitched as well as you can pitch, especially here.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair had thrown 93 pitches and probably could have at least
started the ninth, but Showalter decided to go with Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been the first time Willie had gone into the
ninth,'' Showalter said. ``Oly has been pitching as well as anybody
other than maybe Russ Springer out of the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair dueled Rockies right-hander Pedro Astacio throughout the
game, which started when the temperature was 49, 35 degrees colder
than Tuesday night's temperature at game time.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had a 2-1 lead as the result of Travis Lee's two-out, solo
homer in the sixth inning, his 10th of the year. Astacio, who beat
the Diamondbacks on April 2 at Bank One Ballpark, scattered six
hits and struck out nine in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing, but that stuff happens,'' Blair said. ``I
knew that I pitched well and gave us a chance to win the ballgame.
I was able to throw all of my pitches for strikes most of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was surprised to be lifted after eight innings,
Blair said, ``Yes and no. Oly's been throwing so well lately, that
it would seem to be the logical thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the top of the ninth against left-hander Chuck
McElroy, Dellucci doubled to right-center, his fourth in two games.
He advanced to third on a single to left by Jay Bell but was held
because the ball was hit too shallow.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia then lofted a medium-deep fly to Walker in and third base
coach Brian Butterfield sent Dellucci. Walker's throw was there in
plenty of time, and catcher Jeff Reed made a sweeping tag on
Dellucci, who slid headfirst, for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That throw turned the momentum back in their direction,''
Showalter said. ``Larry's arguably the best right fielder in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   As if Walker's heart wasn't charged up enough, he led off the
ninth with a drive to left-center between Dellucci and Devon White
and outraced Dellucci's throw to second. Olson and the Diamondbacks
didn't even pay attention when Walker took off for third and made
it easily.
</P>
<P>
   Then Castilla connected on the 1-1 curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing deep, but I didn't think it was going to go
out,'' Dellucci said. ``I didn't think it was even going to reach
the fence. But it kept floating and floating . . . the next thing
you know . . . I put my glove up and I hit something, but I don't
know if it was the ball or what. I'll probably dream about it.''
</P>
<P>
   TV replays showed a fan reaching for the ball with a glove, but
it didn't appear that the fan had an impact on the play because the
ball had already bounced on top of the fence. &QL;

CUBAN DEFECTORS ARE STRUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez made his major league debut for
the New York Yankees on Wednesday night. He's the latest Cuban
defector to make the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been that most of the Cubans to arrive in the
big leagues recently have been major disappointments. Hernandez's
half-brother, Livan Hernandez, was the National League Championship
Series and World Series MVP last year but has done little this
season to distinguish himself.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for leading American League Rookie of the Year
candidate Rolando Arrojo in Tampa Bay and New York Mets shortstop
Rey Ordonez, the recent Cubans to make it the majors could almost
all be branded busts.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Osvaldo Fernandez, Oakland's Ariel Prieto and
Rene Arocha haven't come close to living up to the advance billing
each received.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the new Cubans had too much to live up to. The Cuban big
leaguers of the 1950s and '60s set a high standard for the island
nation of 11 million. Minnie Minoso, Luis Tiant, Tony Perez and
Camilo Pascual were All-Star-caliber players whose talents bordered
on the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-Americans of the 1980s, the first generation of Cubans
either born or raised in the United States, continued the standard
set by the previous group.
</P>
<P>
   A list that includes Rafael Palmeiro, Jose Canseco, Alex
Fernandez, Fernando Vina and Jorge Fabregas did little to diminish
the belief that Cubans were great players.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Orlando Hernandez will take his shot at entering the elite
group of Cuban players. Recent history is not on his side, but that
shouldn't matter to the pitcher considered the greatest from Cuba
since Tiant. &QL; 
 &QL; 
They're serious &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs are no longer just hoping to be in a divisional
race this summer. The Cubs are actually making the kind of moves
that show they're dead serious about making a run at their first
playoff appearance in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   By sending third baseman Kevin Orie to Triple-A Iowa last week
and warning catcher Scott Servais to start hitting or else, Cubs
President Andy McPhail sent word that being lovable losers is not
acceptable in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping Orie, considered the best third baseman in franchise
history since Ron Santo, definitely sent a shock through the
clubhouse. Of course, with a .181 batting average, Orie couldn't
make much of an argument to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all accountable, myself, the coaches and the players,''
Manager Jim Riggleman said. ``The bottom of the lineup has got to
pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Servais, who was batting .227 with 11 RBIs in 132
at-bats entering Wednesday, has been told to pick it up or face
losing regular playing time to back up Sandy Martinez, who is
batting .298 with six RBIs in 47 at-bats. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Oh, Brother &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's four-time Cy Young Award winning pitcher Greg Maddux
showed exactly why he is considered a fierce competitor during a
game against Montreal last week.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves clinging to a 1-0 lead, Expos reliever Mike
Maddux (Greg's older brother) came in to face Eddie Perez to start
the eighth. Perez fell behind 1-2 in the count before slamming a
homer over the left-field fence, helping the Braves to a 2-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for the pitch,'' Perez said. ``Greg told me
about his brother. He said, `Get ready for the sinker.' And he
threw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux said, ``He's my brother. I love him. I want him to
do well. But I'm trying to win, you know? I was glad Eddie hit a
home run, sad my brother gave it up. (It) turned out to be a big
run.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rarified air, kind of &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Jim Thome is attempting to enter a select group that
includes only Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Wednesday, Thome's 36 walks and 59 strikeouts were good
enough to rank second in the American League in each category,
trailing the leader by three and one, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a player led the league in those two categories in
the same season was 1958 when Mantle tied with the Washington
Senators' Jim Lemon in strikeouts and led in walks. Before Mantle,
only Ruth had accomplished the feat, leading the league in both
categories in 1923, '24, '27 and '28.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing aspect of this? Thome was batting .322 entering
Wednesday's game. No player has ever hit above .320 and led the
league in strikeouts. &QL;

IN A SLUMP? DON'T BE TOO QUICK TO PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF CADE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Run silent, run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, and it's almost always impossible to predict or
explain, somehow your fine collection of players seems to come to a
dead stop. No one hits, runs or scores, and all the pitchers are
getting creamed. The team sinks faster than the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, is this just a two-week malaise or are you in a
free fall that will wreck your entire year? Will your team correct
itself or do you need to intervene and make a few deals?
</P>
<P>
   One thing to keep in mind is that there are still 100 games to
play.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox Manager Jerry Manual sort of summed it up recently.
``When do we say, `This is enough at-bats, this is enough starts?'
But we're still in the month of May and we still have to keep
things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   No sense unloading a player who is going badly and then watch
him rebound for another team. Some players you just have to ride
out.
</P>
<P>
   That takes in all the trade rumors, too. If you have Randy
Johnson, Hideo Nomo, Rafael Palmeiro, John Olerud, Roberto Alomar
or Carlos Baerga, you just have to bear it.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, baseball insiders usually are wrong more often than
they are right. They are on TV every night and they have to come up
with juicy tidbits, even if they aren't quite on the button. In
short, most trade rumors don't come to fruition, simply because,
for one thing, most teams are not the Marlins. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Speaking of rumors &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays are shopping a pitcher for the Cardinals' Delino
DeShields. The Jays are talking to the right team. The Cardinals
have three starters disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs denied a three-way deal that had them getting Todd
Hundley, the Mets getting Carlos Perez and the Expos getting Brant
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Hamilton of the Padres is targeted by Seattle and St. Louis
for Randy Johnson and Royce Clayton, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Hideo Nomo situation is baffling. He is coming off
surgery. You'd think both sides could cool it, give him the summer
to regain arm strength and then go from there. The Dodgers, taking
a hard line, first with Mike Piazza and now with Nomo, gave up any
trade leverage. Chances are, Nomo will go through waivers, he'll be
assigned to Triple-A, refuse to go and then become a free agent.
What would be something is if the Dodgers pull the trigger on a
deal to get Johnson and the Mariners get the players they want from
LA _ and sign Nomo. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Take note &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck, who despite losing the zip on his fastball, had been
doing the job as the Cubs' closer until last week, when, admittedly
overused, he blew two straight saves and had to be taken out last
Saturday. To Beck's credit, he was used five straight days.
</P>
<P>
   Just a bit to the north, the Brewers have decided to go to
bullpen by committee after Doug Jones blew his trillionth save _
oh, all right, he's blown seven in 18 chances. Chad Fox is expected
to return to the roster in about three weeks. If his arm stays
healthy, he could win the closer job. Expect the Brewers to be
cautious with him, just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett will get a chance to play center field full time
for the Astros while rookie Richard Hidalgo mends a separated
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Griesinger, the Tigers' No. 1 pick in '96, will get a
chance to win a spot in the rotation. His Triple-A record isn't so
hot, but he had a 2.91 ERA in 10 starts at Toledo.

JAZZ WIN GAME 1 IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The teammate he had relied on the most over the
years was in the middle of an awful dream, in which the rim shrinks
and every shot careens out. John Stockton knew Karl Malone was in
trouble, so he whittled his offensive options down to one: himself.
</P>
<P>
   Driving into a lane filled with mounds of muscle and taller
players, the Utah Jazz's ageless, 6-foot-1-inch playmaker lofted a
running jumper from over the outstretched arms of Chicago's Steve
Kerr with 9.3 seconds remaining in overtime on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the shot swished through, the Delta Center erupted in
pandemonium and Michael Jordan's resilient team finally bowed their
heads. Stockton, the little point guard who could, came through in
Game 1 of the National Basketball Association finals, bailing out
the Mailman and the Jazz in their pulsating 88-85 overtime victory
over the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very difficult to defend,'' Kerr said. ``He's the best
point guard I've ever played against. He is amazing, and he was
obviously the difference tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls were suddenly looking at a 1-0 deficit in the
four-of-seven-game series, the Jazz was savoring a rare moment.
They had weathered two thrilling comebacks by the Bulls _ who
trailed by 7 points down with less than five minutes left in
regulation, and by 5 points in the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   That meant they had survived Jordan, who finished with 33 points
on 13-of-29 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The end was frantic. After Stockton's shot in the lane, Toni
Kukoc nailed a long 3-pointer with 5.4 seconds left to trim the
lead to 1 at 86-85.
</P>
<P>
   But Stockton hit two free throws with 3.5 seconds left to seal
the victory, and Scottie Pippen's desperation 3-pointer bounced
high off the rim to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the paint, drove in there, saw some guys fan out and
shot the shot,'' Stockton said of the clinching shot.
``Fortunately, it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulls Coach Phil Jackson said, ``It was a heck of a shot by John
Stockton, the kind that extinguished our hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton scored 7 of his 24 points in the extra period,
compensating for Malone's awful night from the field. Malone, who
made 9 of 25 shots, finished with 21 points and 14 rebounds while
Bryon Russell added 15 points for Utah. Pippen finished with 21
points for the Bulls, but missed 12 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Luc Longley forced the overtime with a lean-in jump
shot off the glass with 14.3 seconds left in regulation, then had
the most critical turnover of the game in overtime. With 30 seconds
remaining, he lost the ball as he dribbled toward the basket. After
a scrum on the floor, Russell grabbed the ball while he was in a
prone position and smartly called time out.
</P>
<P>
   The best-executing team in basketball would have a chance to put
Jordan away for good. With Kerr riding his left elbow, Stockton
delivered the final blow. He received a screen from Malone at the
top of the key and penetrated into the lane, lofting the
high-arching runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was John Stockton, pure and simple,'' Russell said. ``No
nerves. He may be small, but he played huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson went to his bench after the third quarter, hoping to
give Jordan the rest he needed to take care of business in the
final minutes. It worked for a while _ Scott Burrell, Jud Buechler
and Kerr did a good job of preventing the Jazz from taking over the
game _ but eventually Utah wore Chicago down.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was Jordan when he needed to be. He brought Chicago to
within 2 points in the overtime on a perfect swish, turning around
on the left baseline with both Russell and the 7-2 Greg Ostertag in
his face and dropping in a 15-footer to make it 84-82 with 2
minutes 7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But on the next possession, the flame flickered. He was caught
holding the ball and trying to force a shot as the shot clock
expired with 1:18 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had led by 73-66 with 4:38 left in regulation when the
Bulls regained their composure and their grit. Jordan created space
for himself and made pull-up jumpers on consecutive possessions.
Then Pippen added a devastating 3-pointer from the top of the key
with 2:34 left.
</P>
<P>
   That shot silenced the building and tied the score at 75-75.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was atrocious from the field. Perhaps he was feeling the
strain of last season's finals, in which he missed several crucial
free throws to help the Bulls win in six games. Maybe the taped and
misshapen middle finger on his shooting hand was bothering him more
than he let on before the series began.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, his marksmanship prevented Utah from pulling away
from Chicago. He missed 13 of his first 17 shots. With 6:59 left in
the game, the Bulls trailed by only 69-65 and could finally see
daylight in this Utah dungeon.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman was expected to start for the Bulls, but the club
announced before the game that he had suffered torn ligaments in
his right thumb during Game 7 of the Indiana series. Instead, Kukoc
got the nod and the Bulls suffered physically for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz started slow, leading by 45-40 at halftime. They almost
seemed to have too many things on their side. Ten days' rest.
Home-court advantage. And Jordan wagging his tongue more from
exhaustion than mere spite after going to seven games with Indiana
in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's lone weakness seemed to be rust.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had not played since they had knocked out the Los
Angeles Lakers in four straight games. If the Bulls looked fatigued
early, Utah was unpolished. And Jordan was relentless. Employing
up-and-under moves in the post and picturesque step-back jump shots
from the perimeter, he had 20 points by halftime and made the Jazz
work on defense.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about his having one foot on the court and the
other on the ninth hole of a retirement-community golf course,
Jordan was dazzling once more.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting double teams with ease and grace, he kept going to the
up-and-under move. First, he would use a pump fake and then step
between two defenders until he was inches from the rim for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   When he grew bored with those tactics, he simply stepped back
and fired off one foot while leaving his defender flailing at air.
</P>
<P>
   But solid play off Utah's bench from Howard Eisley, Shandon
Anderson and Chris Morris led to the Jazz to several 8-point leads
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jazz regrouped in overtime and set the tone for the
series by fending off the champions in a wild affair.
</P>
<P>
   Though they only shot 44.7 percent from the floor and turned the
ball over in crucial situations, they outlasted the guy who never
gives up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been good at predicting, I just know we have to
play a lot better Friday than we did tonight,'' Stockton said.
``Michael Jordan is too good to think you've got him down. They're
the champions and they'll be back.''

DIAMONDBACKS TAKE THEIR SHOW TO INTERLEAGUE PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a season full of firsts, the Diamondbacks will step into the
world of interleague play for the first time this weekend when they
travel to Oakland to play a three-game series against the
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Anaheim Angels will visit Bank One Ballpark for
the Diamondbacks' first home interleague series.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second season of interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews on the first season appear to be mixed, primarily
because of some travel difficulties and resistance from purists.
</P>
<P>
   Interleague play will be a new experience for the Diamondbacks'
Buck Showalter, who last managed in 1995. Since he came from the
American League with the New York Yankees, this might be an easier
transition for him than it would for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' he said. ``I think it has some
real merits. The fans get to see the players from the other
leagues, which is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy geographically, matching up teams from the West and
the East and so on, but I do think our fans in Arizona would like
to see the (Boston) Red Sox and the (Baltimore) Orioles. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And that other team. The one that wears pinstripes. The, uh,
Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Showalter said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll have to sit down after this season and
re-examine it, how to make things better with the scheduling end of
it,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was messed up, man,'' San Francisco Giants Manager Dusty
Baker said. ``Two games here, two games there. And what happens
when you end up tied for a playoff spot with a team that might not
have played the same amount of games against the same teams as you?
I don't know if they should keep it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Baker's pitchers, veteran right-hander Orel Hershiser, is
never short on opinions. He has played in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should make a decision on it, period, and stick with it.
None of this straddling-the-fence thing every two or three years,''
Hershiser said. ``If they're going to keep it, I think there
certainly has to be a better way than what they have now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of sitting down and taking the time and going
through it, step by step. I'd love to see something in place for
like a minimum of 10 years. It's all about leadership, having a
plan. I've never seen a $10 billion industry fly by the seat of its
pants like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, the San Diego Padres' perennial All-Star outfielder,
said if interleague play is based solely on geographical ties, his
club falls way short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no geographic interleague rival like the Dodgers would
and the Giants would,'' he said. ``The Diamondbacks are kind of in
the same category. The Rockies, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you probably would have everybody playing
everybody, kind of like the NFL does, but I don't know . . . having
the leagues separate makes things interesting at World Series time.
That's what has made our game unique.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that it was enjoyable playing against the Seattle
Mariners. The teams share the same spring-training facility in
Peoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgar (Martinez), A Rod (Alex Rodriguez), Grif (Ken Griffey
Jr.). It's fun to play against them and fun for the fans, I'm sure,
to watch,'' Gwynn said. ``And I would kind of like to play in
Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park just once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there is the question of the (designated hitter). I DH'd
once or twice last year, but I really didn't like it. You get more
of a full experience playing in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it (interleague play) stay? I honestly don't think so.
Mainly because of the travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks shortstop Jay Bell was with the Kansas City Royals
last season, and said the fans' response to games against the St.
Louis Cardinals ``was tremendous. You would hope that kind of
excitement can continue all around baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a different style. The National League probably
relies more on pitching and defense and the American League relies
more on the home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they should do is do the reverse of what they're doing
now. Use the DH in National League parks and not use it in the
American League parks. In general, the National League teams
probably have the advantage because the American League pitchers
don't normally hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The second season of interleague play is sure to manufacture its
share of memorable moments, but will it be enough for it to
continue?  &QL;

UTAH APPEARS READY TO TAKE ULTIMATE STEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ They're ready now. Ready to take the final
step. Ready to win the big prize.
</P>
<P>
   After 53 minutes of chaos, after a man consumed a sandwich
stuffed with live worms just to win a pair of tickets, after Karl
Malone hosted his own Brickyard 400, the Utah Jazz took a huge step
toward the maturity of champions. A huge step toward the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz escaped its own blunders, overcame its jitters and won
a basketball game that could've effectively ended its season. And
now, the Jazz is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good win for us,'' Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan said. ``I didn't
know whether we'd be able to hold them off.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Scottie Pippen slammed his gum to the floor in
disgust. The Bulls have done this so many times, refusing to lose
when they're destined for defeat. Like Wednesday, a night when the
Jazz squandered every opportunity to put the game away, handing
Michael Jordan the showcase of overtime, simply begging for
heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Jazz lost, a championship trophy might have slipped
through its fingers. But it didn't. And now the Bulls can add the
strain of overtime to their aching legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't ask for a better game, a better opportunity to
win on their court,'' Bulls Coach Phil Jackson said. ``We let one
slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson can take partial credit for that, committing a tactical
blunder that sealed the outcome. On the decisive play of overtime _
following a timeout _ he assigned Steve Kerr to guard John
Stockton. The mismatch was exploited, Stockton scored on a drive to
the hoop, and the Jazz had the cushion it needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted that kind of situation,'' Jackson said. ``Steve
stayed in front of him. It was a tough enough shot. I'll live with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He may die with it, too. Surely, Malone won't gag on his jumper
like he did for the first 46 minutes. The Jazz now knows its bench
is superior and is giddy with its breakthrough performance. And it
realize the Bulls are on their heels, a team that committed rare
mistakes in overtime, including a 24-second violation when Jordan
had the ball.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame Jordan, who authored another fabulous game and
may have found renewed serenity with a new hobby. Jordan has begun
playing the piano in his hotel, taking lessons from NBC's Ahmad
Rashad.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls now are relying on Luc Longley, an injured Dennis
Rodman and the immortal Dickey Simpkins to handle Malone. All three
performed well on Wednesday, but the odds of that continuing are
not good. They are also relying too much on Jordan and Pippen to
carry the offense, and pretty soon, the well is going to run dry.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, they haven't beaten the Jazz in three tries this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat to win a game when I don't play the way I expect to
play,'' Malone said. ``In the past, when I didn't have a great
game, we'd lose. That's changed, and it's neat to see when you're
trying to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   If not a passing of the torch, this series is an amazing
contrast in organizations. On Wednesday, Jazz owner Larry Miller
said he is determined to extend the contracts of his three
cornerstones _ Malone, Stockton and Coach Jerry Sloan. But in
Chicago, a dynasty will be dismantled before its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael isn't coming back,'' Ron Harper told ``Newsweek''
magazine. ``There's too much bad blood here for anybody to want to
do this again.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry about Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf suddenly
finding a conscience, which bodes well for everyone who wants to
see Pippen in a Suns jersey next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pippen gets a five-year deal for a lot of money, he should
take it,'' Reinsdorf told a national publication.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a wonder the Bulls can even perform with all the daily
chaos swirling through their lives. Now they have to find a way to
recover and win a game in Utah, find a way to beat a team that's
convinced its time has come.
</P>
<P>
   Or the run is over. And the real chaos will begin. &QL;  &QL;

RUSSELL, CLAIRE ON A HIGH WIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)SLANG 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers circus added another
sideshow Wednesday with manager Bill Russell and executive vice
president Fred Claire possibly perched on the high wire.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after the Randy Johnson trade was killed with
the Seattle Mariners, published reports from New York said Russell
and Claire will be fired at the end of the season and replaced by
Florida Marlins manager Jim Leyland and general manager Dave
Dombrowski.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox's News Corp., the club's new owners, denied the
report that appeared in the Fox-owned New York Post, the Dodgers
once again are wading through turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough to worry about without all this,'' Russell
said before his team beat the the St. Louis Cardinals 7-4 in front
of 35,647 at Dodger Stadium. ``Everybody knows we will be
re-evaluated at the end of the season. Right now we're just hoping
to get everyone's focus back on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, the Dodgers have designated former top-pitcher
Hideo Nomo for assignment and told the Mariners they would not
trade Darren Dreifort for Johnson, one of baseball's top pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's game, Claire addressed the team to discuss the
Johnson-trade talks, which were lengthy and distracting. Claire
also attempted to reaffirm with players that he is in charge of the
baseball operation. In the May 15 blockbuster trade with Florida,
Fox Television head Chase Carey was the point man in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Now this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get things settled down so this is not
beneficial,'' Claire said. ``(New club president Bob Graziano)
talked to me after the story came out to tell me it was not true
and I know he also talked to Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Wednesday's game was almost an afterthought. But not
to Eric Karros, who had a home run, three singles and drove in five
runs as the Dodgers (28-30) ended a losing streak at four games.
</P>
<P>
   For Karros, the focus of trade speculation last winter, it was
his first home run and RBI since May 19. The home run came on the
first pitch of the fifth inning against Cardinals starter Mark
Petkovsek (3-2).
</P>
<P>
   Karros' big night made a winner of Ramon Martinez (7-2), who now
has victories in seven of his last eight decisions. Martinez
pitched seven innings, allowing five hits and two runs with six
strikeouts and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has been swirling since the team was sold in late
March that no one would be safe after Fox took over.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who turns 50 in October, is in the final season of a
two-year $700,000 contract. Claire, 62, was given a three-year
contract by former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley several months
before the sale was finalized.
</P>
<P>
   The future of both men with the club is believed to hinge on the
club's success this year. The Dodgers have not won a post-season
game since 1998. But Fox said Wednesday there have been no talks
about replacing anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no truth to this,'' said Fox spokesman Vince Wladika
``This is obvious speculation on the part of anyone who knows the
situation in Florida. It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyland, who last season led the Marlins to a World Series
champion then watch management dismantle the club in a payroll
purge, has a multi-year contract worth $1.5 million this year. He
can opt out of the contract after this season for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife called me this morning and told me she heard this on
the Regis and Kathy (Lee) show,'' Leyland told the Miami Herald.
``I asked when this was supposed to happen and when was I going to
be informed. I've never talked to anybody. I don't want to talk to
anybody. It annoys me because it doesn't look good. It hurts my
feelings. I've got a job. I don't want another job. It's an insult
to another manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Leyland and Dombrowski are under contract, they can not
be contacted by another club without violating baseball's tampering
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano said he did not think the story carried extra weight
because it was reported in a newspaper run by the owner of his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rupert Murdoch owns a lot of companies and I don't think they
are all in sync to the point where he would use one entity to talk
about another.''

STOCKTON TAKES CENTER COURT AS JAZZ TOP BULLS  
 JORDAN GAFFE NEAR END OF OT DOOMS DEFENDING CHAMPIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Utah's John Stockton may not be as renowned as
Chicago's Michael Jordan for making great plays in critical
situations, but he hasn't been on the NBA's biggest stage as often,
either.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stockton, not Jordan, who made the clutch plays down the
stretch in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday night, lifting the
Jazz to an 88-85 overtime victory and a 1-0 lead in the
best-of-seven championship series.
</P>
<P>
   And Stockton's timing couldn't have been better, as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the Finals a big question was how rusty the Jazz
would be after sitting idle for 10 days after their sweep of the
Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, most of the rust settled in Karl Malone's airway.
The Jazz star struggled with his shot most of the night before
finally hitting a couple of big shots in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Malone wound up with 21 points on 9-of-25 shooting. But Stockton
hit 9 of 12 shots and handed out eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, meanwhile, were concerned with rest more than rust.
They just came off a grueling seven-game series with Indiana and
had to win an intense Game 7 to advance. The last thing the Bulls
wanted was an overtime game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious we had our chances. . .that shot by John Stockton
kind of extinguished our hopes,'' said Chicago Coach Phil Jackson.
``Except for fatigue being a factor at the end of the game, I
thought we played fairly well. Malone had a tough night shooting,
but Stockton picked him up tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan finished with 33 points on 13-of-29 shooting, but he made
a critical error with 1:18 remaining in the overtime and the Jazz
leading by two points. Jordan lost track of the 24-second shot
clock and it expired, turning over the ball to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity level is so high, I think we felt like we had
more time on the clock,'' said Chicago's Scottie Pippen. ``I think
he just lost track.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan agreed it was a mental lapse, but not necessarily his
own. He said Pippen was confused about the play that was supposed
to be run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie didn't know what the play was, so we had to start it
over again,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton made them pay, hitting a running 10-footer off a
classic Utah pick-and-roll set with 9.3 seconds to play in overtime
that gave the Jazz a four-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Chicago's Toni Kukoc connected on a three-point shot with
5.1 seconds on the clock, trimming the Utah lead to a point,
Stockton made a pair of free throws to push it back to three.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, without a timeout remaining to move the ball to
halfcourt, had to go the length of the floor with a pass that
Jordan tipped to Luc Longley. He shoveled it to Pippen, who got a
three-point attempt off at the final buzzer. But the shot was long.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton said the 10-day layoff probably had a negative effect
on the Jazz .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a long time to sit there and wonder and think about
the series when last year we were just thrust into it,'' he said.
``Sometimes thinking too much can hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz almost let the game slip away after leading by eight at
the start of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With a make-shift Chicago lineup of Kukoc, Dennis Rodman, Steve
Kerr, Scott Burrell and Jud Buechler on the court, the Jazz went
cold. After Bryon Russell hit a leaning 16-footer early in the
final quarter, the Jazz went 5:17 without scoring, turning over the
ball four times and missing six straight shots. The Bulls chipped
away, and when Jordan returned he briefly took over. He hit a
17-foot jumper with 3:47 to go in regulation to cut the Jazz lead
to five, then following it with a 19-foot jumper. When Pippen hit a
three-pointer with 2:34 to go, the score was tied.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago could never seize the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Malone finally came alive at that moment, hitting back-to-back
jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going to go to Karl Malone,'' said Utah Coach
Jerry Sloan. ``We're not going to quit going to him in those
situations. He missed a couple. That's part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls got a pair of free throws from Pippen, then a driving
shot from Longley off Jordan's assist with 14 seconds to go in
regulation that tied the score. &QL;

EX-CARD JOHNSON HAS CANCER  
 GIANTS DOCTORS DIS COVER TREATABLE CHEST TUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Born into a rodeo family in Haskell, Okla., a town so small that
it has just one store, LeShon Johnson never had anything handed to
him except a good pair of work gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But he's now facing the biggest chore of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the former Cardinal running back who signed this spring
with the New York Giants, has lymphoma, the Giants announced
Wednesday. The 27-year-old Johnson and his doctors should decide
this week how to treat the cancer, which was discovered after a
routine chest X-ray revealed a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctors tell me we have a good chance to cure this,'' said
Johnson in a statement released by the Giants. ``My family and I
believe that with the help of the doctors and with the strength of
our faith in God, we will get through this, and I will be back on
the field in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   That's questionable, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us are thinking that's a priority,'' said
Giants Coach Jim Fassel, the Cardinals' offensive coordinator in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson experienced no symptoms and participated fully in a
minicamp last month, Fassel said. The Giants required players to
have chest X-rays as part of their physicals before the minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   A mass was found in Johnson's chest, and tests later confirmed
the cancer, which is believed to be non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prognosis for these types of tumors is good,'' team
internist Allan Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had a similar X-ray taken last spring while with the
Cardinals, and it showed no abnormalities. The medical staffs from
the two teams have been in contact for several weeks, and the
Cardinals have forwarded Johnson's medical records to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prayers are with he and his family,'' said Bob Ferguson,
Cardinals vice president for player personnel. ``He's faced
challenges all his life, and I'm sure he'll do everything possible
to overcome this.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who married just a few weeks ago, played with the
Cardinals in 1996 and 1997 after being released by the Green Bay
Packers. In 1996, he set a Cardinals record by rushing for 214
yards in a victory over New Orleans. He scored on consecutive runs
of 56 and 70 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 66-yard run the following week but eventually lost his
starting job. Last season, he rushed only 23 times for 81 yards and
signed with the Giants this spring as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is deeply religious, was popular with his Cardinals
teammates. He was shy and humble, and teammates teased him about
his love of country music, bull riding and the large pickup truck
he drove.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson started riding bulls when he was 8 and later became an
accomplished football player. After two years at Northeastern
Oklahoma A&AMP;M Junior College, he transferred to Northern Illinois,
where he led the nation in rushing his senior year, gaining 1,976
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers drafted Johnson in the third round in 1994, and he
suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament at the end of that
season. Green Bay waived him the following season.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 season, Johnson underwent excimer laser surgery
on both eyes, which improved his vision immensely. His running
style, however, never changed. At 207 pounds, Johnson isn't big by
NFL standards, but he preferred to run over people rather than
elude them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has yet to prove he can be successful with that style,
but he would like another chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``LeShon asked the doctor many times (about playing in 1998),''
Fassel said, ``and the doctor said, `we'll talk about that when we
lay out a whole scenario of what we are going to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had missed the last three days of the Giants' voluntary
practice, and Fassel told the team Wednesday of Johnson's illness.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kent Graham, who like Johnson moved from the
Cardinals to the Giants this spring, has known about Johnson's
condition for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got everybody upset,'' he said, ``but it's encouraging
because it's the type that can be treated.'' &QL;

SORE SHOULDER CONCERNS ECKERSLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox reliever Dennis Eckersley, who pitched two
innings Sunday for only the second time in his last 120 appearances
dating to the start of the 1996 season, was unable to pitch
Wednesday night because of discomfort in the back of his right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley was clearly worried after the game. ``I got hot, ready
to go,'' he said, referring to his warm-ups in the bullpen, when he
was preparing to pitch the seventh inning against the Orioles.
``But then I felt (discomfort). I just didn't find it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley said he first felt discomfort Monday morning, the day
after he went two innings against the Yankees. Eckersley, who
averaged 15 pitches an appearance last season as the Cardinals'
closer, threw 26 pitches against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   That's a total he's exceeded only four times in the last three
years, including a 35-pitch outing against the Indians April 18,
the most pitches he has thrown in that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just have to see how it feels tomorrow,'' said Eckersley,
who had been pitching better of late, going un-scored upon in six
of his last eight appearances, though he has seldom been used in
critical situations.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Jim Corsi, his close friend, said Eckersley's shoulder
had felt better when he played catch the last couple of days. What
concerns Corsi is the location of the discomfort, in the back of
Eck's shoulder. Eckersley plans to be examined Thursday.

FOR ONE NIGHT, JOHNS A STANDOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He shares the locker room with Cal Ripken and Robbie
Alomar and others who regularly command attention from the
assembled media. Perhaps that's why Baltimore Orioles lefthander
Doug Johns, who began last season pitching in Italy, seemed
perplexed to see reporters in front of him Wednesday night _
despite the fact that he held the Red Sox hitless for five innings
and wound up allowing just four hits in 7 1/3 innings of a 3-0
victory Wednesday night at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The journeyman pitched like an All-Star against one of the
American League's best hitting clubs, striking out four and walking
one, as he raised his record to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Three of his strikeouts came in the first four innings. He got
Mo Vaughn swinging in the second and Darren Lewis and John Valentin
looking in the fourth; Valentin was then ejected after arguing
balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug Johns pitched a great game against a very tough lineup,''
said Orioles manager Ray Miller. ``He got (Nomar) Garciaparra out
with two pitches the first two times up. That's pitching, because
even if you give up a hit, at least the guy hasn't seen your whole
arsenal the first time up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox saw much of Johns's arsenal Wednesday night and were
unable to counter until Damon Buford singled to left to open the
sixth. But Johns didn't falter. He got Lou Merloni to force Buford
at second, then retired Jason Varitek on a fly and Lewis on a
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going at them, and fortunately, we got them to hit the
ball where we had guys who made great plays,'' said Johns. ``The
game was close and I just tried to keep guys off base. With this
ballpark, one bad pitch and it can be a close game.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns, 31, was signed by the Orioles as a free agent last June
30 and was assigned to Triple A after being released by the Kansas
City Royals. He had signed a minor league contract with Kansas City
after playing in Parma, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over there for a couple of weeks and had a great
time,'' he said. ``(Baseball) is definitely not as big there as it
is here. I went with a team that played in the European Cup in
Holland. I never actually played with a team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had always been a one-dimensional pitcher, right over the
top,'' said Miller. ``He got righthanders out but he had trouble
with lefties. But (pitching coach) Mike Flanagan, being a Cy Young
winner, a great lefthanded pitcher, worked with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns has had a most eventful career. After playing in the
minors from 1990-95, he got his first major league stint with
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   His major league debut came on July 8, 1995, when he started the
opener of a doubleheader against Toronto. He was ejected in the
fourth inning after throwing a pitch behind Toronto's John Olerud,
a retaliation after Oakland's Mark McGwire was hit on the helmet by
David Cone. For his show of solidarity, Johns was optioned to
Triple A Edmonton following the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night marked Johns's fourth start since he came off
the disabled list, where he had been placed with insomnia, of all
things. He began his Orioles career with a start against Anaheim
April 21 but gave up three runs on seven hits in four innings and
was later moved to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he took the mound Wednesday night with a 2.08 earned run
average since being activated and continued his success.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another poignant scene from the inevitable ``El
Duque'' Hernandez TV movie was staged here Wednesday night: The
Cuban defector doffed his cap for the American national anthem,
then puzzled the Tampa Bay Devil Rays with a Luis Tiant-like range
of deceptive deliveries in his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez's life has been playing out in improbable acts
ever since he and seven others slammed into the Bahamas in a
20-foot boat over Christmas. Wednesday night he replaced David
Cone, who missed a turn because a Jack Russell terrier named
Veronica bit him on his pitching hand Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Cuban flags fluttering from the Yankee Stadium upper deck
and fans chanting, ``El Duque'' and ``libertad,'' in the
right-field bleachers, Hernandez came out wearing No. 26 _ the
number he wore while pitching 10 seasons for Havana's famous
Industriales under the banner of Cuban Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said he cried while warming up in the bullpen. Then he
was all high leg kicks and multiple arm angles, allowing five hits
and striking out seven in seven uneventful innings of a 7-1 Yankee
win. Fred McGriff bombed a high sidearm fastball over the
right-field fence in the fourth, but for the most part, El Duque _
28 going on 32 _ was scarcely nicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I be nervous?'' he said earlier in the day while
munching room-service pasta at the Hilton in Fort Lee, N.J. ``I've
pitched when it was packed at Estadio Latinoamericano'' in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I wasn't nervous,'' he said afterward. ``But I realized
the responsibility I had, taking the place of David Cone.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, Hernandez, the older half-brother of Marlins
righthander Livan Hernandez, was banned from Cuban baseball and
living in the back of his in-laws' sweltering cinder-block home. He
played third base and managed a neighborhood team that played
before a scattering of cows at Lenin Park. He earned $8.75 a month
as a physical therapist at Havana Psychiatric Hospital. After
landing in the Bahamas, he took up residency in Costa Rica, signed
a $6.6 million contract with the Yankees, went 6-0 with Triple A
Columbus, then ascended to the major leagues two months ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival here was terrible news for the Red Sox and the rest
of the American League East. Among other things, it demonstrated
the strength of a Yankee rotation whose weakest link is currently
Andy Pettitte. The Yanks are so deep that Joe Torre announced
before the game that he was planning to send El Duque back to
Columbus immediately regardless of how he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``His future is tonight,'' said Torre. Later, though, the
manager gave himself some wiggle room in case he got a call from
George Steinbrenner, who watched the game from Tampa. ``I don't
anticipate he'll start here in five days,'' said Torre. ``But if
somebody else wants to make the call, I'll write his name in.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Havana, which lives under a perpetual news
blackout, there was no mention Wednesday of Hernandez's debut in
Granma, the Communist Party newspaper. The country was abuzz
nonetheless, according to people who spoke by phone, as word
traveled across the Florida straits via Miami radio and the vast
Cuban exile community in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was supposed to start a day earlier, but they put
it off,'' said Ricardo Calderon, 52, sitting in Havana's Central
Park, where dozens of men gather each day to argue about baseball.
Chino Rodriguez pulled out a weathered Miami Herald clipping of El
Duque donning his Yankee togs for the first time. ``This is a big
moment for all Cubans,'' he said. ``These are the New York
Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven people who set off with Hernandez from Cuba's
northern coast, five remain in Costa Rica. Alberto Hernandez, the
former star catcher, is working in an auto repair shop along with
El Duque's cousin, Joel Pedroso. The boat captain and his wife had
a falling out with Hernandez and are living somewhere in the
capital. Osmany Lorenzo, El Duque's best friend, is working as a
bartender.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez used to get around Havana hitching rides in Lorenzo's
beat-up Lada sedan, and the two lived off Lorenzo's mastery of the
black market.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in San Jose, Lorenzo said of El Duque, ``After so much
work, after so much pain, he's finally living his dream.''

JAZZ HAVE A LITTLE BIT EXTRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SALT LAKE CITY _ The Utah Jazz took the first step Wednesday
night in a once futile but now apparently viable effort to dethrone
Michael Jordan's Bulls. They almost slipped.
</P>
<P>
   They blew a couple of late leads in regulation. They got a
nightmarish shooting game from their leading scorer. But they
nevertheless survived in overtime, taking a tense 88-85 victory in
Game 1 of the best-of-seven NBA Finals before a jubilant crowd at
the Delta Center. Game 2 is here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Utah has won 11 of 12 playoff games since falling behind the
Rockets, 2-1, in the first round. The Bulls, meanwhile, dropped
their fourth consecutive road playoff game, having gone 0-3 in
Indiana in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which beat Utah in six games last year for its second
straight NBA title and fifth in seven years, got 33 points from
Jordan, but he hoisted 29 shots to get them. He also was whistled
for a costly 24-second violation in overtime when he clearly had
lost track of the shot clock. ``It was a mental thing and I never
really noticed the clock and no one noticed the clock,'' Jordan
said. ``We made a lot of mental mistakes down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen added 21 points but was long on a 3-pointer that
would have forced a second overtime. The Bulls left the building
feeling they let one slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't ask for a better opportunity,'' said coach Phil
Jackson. ``We had our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Jordan, ``When you're on the road and have a chance to
win, that's all you want. But we never capitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they didn't. They didn't make the plays when the plays
needed to be made, which they usually do. This time Utah did. The
estimable John Stockton led the Jazz with 24 and bailed them out in
OT, scoring 7 of Utah's 9 points and assisting on the other 2. Karl
Malone was 9 for 25, made only two jump shots all night, and said,
``I didn't have a good rhythm.'' He sure didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was rusty. The Jazz had not played in 10 days, and that
was one of many subplots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten days is a very long time,'' Stockton said. ``I'm not
claiming I was rusty or anyone else was, but it's a long time to
sit back and think about the next series. Sometimes thinking too
much can hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another subplot was Dennis Rodman's sore right thumb, which was
taped and clearly bothered him. He still collected 10 rebounds in
40 minutes and made some key defensive plays. ``I thought Dennis
played exceptionally well, given his situation,'' said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah bench, an undeniable strength, came through again,
outscoring Chicago's reserves, 22-8.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had trouble on offense, as evidenced by the 79-79
score at the end of regulation. (Good defense was there, too, but
so were a lot of missed open shots.) Many of Malone's misses were
shots he routinely makes and likely will make in Game 2 if he gets
the same looks. Jordan, who was 13 for 29, saw several spin out.
The Jazz, who led the NBA in field goal shooting, shot 45 percent.
The Bulls shot 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Utah was in control most of the night, although it never had a
lead larger than 8 points. (The Bulls' largest lead was 4 points,
and they never led after the first quarter.) The Jazz led by 7 with
4:28 left, only to see the Bulls rip off 7 straight points in 72
seconds, 4 by Jordan and a huge trey by Pippen. Utah led by 4 with
55.7 seconds left (after Malone's two jump shots) but saw that
disappear on two Pippen free throws and a Luc Longley lean-in with
14.3 seconds left, tying the game.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, on a pick-and-roll with Stockton, broke the ice in OT,
the first of 5 straight Utah points. The other 3 came from
Stockton, who took it coast to coast after a Pippen turnover and
was fouled. The freebie made it 84-79. The Bulls got within 2
(84-82) on 3 Jordan points (he missed a free throw in there), but
Stockton killed them again with a floater in the lane over Steve
Kerr with 9.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   End of game? Not quite. Toni Kukoc dropped a big 3 out of an
inbounds play to make it 86-85. Stockton was deliberately fouled
with 3.5 seconds left, making both shots. The Bulls, out of
timeouts, went for the post-pattern trey. Pippen got a look and a
shot, but it wasn't close.

THESE OLD BIRDS ARE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They won 98 games and the American League East last
year, then padded their payroll to a historic $74 million, just to
make sure they'd do it again. They came into this season with more
veteran stars than the combined rosters of the Utah Jazz and
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   And then they lost 25 of 35, including nine straight, to fall to
the bottom of baseball's Social Register Division _ a whopping 15
games behind the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   We got our first look at the Baltimore Orioles Wednesday night,
and they beat the Olde Towne Team, 3-0, on the strength of Doug
Johns's strong 7 1/3 innings of four-hit ball. A 31-year-old
journeyman lefthander, Johns has been on the disabled list with
insomnia. Oriole coach Mike Flanagan said they got him out of it by
pitching him in Yankee Stadium (``the city that never sleeps'') and
the Kingdome (``Sleepless in Seattle''). It must have worked.
</P>
<P>
   Shutout pitching is not what we expected from the reeling O's.
We expected to see Robbie Alomar and Brady Anderson dogging it,
refusing to run out ground balls. We expected to see a clubhouse of
guys demanding to be traded and/or calling their bankers on cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Orioles looked very much like most teams that come
through here, only older. With such notables as Cal Ripken, Harold
Baines, Joe Carter, B.J. Surhoff, Rafael Palmeiro, and Jesse
Orosco, the Oriole lineup some days resembles a Supreme Court team
photo.
</P>
<P>
   They are scuffling. But they know it's folly to hang their heads
over a bad start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all right,'' said Anderson (.182). ``I have an idea
what's been going on. I've been told we're not in first place. The
Red Sox are in a better position than we are. They've earned it and
outplayed us all year long. But it hasn't been my experience that
panicking helps.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the Orioles offer injuries as the primary excuse for
their early-season swoon. It's partially legit. At this hour, three
of Baltimore's top four starters (ace Mike Mussina, Jimmy Key, and
Scott Kamieniecki) are on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Putting three starters on the shelf has wreaked havoc with
Baltimore's bullpen, and manager Ray Miller has been forced to use
a lot of rookies and Triple A talents. It hasn't been pretty. Going
into Wednesday night's game, the Baltimore staff ERA was 5.22.
</P>
<P>
   There's been some bad luck involved. Mussina's two trips to the
disabled list were caused by (1) a wart on his finger, and (2) a
line drive to the face. He's supposed to come back Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Down but not done, the Orioles object to the notion that they've
given up. Things got particularly ugly when they were swept in New
York and Anderson and Alomar made video highlights by failing to
run out ground balls. It looked like Miller was losing control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take care of that stuff, but I do it behind closed doors,''
said Miller. ``When things go bad, every little thing gets pointed
out, but the fans at home have been good to me and good to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the Yankees have played great, but take (Andy) Pettitte,
(Hideki) Irabu, and Bernie Williams out of their lineup for a month
and see how (expletive) good they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles are 28-30, 14 1/2 games behind the Yankees and six
behind the Red Sox in the hunt for the wild-card spot. They have
104 games remaining. And they are still working. There were no less
than 16 Orioles on the field Wednesday at 2:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work through this,'' said Ripken, who played in his
2,536th consecutive game. ``Every team goes through a time like
this in their season. We have talent on this club. The ability to
hit and play is all there. It's a matter of getting through it.
There's still two-thirds of a season left. Let's play it and see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jimy Williams, Bret Saberhagen, and several of the Red
Sox, Ripken acknowledges the existence of the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not just one chance anymore,'' he said. ``Obviously,
the wild card is extra incentive. It keeps you optimistic. There's
two shots you can play for instead of one.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the beleaguered manager, looked around the room and
said, ``I wouldn't give up on us.''

SEATTLE FANS GREET JOHNSON WITH WARM RECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There was a sense of relief Wednesday night among many
Mariner fans that Randy Johnson wasn't traded to the Los Angeles
Dodgers or any other team in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   A banner next to the bullpen mound summed up their sentiments:
``Welcome home Big Unit.'' Ushers removed the sign during the first
inning, and it never reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But some fans believe that trading Johnson is the only way the
M's can pick up some relief pitching before the season gets away
from the defending AL West champions. And they wonder if Johnson
will pitch with the same heart and dedication for the Mariners if
he remains unhappy over his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not happy, then he should go,'' said Stacey Wilson of
Vancouver, Wash. ``If he's not happy, he's not going to play hard
for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Stacey Mohagen, admitted that she felt the same, but
would support Johnson as long as he continues to pitch in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right to be booed when you're forced to stay where
you're at,'' she said. ``You can't be upset with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson noted that Johnson still makes $6 million playing in
Seattle this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's almost over the hill, so why pay millions of dollars for
him?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Season-ticket holder Mike Gallagher said he wasn't impressed by
Johnson's last two outings, in which Johnson picked up two wins _
and 25 strikeouts _ over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason he's pitching good is because he sees his
value going down,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Johnson was met with a polite ovation from the crowd
of 24,944 when he walked to the bullpen mound Wednesday night to
begin his warmups and then again when he was announced as the
starting pitcher. However, it was a far cry from the standing
ovation he received when taking the mound on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   For the players, having M's president Chuck Armstrong announce
that Johnson was no longer on the trading block brought a sense of
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could turn into something positive, really spur him on and
really inspire him,'' catcher Dan Wilson said. ``That's what we're
hoping for. There's been a lot on his mind, that's for sure, but
now there's a little bit of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup catcher John Marzano heard the news Tuesday just before
he sat down for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I could finally eat my meal in peace,'' Marzano
said. ``You don't want to get rid of a guy like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson entered Wednesday night's game 13-5 against Anaheim in
23 career starts with a 2.69 ERA. He was 10-1 against the Angels
since June 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet I was hoping not to see him,'' said Angels manager
Terry Collins. ``I was hoping big time for a trade. But I told
everybody (in Anaheim) that we'll see him. Even if there was going
to be a trade, they would let him pitch against us one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was the best news for season-ticket holders Jan and
Dick Kochel of Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy he's still here, because I think he can still
win,'' Dick Kochel said. ``I actually think we need him to stay
around to have a shot at the pennant. Everybody else is getting the
big bucks, why shouldn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   His wife added: ``I feel very loyal to the team and we give a
lot to the team by attending and supporting them every way we can.
I would love for him to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the ace of the starting rotation appears to be staying
with the club at least for the short term, Wilson and other players
said they hoped all the talk would turn to how the Mariners can get
back in the pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is important and every game is important now,''
Wilson said. ``We're in a position where we can catch the No. 1 and
2 teams in our division, and even though we haven't played the way
we wanted, we're not way out of it.''

ANGELS BEDEVIL JOHNSON'S RETURN TO KINDOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners ushered in a new era Wednesday night _
Big Unit, A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Almost Dodger. After Dangling. Alone and be damned.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson made his reluctant return to the Kingdome after a
week of twisting in the trade winds, and it wasn't a happy
homecoming. He got beat by the Anaheim Angels 8-1, extending
Seattle's losing streak to three and causing a seemingly lost
season to dim a little more.
</P>
<P>
   Taking full advantage of all the hurt feelings, longtime Mariner
nemisis Chuck Finley posted his 17th career victory over Seattle in
24 outings, and Damon Mashore drove in the deciding run with a
seventh-inning home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do much,'' Mariner manager Lou Piniella said,
amazingly keeping his composure during difficult times. ``We need
to start winning ballgames. That's how you get momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange and uncomfortable setting, one witnessed by
24,944 fans. People half-heartedly applauded when Johnson's name
was announced on the public-address system a half-hour before game
time. They clapped tepidly when he walked to the bullpen to warm
up. They finally raised their level of appreciation a level higher
when he trudged to the dugout and his name was splashed on the
stadium big screen. Didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (5-4) went about his business in a cold, detached
manner, first setting down some stern ground rules. There would be
no eye contact with anything but the catcher's mitt. No exultant
gestures. No interviews the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For six innings, his displeasure didn't show. The 6-foot-10
lefty locked himself in a terrific duel with Finley (6-2), each
pitcher permitting one run and five hits. Then it all came apart
like a moth-eaten sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner ace crumbled in the seventh inning, serving up five
runs. The first came on the long ball by the light-hitting Mashore
leading off, one soaring out over the left field fence. It was
Mashore's second homer of the season. A one-out double was followed
by a hit batter, a walk, a run-scoring grounder and two singles.
Johnson was done.
</P>
<P>
   Before facing his last batter, the tallest and unhappiest
Mariner turned toward his dugout, as if asking out of this mess.
The last time he did something like that, in 1991, his manager
called him a quitter. Once relieved of his duties on this night, he
left the field with stoic look and a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella offered an explanation for all of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stiffened up in the seventh inning, but he gave us six good
innings,'' the manager said. ``It's nothing long-term. We started
to notice it in the sixth.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his agent before the game, Johnson had asked reporters
to limit their questions to performance, not trade possibilities.
As the game began, the Mariners announced that the pitcher
ultimately had decided not to deal with reporters for the remainder
of the season. He was dressed and gone when the media was allowed
in the clubhouse 10 minutes after the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, according to a witness, let his temper go and started
throwing things in the tunnel outside the dugout after leaving the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Before his mound meltdown, Johnson was efficient, more cutting
than overpowering. He got big outs when he needed them. Outs by
other means than his old standby, the strikeout. He finished with
five K's.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson allowed a lone run in the second inning when the Angels'
Justin Baughman bounced a no-out, infield hit to shortstop with the
bases loaded. Alex Rodriguez could only wait for the high hopper to
settle in his glove and fake a throw to first as Anaheim's Craig
Shipley crossed the plate. Johnson showed great resilience by
retiring the next three hitters and moving on.
</P>
<P>
   For five innings, Finley was even better. He raced through the
Mariner lineup twice, allowing just two harmless doubles by Edgar
Martinez in the fourth and Joey Cora in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners finally got something going against the Anaheim
pitcher in the sixth inning. David Segui singled up the middle and
Martinez followed with another double, slicing one off the right
field wall. Glenallen Hill's groundout plated Segui with the tying
run.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, however, struck out Cora with the bases loaded to end
the inning and send the Angels to their fourth consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have much to sort out. Players say they're trying
to get the clubhouse in order after the carnival atmosphere caused
by the Johnson dealings, or lack of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you dwell on the past and think of negative things, you're
going to go out and play poorly,'' reliever Paul Spoljaric said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has matched his loss total for 1997, will make his
next start Monday night in San Francisco.

SONICS WANT TO TRIM COACH CANDIDATE LIST TO TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The man who barreled past Sonics president Wally
Walker on a street corner here knew the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, will you take my application?'' teased the man, obviously
a friend of Walker's. ``Betcha got a lot of those.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Walker jokingly replied, ``they're piling up.''
</P>
<P>
   But which pile are the applications falling into when it comes
to the Sonics' vacant head-coaching job? Although the predraft camp
here is a haven for just about every NBA coach and general manager,
it probably isn't where Walker will find George Karl's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   There are several plausible candidates on hand at the Moody
Bible Institute's Solheim Center, site of the predraft camp. Sonics
assistant coach Bob Weiss is here. So is Charlotte assistant Paul
Silas.
</P>
<P>
   However, one guy who is not present appears to be at the top of
Walker's list. Although Walker will not discuss individual
candidates, former Phoenix Suns coach Paul Westphal is considered
the frontrunner by two sources close to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   There are only six candidates Walker will consider: Westphal,
Silas, Weiss, former Indiana Pacers and San Antonio Spurs coach Bob
Hill, Chicago's Phil Jackson and apparently one other hopeful whose
name Walker will not disclose.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, though, is attempting to narrow his search to two in a
week. A new coach could be named as soon as 10 days from now.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal is definitely on the short list because Walker is
impressed by his success with the Suns. The next-strongest aspirant
could be Silas or Weiss, depending on how their interviews go.
</P>
<P>
   Silas is scheduled to formally meet with Walker Thursday. Weiss
will have his time a few days after.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, in the meantime, is gathering information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a casual background-checking mode,'' said Walker, who
is being approached by scores of advocates for certain hopefuls.
``A friend will say you should consider _ fill in the name _ for
these reasons. A lot of (information) I'm getting from people I
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Do not underestimate Walker's predetermined analysis of certain
candidates. Westphal's name has been thrown around the most since
Karl's ouster. The reasons are so viable that Westphal, a one-time
Sonics player, probably will be the last to interview late next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Westphal take the Suns to the 1993 NBA Finals, but
he also achieved success with a volatile superstar in Charles
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Walker is looking to create a similar tonic in
Seattle. Appearances aside, Karl struggled at times with All-Star
guard Gary Payton's persona and sometimes poor leadership last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inexact part of (finding the next coach) is trying to find
the right guy who fits our team,'' Walker said. ``I'm still more
inclined to someone with experience. We're going to have a
contending team.''
</P>
<P>
   There are indications that the Sonics' next coach will come from
the free-agent pool. That all but eliminates Atlanta's Lenny
Wilkens from the mix. The perception is that Atlanta and Wilkens
were working on an amicable separation. Speculation is that Wilkens
would love to coach the Sonics again _ especially since he is
beloved by Seattle where he maintains a home.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilkens has several years left on his Atlanta contract and
needs permission from the Hawks to pursue other jobs. Atlanta
general manager Pete Babcock said he's heard the rumors _ but
nothing from Wilkens' mouth _ about the NBA's winningest coach
wanting to leave for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never said anything to me,'' Babcock said. ``Lenny and I
sat down just three days ago and talked about where we need to go
with the team. We made a commitment to him, and he made a
commitment to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker didn't totally rule out a Wilkens candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't asked permission of anybody yet,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Hill, who some feel is being hurt by his public
campaigning for the job, Jackson is perhaps the other longshot. The
Sonics are said to only be willing to wait on Jackson if he
indicates interest in the job. Otherwise, the Sonics would have to
wait until his Bulls contract expires July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who remains coy about the search, said finding a new
coach should not be a long process. He set a light deadline of
filling the vacancy by the June 24 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   The target date seems to be the best thing going in Chicago.

GAME 1 MAKES UP IN DRAMA WHAT IS LOST IN AGED PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ As one of the more eagerly anticipated NBA
Finals _ step right up, kiddies, getcher last look at The Man
before he ascends to Valhalla _ Game 1 between the Utah Jazz and
Chicago Bulls was something less than divas with orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was more of a Middle-Aged-Man Festival, sponsored by
Rogaine and Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Even the pregame dialogue was less than compelling, both teams
scrambling for the low ground, desperate to be cast as underdogs to
accrue the mythical advantages of the trite us-against-the-world
dogma.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent contest rarely emerged from that rhetorical
basement. Rims took a heavy pounding from the brutal shotmaking,
defense was spotty, and aside from a couple episodes of
incandescence from Michael Jordan, the game was smeared with too
many moments of Clipper training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite all this desultory bang-and-clang, the Jazz and
Bulls never lacked for hand-wringing drama. After more than three
hours of inelegance, with no lead greater than eight points, the
Jazz won 87-85 in overtime, leaving the impression they might be
ready for another 10 days' rest before Game 2. (Certainly, anyone
in attendance at Delta Center who had ears is ready for several
days off, unless the NBA invokes a ban on contrived pregame audio
assaults.)
</P>
<P>
   You might have read that the comparative issue advancing this
championship rematch was the Jazz's rust versus the Bulls' lack of
rest. Turns out there was no competition between the liabilities _
both were overwhelming enough to smother the game.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a question of whose poor play would be less
consequential. The Jazz answered positively and perhaps in more
decisive ways than the game-long tautness of the score.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions came from so many directions that the Jazz
established they do indeed have the overall personnel advantage. In
particular, the Jazz reserves outscored their Chicago counterparts
22-8, with all but Antoine Carr hitting at least half their shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bench played really, really well,'' gushed Karl Malone,
whose poor shooting night made assistance mandatory. ``In the past
when I had a bad game, we lost. But we've matured. We still managed
to win, and it's really neat to see.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that was one of several points in the game that were
reverse images of what these teams had done in the past. The
dramatics of the fourth quarter and overtime were usually where the
Bulls excelled, and the multiple lineup combinations had been a
Chicago staple.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the Jazz who had more smart guys doing the right
things more often, even if shots weren't falling.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telltale sign of Bulls' vulnerability came in
the second quarter, when Chicago rested Jordan and trotted out
seldom-used reserves Dickey Simpkins, Randy Brown, Jud Buechler and
Steve Kerr in a bizarre lineup that veteran Bull-watchers swear
they had never seen.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup didn't exactly fail them, but it didn't allow any
exploitation of poor Jazz play. It also accentuated the absences of
two big forwards from the 1997 Finals, Brian Williams and Jason
Caffey, whose contributions weren't replaced this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some guys on the court who weren't particularly
comfortable from an offensive standpoint,'' said Scottie Pippen.
``They do a good job in practice moving the ball. But tonight they
didn't feel confident taking the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, the sage of the bench who is nearing his personal
free agency, picked an odd time to conduct what he admitted was an
experiment with the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lineup I wanted to test,'' he said. ``It's early in the
series. You've got to figure out what's going to work. We're
willing to take some experimental time with it.''
</P>
<P>
   December against Denver is when most teams experiment. Trying it
in June is a fine way to end a dynasty. But it was no less a
stunner than when the Bulls, trailing 84-82 inside the final 30
seconds of overtime, committed a 24-second violation with Jordan as
the ball-holding culprit.
</P>
<P>
   This mistake was Michelangelo straying outside the lines on
paint by numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mental lapse,'' Jordan said. ``Scottie got confused
in terms of what the play was, so we had to start it back over
again. I never really noticed the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of mental mistakes down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   For the defending champs, it was hardly a characteristic game.
As Sonic fans can recall from the Laker series, the results of the
opener in a best-of-seven series are often indicative of little.
Or, in the lexicon of Gary Payton, ``It don't mean nothin'.''
</P>
<P>
   But this one meant something.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've watched Chicago, they're the champs,'' said Malone.
``This is the kind of game they usually win _ one or two points
down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle-Aged-Man festivals rarely are pretty, but they are the
events in which champions excel.

DODGERS WIN AMID RUMORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a long day for Bill Russell and a long
month for Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   For Russell, Wednesday began with him answering published
reports that he and executive vice president Fred Claire would be
fired at the end of the season. It ended with Karros driving in
five runs in a 7-4 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in front of
35,647 at Dodger Stadium that gave the manager his first win in
five games.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after the Randy Johnson trade was killed with
the Seattle Mariners, the Fox-owned New York Post said the
Fox-owned Dodgers would replace Russell and Claire with Florida
Marlins manager Jim Leyland and general manager Dave Dombrowski.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox's News Corp. the club's new owners, denied the
report, the Los Angeles Dodgers needed a victory to replace all the
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough to worry about without all this,'' Russell
said. ``Everybody knows we will be re-evaluated at the end of the
season. Right now we're just hoping to get everyone's focus back on
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, the Dodgers have designated former top pitcher
Hideo Nomo for assignment and told the Mariners they would not
trade Darren Dreifort for Johnson, one of baseball's top pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's game, Claire addressed the team to discuss the
Johnson trade talks, which were lengthy and distracting. Claire
also attempted to reaffirm with players that he is in charge of the
baseball operation. In the May 15 blockbuster trade with Florida,
Fox Television head Chase Carey was the point man in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Now this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get things settled down, so this is not
beneficial,'' Claire said. ``(New club president Bob Graziano)
talked to me after the story came out to tell me it was not true
and I know he also talked to Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The game seemed almost an afterthought but not to Karros, who
had a home run and three singles. He had just three RBI in May.
</P>
<P>
   For Karros, who returned to the cleanup spot he lost to Bobby
Bonilla after the May 15 blockbuster trade with Florida, it was his
first home run and RBI since May 19. He came to the plate five
times and had an RBI in each at-bat. He missed the first 22 games
of the season due to surgery to his left knee, which is still
tender.
</P>
<P>
   The home run came on the first pitch of the fifth inning against
Cardinals starter Mark Petkovsek (3-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be hitting in the fourth spot,'' said Karros, who
was moved from sixth to cleanup Tuesday. ``It's a place I like to
hit. It doesn't matter where I am in the order as long as I do my
job to drive in runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros' big night made a winner of Ramon Martinez (7-2), who now
has victories in seven of his past eight decisions. Martinez
pitched seven innings, allowing five hits and two runs with six
strikeouts and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers bullpen pitched the final two innings and continued
to struggle. Antonio Osuna allowed a two-run homer to Gary Gaetti
in the ninth, but Scott Radinsky, who blew two saves in his last
three appearances, got the final out for his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty, but it will give all of us a little chance
to breathe,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has been swirling since the team was sold in late
March that no one would be safe after Fox took over.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who turns 50 in October, is in the final season of a
two-year $700,000 contract. Claire, 62, was given a three-year
contract by former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley several months
before the sale was finalized. The future of both men with the club
is believed to hinge on the club's success this year. The Dodgers
have not won a postseason game since 1998. But Fox said Wednesday
there have been no talks about replacing anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no truth to this,'' said Fox spokesman Vince Wladika
``This is obvious speculation on the part of anyone who knows the
situation in Florida. It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyland, who last season led the Marlins to a World Series
championship then watched management dismantle the club in a
payroll purge, has a multiyear contract worth $1.5 million this
year. He can opt out of the contract after this season for
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife called me this morning and told me she heard this on
the Regis and Kathy (Lee) show,'' Leyland told the Miami Herald.
``I asked when this was supposed to happen and when was I going to
be informed. I've never talked to anybody. I don't want to talk to
anybody. It annoys me because it doesn't look good. It hurts my
feelings. I've got a job. I don't want another job. It's an insult
to another manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Leyland and Dombrowski are under contract, they cannot
be contacted by another club without violating baseball's tampering
laws.

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRM TO CONDUCT LARGE-SCALE TRIALS OF
AIDS  VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABIN RUSSELL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bankrolled by private investors, a Bay Area
biotechnology company will begin the world's first large-scale
trials of an AIDS vaccine this month.
</P>
<P>
   South San Francisco-based VaxGen Inc., headed by legendary AIDS
pioneer Dr. Donald Francis, said it has received clearance from the
Food and Drug Administration to test its AIDSVAX vaccine on 5,000
American volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to test its vaccine soon on 2,500
volunteers in Thailand. Results should come to light in two to four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wanting to see this happen for the last five years,
so I am delighted,'' said Dr. Marcus Conant, a prominent San
Francisco AIDS physician.
</P>
<P>
   Testing will begin in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia
and St. Louis, but not in New York and San Francisco _ centers of
the AIDS epidemic where skepticism of Francis' vaccine runs deep.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years after the emergence of AIDS, the planned test of
VaxGen's vaccine is generating cautious hope. But there is also
widespread skepticism that the immunizations will work.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many researchers are uncomfortable with the ethical
dilemma posed by the vaccine trials. One out of three volunteers
vaccinated will get a placebo, conferring absolutely no protection
against the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   The only way researchers will know that the vaccine is working
is if a percentage of the placebo group abandons safe sex practices
and becomes infected, while a comparable group of vaccinated
subjects also takes risks but remains virus-free.
</P>
<P>
   There is additional fear that the promise of a vaccine could
induce even some of the general population to cast aside sexual
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is evident that (current AIDS vaccines) have not yielded
antibodies that neutralize most natural strains of HIV,'' said Dr.
David Baltimore, chairman of the AIDS Vaccine Research Committee,
in a January article in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, backers of the vaccine see the decision to go
forward as an historic step in the battle against the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a watershed event in the AIDS crisis,'' said Dr. Seth
Berkley, president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a
New York organization advocating aggressive testing of AIDS
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it can cost more than $30 million to conduct such
a large clinical trial _ money the National Institutes of Health
was not willing to gamble on the VaxGen approach.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 potential AIDS vaccines have been tested in humans, but
until now none has inspired enough confidence to attempt the costly
large-scale trials needed to prove the vaccine works.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said he had no trouble, however, lining up private
investors willing to take a chance this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money hasn't been a problem,'' he said during a phone
interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The VaxGen vaccine is a genetically engineered protein almost
identical to one found on the surface of the AIDS virus. In theory,
the vaccine trains white blood cells to produce antibodies that
recognize and attack the same protein, killing the virus.
</P>
<P>
   An early version of the vaccine was safely tested on 1,200
humans. A new version, which is made from proteins found on two
different strains of the virus, has been tested on 120 humans, and
this is the one that will be used in the large-scale trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's driven us,'' said Francis, ``is the success we have had
in chimpanzees.'' Early versions of the vaccine protected chimps
that were deliberately infected with the AIDS virus. Human subjects
nevertheless have produced more protective antibodies after
vaccination than the chimps.
</P>
<P>
   But as scientists piece together the AIDS puzzle, there is a
mounting consensus that antibodies alone are not sufficient to stop
the virus. A second defense system, consisting of blood cells
programmed to kill other cells infected by the virus, may be
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonsense,'' counters Francis. ``We know this vaccine is
more than sufficient to induce protection.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first federal scientists to warn of the danger of
AIDS in the early 1980s, Francis has made his mark as a maverick
not afraid to speak his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Francis has earned an enviable track record in battling various
diseases including smallpox, the Ebola virus and Hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is only a matter of time before his vaccine is tested
in New York and San Francisco, and up to 40 clinics in North
America should be participating by the end of the year. San
Francisco AIDS doctor Conant said the tests will be valuable even
if the VaxGen vaccine proves a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how these trials come out, (they) will get very
important answers to basic questions,'' he said. ``The skepticism
that is out there is based on speculation, rather than
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the trial, subjects must be uninfected people at
high risk for AIDS because they have more than one sexual partner
within a year. Doctors will be required to reinforce the safe sex
message each time test subjects get one of four shots and receive
up to 14 follow-up evaluations over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the 2,500 Thai volunteers are drug addicts at high
risk for AIDS, who will be counseled on the dangers of sharing
needles. The participants will not be given the clean needles often
provided in Western countries, through programs like San
Francisco's needle exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said that failure to practice safe sex, whether in a
vaccine trial or not, is part of the cold reality of AIDS. ``If
people were following all the rules we made on safe activity, we
wouldn't need a vaccine,'' he said.

CRITICS BLAST CLINTON FOR RENEWING TRADE STATUS WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ President Clinton renewed China's favored nation
trade status Wednesday on the eve of the Tiananmen Square
massacre's ninth anniversary, provoking harsh criticism from
members of his own party who scolded him for ignoring human rights
abuses.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Another anniversary present for the regime,'' said Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., one of the fiercest adversaries of the
administration's China policy.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi called on Clinton to cancel plans to pay a ceremonial
visit to the plaza in the heart of Beijing during his trip to China
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an action by you, the leader of the free world, would
desecrate the memory of the brave individuals who lost their lives
fighting for democratic reforms,'' Pelosi wrote in an open letter
to the president that she circulated last night to other members of
Congress for their signatures.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she defended Clinton against Republican
accusations that the president compromised national security when
he approved a deal that gave Beijing access to sophisticated
satellite technology. The Republican complaints spring from
Clinton's decision to allow a Southern California company run by a
major Democratic Party donor to do business with the Chinese
government _ against the wishes of the Justice Department _ earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never pulled any punches regarding Clinton,'' she said
in an interview. ``But for the Republican leadership to ...
question the president's patriotism is so hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, who has opposed such deals based on China's record of
selling weapons to Pakistan and Iran, nonetheless rejected the
suggestion that a campaign contribution would have played a role in
the decision. She noted that GOP leaders have consistently
supported such deals in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were part of the decision every step of the way. They
have supported the Clinton policy year in and year out _ do they
think we have no memory?''
</P>
<P>
   Heated debate over U.S. policy toward China is expected all
month leading up to Clinton's nine-day trip starting June 25. He is
the first American president to visit China since the bloody 1989
Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has shown little willingness to confront the Chinese
government over human rights, trade or weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   At a Rose Garden ceremony with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Clinton cited the need for close relations with Beijing
amid an escalating nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan as
one reason not to erect trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to renew (trade relations) would be to sever our economic,
and to a large measure, our strategic relationship with China,
turning our back on a fourth of the world at a time when our
cooperation for world peace and security is especially important in
light of the recent event in south Asia,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will meet with leaders from five nuclear powers
Thursday in Geneva to discuss the escalating arms race between
India and Pakistan. Clinton said China's participation in the
Geneva meeting was evidence of ``constructive Chinese leadership''
that will be ``essential to the long-term resolution of issues
involving south Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual fight over China trade is expected to be more intense
than usual this year in light of the revelations surrounding the
satellite technology and investigations into illegal campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Clinton is required to notify Congress of his intention
to extend China's trade status 30 days before it expires July 3.
Congress has 60 days after the expiration to object to the
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the current circumstances make it a very (close)
vote,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., added his
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not reward the Chinese Communist government for its
continuing political repression and tyranny,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the prospects of Congress repealing the
president's decision _ and then overriding a likely veto _ appeared
doubtful. Three senior Republicans _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas and Rep. Philip Crane of
Illinois, wrote Clinton that China's trade benefits deserve
support.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate is certain to expose the deeply divided
sentiments in Washington over how to handle relations with the
world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual coalition of conservatives, including members of the
religious right such as Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council,
and liberals like Pelosi, are banding together to pressure Clinton
into standing up to his Chinese hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi mocked Clinton's assertion that China is needed to
resolve the arms race in south Asia, noting that ``China has
provided Pakistan with technology critical to its development and
recent testing of nuclear weapons. Without that assistance,
Pakistan would not have had such a developed nuclear weapons
program.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter addressed to Clinton distributed to her colleagues
Wednesday, Pelosi urged the president while in China to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Call for the unconditional release of a significant number of
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   -- Encourage a meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama, the
spiritual leader of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   -- Encourage the Chinese to allow workers to form free trade
unions.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, she expressed disbelief at Clinton's assertion
that China is taking significant steps toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of state of denial is he in?'' she asked. &QL;

QUARTER OF AIDS PATIENTS NOT GETTING BEST THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the availability of new AIDS drug combinations that are
saving thousands of lives, at least one-quarter of HIV-infected
patients are not being given the most effective therapy by their
doctors, a national survey shows.
</P>
<P>
   And it is women and minorities who are faring the worst _ a fact
that may well contribute to their notably higher death rates,
doctors warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, the nation's leading AIDS physicians,
working with the Department of Health and Human Services, published
guidelines urgently recommending that all doctors prescribe a
three-way combination of new and old drugs when they begin treating
AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   But those guidelines are not being followed everywhere, the
survey disclosed. And doctors with the least experience in battling
the epidemic are the most likely to wait too long to begin therapy,
and then to use only one or two of the older drugs while ignoring
the new triple combinations, according to the first national survey
of AIDS treatment practices.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the study were reported in Washington Wednesday by
Dr. Paul Volberding, director of the University of California at
San Francisco's AIDS program at San Francisco General Hospital, and
Dr. John G. Bartlett, chief of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore. The survey was conducted by Louis Harris &AMP;
Associates, the nationwide polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   Volberding and Bartlett are pioneers in assessing the effects of
innovative AIDS therapies. They were members of the team that
originally called for AIDS treatment to begin with a combination of
one of the new compounds called protease inhibitors plus two of
several older drugs like the familiar AZT. Both classes of
compounds prevent HIV, the AIDS virus, from replicating after it
has invaded crucial cells of the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Using only a single drug to attack the virus, Bartlett warned,
makes patients more likely to develop dangerous AIDS-related
symptoms and also exposes them to resistance against the effects of
the medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that physicians who receive new information and
education on an ongoing basis are more likely to adopt and apply
the treatment guidelines,'' said Volberding in a statement.
``Likewise, patients who are familiar with the health benefits of
new treatments will more likely seek and receive the most
aggressive care.''
</P>
<P>
   After the new protease inhibitor drugs became available in 1996
and their combination with older drugs became standard treatment in
the hands of knowledgeable doctors, death rates from AIDS began to
drop dramatically. Among white patients the death rate dropped by
33 percent in 1996, but among women with AIDS the decline was only
13 percent and among people of color AIDS deaths decreased by 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
   To Volberding, the national survey's results provided
``troubling information about the obstacles to treatment that women
and minorities face.'' For example, he said, ``many of the more
experienced physicians are not always easily accessible to this
growing segment of the population most affected by HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings are ``worse than we thought,'' said Dr. Scott Hitt,
chairman of the President's Advisory Committee on AIDS. ``We've got
to do better at educating physicians and also educating patients
about seeing specialists.''

 &HT;    (For release Sunday, June 7, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say that if you can remember the day you quit smoking,
you're still a candidate to resume. I quit so many years ago that I
forgot when, which is a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a search through some old articles I had written, I
came across the one that announced my separation from smoking. It
was written in June 1983, so it means I quit 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't accidental that I was looking for that column. I was
trying to find it to see how much cigarettes cost when I quit
because I wanted to make a point about it.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who still smokes -- ``Just two or three a day,'' she
unwisely rationalizes -- had asked me to pick up a pack of
cigarettes for her the other day. It was the first pack I had
purchased since I quit.
</P>
<P>
   When the clerk asked $2.55 of me, I was astonished. When I quit
my pack-a-day habit, cigarettes cost half that much. Had the price
held all the years of my abstinence, I figure I have saved more
than $7,000. (And, likely, my life, since I had been puffing away
since I was about 14 years old _ when a pack sold for 17 cents.)
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of cigarettes, abetted by so-called sin taxes, has
risen considerably so I must have saved in excess of $10,000. (I
think I spent it all on a trip to Europe last summer.)
</P>
<P>
   Between medical reports, lawsuits and even more sin taxes, the
cigarette industry has been under siege and, not surprisingly, has
developed a siege mentality. Despite the discovery of secret
methodology to trap youths into smoking, and other nefarious
methods to promote their industry, the cigarette people appear to
lack remorse for what they have inflicted upon this nation.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of heaping huge additional taxes onto cigarette sales
is to dissuade people from buying cigarettes. If you can't convince
them they are under medical risk in buying and smoking cigarettes,
then drive them away from them economically. Make cigarettes too
costly to buy.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the best idea because a kid wanting to smoke is going
to find a way to get that money, but it is a venture in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette industry, already riled by truth, is striking
back, purchasing ads that contend the government spends its tax
income unwisely, and thus we should oppose the new cigarette taxes
because it's just going to fill a bunch of pork barrels somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to that, the cigarette people are lobbying us that
impairing the cigarette industry is going to put a lot of good
people out of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the coca-growing nations of South America have used that
approach as well. Their logic: if the coca industry is wiped out,
lots of South American farmers are going to be hungry.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the same could be said of the people who worked for the
Nazi war machine. They would have stopped invading countries and
slaughtering people but it would have put a lot of good Nazis out
of work.
</P>
<P>
   My role in life is to not be a missionary against smoking; to
each his own. But keep it out of my face because I learned my
lesson 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What worries me, and gets me to writing about the subject, is
the way the lobby representing Big Tobacco is trying to defend
itself by attacking government in a clever campaign that is certain
to impress some very naive Americans, a component of this
population which, unfortunately, is quite numerous.
</P>
<P>
   If all the tax money garnered from cigarette sales went to
cancer research _ and why don't they do that? _ the tobacco people
still would find some other approach to blow smoke in your face.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Swiss must account for Nazi gold
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nazi gold, more than 50 years after World War II and the
Holocaust ended, remains molten. It burns the conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reports that a pending U.S. government report
will show that some $300 million in looted gold _ $2.6 billion in
today's money _ was washed through Swiss banks and was used to buy
critical war materiel from such other neutrals as Turkey, Spain,
Sweden and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the gold was looted from the central banks of conquered
nations. Much was stolen from Jews _ personal effects, wedding
rings, even gold fillings mined from the teeth of Holocaust
cadavers. More than $40 million in current dollars from Jewish
victims was desposited in just one account. The account is believed
to represent only a fraction of the thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Most neutrals have fulfilled to some degree their postwar
obligation to repay looted gold. Sweden, which had an
understandable case for defensive neutrality, was unhesitating. The
Swiss still balk, although Switzerland's own study commission says
the Swiss National Bank knowingly accepted billions in stolen Nazi
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss culpability is no longer at serious issue. Swiss honor and
justice very much are.
</P>
<P>
   A financial accounting is the necessary means to a moral
accounting. The commerce the Swiss so agreeably serviced, and
profited from so richly, prolonged the war and the Holocaust.
Germany was able, for instance, to buy from Spain and Portugal
virtually all of the minerals it needed to produce machine tools
and armaments _ especially, the U.S. report says, armor-piercing
shells.
</P>
<P>
   It is futile to try to calculate by how much the war was
lengthened, but even if it was for only a few hours _ and it was
surely for very much longer than that _ thousands died in the
delay. More, the gold let the Nazis set aside resources for their
death camps and still fund the military. Fungibility for the
business of extermination.
</P>
<P>
   If the Swiss and other benefiting neutrals did not know at the
time all the horrors of the war, nor exactly the extent of the
Holocaust, they did know these things, for they were univerally
known: Nazi Germany was devasting unoffending nations, it was
working slave laborers to death and it was rounding up Jews with an
anti-Semitic fervor that could promise nothing better than a
wretched end, whatever that might be.
</P>
<P>
   Those would seem to be reasons enough _ wouldn't they? _ to
manage neutrality, not as a career opportunity, but with a
reluctance informed by revulsion. Instead, more often the Nazi gold
bought not just goods but souls.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it seems now that all this was a long time ago, but history
will be eternally downwind from the Holocaust and the other horrors
of that war, and the moral debris does not lessen but grows as
recent scholarship teaches us how often the Nazis backed off from
the righteous few who stood against the demands of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In its time, Nazi gold tempted and persuaded. But history has
been, if you will, a kind of counter-alchemist. It has turned Nazi
gold into dross and has left the taint of base metal on the hands
it passed through.

<TEXT>
<P>
   1. JAMAICA'S SOCCER MIRACLE: THE LITTLE ISLAND THAT ROARED Until
only three years ago, soccer was barely known in Jamaica, played
mainly on dirt roads and gravel-covered squares in the poor
island's slums. Then came ``The Miracle.'' Rene Simoes, a Brazilian
coach with only a mixed record of success, took over the national
team. He scoured the island for talent, turned a grab-bag of
skilled but undisciplined players into a united team, and imbued
the entire island with a new spirit of optimism and belief in
itself. When Jamaica qualified for this summer's World Cup, it
became the least populous country to do so since World War II. From
Der Spiegel. 1,000 words. (English translation available.)

DON'T REPEAT BOSNIA, PRESS ON MILOSEVIC There are some eerie
similarities in the way Europe and the U.S. are reacting to
hostilities in Kosovo and the way they dithered as Bosnia was left
to stumble into a long, ferocious war. If NATO wants to avoid
repeating the tragic Bosnia story, members should do what they can
to help the new Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic send Slobodan
Milosevic packing. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

HIGH-TECH GHOST SHIP : AN UNMANNED BOAT PREPARES
</P>
<P>
   TO SAIL ITSELF AROUND THE WORLD A German-built sailboat is about
to set off on a remarkable voyage. Its planned route around the
world is daring enough. What is new, however, is that the ``crew''
will remain behind in Germany. The ``Relationship,'' designed by
eight professors, will be controlled by a computer that will raise
and lower sails, turn the rudder, and set its own course. Back in
Germany, ``mission control'' will keep an eye on things, thanks to
onboard video cameras and a satellite hookup, and interfere only in
case of emergency. The magnificent experiment begins with a
stopover at the World's Fair in Lisbon. Der Spiegel. 800 words.
(English translation available.) 6. DEMOCRACY : IS IT FOR EVERYONE?
The prestigious Council on Foreign Relations is offering this
important commentary on late 20th-century democracy as part of our
monthly World Leaders Forum. It is also available as a ``separate
buy.'' By Samuel P. Huntington. Council on Foreign Relations. 1,800

   THREE GORGES DAM, China _ Here are some key facts about the dam
for purposes of making maps and graphics. In addition, several
diagrams of the dam itself are available for faxing:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Excavation: 102.6 million cubic meters of earth and stone (134
million cubic yards).
</P>
<P>
   - Concrete: 27.2 million cubic meters (35.5 million cubic
yards).
</P>
<P>
   - Steel reinforcing bars: 354,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   - Dam height: 185 meters (607 feet).
</P>
<P>
   - Dam length: 2,309 meters (1.4 miles) divided into three parts.
In the center will be a 484-meter spillway section with 23 bottom
outlets and 22 sluice gates. On the left and right of the spillway
will be two giant power stations (see below).
</P>
<P>
   - Timing: Phase 1 began in 1994 and ended in 1997 with the
initial diversion of the Yangtze River. Phase 2 began in 1998 and
is due to end in 2003 when the water level rises to 156 meters (511
feet) and the dam starts generating electricity. Phase 3 should end
in 2009 when the water level reaches 175 meters (574 feet) and full
power generation begins.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DOWNSIDE CONSEQUENCES: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Water pollution in the dammed Yangtze will double _ at least _
as the dam traps more than 50 types of pollutants from mines,
factories and human settlements that were formerly flushed out to
sea by the swift Yangtze currents.
</P>
<P>
   - About 1,300 archaeological sites will be moved or flooded.
</P>
<P>
   - Critics contend that the heavy silt in the river will form
thick deposits near the upstream end of the dam, clogging the major
river channels of the city of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
   - Facing Inundation: 632 square kilometers (244 square miles),
19 cities, 326 villages, including 27,000 hectares (66,700 acres)
of farms and orchards.
</P>
<P>
   - Facing resettlement: 1.1 million to 1.9 million people.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FUTURE RESERVOIR: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Average width: 1.1 kilometers (0.7 miles).
</P>
<P>
   - Length: 600 kilometers (370 miles).
</P>
<P>
   - Storage: 39.3 billion cubic meters of water (51.4 billion
cubic yards).
</P>
<P>
   - Water level: elevated 175 meters (574 feet) above Yangtze
River surface.
</P>
<P>
   - Runoff: 451 billion cubic meters (589 billion cubic yards) of
Yangtze River water will flow into the reservoir annually.
</P>
<P>
   - Silt: The muddy Yangtze will discharge 530 million tons of
silt into the reservoir in a typical year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ELECTRICITY: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Machinery: The two power stations flanking the dam's central
spillway will operate 26 of the world's largest turbine generators,
700 megawatts each.
</P>
<P>
   - Capacity: Total generating capacity will be 18,200 megawatts,
or as much as big 18 nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
   - Transmission: Fifteen 500,000-volt transmission lines will
send electricity to Shanghai and elsewhere throughout East China,
Central China and eastern Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
   - Output: 84.7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually,
equivalent to burning 40 million tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SHIPPING: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Ship lock will consist of five locks, each 280 meters (918
feet) long and 35 meters (114 feet) wide, with a water depth of 5
meters (16.4 feet). Supposed to handle 10,000 ton barges.
</P>
<P>
   - Ship lift will be a one-stage vertical lift capable of
carrying a 3,000-ton passenger or cargo vessel.
</P>
<P>
   - River shipping through central Yangtze estimated to increase
from 10 million to 50 million tons annually, with transportation
costs cut by 30-37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FLOOD CONTROL: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Dam sponsors say the reservoir's 22.1 billion cubic meter
(28.9 billion cubic yards) flood control storage capacity should
lessen the frequency of big downstream floods from once every 10
years to once every 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RANKINGS OF WORLD'S TEN LARGEST HYDROELECTRIC PROJECTS &LR;
</P>

   BADONG, China _ In their spick-and-span, open-front shop, a
patient Chinese couple sat on a humid afternoon waiting for their
future to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Their one-room storefront was new, brimming with sundries from
shampoo to socks. Their street was new. Their five-story building
perched on the hillside was new. In fact, the entire block of
mostly vacant shops and apartments was entertaining the finishing
touches of construction.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Li Damin and his wife was that no cars travelled
the street, no people strolled past to eye their wares.
</P>
<P>
   Few others had moved in yet from the old town's shabby
riverfront that in five years will disappear under muddy water,
once the Three Gorges Dam bottles up the mighty Yangtze River and
turns 370 miles of churning energy into a calm reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the first stage of resettlement,'' Li, 45, placidly
acknowledged. By the time the next stage is finished in four years,
the couple should have plenty of customers in the new city,
assuming they can pay the monthly $43 rent that long.
</P>
<P>
   For now they are isolated here, their lifeline to the old town a
pocked and muddy road winding across steep hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   The new heights of Badong are China's resettlement at its best,
where the government brings visitors to sample its handling of
perhaps the most controversial facet of the immense dam project
that will uproot between 1.1 million and 1.9 million Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
   When the dam is finished in 2003, the Yangtze waters will begin
a climb of 175 meters _ nearly 575 feet _ inundating 66,700 acres
of farms and orchards, 657 factories and mines, 19 cities and 326
villages.
</P>
<P>
   The government promises that change spurred by the dam will
create a fresh new life, most importantly a life safe from floods
for 15 million people downstream, but also one flourishing with new
economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The construction of the dam has brought a rare opportunity for
the opening of the region, for the changing of thoughts and
liberation of minds,'' said Chen Gong, an earnest, 34-year-old
economic development official interviewed in the Hubei Province
capital of Wuhan, a two-day float downstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have realized the aim of being able to remove, to resettle
and to become rich,'' he said, describing the early resettlement as
going perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposing side, critics in China and abroad warn the
process is becoming a sociological nightmare in which funds are
squandered, resettlements botched and families ruthlessly cut from
generational moorings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Official statements give the impression that resettlement is
proceeding smoothly, but in reality it has been plagued by
mismanagement, official corruption, inadequate compensation, a
shortage of farmland and lack of jobs for the resettlers,'' said a
Chinese sociologist who wrote under the pseudonym Wu Ming
(``nameless''), in a study this spring for the U.S.-based groups
International Rivers Network and Human Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese river people have nice things to say about this
project the government so strongly endorses, but some signs of
unrest have appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service interviews found feelings running strong in
Fengdu, population 40,000, where residents confided that agitated
workers recently took to the streets in protest. Their food
processing factory was sold, probably for scrap, and they received
no compensation to tide them over till finding jobs in the new town
being built on a higher bank across the river.
</P>
<P>
   It is troubling to imagine everything underwater in the lively
little city full of stores and homes, its streets crowded with
shoppers and vendors carrying loads of vegetables on shoulder poles
or hawking smoked pork bellies from corner stands. The
flower-filled park and shrine to Tianzi, known as King of the Dead,
will be lost with the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Even an official guide was unexpectedly candid about emotions in
Fengdu, as she led cruise ship tourists through the ancient city's
sites last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older people don't want to leave. It's also hard for the
people aged 40 or 50,'' said Zheng Manman, 22. ``Younger people
don't mind because the city will be bigger. There will be new
opportunities for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged workers, as throughout China, already are losing
jobs as economic reform shuts down old, inefficient enterprises,
she said. But in these low-lying waterfront towns every single old
factory will be closed. Resettlement plans envision modern industry
and business for which these mountain people lack skills.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng personally is stymied at how to save the 30,000 yuan, more
than $3,700, she said she will need within five years for the new
apartment she must buy in the new city.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she earned a monthly salary as high as 600 yuan _ a lot
in a Chinese country town _ her entire earnings in five years would
come to only 36,000 yuan, or about $4,460. The government would
sell her the apartment well below its construction cost. Even so,
buying it would leave Zheng with only $760 to support herself for
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   In Badong, the merchant Li borrowed from a bank, from friends
and from family to purchase the couple's 30,000-yuan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow they will have to pay that back. But they live in a
bigger, nicer space now. And they are better off than Xiong
Changlin, who was down on the waterfront wielding sizzling pans in
his grime-covered cafe on a recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   Xiong, 41, said he will be glad enough to move with the second
wave of resettlers, though he doesn't know exactly how he will live
in the sparkling new hilltop town. He doesn't have a shop or cafe,
or any job at all up there.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't comment any further on the dam and resettling
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some ideas of my own,'' he said cryptically, ``but
since it's the project of the state, I have to support it.''

<P>
   THREE GORGES DAM, China _ Every day 18,000 Chinese mobilize to
build the most powerful _ and most disparaged _ hydro-electric dam
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Each day they crunch more rocks, dig deeper pits, pour more and
more concrete for the edifice that within five years will stretch
1.4 miles across the Yangtze River and create a mammoth reservoir
370 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   With swells of national pride, some Chinese call this dam the
modern Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not a place that politically cautious visitors like
President Clinton _ soon due to spend nine days in China _ will
come and admire as a new national icon. For the dam is suffused in
controversy as thick as the river mists that enfold construction
cranes angling high over the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
   These workers and thousands more still to come will reconfigure
not just this site, but will flood the mystically beautiful Three
Gorges canyons that have inspired Chinese poets for centuries. And
they will trigger the eviction of more than one million Chinese who
fish and farm and trade along the river that carries their
livelihood and sometimes their destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is still a poor country,'' Lu Youmei, general manager of
the China Three Gorges Project Corp., told Cox News Service
recently. ``To catch up to modern conditions in developed
countries, we may need half a century or even a century. The
Chinese have many things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu is convinced the state-constructed hydroelectric dam will
boost China in its run toward modernity, producing electric power
equivalent to the output of 18 nuclear plants, diminishing the
deadly threat of floods and making navigation more cheap, reliable
and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 generating units at this single site will have an
installed
</P>
<P>
   capacity of 18,200 megawatts, fully half the production
capability of the
</P>
<P>
   entire, multi-state Southern Company, the largest producer of
electricity
</P>
<P>
   in America.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to this central Yangtze region shows that Western
opponents who think they still can stop the Three Gorges Dam _
warning of environmental devastation and social dislocation _ had
better think again.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Chinese peasants and villagers already have
been relocated, as new towns rise on riverbank heights to replace
the low-lying buildings exploded into rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Early stages of the dam itself are an imposing physical
presence.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, Lu's corporation has spent $3.7 billion,
harnessed the Yangtze into a channel to drain a river bed building
site, planted one stout end of the dam and blasted a massive
stair-stepped pit into the reddish-brown earth where shipping locks
will carry multi-ton vessels past the dam.
</P>
<P>
   A new high-speed road and new airport funnel supplies and people
here, new apartment buildings shelter the workers, and a new
Chinese-British joint venture every year produces 6 million
chickens, 60,000 pigs, and eggs from 200,000 hens to feed them.
</P>
<P>
   The dam is all but a fact. Yet fateful uncertainties remain:
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the dam actually end horrific Yangtze floods such as the
three major deluges that killed more than 300,000 people in this
century?
</P>
<P>
   -- Will a tangle of environmental complications result, such as
choking siltation that some predict will clog the very ports this
project is supposed to enhance? And will heavy upstream pollution
concentrate even further into a reservoir of bile as the dam
reduces river flow?
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the 1.1 million to 1.9 million people being resettled
end up with better housing and work opportunities, as the
government promises? Or will Three Gorges follow the pattern of
earlier Chinese dam projects, in which peasants were uprooted with
marginal help and resettlement funds got squandered?
</P>
<P>
   -- Does the dam itself carry the threat of deluge, either as a
wartime target or as result of earthquake or construction fault?
</P>
<P>
   They add up to the overall question of whether the dam, power
plant and resettlement, now carrying a $25 billion official price
tag by completion of Phase 3 in 2009, will be worth the many
dimensions of cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be stopped. The project is merely political,
masquerading as a development project,'' said Owen Lammers,
executive director of the International Rivers Network, a San
Francisco-based coalition of environmental groups. ``If the Three
Gorges project is implemented, it will only reinforce the hardline
elements of the government, reinforce the power of state-owned
enterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecologists propose a series of smaller dams that would be
gentler to the environment and to the people while also
contributing long-needed flood control and electric power.
</P>
<P>
   The dam opponents say dissent within China has been stifled on
this issue, as on other political questions, so pressure must be
built from outside the country. With China still short of funds to
complete the dam, opponents think the most effective pressure point
is the international financial community.
</P>
<P>
   Rumblings of dissatisfaction sound faintly in the countryside
areas directly affected by the dam. Negative reports from
hydrologists or archaeologists determined to state their case were
considered, then in most cases filed away or publicly refuted.
</P>
<P>
   Whether repelled by the controversy or mistakenly thinking the
dam already has diminished the river's scenic views, only half as
many tourists visited Three Gorges this year as came at this point
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What has long been one of China's most spectacular attractions
will not be altered until Phase 2 of the dam is finished in the
year 2003. Then the rising waters will form a narrow reservoir
through the Three Gorges and beyond, ultimately reaching a water
level 175 meters _ about 575 feet _ higher than at present.
</P>
<P>
   The reservoir will bury not only towns and orchards, but also
Chinese artifacts thousands of years old _ ancient barge haulers'
tow paths, hanging coffins and mysterious rock engravings _ and it
will cut by a third or more the majestic height of sheer-sloped
gorges that today dwarf river travelers in misty drama.
</P>
<P>
   Yet officials like Lu sound confident of reaching all the worthy
goals listed in their brochures and headquarters signboards. At the
same time, they dismiss critics as simply being wrong, either
through naivete or intent to try to sabotage an important Chinese
project.
</P>
<P>
   And the Three Gorges Dam is almost exclusively a Chinese work.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because some financial institutions heeded the
campaign that Western environmental groups mounted against the dam
by calling it an ecological and social time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Export-Import Bank for example, opposed the dam in
1996, based on strong recommendations against the project from the
U.S. National Security Council. It asked the Chinese to bring plans
up to acceptable environmental standards before it would consider
financing any projects related to the dam, but never received a
response, said Linda Formella, a spokeswoman at the bank's
headquarters in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign banks have been more friendly, such as the
Canadians who issued export credits on behalf of General
Electric-Canada, or the Germans who are helping finance Siemens
generators for the power plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the few Americans who have grabbed a piece of Three Gorges
project _ including Caterpillar with a $30 million contract for
construction equipment and Rotec Industries winning $30 million for
concrete conveyor systems _ are supplying mostly hardware.
</P>
<P>
   An noticeably disappointed senior project manager Alfred Roider
of the giant German construction firm Philip Holzmann lamented that
the project was so ``political'' that the Chinese shut out
foreigners from engineering and building contracts.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to assess whether the Chinese did not want to be
hamstrung by potential foreign demands for stronger environmental
and social protections, or whether the Three Gorges Dam simply is
too important to national pride to let outsiders take credit for
building it.
</P>
<P>
   The notion has kicked around since one of China's first
revolutionary leaders, Sun Yat Sen, first proposed a dam in the
gorges in 1919. But war or revolution or politics always
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Now if the dam's major aims are fulfilled _ the erratic and
powerful Yantgze waters are brought under control, a clean new
source of electric power opens more of China to modernization and
development, and river cargo transport is expanded and made more
affordable _ those huge achievements will help propel what in many
ways is a Third World country into the 21st century circle of
wealthy nations.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the case assuming other consequences of the massive
dam are tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Environmental aftermath is among the most troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese journalist and engineer Dai Qing published a book of
stinging critiques of the dam written by Chinese scientists, then
spent ten months in prison for it after the 1989 Tiananmen Square
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   She warns that little progress has been made in treating waste
water flowing freely into the Yangtze from cities and from big and
little industries that line the river banks. Even more polluting
factories have been allowed to locate in the new areas, she said.

   Three Gorges Dam defenders say they will prevent the reservoir
from becoming a catchment of lethal filth. Since the dam project
was approved in 1992, however, they have done little except tell
ships to stop dumping waste and sewage in the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making local laws now for environmental protection of
the reservoir,'' assured Chen Gong, a development official in
Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province which includes the dam. ``The
regulations will come out very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The China sturgeon and three other species of Yangtze fish
already are endangered, and dam-influenced changes to their habitat
are unpredictable. Other experts worry about endangered Siberian
cranes and Swan Geese that winter downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Worries also remain about the impact of cramming at least
another 1.1 million people onto already heavily populated forest
and farmland at higher elevation, much of it more sharply sloped
than the fertile riverside banks that will be inundated.
</P>
<P>
   For China, the issues boil down to tradeoffs on a scale that the
rest of the world has seldom faced except in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Lu, the general manager of the Three Gorges corporation, cited
hydroelectric power as the cleanest, safest way to generate
electricity, without radiation hazards of nuclear plants or the air
pollution of coal and oil generation. It does require reservoir
inundation, whose consequences he believes not only can be
controlled, but are far outweighed by gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, with completion of the project we are going to
contribute a great deal to protecting the property and life of 15
million people living in downstream areas,'' he said. ``The threat
of flood will be remote. People can develop the economy that will
lead to a better life in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``And second, it will generate enormous power which will
contribute to Central China, eastern China, Sichuan Province, to
the areas in all the Yangtze River. The power is cheap and is
clean. People will benefit from that.''

<P>
   THREE GORGES DAM, China _ Every day 18,000 Chinese mobilize to
build the most powerful _ and most disparaged _ hydro-electric dam
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Each day they crunch more rocks, dig deeper pits, pour more and
more concrete for the edifice that within five years will stretch
1.4 miles across the Yangtze River and create a mammoth reservoir
370 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   With swells of national pride, some Chinese call this dam the
modern Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not a place that politically cautious visitors like
President Clinton _ soon due to spend nine days in China _ will
come and admire as a new national icon. For the dam is suffused in
controversy as thick as the river mists that enfold construction
cranes angling high over the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
   These workers and thousands more still to come will reconfigure
not just this site, but will flood the mystically beautiful Three
Gorges canyons that have inspired Chinese poets for centuries. And
they will trigger the eviction of more than one million Chinese who
fish and farm and trade along the river that carries their
livelihood and sometimes their destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is still a poor country,'' Lu Youmei, general manager of
the China Three Gorges Project Corp., told Cox News Service
recently. ``To catch up to modern conditions in developed
countries, we may need half a century or even a century. The
Chinese have many things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu is convinced the state-constructed hydroelectric dam will
boost China in its run toward modernity, producing electric power
equivalent to the output of 18 nuclear plants, diminishing the
deadly threat of floods and making navigation more cheap, reliable
and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 generating units at this single site will have an
installed
</P>
<P>
   capacity of 18,200 megawatts, fully half the production
capability of the
</P>
<P>
   entire, multi-state Southern Company, the largest producer of
electricity
</P>
<P>
   in America.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to this central Yangtze region shows that Western
opponents who think they still can stop the Three Gorges Dam _
warning of environmental devastation and social dislocation _ had
better think again.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Chinese peasants and villagers already have
been relocated, as new towns rise on riverbank heights to replace
the low-lying buildings exploded into rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Early stages of the dam itself are an imposing physical
presence.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, Lu's corporation has spent $3.7 billion,
harnessed the Yangtze into a channel to drain a river bed building
site, planted one stout end of the dam and blasted a massive
stair-stepped pit into the reddish-brown earth where shipping locks
will carry multi-ton vessels past the dam.
</P>
<P>
   A new high-speed road and new airport funnel supplies and people
here, new apartment buildings shelter the workers, and a new
Chinese-British joint venture every year produces 6 million
chickens, 60,000 pigs, and eggs from 200,000 hens to feed them.
</P>
<P>
   The dam is all but a fact. Yet fateful uncertainties remain:
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the dam actually end horrific Yangtze floods such as the
three major deluges that killed more than 300,000 people in this
century?
</P>
<P>
   -- Will a tangle of environmental complications result, such as
choking siltation that some predict will clog the very ports this
project is supposed to enhance? And will heavy upstream pollution
concentrate even further into a reservoir of bile as the dam
reduces river flow?
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the 1.1 million to 1.9 million people being resettled
end up with better housing and work opportunities, as the
government promises? Or will Three Gorges follow the pattern of
earlier Chinese dam projects, in which peasants were uprooted with
marginal help and resettlement funds got squandered?
</P>
<P>
   -- Does the dam itself carry the threat of deluge, either as a
wartime target or as result of earthquake or construction fault?
</P>
<P>
   They add up to the overall question of whether the dam, power
plant and resettlement, now carrying a $25 billion official price
tag by completion of Phase 3 in 2009, will be worth the many
dimensions of cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be stopped. The project is merely political,
masquerading as a development project,'' said Owen Lammers,
executive director of the International Rivers Network, a San
Francisco-based coalition of environmental groups. ``If the Three
Gorges project is implemented, it will only reinforce the hardline
elements of the government, reinforce the power of state-owned
enterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecologists propose a series of smaller dams that would be
gentler to the environment and to the people while also
contributing long-needed flood control and electric power.
</P>
<P>
   The dam opponents say dissent within China has been stifled on
this issue, as on other political questions, so pressure must be
built from outside the country. With China still short of funds to
complete the dam, opponents think the most effective pressure point
is the international financial community.
</P>
<P>
   Rumblings of dissatisfaction sound faintly in the countryside
areas directly affected by the dam. Negative reports from
hydrologists or archaeologists determined to state their case were
considered, then in most cases filed away or publicly refuted.
</P>
<P>
   Whether repelled by the controversy or mistakenly thinking the
dam already has diminished the river's scenic views, only half as
many tourists visited Three Gorges this year as came at this point
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What has long been one of China's most spectacular attractions
will not be altered until Phase 2 of the dam is finished in the
year 2003. Then the rising waters will form a narrow reservoir
through the Three Gorges and beyond, ultimately reaching a water
level 175 meters _ about 575 feet _ higher than at present.
</P>
<P>
   The reservoir will bury not only towns and orchards, but also
Chinese artifacts thousands of years old _ ancient barge haulers'
tow paths, hanging coffins and mysterious rock engravings _ and it
will cut by a third or more the majestic height of sheer-sloped
gorges that today dwarf river travelers in misty drama.
</P>
<P>
   Yet officials like Lu sound confident of reaching all the worthy
goals listed in their brochures and headquarters signboards. At the
same time, they dismiss critics as simply being wrong, either
through naivete or intent to try to sabotage an important Chinese
project.
</P>
<P>
   And the Three Gorges Dam is almost exclusively a Chinese work.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because some financial institutions heeded the
campaign that Western environmental groups mounted against the dam
by calling it an ecological and social time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Export-Import Bank for example, opposed the dam in
1996, based on strong recommendations against the project from the
U.S. National Security Council. It asked the Chinese to bring plans
up to acceptable environmental standards before it would consider
financing any projects related to the dam, but never received a
response, said Linda Formella, a spokeswoman at the bank's
headquarters in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign banks have been more friendly, such as the
Canadians who issued export credits on behalf of General
Electric-Canada, or the Germans who are helping finance Siemens
generators for the power plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the few Americans who have grabbed a piece of Three Gorges
project _ including Caterpillar with a $30 million contract for
construction equipment and Rotec Industries winning $30 million for
concrete conveyor systems _ are supplying mostly hardware.

   KRASNOYARSK, Russia _ A local beverage company in the heart of
Siberia may have lost its senses, but not its sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging the production and marketing might of Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola Co. in this remote part Russia, the firm named its brand
Crazy Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it is a joke to go against Coca-Cola. So we
called ours `Crazy Cola' in order to laugh at ourselves,'' said
Yevgenia Kuznetsova, president of Pikra, a Siberian beer and
soft-drinks manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Even crazier, she added, Crazy Cola is showing a slight profit
18 months after it was introduced, finding a small niche in a
domestic market increasingly keen to buy Russian-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's thirst for domination of the international
soft-drink market extends even to this desolate part of the world.
A new, $40 million Coca-Cola bottling plant, one of four opened in
Russia last year, stands at the edge of Krasnoyarsk, a regional
capital in Siberia, more than 2,000 miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   According to company figures, Pikra soft drinks _ including
Crazy Cola, lemonade, mineral water and other products _ held a 58
percent share of the market in Siberia in 1997 compared with 23
percent for Pepsi and 18 percent for Coca-Cola. The company did not
disclose how the colas compare in head-to-head sales.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to cite specific market data, Coca-Cola officials
acknowledge that they sold little of their product in Krasnoyarsk
before opening their local bottling facility, one of two in vast,
sparsely populated Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   In just a year, all that has changed, they said. ``In Siberia,
we are now Number One,'' claimed Coca-Cola spokesman Alexander
Chernov in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was long dominated by Pepsi-Cola, which cut a rare deal
with Soviet officials during the Cold War and gained a lock on the
massive market in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola entered Russia a decade later and, after the collapse
of the Soviet Union, became the most popular soft-drink throughout
Russia. It now has 12 bottling plants across Russia and claims a
more than 2-1 lead over nearest rival, Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pikra, a state-run beer producer in Soviet times and
now a private company, slipped into a corner of this battlefield
with the launch of Crazy Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Crazy Cola all face some discouraging facts
about doing business in deepest Russia, however.
</P>
<P>
   At least six months of the year in Siberia, one of the chief
distribution problems is getting the cola to market before it
freezes solid.
</P>
<P>
   And, added Kuznetsova: ``Remember in this territory there are
more trees than people. And trees don't drink cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Pikra was until 1995 the local bottler for Pepsi. The
partnership was mutually terminated in the face of Coca-Cola's
growing share of the Russian market and Pikra's desire to branch
out into soft-drink production.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the need to give Coke a distinctly Russian
signature, Coca-Cola earlier this year introduced its first
television advertisements specifically for Russians, breaking with
the tradition of importing American TV ads to its international
markets. The series of 60-second commercials adapted a traditional
Russian fairy tale into a modern-day love story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has past when Russians would seek out and buy
anything with foreign labels. Now, Russians tend to buy Russian
products and things with a Russian flavor,'' said Kuznetsova.
</P>
<P>
   There is yet another local entry in the cola wars. A widely
popular soccer club in Moscow, Spartak, announced last week that it
would begin marketing its own cola.
</P>
<P>
   American and other Western producers are increasingly sensitive
to a potential backlash in the Russian market. American candy giant
Mars Inc. found itself the target of communist and nationalist
politicians who denounced the ``invasion'' by Western popular
culture following a TV ad blitz for their popular Snickers candy
bars.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Coca-Cola plans a public-relations blitz of its own to
publicize a newly signed deal with the city of Moscow: Coke will be
the exclusive cola of Moscow's famous Gorky Park.
</P>
<P>
   In Siberia, Kuznetsova suggests that Coca-Cola is gaining in the
market, but at a cost. The soft-drink giant is also losing money,
she says, as a result of aggressive promotions, product giveaways
and distribution of refrigeration display cases free to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never tried to fight them and we never will. We respect
them as a huge international company,'' Kuznetsova said of
Coca-Cola. ``We just follow our own path and try to find our piece
of the market.''

 &HT;    My sure-fire idea for the next movie blockbuster
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, work with me on this one. I have a great idea for a movie.
Just work with me . . . .
</P>
<P>
   What happens, see, is that you have this humongous space ship
from another galaxy that comes to orbit Earth and and sends
smaller, but still really big, ships over every major city in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Are you with me, so far? Good.
</P>
<P>
   After a few days, they blow the White House, Empire State
Building and some other well-known places to smithereens. We send
the Air Force after these ships and it doesn't do any good at all.
Our missiles just bounce off.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, an astronomer in California trying to look at
the ships actually spots something else.
</P>
<P>
   It's. . . Oh, no! It's a mile-wide asteroid ripping through the
heavens and heading straight toward earth.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist gets scared out of his gourd and starts driving
down a mountain to tell everyone his bad news.
</P>
<P>
   As he is driving, he is thrown off the road because of a sudden
and massive earthquake that shatters the Richter scale. He tumbles
down the side of the mountain and into a pit of molten lava formed
from the volcano that has erupted because of all the seismic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in California circulates a petition asking for a
constitutional amendment that the state can only suffer one
disaster at a time. Between aliens, earthquake and volcano, taxes
are going to be the worst disaster of all. The only people who sign
the petition have recently been hatched from pods left by another
alien intelligence that wants to take over the world. About the
same time off the East Coast, something very strange is happening.
Something is moving in the water.
</P>
<P>
   You guessed it, Godzilla. But this is not your daddy's Godzilla.
The old version had some trouble walking and, in fact, looked as if
he had a bad case of Godzilla chaffing. The new Godzilla can do
zero-to-60 in six seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just as Godzilla decides to surface -- wouldn't you know
it -- the world's largest cruise ship, the Titanic II, which has
the King of the World on board, runs smack dab into the big lizard.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just water off a lizard's back. The ship snaps in
half and Celine Dion begins to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Above the cruise ship a hijacker takes over a 747 and terrorizes
the passengers, each of whom begin to have their lives flash before
their eyes. The hijacker, whose name is Gort, speaks in a foreign
language with words that sound something like, ``Klattu Berada,
Nickto.'' Nobody knows it, but the President of the United States
is on the plane with his entire family and probably his mistress
(you can never have too many disasters).
</P>
<P>
   But this is where the movie's action really heats up. You forgot
about that pesky asteroid didn't you?
</P>
<P>
   Picture this, just as the aliens are ready to fire their
Doomsday weapon that will vaporize every living being on earth, the
mile-wide asteroid makes a donut out of the aliens' mother ship.
All the little ships explode, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the asteroid doesn't stop. It keeps hurtling toward earth
and plunges into the Atlantic Ocean where it hits -- would you
believe it -- Godzilla as he is fleeing the smog in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A huge tidal wave sweeps across the ocean and is so big that it
reaches California and snuffs out the volcano which, miraculously,
has spewed just enough lava to fill in all the cracks left by the
aarthquake. The seawater also kills all the pod people.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the air the President of the United States risks his life
(remember, this is a movie) to beat up the hijacker and takes
control of the airplane himself. Sorry, I can't do anything about
the cruise ship. The Titanic always sinks.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the movie everyone left alive finds someone to
kiss for three minutes while the credits roll.
</P>
<P>
   If all that isn't enough, I've found a sure-fire way to get
people to get people into the theater. It's all in the name. We'll
just call it, ``Two Thumbs Up.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Corpus Christi teaches lessons of life
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ My son is in the beehive of kindergartners at
Corpus Christi School. They buzz with so much energy and vitality,
the mornings I've visited the classroom, they crowd out any
thoughts of what might have come before them. So it's incongruous
to see the banners all over school this year: ``Corpus Christi
Celebrates 85 Years!''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Staley Callier, too, was once part of the youngest class at
Corpus Christi, a second-grader during that first school year of
1912-13. She's 93, but she can close her eyes and travel back to
the day she started, and how proud everybody was of their brand
spanking new school. ``Oh, it was so beautiful,'' she recalls, her
cornflower-blue eyes shining in a way that makes you see the little
girl who made the half-hour trek with her older brother and sister
from their home on Riverside Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody anticipated that first school year would bring the Great
Dayton Flood _ or any of the other challenges that would face the
school in its 85-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Callier remembers the days after the flood: ``The teacher
painted the children's names at each desk. When the teacher found
out the student was safe, the name was removed. The teacher
wouldn't take the name off until the child was safe.'' All of the
25 children in her class survived.
</P>
<P>
   The school faces different challenges today. Financial
struggles. Struggles to maintain its mission and strong academic
tradition while adapting to the neighborhood's changing
demographics. Long an anchor for the Five Oaks neighborhood, Corpus
Christi started out as a strictly Catholic, neighborhood school,
primarily serving the children of Eastern European immigrants.
Corpus Christi enrollment, which peaked at more than 600 in the
'60s, now hovers around 200.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time in Corpus Christi history, more
than half the student body is non-Catholic. ``Eighty-five years
later, we're different and we're the same,'' said Corpus Christi
pastor Jim Schutte. ``We're different because we're reaching out to
a whole different child today, mainly because of the differences in
the demographics of the neighborhood. Those are the challenges: How
do we live our mission statement, of sharing, living and teaching
the Catholic faith?''
</P>
<P>
   The Jane Staley of 1913 would find much that was unfamiliar in
the Corpus Christi of today. She would no doubt have been surprised
by the multi-cultural student body and the existence of Cor-Care,
the day-care center in the school's basement. She might have been
startled to see Principal Barbara Markus greet the children every
morning as crossing guard.
</P>
<P>
   Other things would have seemed more familiar, including some of
the family names. Second-, even third-generation families are
commonplace here. There is still the kindly parish priest _ Father
Schutte, a man who literally and figuratively gets down to the
kids' level. He has been witnessed on at least one occasion getting
down on his knees and joining students in the drinking fountain
line, and has been spotted on many occasions acting silly and
affectionate with them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, there was Father John Gallagher. ``He was very good to
the children,'' Callier recalls. There were also, as today,
committed teachers who know how to be strict yet compassionate.
``The nuns cared in a special way when they were the teachers, and
the caring of the teachers is still evident,'' said Jim Flynn,
Callier's nephew and business manager for Corpus Christi parish.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, discipline methods have changed since 1913. Kids
lived in terror of the words, ``Go to the cloakroom,'' Callier
recalls. She was careful not to get in the bad graces of Sister
Fostina, who was fair but stern if you misbehaved. ``There was a
bond between the nuns and the children,'' she recalls. ``We knew we
had to obey them and respect them, and we didn't have any
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody gets banished to the cloakroom these days, but you can
still find teachers of the stern-but-kindly variety. There is the
indomitable Sarahmarie Coleman, a Corpus tradition for 32 years.
The first-grade teacher is a rite of passage for kids who might be
at first intimidated by her booming voice and no-nonsense
discipline, but are won over by her zest for learning.
</P>
<P>
   Students greet visitors like properly trained French
schoolchildren: ``Bonjour, Madame McCarty.'' Mrs. Coleman ``expects
manners,'' just as the nuns who brought her up expected manners.
</P>
<P>
   With her commanding presence and voice _ part Barbara Jordan,
part Vanessa Redgrave _ Mrs. Coleman could have been born for the
stage. But the classroom is the only stage Mrs. Coleman craves.
``First grade is my favorite grade. You lay the foundation for
their life in school. You want to encourage positive habits and
make it interesting, and informative, so they will enjoy
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher who inspires the fear of God also inspires notes
like this: ``I love you for a teacher. God made you to teach us to
be kind.'' She praises as exuberantly as she reprimands.
``Outstanding!'' she exclaims, as the students practice sentences.
``You are on target! You are ready for second grade!''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Coleman is a family tradition for some of her students; she
taught the parents of two of her students and the uncles of another
first-grader, Jason Brandell.
</P>
<P>
   Jason's mother, Sue Brandell, said the family postponed a move
to Washington Twp. partly because she wanted her younger son to
have Mrs. Coleman for a teacher. ``She has a wonderful sense of
discipline, but she still makes it fun for the kids,'' Brandell
says. ``She is a disciplinarian, but that only helps the children
to be better people, and more responsible, as they go through
life.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other lessons in life. This year, sixth-grade teacher
Carmen Coggburn coordinated the annual ``Buckets of Love'' program,
three barrels and 30 buckets of clothing and toys to be sent to an
orphanage in Monrovia, Liberia. It's part of their religious
education, Coggburn explains, ``giving and helping the less
fortunate. That's why we do it during the season of Lent.''
</P>
<P>
   Today is the last day of school, and my son's last day of
kindergarten. His teacher, Joan Eifert _ a woman of saintly
patience and stalwart eardrums _ will now enjoy some richly
deserved quiet and rest. And maybe, if I visited Alec's classroom
tomorrow, I could sense the presence of other children, hear other
voices.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I could hear Jane Staley, 8 years old again, no longer a
widow and sole survivor among the nine children of James and
Catherine Staley. She certainly can hear all those voices from
1913, see all those earnest young faces. ``We were raised from the
ground up at Corpus Christi,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What a foundation it proved to be.

   COLUMN: Who has the right to repent?
</P>
<P>
   By Rowland Nethaway
</P>
<P>
   c 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Some African-Americans want an official apology
for slavery. Others seek reparation payments. A Waco city council
member wants a public plaque to denounce an 82-year-old lynching.
</P>
<P>
   While these requests are being debated or ignored, a group of
white citizens in Tulsa, Okla., publicly repented for a 1921 race
riot.
</P>
<P>
   On the 77th anniversary of a race riot that claimed up to 300
lives and destroyed 35 blocks of Tulsa's prosperous black business
district, the Rev. Glenn Shaffer and other whites repented for the
riot and sought forgiveness from African-Americans who gathered to
watch the ``assembly of repentance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Shaffer and other white ministers led a gathering of whites
in asking forgiveness for something they did not do.
</P>
<P>
   Black ministers led a smaller group of blacks in pardoning the
whites.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, not everyone in Tulsa thought the idea of
repenting for the riot was a worthwhile undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't repent,'' Phillip Rhees was quoted in an Associated
Press story. ``I didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhees was just 8 when the race riot erupted on May 21, 1921,
after word spread that a black man had assaulted a white elevator
operator, a woman who later declined to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it hadn't happened,'' Rhees told the reporter. ``I wish
a lot of things didn't happen, but I don't take responsibility for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 84-year-old Tulsa native said his family sheltered blacks in
their home during the riot.
</P>
<P>
   That's always the sticking point. For the most part, people not
directly involved in some historical outrage seldom feel the need
to repent for something they didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a population of more than 500,000, only a few hundred
people, both white and black, bothered to turn out to the
``assembly of repentance'' in Tulsa's once-thriving Greenwood
district.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of Tulsa's race riot was marked by the city for
the first time two years ago, according to the AP story. A black
state representative issued an apology to survivors and victims'
families.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a Waco native and president of the local National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, council member
Lawrence Johnson said he had never heard of the 1916 lynching of a
young black man convicted of the rape and murder of a white woman
until he visited the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis two
years ago. There he saw a photo of the burned and disfigured man
hanging from a tree on the lawn of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were indications that city officials were watching it
happen and did nothing to stop it,'' Johnson said. ``I thought it
was time we did something to purge that incident, to gain a sense
of atonement.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson, it's unlikely that many Waco natives ever heard of
the 82-year-old incident that became a campaign issue in the
NAACP's push to pass federal anti-lynching legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Lynchings were barbaric and outrageous, but unfortunately they
were not that unusual in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Even the staunchest critics of the 1916 lynching did not
question the guilt of the young black man sentenced to hang for his
crimes. The barbarity of the lawless mob shocked the nation. The
young man was dragged from the courtroom, beaten, hanged, burned
and disfigured for souvenirs by the more bloodthirsty of the 15,000
onlookers. His corpse was dragged triumphantly through city
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Although the passage of time clouds apologies, acknowledgments
and pleas of forgiveness, 101-year-old Mabel Little, who lost most
of her community in the Tulsa race riot, forgave the whites who
repented for something they did not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless you wonderful people,'' said Mrs. Little. ``I'm the
happiest person in the world today.''

 &HT;    Baby daze leaves mom-to-be with mind-that-was
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm here at my desk at work, a perfectly useful place for a
pregnant woman to be . . . until I hit the eighth-month mark about
three weeks ago. That's when my brain left me.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose my brain hinted that it needed a break a few months
back. There were all the rooms I walked into, only to find myself
wondering why I was in them. (If I was in the kitchen, I could
answer ``Ice cream!'' and be satisfied, even if I later remembered
the unwashed dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   There were the motor skills _ both fine and gross _ that
departed, the ones I yearned for while teetering in the shower,
trying to shave my legs. (As if anyone was paying attention to my
legs, hidden in the shadow of my dirigible belly.)
</P>
<P>
   Work, though, became the biggest challenge. I tried to think of
clever stories to write. The process went something like this:
``Hmmm . . . all those problems in Indonesia . . . Indonesia's near
Malaysia . . . my mother-in-law lived in Malaysia . . . she just
sent us those adorable baby shoes . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``When do babies start wearing shoes?''
</P>
<P>
   But then one day my brain completely vanished, right there in
the Publix check-out aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left or right?'' asked the helpful bag boy, his hands poised
on my loaded shopping cart.
</P>
<P>
   I blinked at him. The car! He wanted to know where I'd parked
the car. Good question. Outside? Yes, definitely outside. But
where?
</P>
<P>
   ``Left,'' I announced, with confidence I did not really possess.
I thought of suggesting we look for a beige Camry, until I realized
that would be like saying, ``Look for a brown UPS truck.''
</P>
<P>
   But there, parked right out front, was my car. I had forgotten
not only where I'd parked it, but that I had scored a maternity
coup: an unoccupied ``stork parking'' spot for pregnant women. (It
had been a triumphant moment. How many times, on my way to the
parking lot boonies, had I waddled past some skinny man getting
into his stork-parked car? Of course, once inside the store I
forgot my triumph and was soon overwhelmed by too many kinds of
cheese.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, the baby daze got worse. Where the
brain goes, apparently, the will to move follows. This is when you
find yourself glued to the couch and an episode of Love Boat, circa
Gopher and the gang.
</P>
<P>
   I had become a human paperweight.
</P>
<P>
   The Book explains all of this. ``What to Expect When You're
Expecting,'' the pregnant woman's operating manual, warns of ``a
feeling you're not quite together. You're a scatterbrain, you
forget things, drop things'' starting in the fourth month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's caused,'' the manual states, ``by the hormonal changes
wrought by pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   But with my baby's birth just days away, I think I've learned a
more important reason for the memory lapses: A mother's brain needs
a hiatus before her child arrives. It must reprogram some of its
adult, self-centric wiring. Mine, I think, ditched a whole lobe's
worth of thoughts on nuclear testing in India, the last episode of
Seinfeld and whether to boost my 401K contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has room for lullabies.

   Q: I have heard you can get old shredded dollars from the U.S.
Treasury. I'd love to get some to use in a direct mail campaign.
Who do I contact? _ Michelle W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Small bags of shredded bills may be purchased from the Bureau
of Engraving and Printing in D.C.,at (202) 874-2999.
</P>
<P>
   However, any use involving commercial enterprise must be
approved by Uncle Sam. Send a letter outlining your intended use of
the shreds to Tom Rogers, Chief, Department of Treasury, Bureau of
Engraving and Printing, Office of Currency Standards, 14th and C
Streets, SW, Washington, D.C. 20228.
</P>
<P>
   You will be sent the department's guidelines. The shredded money
purchase is made at certain Federal Reserve Banks. Permitted uses
include recycling (roof shingles or insulation) and as novelties
(pens, neckties, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to get tickets to the Olympics in Salt Lake City. How
do I go about this and when? _ Anne Douglas
</P>
<P>
   A: Tickets for Utah's Winter Olympics are not on sale yet.
Policies and information will be available in 2000. Want to check
in periodically for more information? Try the games' Web site at
www.slc2002.org or call (801) 322-2002. (See the pattern?)
</P>
<P>
   The XIX Olympic Winter Games will be Feb. 8-24, 2002. An
estimated 3,500 athletes and officials will participate in seven
sports in 68 medal events.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to purchase an Al Hirschfeld cartoon. Do you
know where? _ David Morris
</P>
<P>
   A: The Margo Feiden Galleries Ltd. in New York. Call (212)
677-5330 to buy an original (beginning at $3,000) or a lithograph
(beginning at $650).
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen his work on a letter. In 1991 Hirschfeld's
drawings of famous comedians were made into postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis-born artist hides his daughter's name, Nina, in
every cartoon. Where does this famous Nina reside? Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter and I are having an argument. I say that Kentucky
Fried Chicken was for sale in Austin, Texas as early as 1953. Am I
right?
</P>
<P>
   Also my cherrywood dining chairs have some wax buildup. I used
Murphy's Oil Soap but no dice. What will remove it without harming
the finish? _ C.M.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try a solvent like toluol to lift grease, wax and glue.
Experiment on a hidden area to see how the finish reacts. You may
have to strip and refinish the furniture. The Austin History Center
staff says The Colonel first appears in the 1961Austin telephone
directory. Good resource because the people at Kentucky Fried had
no idea! The first KFC franchise was located in Salt Lake City in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a gazebo in our back yard and every summer bumblebees
descend on the area. They do not seem to do anything except fly
around and chase each other.
</P>
<P>
   It is getting increasingly difficult to ignore them _ they buzz
very close and we are afraid of them. They may take over the entire
yard even though there is no hive. Can you help us?
</P>
<P>
   _William &AMP; Jeanne Lummus
</P>
<P>
   A: Good news. These are carpenter bees, not bumblebees, says
John Fick, apiary inspector at Texas A&AMP;M.Carpenter bees are
solitary and do not nest in a hive like bumblebees.
</P>
<P>
   You are besieged by male carpenter bees looking for a female _
not very successfully, it seems. Males cannot sting but there is
little you can do to discourage them from returning. Still want a
bee-ectomy? Call local bee and wasp guru Al Kinser at 477-9025.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just noticed recently that Mary Higgins Clark had a No. 1
best seller in fiction and in paperback fiction at the same time,
according to The New York Times Best Seller list. Has anyone had
more than two No. 1 sellers at a time?
</P>
<P>
   _J.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Prolific authors such as Clark often have a hardback novel
hit the stands as the previously published hardback is released in
paperback. Thus the simultaneous ``firsts'' on the list. According
to Peter Breen, managing editor of Book Publishing Report other
such authors have been John Grisham and Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need to to know how to reach Bernard Hill _ he played the
captain in ``Titanic.'' He is a friend from way back and we have
some important information for him. I have exhausted my sources _
even those in England.
</P>
<P>
   _I. Watson
</P>
<P>
   A: Hill is represented by Susan Smith &AMP; Associates, 121 N. San
Vicente Blvd., Beverly Hills, Calif. 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter is a Peace Corps volunteer in public health
stationed in Sofara, Mali, West Africa. She is working with a
biology teacher who has no visual materials (body systems,
diagrams, models, etc.), no up-to-date textbooks and no microscope.
Surely one of your readers has an outdated microscope or some
textbooks or visual aids to assist this teacher.
</P>
<P>
   We will be glad to bring such donations to this school.
</P>
<P>
   _Paul Angenend
</P>
<P>
   A: Terrific way to help a teacher! Call Angenend at 453-8686 to
donate. His ``Mali Express'' leaves this month!
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have an old, baby push cart bought in England many years
ago and need to replace the tires. It has spoke wheels, about seven
inches in diameter, and hard rubber tires. Where might we find
replacements?
</P>
<P>
   _C.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: New metal wheels with spokes and tires are in stock at Breed
&AMP; Co., 718 W. 29th St. If you want to keep the original wheels and
just re-tire them, talk to the folks at A to Z Tire and Battery,
</P>
<P>
   6401 S. First. They stock (or can order) tires like the Carlisle
line (used on utility carts, wheel barrows and go-carts).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to know what the law is in Texas about loans
that a husband borrowed from a bank without the wife's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Is the wife still responsible for the payments if the husband
does not pay? Also, does it apply to credit card purchases that he
made on his individual cards? I am new and confused in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A: L.H. Very possibly. Welcome to Texas, a community property
state. A spouse is at risk for the debts incurred by a marital
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot be assured you won't be held liable _ even if you
did not sign for the account or the loan,'' says attorney Sara E.
Saltmarsh, board certified in family law. In Texas, ``each spouse
has the duty to support the other, and the nature of the debt may
determine responsibility in a court's view,'' adds Saltmarsh.
Sounds like you and your spouse might benefit from a course or two
at Consumer Credit Counseling Service (447-0711).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I believe my great-grandfather served in the Confederate
Army. Can you tell me how to reach the Daughters of the
Confederacy?
</P>
<P>
   _K. Boyd
</P>
<P>
   A: The group's Albert Sidney Johnston Chapter meets monthly at
Camp Mabry, except for a summer recess. Call chapter registrar Lana
Henley (258-7904) for details.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please help us settle a bet. What year did the Space Mountain
ride open at Disneyland? My husband swears it was in the early
1970s and I say it was 1977 or 1978.
</P>
<P>
   _Ronda W.
</P>
<P>
   A: May 4, 1977. You win. This terrifying ride (really want to
hitch your stomach to a roller coaster in the dark?) is a hit with
children. The most popular ride in the park? Pirates of the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get an appraisal locally of what might be a
valuable antique book? It is a leather-bound volume titled ``The
Conquest of Granada,'' by Washington Irving, Hudson Edition,

``entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by
Washington Irving.'' It appears Irving wrote this book in 1829
while serving as an ambassador in Spain. I thought it strange the

later.

 &HT;    Florida school therapist faces felony charges
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   School therapist Linda Werner passed herself off as a clinical
psychologist and collected $200-an-hour fees as an expert witness
in Palm Beach County's court system _ even though she was never
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Werner, 47, is charged with defrauding Blue Cross/Blue
Shield of Florida and may face federal prosecution on Medicare
fraud allegations. She also could be prosecuted for lying about her
qualifications under oath in court cases and on her Blue Cross/Blue
Shield provider application, according to the Florida Department of
Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts police arrested Werner at her home in the Cape Cod
village of Sandwich at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, June 3, on a warrant
charging her with grand theft, organized scheme to defraud, and
filing false and fraudulent insurance claims. Each is a
second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are based on bills for 20 patients totaling $33,739
that Werner and her partner, Larry Mack, submitted to Blue
Cross/Blue Shield between April 1996 and March 1997, according to
the arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Werner waived extradition and was released in the custody of her
attorney, George Otto, who's also her husband. She has 10 days to
turn herself in to the Palm Beach County Jail, an investigator
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Werner nor Otto could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, a licensed marriage and family therapist on Palm Beach
Lakes Boulevard, is still under investigation, a department
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Mack is not guilty of any intentional wrongdoing
whatsoever,'' said Michael Dubiner, his attorney. Dubiner told
investigators Mack didn't know Werner wasn't a licensed
psychologist _ or that she'd lost even her school license _ until
he read it in The Palm Beach Post in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Werner has a doctorate in psychology but never went through the
state testing and licensing procedure for psychologists. Her school
license, issued in 1985, was limited to dealing with students'
learning problems. The state Department of Business and
Professional Regulation forced her to give that up in 1996,
charging she had violated it by testifying in a custody case and
arranging a personal relationship between two patients.
</P>
<P>
   Werner was a favorite of local divorce lawyers. They paid her to
do psychological evaluations of adults and children _ something she
couldn't do, legally _ and testify to their mental and emotional
states.
</P>
<P>
   Werner said under oath in 1994 that she was a ``licensed
clinical psychologist'' who had testified as an expert in at least
250 cases and been appointed by judges 30 to 40 times. Judges
relied on her testimony to decide whether parents were capable of
raising children and how marital assets should be divided.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County requires court-appointed mental health experts
to provide their license numbers, but they don't have to submit
copies of the licenses or other proof.
</P>
<P>
   Werner listed herself as a clinical psychologist when she
applied for a Blue Cross/Blue Shield health care provider number in
1991, according to the arrest warrant. Mack didn't have a Blue
Cross/Blue Shield number so all insurance claims were filed under
Werner's name and number, a common practice in professional
offices.
</P>
<P>
   The two continued filing claims even after Werner lost her
school psychology license in April 1996. Of the $33,739 billed, the
agency paid $10,395 before learning that she had no license of any
kind, but only $6,000 is included in the state charges. The rest
was Medicare money and will be dealt with by federal investigators,
said Ron Poindexter, director of the state insurance fraud
division.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Werner aren't that unusual, Poindexter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another type of medical billing fraud, which is
rampant in Florida.''

 &HT;    Veteran pilot fights FAA's retire at 60 rule
 &HT;    By Doug Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ LEARN TO FLY. The image of that
flight-school advertisement is forever fused with Frank Murphy's
childhood memory of roaring through the clouds in an old biplane
with his father at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy saw the sign each time he shuttled between New Jersey and
Alabama as a young engineer testing guidance systems at the NASA
design center in the 1960s. The sign, and the memory, tugged at him
until he finally walked into the Huntsville Flying Service and
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   A little less than three years later, on April Fool's Day 1969,
he quit his engineer's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided there was no point working if I could fly for a
living,'' he says. ``I don't think of flying as work. I think of
flying as art.''
</P>
<P>
   At 29, he got a late start at a lucky time. Six months after he
started ferrying cargo, his boss bought a fleet of surplus
piston-engine planes and started Span East Airlines. Murphy became
a commercial pilot.
</P>
<P>
   He's had a thrilling if occasionally bumpy ascent since.
Airlines have vanished around him, but Murphy's love of flying,
travel and adventure is stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like doing this,'' he says. ``I love doing this. There's
nothing else I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What hurts is the increasing sense that no one else really
cares.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 30, 1999
</P>
<P>
   This calendar page is the vision now fixed in Murphy's mind.
That day, his 60th birthday, he will become too feeble or addled or
simply incompetent to do what he loves.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Federal Aviation Administration rule book says,
regardless of what any doctor or inspector or Murphy himself
thinks. Murphy says he has no trouble passing his twice-yearly FAA
physicals and flight-simulator tests, and doesn't expect to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes no sense,'' Murphy says. ``How can I be perfectly
capable of flying on Oct. 29 but not the next day?''
</P>
<P>
   The more he talks about it, the more agitated and disbelieving
he becomes. How can it come down to this? A mere 16 months. At the
least, he ought to get credit for the last three months he's spent
waiting to fly again.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who has lived in Miami since 1970, flew for Air Florida
and then for Carnival Air Lines. He stayed when the lettering on
the planes changed to Pan Am, but his job ended when the airline
filed for bankruptcy in February. He's been told he'll be flying
for Pan Am again sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about flying again, but I know it won't be for
long,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's age limit has been a point of contention since it was
imposed in 1959. The agency says there is no certain way to
determine the age at which health and skills deteriorate
dangerously. So, the agency argues, it's safest to draw an early
line.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous pilots and pilot groups have challenged the rule with
studies showing that older pilots fly safely in other parts of the
world and can be tested as reliably as younger pilots.
</P>
<P>
   As for slowed reflexes, Murphy cautions against thinking in
terms of evasive maneuvers on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to avoid those sort of quick motions in a cockpit,''
Murphy says. ``In 30 years, you learn to avoid problems as well as
deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest and, to Murphy, most discouraging word came from the
U.S. Supreme Court last month. Two pilots, backed by a group called
the Professional Pilots Federation, sued to overturn the age limit
as illegal discrimination, but they lost and the Supreme Court
refused to consider their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt,'' Murphy says. ``I guess I believed you could count
on the courts to protect the rights of the minority even when the
executive and legislative branches won't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Line Pilots Association, the union representing 49,000
pilots, opposed the rule for decades but now supports it. (Requests
for the union's comment on the Supreme Court decision went
unanswered.)
</P>
<P>
   To Murphy and other older pilots, the reason for the union's
turn-around is clear: Younger pilots, a majority of the union's
members, have a financial incentive to push the older pilots out.
</P>
<P>
   Because of flying's rigid seniority system, the only way to move
into the highest-paying jobs is for someone up ahead to retire.
</P>
<P>
   And getting to those jobs is important, because one of the major
influences on retirement pay is a pilot's final salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many younger pilots want to clear the path for
themselves,'' Murphy says. ``They don't think they'll ever turn
60.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did he.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who says he has a little bit of Indiana Jones in him,
talks enthusiastically about the days when he and a pal flew
plantains from Ecuador in an old DC-7.
</P>
<P>
   But he's just as enthusiastic about more recent adventures,
including summers based in Egypt and Turkey under Pan Am contracts
with airlines in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he's been talking more often and more forcefully, trying
to persuade as many people as he can that the age limit should be
repealed. He even showed up on CNN, but he also will make his case
one listener at a time.
</P>
<P>
   He carries a briefcase full of magazine articles, studies and
charts to support his position. One of them underscores the
difficulty he has finding sympathy. It shows that pilots for top
carriers can earn $3 million to $9 million over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking you to cry for pilots,'' he says. ``But
remember: that figure is for 30 years. A lot of guys flying for
Eastern, Braniff and a lot of other airlines never got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of pilots who have been bounced from job to job or who
always worked for smaller airlines really do need to work. The
FAA's age limit doesn't make them eligible for early Social
Security retirement or disability benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who is single, is ready to retire financially but not
emotionally. So he'll find a way to keep flying past Oct. 30, 1999
_ in Central America or Europe or some other place that will show
confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to leave my country, but I'm going to be flying
something, somewhere,'' he says. ``Why would I want to retire? I
never really worked.''

82-year-old lynching. While these requests are being debated or
ignored, a group of white citizens in Tulsa, Okla., publicly
repented for a 1921 race riot. As might be expected, not everyone
in Tulsa thought the idea of repenting for the riot was a
worthwhile undertaking. ``I can't repent,'' Phillip Rhees was
quoted in an Associated Press story. ``I didn't do it.'' (Nethaway,
Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   BLACKWHITE _ ATLANTA _ People do many things to stand out in a
crowd. Joel Bethea and Kelvin Lawrence simply went to high school.
Bethea is one of two white students graduating this month from
Southwest DeKalb High, and Lawrence is one of six black students in
his senior class at Pope High in the suburb of East Cobb. On June
13, they both will celebrate their high-school graduation. They
admit it wasn't always easy being a white face in a black crowd or
vice versa. But they didn't just survive their four years of high
school, they thrived. Here's how. (Harrison, Atlanta

 &HT;    Veteran pilot fights FAA's retire at 60 rule
 &HT;    By Doug Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ LEARN TO FLY. The image of that
flight-school advertisement is forever fused with Frank Murphy's
childhood memory of roaring through the clouds in an old biplane
with his father at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy saw the sign each time he shuttled between New Jersey and
Alabama as a young engineer testing guidance systems at the NASA
design center in the 1960s. The sign, and the memory, tugged at him
until he finally walked into the Huntsville Flying Service and
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   A little less than three years later, on April Fool's Day 1969,
he quit his engineer's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided there was no point working if I could fly for a
living,'' he says. ``I don't think of flying as work. I think of
flying as art.''
</P>
<P>
   At 29, he got a late start at a lucky time. Six months after he
started ferrying cargo, his boss bought a fleet of surplus
piston-engine planes and started Span East Airlines. Murphy became
a commercial pilot.
</P>
<P>
   He's had a thrilling if occasionally bumpy ascent since.
Airlines have vanished around him, but Murphy's love of flying,
travel and adventure is stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like doing this,'' he says. ``I love doing this. There's
nothing else I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What hurts is the increasing sense that no one else really
cares.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 30, 1999
</P>
<P>
   This calendar page is the vision now fixed in Murphy's mind.
That day, his 60th birthday, he will become too feeble or addled or
simply incompetent to do what he loves.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Federal Aviation Administration rule book says,
regardless of what any doctor or inspector or Murphy himself
thinks. Murphy says he has no trouble passing his twice-yearly FAA
physicals and flight-simulator tests, and doesn't expect to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes no sense,'' Murphy says. ``How can I be perfectly
capable of flying on Oct. 29 but not the next day?''
</P>
<P>
   The more he talks about it, the more agitated and disbelieving
he becomes. How can it come down to this? A mere 16 months. At the
least, he ought to get credit for the last three months he's spent
waiting to fly again.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who has lived in Miami since 1970, flew for Air Florida
and then for Carnival Air Lines. He stayed when the lettering on
the planes changed to Pan Am, but his job ended when the airline
filed for bankruptcy in February. He's been told he'll be flying
for Pan Am again sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about flying again, but I know it won't be for
long,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's age limit has been a point of contention since it was
imposed in 1959. The agency says there is no certain way to
determine the age at which health and skills deteriorate
dangerously. So, the agency argues, it's safest to draw an early
line.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous pilots and pilot groups have challenged the rule with
studies showing that older pilots fly safely in other parts of the
world and can be tested as reliably as younger pilots.
</P>
<P>
   As for slowed reflexes, Murphy cautions against thinking in
terms of evasive maneuvers on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to avoid those sort of quick motions in a cockpit,''
Murphy says. ``In 30 years, you learn to avoid problems as well as
deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest and, to Murphy, most discouraging word came from the
U.S. Supreme Court last month. Two pilots, backed by a group called
the Professional Pilots Federation, sued to overturn the age limit
as illegal discrimination, but they lost and the Supreme Court
refused to consider their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt,'' Murphy says. ``I guess I believed you could count
on the courts to protect the rights of the minority even when the
executive and legislative branches won't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Line Pilots Association, the union representing 49,000
pilots, opposed the rule for decades but now supports it. (Requests
for the union's comment on the Supreme Court decision went
unanswered.)
</P>
<P>
   To Murphy and other older pilots, the reason for the union's
turn-around is clear: Younger pilots, a majority of the union's
members, have a financial incentive to push the older pilots out.
</P>
<P>
   Because of flying's rigid seniority system, the only way to move
into the highest-paying jobs is for someone up ahead to retire.
</P>
<P>
   And getting to those jobs is important, because one of the major
influences on retirement pay is a pilot's final salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many younger pilots want to clear the path for
themselves,'' Murphy says. ``They don't think they'll ever turn
60.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did he.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who says he has a little bit of Indiana Jones in him,
talks enthusiastically about the days when he and a pal flew
plantains from Ecuador in an old DC-7.
</P>
<P>
   But he's just as enthusiastic about more recent adventures,
including summers based in Egypt and Turkey under Pan Am contracts
with airlines in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he's been talking more often and more forcefully, trying
to persuade as many people as he can that the age limit should be
repealed. He even showed up on CNN, but he also will make his case
one listener at a time.
</P>
<P>
   He carries a briefcase full of magazine articles, studies and
charts to support his position. One of them underscores the
difficulty he has finding sympathy. It shows that pilots for top
carriers can earn $3 million to $9 million over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking you to cry for pilots,'' he says. ``But
remember: that figure is for 30 years. A lot of guys flying for
Eastern, Braniff and a lot of other airlines never got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of pilots who have been bounced from job to job or who
always worked for smaller airlines really do need to work. The
FAA's age limit doesn't make them eligible for early Social
Security retirement or disability benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who is single, is ready to retire financially but not
emotionally. So he'll find a way to keep flying past Oct. 30, 1999
_ in Central America or Europe or some other place that will show
confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to leave my country, but I'm going to be flying
something, somewhere,'' he says. ``Why would I want to retire? I
never really worked.''

   $ADV07  COMMENTARY: BRING IN THE RED TEAM
 &HT;     For release Sunday, June 7.
 &HT;     By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's no secret nowadays that a chunk of the $27
billion to be spent this year on our vast intelligence empire will
pay for an order of humble pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my responsibility to stand up and tell the American
people that we didn't get it right,'' George Tenet, the nation's
spy chief, said of his team's failure to predict that India would
muscle its way into the nuclear club. At a closed hearing, Tenet
told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he would try to do
better.
</P>
<P>
   One way to start is to have some of the folks who deal with the
region, home to a fifth of the world's people, bookmark the Times
of India newspaper on their Internet browsers. It's a free ride on
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Had they done so last month, they would have noted that India's
fiercely nationalistic Bharatiya Janata Party had sent loads of
clear signals in plain English of plans to put nukes in their
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   As retired admiral David Jeremiah sees it, the failure came
because ``both the intelligence and policy communities had an
underlying mind set'' that the people who took over in New Delhi in
March ``would behave as we behave.'' As director of Central
Intelligence, Tenet brought Jeremiah in to write a classified
report on what had gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   So far as an outsider can tell, the sole flaw in Jeremiah's
analysis of the CIA's failed analysis was his use of the past
tense: The mind set he cited has yet to change.
</P>
<P>
   Take the briefing that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
gave before leaving for Geneva and a Big Five powwow on the nuclear
expansion issue. She ignored the only country that has so far
actively stepped in to mediate the crisis: Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she spoke, Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi was in
New Delhi meeting with India's Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
and telling reporters that ``we believe in a nuclear weapons-free
zone in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Islamabad, where he had met with Pakistani leaders,
Kharrazi sang a different tune, praising Pakistan's ``Islamic
bomb'' and suggesting that ``the development of a nuclear bomb by a
Muslim country can act as a deterrent for Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Iran, these themes fail to strike a happy chord in
official Washington, which holds that the Iranian mullahs are up to
no good when it comes to nukes and that, in any event, they have no
business trying to mediate matters in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Jeremiah's secret report, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.,
a key member of the intelligence panel, said we need new laws ``so
that there is regular `red team' independent analysis done. Such
teams, as Kerrey would have it, would ensure ``that the people who
are collecting, who are processing, and who are analyzing and
disseminating intelligence have outside review.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad idea. But so long as they are at it, let them begin by
analyzing the flawed foreign policy priorities of a distracted
president and the mind set of a secretary of state loath to
exchange her personal popularity by speaking honestly about the
world as it really exists and not as she wishes it would.

 &HT;     TIANANMEN DEMONSTRATION GOES PEACEFULLY _ 1,000 MILES AWAY IN
HONG KONG
 &HT;     By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Shielding their candles from a punishing rain,
thousands of demonstrators held the first vigil on Chinese soil
Thursday night for their countrymen mowed down in the Tiananmen
Square democracy movement nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony dramatized by thunder and lightening amid the
sweet, sad tones of traditional Chinese music, a crowd that
organizers estimated to number 40,000 carried off a peaceful rally
in Victoria Park. Pro-democracy activists laid wreaths in memory of
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first memorial to the Tiananmen victims since Hong
Kong was restored to Chinese rule last summer, and thus the first
such event ever to take place in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our responsibility to continue what has not been
finished,'' said exiled Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng, who spoke
to demonstrators over a videotape from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the democratic movement on the mainland is suppressed in a
cruel way, then it will be very hard to maintain democracy in Hong
Kong,'' Wei said. ``On the other hand, if Hong Kong can maintain
democracy here, this will be important to the democratization of
China.''
</P>
<P>
   A second dissident recently released from prison into U.S.
exile, the Tiananmen student leader Wang Dan, talked to the crowd
on an open telephone line. He thanked them for braving the lousy
weather, and expressed hopes he one day will be permitted to join
demonstrators back in his homeland to mark the June 4 massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's annual remembrance here drew 55,000 mourners, but
organizers guessed in advance that today's more temperate political
atmosphere would pull down the numbers. Just before the Hong Kong
handover last year, people here were intent on letting China's
leaders know the change in regime would not cow them into quieting
their calls for democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the crowd Thursday was of respectable size for the
conditions, and it was the only protest permitted anywhere in
China. There had been no threat of disorder by the group that has
staged annual peaceful memorials since the 1989 crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   In Tiananmen Square in Beijing, there was no overt observance of
the bloody attack China's army staged the night of June 3-4, 1989,
to end a weeks-long, student-led demonstration for democracy and
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly Chinese tourists flew kites and ogled monuments on a
sunny, warm day, and a crowd of yellow-hatted retirees stood
through a lecture on the history of the square that has been a
central landmark to generations of Chinese. The lecturer left the
events of 1989 out of his recitation.
</P>
<P>
   The only unusual event was the appearance of a wheelchair-bound
protester and his brother, farmers from Fujian Province in the
southeast, whose complaint was unrelated to the 1989 events that
remain an open political wound. Police quickly hauled both men off
the square, stifling their effort to draw attention to claims that
local officials abused power in the personal injury case that left
the man crippled.
</P>
<P>
   Others dared not show up to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups report police as usual stepped up
surveillance of dissidents and their families in days leading up to
the anniversary, detaining some and putting guards at the homes of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Tighter controls were reportedly placed over Zhao Ziyang, the
78-year-old former Communist Party general secretary who remains
under house arrest nine years after expressing sympathy for the
students who gathered thousands of demonstrators to the square.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights group Amnesty International reported Thursday
that at least 250 people remain in prison for their participation
in the democracy movement, out of more than 2,000 political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   One of the boldest efforts to be heard has come from Bao Tong,
the assistant to Zhao Ziyang in 1989, who only in recent days
finally was released from prison. He had been held on charges of
leaking state secrets and counter-revolutionary incitement.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews, including one published here Thursday
in the South China Morning Post, Bao has come out strongly for
democratic political reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest lesson (from June 4) is that our power must have
limits and supervision by the people,'' Bao said in the interview.
``If we do not establish controls, then such a thing could happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary was especially sensitive this year, as
authorities wondered whether increasingly troubling unemployment
problems might translate into political protest. Another sore point
is the coming visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has been
under fire at home for agreeing to have his official welcome
ceremony at Tiananmen Square.

NUN TACKLES A NEW MISSION FOR THE NEEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although the place was packed, there were no
mayors, supervisors, city department heads or well-heeled
representatives from the Office of Protocol. Seeing as it was a
pretty strong Catholic crowd, there were plenty of priests, nuns
and brown-robed Franciscan friars in attendance, but no bishops.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was a typical gathering in the dining room at
the St. Anthony Foundation: About 175 just-folks singing, hugging,
praying and gnoshing _ and everyone there was ``family.''
</P>
<P>
   All had come to witness the installation of Sister Patrick
Curran as executive director of the half-century-old institution in
San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A Sister of Mercy who took her vows the year men first walked on
the moon, Curran has a long career in health care and
administration. As its vice president and chief operating officer,
she spent the last 14 years running Mercy Retirement and Care
Center in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, she has learned the lay of the new land. Of the
tight-knit, hard-working San Francisco neighborhood in which most
St. Anthony services operate, Curran said: ``Do not fool with the
Tenderloin community.''
</P>
<P>
   That remark won the no-nonsense nun a raucous round of applause.
Yet, in nearly the same breath, she reminded all present that their
new executive director is first and foremost a woman of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel blessed to be here,'' she said. ``This is very holy
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   While most San Francisco Bay-area residents know of St.
Anthony's through its legendary dining room for the poor _ 2,000
meals are served each day _ the foundation is considerably more
than a soup kitchen next door to St. Boniface Church. With an
annual budget of $13 million, St. Anthony's oversees more than a
dozen programs, including a free medical clinic, drug and alcohol
rehabilitation programs, housing for elderly women, clothing and
furniture distribution and employment.
</P>
<P>
   Like most social service agencies in the United States, St.
Anthony's biggest challenge these days is keeping up with the
increasing number of people made poor, homeless and desperate by
state and federal welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The faces of the poor have changed so much since I was a young
nun in Harlem,'' Curran said after the ceremony. ``Then, it was
almost always men. Yesterday, we had an 8-month-old baby in here.
Earlier this week, a typical family came in. They can pay their
rent, but, by the end of the month, there's no money for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their son is 11. You could tell he was embarrassed to have to
be here. I sat down and talked with him and tried to make him feel
a little more comfortable. With the numbers of people we have
coming, we can never lose the personalism that St. Anthony's has
always offered. We can never stop looking each person in the eyes
and seeing the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opening comments, the Rev. Floyd Lotito touched on that
``personalism'' _ and its two-way benefits. All priests and nuns in
the Franciscan order, he said, have been charged by their superiors
to rediscover the spirit that moved their founder, St. Francis of
Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each should share as far as they are able, the life, history,
and hope of the poor and marginalized of our society, in order to
be evangelized by them,'' Lotito said.
</P>
<P>
   The mission isn't to teach the poor, he said, but ``to allow
them to preach the gospel to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Patrick Curran could not agree more. Back in the early
1800s, the Irish founder of her order, Catherine McAuley, advised
her pioneering nuns: ``Welcome everyone _ and make them a
comforting cup of tea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that fits right in here at St. Anthony's,'' Curran
said.
</P>
<P>
   As if to demonstrate that the St. Anthony family expects
Curran's ``cup of tea'' to be decidedly 21st century, a man from
the maintenance staff walked up, congratulated the nun and gave her
a sharp military salute.
</P>
<P>
   She saluted back.

MAYOR SOMEBODY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The people of Oakland want to be somebody.
That, more than anything else, explains why almost 60 percent of
Oakland voters on Tuesday chose Jerry Brown as their new mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund G. ``Jerry'' Brown Jr. is somebody, a former California
governor, a former presidential candidate, a former boyfriend of
pop singer Linda Ronstadt, a former helper to Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   Oaklanders, who have never had anyone like him lead them, are
tired of living in the shadow of San Francisco and envious of
Silicon Valley's booming high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   They are starved for positive recognition. They cringed when _
pre-Jerry Brown _ the national news media turned a glaring
spotlight on their humble town. The attention was usually negative,
with ``menacing'' as the adjective affixed to the Black Panthers,
the Hell's Angels, the Oakland Raiders and even the Rolls Royce
funeral cortege of a notorious drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor-elect Jerry Brown promises to bring a positive national
and international spin to a city that hungers for validation.
</P>
<P>
   Debbra Schwartz, speaking amid the din of Brown's victory party,
said: ``When a national figure like Jerry Brown comes here and
says, `Hey, this place is OK,' then it's not a loss for us. Oakland
gets a lot of bad press from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to sit around here and say things are hopeless,
horrible. But when someone who's been around like Jerry Brown has
comes here and says, `It's not so terrible; let's do something,'
then it helps our national image.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hilliard had similar feelings. A founder of the Black
Panther Party in the 1960s and an early supporter of Brown, he
said, ``With Jerry as our mayor, Oakland will be a focal point of
national and international importance. He brings our city into an
international community, because we live in a global era.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Johnson, an Oakland resident and truck driver, said,
``Jerry Brown gives Oakland national exposure. People are looking
at Oakland in a different light than before.''
</P>
<P>
   That Brown is white doesn't bother Hilliard or Johnson, who are
African Americans in a city with an African-American population of
about 40 percent and Asian-American and Latino populations of about
15 percent each. It's a city where race is always a factor, despite
protests to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about black or white,'' Johnson said. ``Jerry knows
more CEOs than the other candidates. He has connections. We have
had black people on the school board and on the City Council. We
can't blame whites. It's not about race. It's about getting the
best person to run the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard says Brown has historical connections to the
African-American community. And, in a back-to-the-future twist,
Hilliard sees Brown's victory in Oakland as a continuum of the
Black Panther Party's programs of the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very progressive victory for Oakland,'' Hilliard
said. ``Our politics have always been class politics. It was never
about race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jerry puts the right people in place, it will be the most
important transition for the city since the Black Panther Party. He
echoes our agenda of addressing joblessness and crime. I haven't
seen this sort of electricity of race and class and participation
in politics since Bobby Seale ran for mayor in 1973. Jerry will
bring all sorts of experiences to get the community participating.
Jerry will bring the races together. He will heal the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that happens awaits the passage of time. Meanwhile,
before he takes office in January, Brown will try to change the
city charter to strengthen the mayor's office, a highly divisive
issue in the recent past.

 (For release Sunday, June 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was trying to make up
his mind about anything of moment, he took on a look of pain and
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to sweat more and to lower his head and stare off into
space and twist his hands a lot. He was never a fashion plate, but
at such times he seemed to grow more ungroomed, and too consumed by
thought to notice.
</P>
<P>
   He was that way in January 1968, when Look magazine photographer
Stanley Tretick and I, as Look Washington editor, were hanging out
with him, practically day and night. He was wrestling with a
decision on whether to oppose incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson in the
1968 Democratic presidential primaries. His head told him it would
be folly, but his heart said do it.
</P>
<P>
   All of us watching him up close understood the struggle. Tretick
and I were closer than most because we had a deal with him, to
cover him ``from the inside out,'' as Theodore White had done in
1960 for his book, ``The Making of a President.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against running were overwhelming. Even though
Vietnam War casualties and protests had severely undercut Johnson's
earlier popularity, he still had the power of incumbency. And
everybody knew he could be a formidable no-quarter, no-prisoners
campaigner. He had scornfully, humiliatingly rejected Kennedy's
suggestion to pick him as his vice-presidential nominee in 1968,
and any idea of another confrontation was chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``O-oh-oh, what he would do to me!'' Kennedy said once,
grimacing, almost to himself, as he responded to the umpteenth
question about whether he would run.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed, but said nothing more. He had an agenda _ end the
war and heal its wounds, work more imaginatively to be rid of
racial strife, try to halt the standoff with Cuba and the Cold War
with the Soviet Union, resolve to boost early education,
reinvigorate the war on poverty, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not know how to get the power to achieve that. And,
despite all the pressures from liberal well-wishers, he did not see
how he could beat Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Tretick and I flew into Rochester, N.Y., with him and Ethel
Kennedy in January 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He was making duty rounds as New York's junior senator, a Polish
American breakfast here, an Italian American supper there. But, as
he had since he toured the country campaigning on behalf of
Democratic candidates in 1966, he was testing the waters for a
possible run at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we landed, a raging blizzard set in, and all aircraft
were grounded. It took three hours to feel our way to Syracuse in
the blinding blanket of snow. We had a wonderful time, talking some
shop but mostly just talking.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his wife had had dinner the night before with Harold
MacMillan, the former British prime minister. To my great surprise,
because I knew Kennedy had a tin ear and could sing only one song
(``Jingle Bells''), he beautifully mimicked MacMillan's upper-class
accent, phrasing and cadence in repeating stories he had told at
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' he said, suddenly serious. ``You guys keep saying I
have to run, I have to run. Well, it is not just me I would be
deciding for. If I announce, people would come running to the
campaign. They would quit jobs they love and leave their families
to work in the campaign. There would be divorces, and some people
would meet and get married. Hundreds, thousands of good people
would be affected. It isn't just me. It's a lot of people. And they
would never be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   As the months went by and we kept gnawing at him, he took on a
deeper look of distress. He did not budge even when Minnesota Sen.
Eugene J. McCarthy got in to challenge Johnson and attracted a
whole flock of liberal activists away from Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   He was gathering a team, though, just in case. By this time, I
was pretty convinced he would run. Look assigned Tretick and me to
do the story. But I could not get a definite yes or no out of him,
even for my own background and guidance, and the deadline for the
story was bearing down.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote two stories. One said he had decided to run and
explained why, in a grand display of punditry, and the other
confidently detailed why he did not run.
</P>
<P>
   That left the problem of the ``sell line'' to go with Tretick's
splendid portrait of Kennedy on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   It was major, because the cover was printed two weeks ahead of
the rest of the magazine, and there was no time left. After much
thrashing about, I came up with a one-size-fits-all: ``Bobby
Kennedy: How He Made Up His Mind about 1968.''
</P>
<P>
   We rolled the cover with that. But we could not get a commitment
from him until McCarthy won a surprising 45 percent of the vote
against Johnson in the New Hampshire primary, a prelude to
president's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   I called Kennedy early the next morning and he said he would let
me know the following day at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where he was
giving a speech. We held the presses at Look, the first time we had
ever done that in the magazine's history, at a cost of $25,000 per
day.
</P>
<P>
   At Saratoga Springs, as Kennedy entered the hotel where he was
to speak, I fought my way through a mob of reporters and
photographers to his side. I did not want to tip my hand, and so I
shouted, ``Is it up or down?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked puzzled a second and then made a thumbs-up gesture. I
raced to a telephone and told the Look printer in Chicago to go
with the ``go'' story. It was as close to a scoop as I could get.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy formally announced his candidacy March 16 in the Senate
Caucus Room, the same place from which his brother John began his
quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Kennedy marched in the St. Patrick's Day parades
in Boston and New York, and we all set out on the whirlwind, 81-day
campaign that ended in that hotel kitchen in Los Angeles the night
he won the California primary and seemed certain to get the
nomination and probably the election.
</P>
<P>
   When the shots were fired, I came up behind Sirhan Sirhan. I got
him under one leg and, with others, wrestled with him for the gun.
There were too many big, strong people in that melee and I
disengaged and went to Kennedy. Mrs. Kennedy was bending over him.
I saw the wound, in the mastoid area just behind his ear. I knew
then that all the hopes and dreams would vanish.
</P>
<P>
   And as Mrs. Kennedy, security man Bill Barry, campaign worker
Fred Dutton and I took him to the hospital in the ambulance, I
thought of what he had said once on the campaign trail, scolding
aides for being over-protective of him in crowds:
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people don't want to hurt me. They just want to touch me
and feel part of something. But, if there is somebody out there who
means me harm, I don't want to dwell on it. I can't live like that,
in fear that something might happen to me. And I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy died at the age of 42 just 30 years ago.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   People have asked many times since whether he was always as
dour, demanding and humorless as they remember him.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect, it makes me laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Dour and demanding at times, OK. But humorless? Not hardly. He
never went out of his way to make you laugh, and he despised foul
language and dirty jokes and always walked away from them. But he
could crack us up, and he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, Kennedy emulated Harry Truman's triumphant
whistlestopping of 1948 by riding a train dubbed ``The Wabash
Cannonball'' for a spell. Ethel Kennedy joined us and, when we
stopped at Warren G. Harding's hometown of Marion, she saw me
interviewing people in the crowd and waved.
</P>
<P>
   Back aboard, Kennedy was looking out the rear at a German
television crew stranded on the tracks, glum and forlorn, as the
train gathered speed. Nobody could empathize like Kennedy. He
appeared genuinely distressed as he asked, ``Will they catch up
with us someplace?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't,'' I said, ``they don't belong in this business.
Besides. It's your fault they missed the train.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' I said. ``You know that part in your set speech where
you say, `As George Bernard Shaw once said, ``Some men see things
as they are and ask why _ I see things that never were and ask why
not?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you left that out this time. Senator, I don't know what
those words mean to you, but to us they mean, `Run for the
train!'''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, at a stop outside a very small town where only a
few farmers, thumbs in the straps of their bib overalls, showed up,
he hurried through his speech to the climax and, voice rising
dramatically, declared, ``As George Bernard Shaw once said _ `Run
for the train!'''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's reputation as a sourpuss probably arose from innate
shyness as well as from the role he assigned himself in the Kennedy
clan. He was the family naysayer.
</P>
<P>
   He braved the limelight when he had to, but he never got over
his stage fright. He made hundreds of speeches, and yet his hands
never stopped trembling. He could sweat through a fresh shirt at a
single television appearance, and he usually did.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary TV host Jack Paar had Kennedy on his show many
times.
</P>
<P>
   They worked a routine whereby Kennedy would change to a clean
shirt after the show and leave the damp one behind. Paar would take
it home to his wife, who would wash and iron it and have it ready
for the next time.
</P>
<P>
   When Paar decided it was time to retire, he called Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do?'' Kennedy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Paar mumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Kennedy said, ``you could always open a laundry.''

YOUNG LAWYERS PLANS HIKE TO ONE OF EARTH'S HIGHEST HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Douglas Gerhardt spent minutes putting
on boots, a fleece jacket, wind pants, ropes and spiked iron shoe
plates called crampons, grabbed an ice ax and stepped outside. The
burglar alarm beeped.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife will kill me if I ruin the carpet,'' he said, taking
care with the crampons as he closed the sliding door, quelling the
alarm. Dressed in as much gear as an astronaut, he posed in a
grassy backyard outfitted with bird feeder, deck and barbecue
grill.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Gerhardt was a suburban commando. But at 18,000 feet in
the Caucasus Mountains of southwestern Russia, the layers will
prove useful _ no, essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says here: `More than 50 percent of those attempting to
climb (Mount) Elbrus turn back due to high altitude, wind and
cold,''' he said moments later, clad in jeans and an Oxford shirt
and reading the travel literature at his kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhardt, 31, leaves July 19 for Mount Elbrus, at 18,481 feet
the highest point in Europe. He will join a group led by
Seattle-based REI Adventures to scale one of the world's Seven
Summits, so-named because they represent the highest points in each
continent.
</P>
<P>
   The climber, an attorney and lobbyist for the School
Administrators Association of New York State, is quick to emphasize
that Elbrus is not the people-eating Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian peak is a good 10,000 feet lower than the Asian
summit, and it is unlikely climbers will become afflicted by the
accumulation of fluids in lungs more common at higher elevations.
</P>
<P>
   Elbrus does not require the specialized ice climbing techniques
needed to scale Everest and Alaska's Mount McKinley, and also lacks
some their other extremes: cost and time among them. Permits for
Everest can run in the tens of thousands of dollars and like other
elite mountains, it demands months of work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a time of year when thousands of visitors will flock
to his own town for fun, Gerhardt is aware his summer place to be
is an unusual choice.
</P>
<P>
   His two-week vacation will cost more than $5,000, a good share
of it that will go to insulate his body against the elements. The
expense probably means no more trips this year, for himself or his
wife Pam, who isn't even going on this one. And, Elbrus is
certainly more dangerous than, say, Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there's a selfishness to the endeavor. I've only
been married a year and a half and my wife isn't coming along,''
conceded Gerhardt, who stands 5-feet-7-inches and weighs 161
pounds. ``But I see it as a risk, not as life threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   The group of six climbers will fly to Moscow before catching a
transfer flight to Mineralniye Vody, a town named for its mineral
waters. On the fourth and fifth day, climbers will take day hikes
at ever higher elevations, arriving at their final base camp and
then, one hopes, the summit.
</P>
<P>
   At 18,481 feet, Elbrus is a gentle-sloped volcano in the center
of the Caucasus range, near the Russian-Georgian border. Its jagged
peaks resemble the Swiss Alps, its terrain recommended for the most
physically fit.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures can range from 60 to minus 20. Mountain sickness is
a threat, along with unscheduled storms. The REI itinerary reserves
day eight for ``summit attempt,'' not simply ``summit,'' followed
the next day by another attempt and then a ``reserve'' day in case
the weather isn't amenable the first two times.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the up and down can take between nine and 15 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Though undoubtedly a risk taker, Gerhardt said he is not one to
be lured to the top if weather and his own physical limitations
suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Respect for the outdoors is a lesson he wishes more people would
heed. People twist ankles and they die doing what he is about to
do.
</P>
<P>
   But the drama is part of what drives him, Gerhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like my boss said about this trip, `You'll go higher than
anyone I know.'''

TEXAS CONSIDERS REGULATING PRODUCT USED IN POPULAR HERBAL
SUPPLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Seeking to boost his daily workouts at the gym,
Jeff Bowers turned recently to a popular herbal supplement to
increase his metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers bought the ephedrine-based product, Ripped Fuel, at a
health food store in San Antonio. But after only a few days of
using it as directed to try and heighten athletic performance and
burn fat, Bowers suffered an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel my heart pounding through my shirt, my hands were
jittery and I was hyperventilating, so my roommate took me to the
emergency room,'' he recalled in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the Ripped Fuel with me, and before I even opened it
up, the nurse guessed what it was,'' he said. ``She said I wasn't
the first whom she'd seen with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving more than 1,400 similar, ephedrine-related
complaints from people across the state, the Texas Department of
Health is considering classifying the stimulant as a dangerous drug
and requiring a prescription for most products containing it.
</P>
<P>
   Banning ephedrine from over-the-counter sales would affect the
multimillion-dollar, herbal-supplement industry in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its products include diet aids, athletic
performance-boosters and many ``herbal ecstasy'' intoxicants that
teen-agers buy at convenience stores to get an amphetamine-like
``buzz'' or ``high.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of non-prescription ephedrine products sold for asthma,
such as Primatene and some nasal decongestants, would not fall
under the proposed new regulations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight deaths in Texas and more than 40 nationwide have
been linked to ephedrine _ a stimulant found in certain Asian
plants _ said Cynthia Culmo of the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say you can determine a safe amount (for over-the-counter
sale) is incorrect,'' Culmo said. ``The only amount we see as safe
is zero.''
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Health committee met Wednesday to accept public
comment on the regulation change. More than 150 people testified at
the hearing, with an overwhelming majority against requiring
prescription sales of ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Most who testified were connected to the industry that provides
ephedrine-based dietary supplements or stimulants. The witnesses
pleaded with the state to back down from the proposal and instead
consider a compromise that, among other things, would restrict
sales of ephedrine-based products to minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health is not expected to rule on the possible
changes until this fall.
</P>
<P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Banning over-the-counter sales of ephedrine would only hurt
consumers and independent business distributors, while allowing
larger drug companies to profit, said Phillip Sindler of the
Dallas-based Wellness International Network, which sells dietary
supplements, including the stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a health issue. It's an issue of where is the profit
going to go,'' Sindler told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 companies in the Texas market ephedrine-based
products, which constitute a multimillion industry in the state,
according to Michael Ellis, president of Metabolife International.
</P>
<P>
   Although other states have restricted some sales of ephedrine
products, Texas' proposal is by far the most far-reaching, Ellis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shocked us,'' he said, stressing that there is no medical
evidence that ephedrine products cause adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis and Dr. Ted Farber, a toxicologist for the dietary
supplement industry, disputed the number of complaints and deaths
Culmo said were possibly linked to ephedrine products.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration originally had reported it was
investigating more than 40 deaths possibly related to ephedrine,
Farber said. But recently, the federal agency revised that number
to only two, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA spokeswoman did not respond to a request for the correct
number.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA currently is considering prohibiting the marketing of
dietary supplements containing 8 milligrams or more of ephedrine
per dose. The agency also is looking at requiring product labels
that instruct consumers not to use the product for more than seven
days.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence ephedrine is safe, Ellis cited an ongoing study by
Dr. Patricia Daly of the Harvard Medical School on the effects of a
supplement containing caffeine and ephedra, an herb from which
ephedrine is extracted.
</P>
<P>
   The incomplete study, paid for by companies that market
ephedrine products, has found no adverse effects so far on
patients, Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   The death about two months ago of a 15-year-old California girl
who was taking an ephedrine-based stimulant also has highlighted
the ongoing debate over the safety of such products. Rosanna Porras
reportedly took Ripped Fuel capsules before collapsing at soccer
practice.
</P>
<P>
   She later died, and California officials are still investigating
the possibility that the herbal supplement caused her death. The
company that markets Ripped Fuel has said it does not believe its
product was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers supports the move to ban such products from
over-the-counter sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'll admit that part of it's because of my own ignorance
for trusting some 18-year-old who recommended the stuff at the
health food store,'' he said. ``But these companies are duping
people because they stand to make a lot of money, while this stuff
is killing people.''

NEW BOWMORE SCOTCH UNTAMED AND TERRIFIC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The North Sea roared and spit its cold, gray fury as I stood at
water's edge. The wind rocked me back on my heels, stinging my
face. My teeth chattered like shuffled dominoes despite the
overcoat, wool suit and cashmere sweater.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't care; I was happy as a clam (albeit a stone-cold
one).
</P>
<P>
   I was standing on the beach, if you can call it that, in the
Orkney Islands, north of Scotland. It was November, and mister, it
was raw. In a moment I would join my group for a ``ceiligh,'' a
``musical evening,'' in the salon of the hotel in the seaport town
of Kirkwall. A small group of U.S. visitors was being entertained
by the Orkney Strathspey and Reel Society. This was a local group,
and the toe-tapping music was the real MacCoy.
</P>
<P>
   To my dying day I'll never forget that night: icy winds outside,
warm camaraderie inside.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention we were drinking some of the finest whisky in the
world?
</P>
<P>
   Single-malt scotch, of course. Several brands were on the
sideboard, and they were free-flowing. I sampled the ones from
Orkney first, and the Highland Park, especially, was memorable. But
my favorite scotches continue to be from the western Scottish
islands, specifically those from Islay.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with blended scotches, mind you, but the single
malts offer more complexity if less finesse. When you talk
single-malt scotches, you talk about their regions.
</P>
<P>
   Single-malt scotches come in varying styles, usually dictated by
their geography. In my tasting experience, going from Islay in the
west to the Highlands in the east, single-malt whiskies get
smoother, lighter, less peaty _ more ... civilized.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why I like the Islay (EYE-lah) malts so. At their
best, they're untamed, unforgiving, unrepentant _ and magnificent.
It's true that some of the Islays have been compromised to tame
that wild, peaty, smoky iodine streak, but others play that
pungency to the kilt _ er, hilt. If Mel Gibson had tippled a wee
dram in ``Braveheart'' before he went off to fight the British, you
know it would've been an Islay malt ...
</P>
<P>
   It's been awhile since I stood on that wind-scored shore and had
what was left of my hair blown south to the Azores. But one day _
soon _ I'm going back to Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll head west next time, west to Islay and maybe the isle
of Jura, and visit my favorite distilleries, such as Lagavulin and
Laphroaig.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll be stopping at Bowmore, too, which has just released a
couple of new single malts, one of which is sensational. It's a
``Cask Strength'' Islay malt _ 112 proof, can you believe? _ that
has power and complexity and enough iodine, heather, seaweed and
peat in a single sip to carve its initials on your taste buds for
life.
</P>
<P>
   There's no age for the Bowmore ``Cask Strength'' Single Malt
listed on the label, but it's roughly 15 years old. And the whisky
was aged in bourbon hogsheads, so there's no sherry-cask nuances to
butt in on the cornucopia of flavors already there.
</P>
<P>
   This is a serious whisky. And at a suggested price of $50 or so,
it's expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But Father's Day is in a couple of weeks, and since this Bowmore
``Cask Strength'' Single Malt is obviously a special-occasion
potable _ well, the connection seems obvious.
</P>
<P>
   There are other Bowmore scotches already in the market, however,
including the Bowmore ``Legend'' (eight years old), plus Bowmore
12-, 17-and 21-Year-Old. And there is a ``Cask Strength'' Bowmore
bottled by Cadenhead available, too, but it's pushing the
$100-a-bottle mark.
</P>
<P>
   So: If you happen to be in western Scotland ere long, and you
see a solitary fellow walking along the beach, stop and ask him
what's in that sterling flask in his hip pocket. If it's Bowmore
``Cask Strength'' Single Malt, well, I'll be happy to share.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth _ straight, no chaser ...
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Father's Day, here are a few more ideas for Dad on
his special day. There are several companies that specialize in
wine-related paraphernalia; these suggestions are from the Wine
Enthusiast catalog:
</P>
<P>
   Riedel makes wine glasses for every conceivable kind of wine,
and they come in three price categories, ranging from $8 or so a
stem to $70 a stem.
</P>
<P>
   If Dad is serious about his wine but has no practical place to
store it, consider a self-contained cooling unit such as EuroCave.
These start in the three-figure range and go up quickly, but they
do store your wine in a cooled, humidity-controlled unit, away from
light and vibration.
</P>
<P>
   If Dad likes an occasional post-prandial brandy, a crystal
decanter looks great and will keep his best cognac or armagnac
available at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Toss out that cheesy corkscrew and buy Dad a Screwpull, probably
the best cork-puller ever. The basic models (which work just fine,
thank you), start around $15, although there's a super-deluxe model
for about $130.
</P>
<P>
   Just starting out learning about wine? One of the best primers
is ``The Windows on the World Complete Wine Course'' (Sterling,
$24.99). It's that publishing rarity: informative AND fun.
</P>
<P>
   Other gift ideas: wine racks, wine-logo aprons for the dad who
likes to barbecue, small wine-cork bulletin boards and trivets and
wine coasters.
</P>
<P>
   To get a Wine Enthusiast catalog, call 800-356-8466 or write to
Box 39, Pleasantville, N.Y. 10570; the Web site is
www.wineenthusiast.com.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, make it easy on yourself: Just get Dad a bottle of his
favorite wine or maybe even two or three. It's his day, and the old
boy's worth it.

IT'S TIME TO PLAN SUMMER PARTIES  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ June. You remember it well. School is out, shoes are
off, the swimming pool is open, and the Popsicle man cometh round
every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As adults, however, life and entertaining are not always so
simple. Like children, we want to kick back and celebrate the
advent of summer, yet our sense of decorum tells us that is not as
easy as squeezing into cutoffs, popping the top on a cool one and
throwing a hunk of meat on the grill. Perhaps if we're camping out
_ but city, and even country, life today is a tad more civilized
than that hippie '70s version of backyard partying.
</P>
<P>
   Today's flaired pants may have Gucci labels, our capris may be
silk and even our paper plates are loaded with style. Why not take
advantage of the options available to entertain in a grand manner,
color-coordinating disposable paperware, your party favors and even
your summer fashions and accessories?
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's your party and you can shine if you want to.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GARDEN PARTY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mackenzie-Childs, the Aurora, N.Y.-based company famed for
wildly decorative home accessories, china and painted furnishings,
also excels in patterned paperware pretty enough to grace tables at
a wedding reception.
</P>
<P>
   With coordinated plates, napkins and cups, Mackenzie-Childs
offers so many florals, stripes, checks, dots and garnishes that
your guests will not miss the kinds of china and crystal that need
to be washed by hand.
</P>
<P>
   For table decorations, arrange colorful English garden-variety
flowers in clear glass vases, clay pots or tin pails. For
inexpensive tablecloths, look in discount stores for colorful flat
bedsheets. Or sprinkle a table covered in a bright paper cloth with
paper flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A salad menu is perfect for this kind of party, with fresh
berries and cake for dessert and iced tea to drink.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose highly decorative paperware, do not make the
mistake of matching your hostess ensemble to the patterns in the
plates and napkins. Stick to clothing in bright or pastel solid
colors. Choose silk shantung and patent-leather sandals for shine,
and some of today's newly colorful cosmetics, including pink,
fuchsia and orange lipsticks and blue and green eyeshadows.
</P>
<P>
   Party favors might be Mackenzie-Childs cotton sock coin purses
or large sock shoulder bags, silk-flower-topped boxes of candies or
a tiny bottle of a fresh ``green'' fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COUNTRY SHINDIG &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Summer is a fine time to show off a country home and garden, but
make entertaining easy on yourself with red, white and blue paper
products that are tasteful without overdoing your theme.
</P>
<P>
   Ideal Home Range offers combination red bandanna print and blue
check plates. Add coordinating prints and solids, with paper
napkins or cloth bandannas.
</P>
<P>
   Country-flavored party favors _ spiced pecans, chocolate chip
cookies, note pads, decorative magnets _ in blue-checked paper
totes. If it tends to be buggy in your area, light citronella
candles and add bug repellents and anti-itch agents to the goodie
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Pick flowers such as zinnias, marigolds, sunflowers, daylilies
and bachelor buttons, massing them in tin pails or watering cans
with herbs such as rosemary, basil and pennyroyal, all natural bug
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Make a scarecrow to point the way to your back yard, and if you
have a garden growing, allow guests to help with the harvest for
lunch or dinner. If your place is a haven for birds, station your
bird books on the table so city-slicker guests can identify the
various species.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the menu simple. Sun tea and wines. Grilled chicken or pork
chops, baked beans, cole slaw or green salad and jalapeno corn
bread. Shine with a dessert you prepare ahead _ pecan-covered ice
cream balls served with a choice of chocolate or butterscotch
toppings.
</P>
<P>
   What to wear? Jeans or a denim sundress are always appropriate
in the country, but white cottons and linens look and feel cooler.
You might want to shop for eyelet embroideries or a white knit,
long dress to wear with a pointelle sweater tied round the neck or
waist.
</P>
<P>
   If fire ants have infested your part of the country, do your
guests a favor and advise them ahead of time to wear socks and
tennis shoes and leave the sandals at home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
POOL PARTY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amscan's line of paperware includes almost-neon-colored
tableware and invitations to match in a pool party motif. Cover
your table in a whisk-away fuchsia plastic ``cloth'' or a bright
flat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   For novel table decorations, buy bright but inexpensive
flip-flops and sunglasses, and for party favors, fill colorful
paper totes with lip lubricant, one of the new combination sun- and
bug-proofing lotions, melt-proof candies and fun items such as
yo-yos and, if you dare, water guns.
</P>
<P>
   Pick your swimsuit to coordinate with the colors from Amscan's
pool-party papers _ blue, hot pink, green, yellow and orange _ but
make it floral, striped or polka-dotted. Pick a bright cover-up, a
pair of comfortable sandals and a hat for sun protection.
</P>
<P>
   If guests will be going directly from the pool to the table in
wet suits, drape chairs with bright terry beach towels.
</P>
<P>
   Hot dogs cooked on the grill, with pots of chili and sauerkraut
for toppers, make the simplest menu. Add a variety of chips and a
platter of raw vegetables, but skip the potato salad, which is
often difficult to maintain at a safe temperature in the outdoors.
For dessert, offer cupcakes with happy faces, M&AMP;M cookies and a
bowl of fresh fruit salad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WILD TIMES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contempo and Creative Papers offer animal print paperware to get
your summer party off to a roaring start. These animal prints work
well with solid brown or brown-striped cloths and flowers in
yellow, orange and red. For the most elegant table, set your paper
plates on an antique kuba cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical flowers, such as birds of paradise, and banana leaves
and palm fronds are easily arranged in plain vases or cans of water
hidden in baskets. Add African or Indian masks to the table and
dcor, and light citronella flares in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a menu that includes shish kebobs that guests assemble
and cook on their own. Ingredients might include three choices of
meat and six to eight vegetables and fruits, with a choice of
basting and dipping sauces, a cold rice or couscous dish, and a
green salad.
</P>
<P>
   Make your choice of clothing on the simply elegant side. While
the temptation might be to wear animal spots and stripes, resist
the urge. If you let your invitation spell out your tribal/safari
theme, allow your guests to show off their collections of animal
prints while you confine yourself to a beautifully bare, black
linen sundress or a figure-hugging neutral striped knit. Wear
sandals and treat yourself to a pedicure and bright polish.
</P>
<P>
   For party favors, look for decorative boxes and fill them with
chocolate-covered coffee beans or strings of ethnic beads.

   WASHINGTON _ When Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was trying to make up
his mind about anything of moment, he took on a look of pain and
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to sweat more and to lower his head and stare off into
space and twist his hands a lot. He was never a fashion plate, but
at such times he seemed to grow more ungroomed, and too consumed by
thought to notice.
</P>
<P>
   He was that way in January 1968, when Look magazine photographer
Stanley Tretick and I, as Look Washington editor, were hanging out
with him, practically day and night. He was wrestling with a
decision on whether to oppose incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson in the
1968 Democratic presidential primaries. His head told him it would
be folly, but his heart said do it.
</P>
<P>
   All of us watching him up close understood the struggle. Tretick
and I were closer than most because we had a deal with him, to
cover him ``from the inside out,'' as Theodore White had done in
1960 for his book, ``The Making of a President.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against running were overwhelming. Even though
Vietnam War casualties and protests had severely undercut Johnson's
earlier popularity, he still had the power of incumbency. And
everybody knew he could be a formidable no-quarter, no-prisoners
campaigner. He had scornfully, humiliatingly rejected Kennedy's
suggestion to pick him as his vice-presidential nominee in 1968,
and any idea of another confrontation was chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``O-oh-oh, what he would do to me!'' Kennedy said once,
grimacing, almost to himself, as he responded to the umpteenth
question about whether he would run.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed, but said nothing more. He had an agenda _ end the
war and heal its wounds, work more imaginatively to be rid of
racial strife, try to halt the standoff with Cuba and the Cold War
with the Soviet Union, resolve to boost early education,
reinvigorate the war on poverty, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not know how to get the power to achieve that. And,
despite all the pressures from liberal well-wishers, he did not see
how he could beat Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Tretick and I flew into Rochester, N.Y., with him and Ethel
Kennedy in January 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He was making duty rounds as New York's junior senator, a Polish
American breakfast here, an Italian American supper there. But, as
he had since he toured the country campaigning on behalf of
Democratic candidates in 1966, he was testing the waters for a
possible run at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we landed, a raging blizzard set in, and all aircraft
were grounded. It took three hours to feel our way to Syracuse in
the blinding blanket of snow. We had a wonderful time, talking some
shop but mostly just talking.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his wife had had dinner the night before with Harold
MacMillan, the former British prime minister. To my great surprise,
because I knew Kennedy had a tin ear and could sing only one song
(``Jingle Bells''), he beautifully mimicked MacMillan's upper-class
accent, phrasing and cadence in repeating stories he had told at
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' he said, suddenly serious. ``You guys keep saying I
have to run, I have to run. Well, it is not just me I would be
deciding for. If I announce, people would come running to the
campaign. They would quit jobs they love and leave their families
to work in the campaign. There would be divorces, and some people
would meet and get married. Hundreds, thousands of good people
would be affected. It isn't just me. It's a lot of people. And they
would never be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   As the months went by and we kept gnawing at him, he took on a
deeper look of distress. He did not budge even when Minnesota Sen.
Eugene J. McCarthy got in to challenge Johnson and attracted a
whole flock of liberal activists away from Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   He was gathering a team, though, just in case. By this time, I
was pretty convinced he would run. Look assigned Tretick and me to
do the story. But I could not get a definite yes or no out of him,
even for my own background and guidance, and the deadline for the
story was bearing down.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote two stories. One said he had decided to run and
explained why, in a grand display of punditry, and the other
confidently detailed why he did not run.
</P>
<P>
   That left the problem of the ``sell line'' to go with Tretick's
splendid portrait of Kennedy on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   It was major, because the cover was printed two weeks ahead of
the rest of the magazine, and there was no time left. After much
thrashing about, I came up with a one-size-fits-all: ``Bobby
Kennedy: How He Made Up His Mind about 1968.''
</P>
<P>
   We rolled the cover with that. But we could not get a commitment
from him until McCarthy won a surprising 45 percent of the vote
against Johnson in the New Hampshire primary, a prelude to
president's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   I called Kennedy early the next morning and he said he would let
me know the following day at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where he was
giving a speech. We held the presses at Look, the first time we had
ever done that in the magazine's history, at a cost of $25,000 per
day.
</P>
<P>
   At Saratoga Springs, as Kennedy entered the hotel where he was
to speak, I fought my way through a mob of reporters and
photographers to his side. I did not want to tip my hand, and so I
shouted, ``Is it up or down?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked puzzled a second and then made a thumbs-up gesture. I
raced to a telephone and told the Look printer in Chicago to go
with the ``go'' story. It was as close to a scoop as I could get.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy formally announced his candidacy March 16 in the Senate
Caucus Room, the same place from which his brother John began his
quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Kennedy marched in the St. Patrick's Day parades
in Boston and New York, and we all set out on the whirlwind, 81-day
campaign that ended in that hotel kitchen in Los Angeles the night
he won the California primary and seemed certain to get the
nomination and probably the election.
</P>
<P>
   When the shots were fired, I came up behind Sirhan Sirhan. I got
him under one leg and, with others, wrestled with him for the gun.
There were too many big, strong people in that melee and I
disengaged and went to Kennedy. Mrs. Kennedy was bending over him.
I saw the wound, in the mastoid area just behind his ear. I knew
then that all the hopes and dreams would vanish.
</P>
<P>
   And as Mrs. Kennedy, security man Bill Barry, campaign worker
Fred Dutton and I took him to the hospital in the ambulance, I
thought of what he had said once on the campaign trail, scolding
aides for being over-protective of him in crowds:
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people don't want to hurt me. They just want to touch me
and feel part of something. But, if there is somebody out there who
means me harm, I don't want to dwell on it. I can't live like that,
in fear that something might happen to me. And I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy died at the age of 42 just 30 years ago.

</P>
<P>
   People have asked many times since whether he was always as
dour, demanding and humorless as they remember him.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect, it makes me laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Dour and demanding at times, OK. But humorless? Not hardly. He
never went out of his way to make you laugh, and he despised foul
language and dirty jokes and always walked away from them. But he
could crack us up, and he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, Kennedy emulated Harry Truman's triumphant
whistlestopping of 1948 by riding a train dubbed ``The Wabash
Cannonball'' for a spell. Ethel Kennedy joined us and, when we
stopped at Warren G. Harding's hometown of Marion, she saw me
interviewing people in the crowd and waved.
</P>
<P>
   Back aboard, Kennedy was looking out the rear at a German
television crew stranded on the tracks, glum and forlorn, as the
train gathered speed. Nobody could empathize like Kennedy. He
appeared genuinely distressed as he asked, ``Will they catch up
with us someplace?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't,'' I said, ``they don't belong in this business.
Besides. It's your fault they missed the train.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' I said. ``You know that part in your set speech where
you say, `As George Bernard Shaw once said, ``Some men see things
as they are and ask why _ I see things that never were and ask why
not?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you left that out this time. Senator, I don't know what
those words mean to you, but to us they mean, `Run for the
train!'''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, at a stop outside a very small town where only a
few farmers, thumbs in the straps of their bib overalls, showed up,
he hurried through his speech to the climax and, voice rising
dramatically, declared, ``As George Bernard Shaw once said _ `Run
for the train!'''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's reputation as a sourpuss probably arose from innate
shyness as well as from the role he assigned himself in the Kennedy
clan. He was the family naysayer.
</P>
<P>
   He braved the limelight when he had to, but he never got over
his stage fright. He made hundreds of speeches, and yet his hands
never stopped trembling. He could sweat through a fresh shirt at a
single television appearance, and he usually did.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary TV host Jack Paar had Kennedy on his show many
times.
</P>
<P>
   They worked a routine whereby Kennedy would change to a clean
shirt after the show and leave the damp one behind. Paar would take
it home to his wife, who would wash and iron it and have it ready
for the next time.
</P>
<P>
   When Paar decided it was time to retire, he called Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do?'' Kennedy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Paar mumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Kennedy said, ``you could always open a laundry.''

STOCK MARKET GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW DOWN

<P>
   Q. My husband and I are in our late 40s and our main financial
goal is to retire in 12 years when our $85,000 mortgage is paid
off. We earn $65,000 combined, and have these savings: $70,000 in
stock IRAs to which we make the maximum allowed contributions,
$44,500 in eight taxable mutual fund accounts, mostly dominated by
stocks; $62,000 in blue-chip stocks, and $50,000 in a company
savings plan, with 80 percent of this in Textron stock. What would
you estimate the value of these investments in 12 years if no
contributions were made beyond fully funding the IRAs? Should I
sell some of the individual stocks, perhaps to pay down the
mortgage?
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Sharon
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UFanswer &LR; If we assume 10 percent average annual growthover that
time, you would have $800,287.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that while I believe 10 percent is reasonable for
long-term stock market growth, I'm not particularly happy with it
for the next 12 years. I've long thought it was time for the market
to take a rest, and the way things seem to be going that rest might
last for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, from the highs of the late 1960s, it took about a
decade for the Dow to return to those levels (although to be fair,
the Dow is a narrow measure, and those statistics don't include
dividends).
</P>
<P>
   The point is that it would be only prudent to consider average
returns of 8 percent over those 12 years, which would mean the
combined accounts would reach $649,039.
</P>
<P>
   What does all of this mean? If you have other retirement assets,
such as pensions, these would combine with Social Security to put
you in a pretty comfortable situation in retirement, whatever the
market does.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no pension, I suggest you keep plugging away _ to
the company savings plan and to the taxable fund accounts as well
as the IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   I have no major problem with the portfolio, which mainly
consists of solid large-cap funds. And selling off any of the
common stock likely won't cause pain on tax day.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you want to adopt a modest alternative plan to selling
stock to pay down the mortgage: redirecting all dividends from the
stock accounts to mortgage repayments.
</P>
<P>
   If you do that, however, it will reduce those growth
projections, which presume reinvestment of all returns. You should
probably continue to reinvest these dividends, not in more of the
common stock but in a balanced fund account such as the Vanguard
Wellington position you already hold, treating this as the first
step in a long series of moves designed to make the portfolio more
conservative and more yield-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Four years ago I opened a Uniform Gifts to Minors account for
my new great-grandson. Based on a recommendation from one of your
columns, I chose Vanguard Index Value fund. It has done well, as
you know. I now have a new great-granddaughter and wish to open a
similar account for her. Do you still recommend this fund?
</P>
<P>
   P.F., Chula Vista, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UFanswer &LR; Yes, and I think the numbers back me up.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Index Value was launched Nov. 2, 1992, and from that
time through April 30 it has averaged 21.98 percent annual total
returns. On the same day a sibling fund, Vanguard Index Growth, was
also launched, and its comparable record is 21.72 percent average
annual total returns.
</P>
<P>
   The two funds have complementary portfolios, with Index Value
holding the two-thirds of the Standard &AMP; Poor's stock with the
lowest price-to-book ratios, and Index Growth holding the remaining
issues.
</P>
<P>
   My distrust of the current market, of course, makes me favor
Index Value particularly.
</P>
<P>
   My assumption is that when stocks come under pressure, those
with the higher yields and the lower price-to-earnings ratios will
be relatively stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The last reports from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows an average
portfolio P/E of 21.4 for Index Value, compared with 32.1 for Index
Growth. Yields were 1.5 percent for Index Value and 0.9 percent for
Index Growth _ both puny, of course, but a good reason why the more
defensive Index Value is the better bet now.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, though, I should point out that Morningstar
gives Index Growth five stars, its top grade, while Index Value
wins only four, meaning above average; these ratings are entirely
statistical, and the bulk of the difference can probably be found
in those five-year comparative results.

TEN YEARS AND A NEW OUTLOOK LATER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago, I stood on stage at the Boston Public Library and
looked out at a sea of faces. It was one of the best and yet one of
the worst afternoons of my life.
</P>
<P>
   I'd had a collection of columns published that year and the
Globe had been good enough to choose me as one of five speakers in
the 1988 Globe Book Fair. I'd attended two earlier talks, observing
Nicholas Daniloff and Edward Abbey as they signed their books and
chatted with readers. Neither one of them had quite filled the hall
so when I arrived for my talk 15 minutes early and found that the
library guards were already turning people away, my heart started
pounding in my chest.
</P>
<P>
   It was early in my career. Writing from home, I had no idea how
many people read my column or how anyone felt about it. My only
feedback from my editors at the Globe so far had been, ``No
complaints.'' I didn't hear from readers that often back then, and
 &UR; rras I pressed past groups of women trying to talk their way in, I
saw their presence as an antidote to my shaky self-esteem. I felt a
surge of triumph. ``This will show everyone,'' I thought. I'd no
longer be invisible. I'd arrived.
</P>
<P>
   They say pride goeth before a fall. In my case, it was
immediate.
</P>
<P>
   As I made my way backstage, someone official approached me. The
woman flashed a tight smile, then apologized. Sorry, there were no
books. They'd been ordered, but William Morrow, my publisher,
hadn't sent them. Hoping to make me feel better, I think, the woman
confided, ``We only asked for 30. It wouldn't have been enough
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Disbelief and shock welled up in me like oil gushing from an oil
well, and instinctively I tried to keep it from overflowing into
tears. I ran into the bathroom, where I tried to get control of my
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   At the very moment of my greatest success, I couldn't help but
feel that a vengeful power had deliberately cut me down to size.
I'd made the mistake of feeling important, dared to think I was
something out of the ordinary. Not only was my publisher
indifferent, but the bookstore hadn't been expecting many people to
come. Now I heard a voice from my childhood, saying, ``Serves you
right, big shot!!'' and I buried my face in my hands, trying not to
hear the laughter at my expense. How had I dared to picture myself
equal to the authors who'd appeared before me? I was a nobody, a
middle-aged suburban housewife whose column was buried in an
obscure section of the newspaper, and now I'd been properly humbled
and humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   How in the world was I going to set foot on stage?
</P>
<P>
   I swallowed to relieve the pressure in my throat. I splashed
cold water on my eyes and stared at my reddened face in the mirror.
Four hundred-plus people had come to hear me. That was solid. That
was real. Acknowledging that fact calmed me and released me from
the grip of my own contempt. Now I could experience my longing to
connect with women who knew me as I was, not as a celebrity with an
audience, but as a person in dialogue with friends. They hadn't
come to stare at some rising star, but to become part of an
informal network of women struggling with the same issues and
dreaming the same dreams. I'd spoken from the heart to all these
folks before and now they were ready to listen from the same deep
place.
</P>
<P>
   I took a deep breath and stepped back into my life.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally went on stage, I paused for a moment, gazing out
into the hall. I located various points of safety _ my two
daughters, my husband, my sister-in-law juggling my 4-month-old
nephew on her lap, my best friend Lynn _ until all the glowing eyes
in front of me dissolved into a single promise of encouragement and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   That's how I found my voice.
</P>
<P>
   By some quirk of fate, I have given exactly 300 talks between
that afternoon and next Wednesday at 6 p.m. when I'll be on stage
at the Boston Public Library once again. Another book, another
speech, but this time the speaker has a different outlook.
</P>
<P>
   I'm grateful those books never arrived. I now see that my pain
was actually an affront to my ego, which at the moment was engaged
in taking over the reins from my soul. The real triumph of that day
was an inner one and it resulted in a decision to redirect my
energies into more meaningful directions. I have come to believe
that the most satisfying place to be in this society is not in a
starring role, but linked with others in a mutuality that helps
everyone reach their goals.
</P>
<P>
   I have a simple philosophy E.M. Forster would be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only connect!''

FENCE ME IN FOR PRIVACY, GOOD LOOKS, AND SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good fences make good neighbors, saith the bard, although the
motives for putting up a fence vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   Some fences _ stockade, Cyclone, chain-link topped by razor wire
_ say, ``Keep out!'' and are designed to keep undesirables (dogs,
cats and maybe even neighbors) out, and desirables in; a fence is a
good way to keep your pet pooch from wandering.
</P>
<P>
   Such fences are put up for privacy, although they do reflect a
fortress mentality and are not a nice thing to look at.
</P>
<P>
   But most fences are indeed, neighborly, set on the line simply
to divide the properties. Low (four feet or so) picket fences are
ideal for this purpose. And, for privacy without intimidation, a
four-foot picket topped by lattice will do nicely.
</P>
<P>
   These fences also provide a good background for growing plants
and shrubs. And your neigbhor can do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman once prposed setting up a fence between his ewstate
and but neighbor didn't like the idea, even when she was informed
that this would be pickets topped by lattice; in other words, a
neighborly, friendly fence.
</P>
<P>
   But she relented, reluctantly, but was surprised and pleased
when it finally went in place. So it pays to discuss it with yur
neighbors. An added neighborly gesture, and stylish, too, is a
gate.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you put up a boundary fence, it is a good idea to build
it a tad back from the line, and pay for all of it. Sharing a
boundary fence with your neighbor can get sticky over time. Even
though you and he are friends, your friendship will not apply if
someone buys his property and wants to tear down the nice fence and
put up a brick wall, and wants you to pay for part of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are an infinite number of styles out there. Cedar is the
preferred wood; in fact some fence companies do nothing but cedar,
disdaining anything more or less. Some companies recommend
pressure-treated wood. So you can compromise: use pressure-treated
posts and rails, and cedar pickets. The cedar will last
indefinitely if it is allowed to dry out between wettings.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing? At the risk of being politically incorrect, I venture
that women, it seems, dream of a nice, white picket fence, and that
means regular staining or painting and sanding and scraping and
cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Why not leave it alone, as a fence should be? Both woods _ cedar
and pressure-treated _ will weather nicely without decaying, and
absolutey no maintenance is needed. Even spruce, often used in
economy type stockade fences, weathers well.
</P>
<P>
   And, to repeat, any wood that gets wet but is able to dry out
between wettings, will last indefinitely. The biggest failure in
fences occur in the posts, if they are cedar and buried in the
ground. Other failures may occur due to the way the fence was
built. If pickets and other components are nailed to rails so that
water collects and stays in the joints, then decay will occur.
</P>
<P>
   Fences cost $10 and up per lineal foot; about half that if you
buy the materials (at any fence builder) and put it up yourself.
</P>
<P>
   A big aid to putting up a fence these days are Post Ups, a steel
stake 24, 30 and 36 inches long and topped by as steel box big
enough to hold a 4x4 post. Such shanks are cross-shaped and
relatively easy to drive into the ground by inserting a short 4x4
in the box and driving it with a sledge hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Secure the post and you're home free.
</P>
<P>
   You have to locate the posts fairly accurately, but they are
easy to drive, if you don't run into any stones. Sometimes the
driven stake will bypass a stone, although it might slope a little,
even twist, something you can avoid by redriving the stake.
</P>
<P>
   If you hit a rock, pull up the Post Up and see if you can dig up
the rock. Avoid driving the stake come hell or high water, trying
to break through the stone or circumvent it; it almost never works,
and you will end up with a stake that has a perfect U shape at its
point. The handyman has one such bent stake in his trophy case,
just like Alvin York's rifle gun when lightning hit it. Remember
the movie?
</P>
<P>
   Building your own fence not only saves money, but allows you to
make your own design, and just as important, allows a random
spacing of posts, which may be required, depending on how many
stones you hit or the lay of the land. However random you make the
posts, don't space them more than 10 feet apart; eight is better.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, if you build a fence up or down a slope, do not
slope the fence itself; it will look very strange. All posts should
be plumb (vertical, straight up and down) and each section of rails
between posts should be level, so you will have to step the fence,
setting one section level at one height, and the second also level
at a higher or lower height, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Fences designs are infinite. Examples:
</P>
<P>
   Pickets spaced half an inch on rails for air circulation and
some privacy. Use two or three rails, depending on the height of
the fence. You can buy pickets up to six feet long, with tops that
are square, fleur de lis, plain curved or Gothic. The curved tops
are better than square ones because they shed more water than
square tops. Or, put an rail on top of the square-topped pickets,
protecting them from water.
</P>
<P>
   Set 2x4 rails between posts with joist hangers.
</P>
<P>
   A design variation is a two-foot-high strip of pressure-treated
lattice on top of four-foot pickets, giving you six feet of good
looks and privacy. Six feet is usually the maximum height for a
fence. Check with your community for height limits and other
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are board-on-board fences, with a vertical 1x6 or 1x8
on one side, spaced six or seven inches by similar boards covering
the gap. This gives nearly total privacy but allows air
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a woven fence will hit the spot. These are boards
woven along upright pieces. It will take more careful fastening to
keep the curved boards, which are under tension, from springing
back.
</P>
<P>
   Getting any fancier increases the cost, except for a picket
fence with a catenary curve or arc. Catenary is from the Latin word
katena, meaning chain. To achieve a catenary curve, suspend a chain
from two posts; it will hang naturally in a catenary curve. It will
be a natural curve whether you make it long and shallow or short
and steep. Once this curve is established, transfer it to the
pickets all in a row and cut them to match.
</P>
<P>
   A bonus for a solid fence is that it is a sound barrier, sort
of, by deflecting sounds up and away from the fence. A brick wall
would be better, but that is another story.
</P>
<P>
   Two more points:
</P>
<P>
   1. It is a tradition (no laws) for the builder to face the
smooth side toward his neighbor as a goodwill gesture. That is
nice, but thinking about it, the unsmooth side, with rails and
other structural members showing, is more interesting than the
smooth side.
</P>
<P>
   2. A long, straight fence looks nice, but may tend to lean over
after a few years. To avoid this, and to give the fence a
sculptured, architectural look, set the fence in a series of jigs
and jogs: Set one section straight and level; set another to turn
at right angles for one to two feet, then a straight line, and
another jog back to the original plane of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   This technique also helps you to make a jog aroud a tree that
sets smack in the middle of the fence line.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to paint it, don't. Instead, use a stain: a solid
color latex stain will give you a good white color; two coats are
neded, but no primer. All you have to worry about is cedar bleed.
</P>
<P>
   Or, better yet, use a semitransparent stain. One coat is needed
and you can recoat in four to five years without having to scrape
and stain. You can't get white in a semitransparent stain, but you
can get a pleasant light gray and other pastel and earth colors.
</P>
<P>
   Do fence me in!

MAIL-ORDER NURSERIES IN NORTHWEST EXPLORE NEW DIRECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The residential streets of Seattle and Portland, Ore., are alive
with front-yard rock gardens, Japanese maple groves, and clambering
clematis vines, signaling a population that can grow almost
anything. Long a national center for the wholesale shrub and tree
business, the Pacific Northwest now pulses with a new excitement.
Combining entrepreneurial spirit and ideal growing conditions, the
region has given birth to a crop of mail-order nurseries
specializing in rare and hard-to-find plants.
</P>
<P>
   With a group of fellow plant lovers, I recently criss-crossed
Washington state and Oregon on a Horticulture magazine tour of the
region's top nurseries. As plant fever tightened its grip, young
trees, shrubs, and perennials boarded along with their new owners,
filling every spare seat and many a lap.
</P>
<P>
   Because these nurseries are run by enthusiasts who started out
with large gardens and then went into business to support the
hobby, most have knockout display gardens that allowed us to see
mature specimens. The hot plants among importers and hybridizers
that will evenually be appearing in local garden centers included
epimediums, perennial geraniums, Asian jack-in-the-pulpits,
pulmonarias, and, most of all, hellebores in new colors. It seemed,
too, that breeders were more excited by colored foliage than
flowers. Everywhere we went, we saw old-fashioned flowers deemed
exciting because of foliage in new colors: feverfew and columbine
with chartreuse foliage; buttercups and cow parsnips with maroon
leaves; heuchera with three or four colors on a single leaf. Trees
and shrubs had greenery edged or flecked with white or yellow so
they looked as if they were in permanent bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in climate, shipping costs (which average about 30
percent), and the stress plants undergo when mailed are all major
reasons why it's better to buy locally grown plants when possible.
But if you're an ``early adapter'' who likes to be the first with a
trendy plant, a horticulturalist looking for the unusual or
underappreciated, or a collector focusing on a certain genre, then
this nursery list is for you. Here is the best of the Northwest:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Heirloom Old Garden Roses. &LR;  24062 N.E. Riverside Drive, St.
Paul, OR 97137; 503-538-1576; fax 503-538-5902; open daily. The
lush $5 catalog has color photos of many of the 700 varieties of
roses offered. Plants are propagated and shipped year-round.
</P>
<P>
   This 12-year-old rose nursery is one of the few that propagates
and sells rose varieties grown on their own roots. (Lowes Own Root
Roses, 6 Sheffield Road, Nashua, NH 03062, is another.) That's
important, says owner Louise Clements, because the technique keeps
roses free of a virus that affects many roses commercially grafted
onto diseased rootstock. Clements's customers say her roses are
longer lived and more vigorous. Fifteen hundred roses are on
display on her family's farm near Portland, which is well worth a
visit between May and August. Old-fashioned roses are prized for
fragrance and the lemon scented resin on old moss roses melds with
the clove fragrance of Rosa moschata and the myrrh of David Austin
roses as you wander through 3 acres of color and perfume.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Collector's Nursery. &LR;  16804 NE 102d Ave., Battle Ground, WA
98604; 360-574-3832; fax 360-571-8540; catalog $2; Ships spring and
fall.
</P>
<P>
   This nine-year-old home nursery is doing fantastic things. Bill
Janssen was a gem prospector before he switched to searching out
exotic plants. He breeds hostas. His wife Diana Reeck breeds
epimediums. She's an ex-hippy and amateur botanist who's gone to
Yunnan Province in southwest China twice to collect rare seeds.
He's an artist who has made the garden his palette. In their areas
of specialization _ woodland plants and dwarf conifers _ their
offerings are rare, exotic, and inexpensive. If you want to add
some scary-looking Asian jack-in-the-pulpits to your staid woodland
garden, this is the catalog to order. And the 2-acre home display
garden is a marvel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Russell Graham Nursery &LR; , 4030 Eagle Crest Road NW, Salem, OR
97304. Spring and fall catalogs $2. Shipping resumes in late
August.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne and Russell Graham _ he's a retired motor vehicle
department manager _ believe in low overhead and low tech. They
have a devoted following among gardeners looking for hard-to-find
woodland plants, field grown and shipped bare rooted. This is the
place for Cardiocrinum giganteum bulbs, English violas, primroses,
or woodland wildflowers at prices just short of amazing. If you
visit, you'll find a modest old frame house and barn, perennial
gardens, and bluebirds and tree swallows skimming over meadows
against a breathtaking view of Mount Hood. Write for visiting days.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gossler Farms Nursery &LR; , 1200 Weaver Road, Springfield, OR
97478-9691; 541-746-3922 for orders or questions 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Pacific Standard Time; fax 541-744-7924; catalog $2; shipping
season October to mid-December and February to April; visits by
appointment only.
</P>
<P>
   This family home business includes three homes, one each for
brothers Roger and Eric, and one for their mom, Marj, linked by an
exquisitely designed display garden of 5,000 plants.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to look pretty hard to find a nurseryman as nice or
as knowledgeable as Roger Gossler, especially on his specialty,
ornamental trees and shrubs. If you call him up and he doesn't have
what you want, he says he'll try to suggest someone who does. He
grows everything he sells in his home garden before he markets it
to make sure it performs well, making this catalog small but
select. One of the plants he's currently testing is a mutant yellow
Boston ivy called Parthenocissus tricuspidata Fenway Park that
Arnold Arboretum horticulturalist Peter Del Tredici spotted growing
near the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greer Gardens &LR; , 1280 Goodpasture Island Road, Eugene, OR
97401-1794; customer service, 541-686-8266; fax, 541-686-0910; to
order the $3 catalog with full-color photographs, 800-548-0111;
open seven days a week; shipping year-round.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This is the catalog to order if you like one-stop shopping
with color pictures, though with more than 3,000 trees, shrubs,
vines, perennials, orchids, bamboos, ornamental grasses, and bonsai
and rock garden plants offered, only a tiny percentage can be
pictured. This is a large traditional nursery that tries to offer
everything and uses subcontractors to grow much of its stock.
Still, within the soup-to-nuts framework, the areas of special
depth reflect owner Harold Greer's passions: rhododendrons (700!),
Japanese maples, magnolias. Favorite features are the discounted
``frugal-dendron'' and ``frugal azaleas'' listings. ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's on an Egg McMuffin Budget,'' the catalog calls them. The
3-acre display garden features many mature trees and is open to the
public year round.

<P>
   &UR; Forestfarm &LR; , 990 Tetherow Road, Williams, OR 97544-9599;
orders, 541-846-7269; problems and fax orders, 541-846-6963;
catalog $4, ship air year round.
</P>
<P>
   This nursery is more like a cause than a business. While
everyone else is growing trendy hellebores, idealistic Ray and Peg
Prag try to grow useful plants that other nurseries disdain. Their
catalog is full of little horticulture lessons that make good
reading. Offerings are coded to tell you if a plant is useful for
basketweaving, dying, bee pollination, and all sorts of things you
wouldn't think of asking. The couple's emphasis is native plants
and they grow most of the thousands of types they offer in their
book-size catalog without using middle-man suppliers. The 30 young
employees are treated as a communal family and when we visited they
had a bonfire celebrating the end of winter, a European tradition
observed to honor interns from the Czech Republic, Hungary, and
France. Remotely located, they welcome visitors warmly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Siskiyou Rare Plant Nursery &LR; , 2825 Cummings Road, Medford, OR
97501; 541-772-6846 Tuesdays-Fridays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; color
catalog $3 with spring and fall supplements; fax 541-772-4917;
e-mail:  &UR; srpn(AT)wa &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; ve.net &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This home nursery, which also propagates most of its own plants,
has been a wellspring for rock gardeners and lovers of alpines. The
nearby Siskiyou Mountains were a source for many of the wild seeds
grown and distributed by the two postal employees who started the
business 35 years ago. In 1978 a California architect named
Baldasarre Mineo came for a visit and ended up buying the business.
The beautiful display garden covers 2 acres and includes a rock
garden by designer Josef Halda. The fall catalog, mailed out in
August, carries the country's largest selection of erythroniums and
anemones. Open to visitors the first and last Saturdays of March
through November or by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Joy Creek Nursery. &LR;  20300 NW Watson Road, Scappoose, OR 07056.
503-543-7474. Catalog is $2 with a fall supplement. Open daily 9
a.m.-5 p.m., March through October.
</P>
<P>
   This six-year-old nursery is on the brink of going big-time. It
tries to carry a comprehensive listing of the best new perennials,
with a specialization in rock garden plants and unusual clematis
vines. The three owners wear different hats. Scott Christy is the
horticulturalist. Mike Smith is the businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Horn, who has a theater background, is in charge of
sales. The display gardens are delightful. The owners assumed they
were too far outside Portland to attract retail trade, but local
gardeners have sought them out and now the majority of their
business comes from that and landscaping, though their mail-order
business continues to double annually.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Heronswood Nursery Ltd. &LR;  7530 NE 288th St., Kingston, WA 98346;
360-297-4172; fax 360-297-8321. Web site,
 &UR; www.eskimo.com/ &UR; GFtilde &LR; mcalpin/ &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; heron/heron.html &LR; . The catalog is $5 for two years. The nursery
ships mail orders Feb. 1-May 15 and mid-September to Nov. 1.
On-site visits by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Although only 10 years old, this catalog carries the largest
offering of perennials in the country and has been immensely
influential. Heronswood is viewed by plant connoisseurs as the
Cadillac of catalogs, listing 2,800 species of plants. Dan Hinkley
travels the globe procuring plant seed from the wild, and since
many of the plants he then grows are unknown to the nursery trade
and the catalog has no pictures, each order arrives like a surprise
package. ``I want to get botany back into horticulture,'' said
Hinkley. But high-style design also has a place at Heronswood. A
faux Eygyptian ruin is one new addition to the 12 gardens that
surround his home with colored foliage and rare plants. Hinkley's
catalog prose is unique. Each spring he turns out 265 pages of
gonzo plant descriptions written in caffeine-fueled spurts between
4 and 6 a.m. (``Geranium endressii `Hot Pink': From a seedling that
originated here, perhaps more true to the nature of the species
itself, with weeks of zappy, zingy, I got steam-m-m heat, flowers
above somewhat felted leaves,'' goes one entry, warning, ``Not for
the meek.'')

TEXAS CONSIDERS REGULATING PRODUCT USED IN POPULAR HERBAL
SUPPLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS 26thgraf, She later died, to add name of manufacturer of
Ripped Fuel)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Seeking to boost his daily workouts at the gym,
Jeff Bowers turned recently to a popular herbal supplement to
increase his metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers bought the ephedrine-based product, Ripped Fuel, at a
health food store in San Antonio. But after only a few days of
using it as directed to try and heighten athletic performance and
burn fat, Bowers suffered an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel my heart pounding through my shirt, my hands were
jittery and I was hyperventilating, so my roommate took me to the
emergency room,'' he recalled in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the Ripped Fuel with me, and before I even opened it
up, the nurse guessed what it was,'' he said. ``She said I wasn't
the first whom she'd seen with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving more than 1,400 similar, ephedrine-related
complaints from people across the state, the Texas Department of
Health is considering classifying the stimulant as a dangerous drug
and requiring a prescription for most products containing it.
</P>
<P>
   Banning ephedrine from over-the-counter sales would affect the
multimillion-dollar, herbal-supplement industry in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its products include diet aids, athletic
performance-boosters and many ``herbal ecstasy'' intoxicants that
teen-agers buy at convenience stores to get an amphetamine-like
``buzz'' or ``high.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of non-prescription ephedrine products sold for asthma,
such as Primatene and some nasal decongestants, would not fall
under the proposed new regulations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight deaths in Texas and more than 40 nationwide have
been linked to ephedrine _ a stimulant found in certain Asian
plants _ said Cynthia Culmo of the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say you can determine a safe amount (for over-the-counter
sale) is incorrect,'' Culmo said. ``The only amount we see as safe
is zero.''
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Health committee met Wednesday to accept public
comment on the regulation change. More than 150 people testified at
the hearing, with an overwhelming majority against requiring
prescription sales of ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Most who testified were connected to the industry that provides
ephedrine-based dietary supplements or stimulants. The witnesses
pleaded with the state to back down from the proposal and instead
consider a compromise that, among other things, would restrict
sales of ephedrine-based products to minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health is not expected to rule on the possible
changes until this fall.
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Banning over-the-counter sales of ephedrine would only hurt
consumers and independent business distributors, while allowing
larger drug companies to profit, said Phillip Sindler of the
Dallas-based Wellness International Network, which sells dietary
supplements, including the stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a health issue. It's an issue of where is the profit
going to go,'' Sindler told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 companies in the Texas market ephedrine-based
products, which constitute a multimillion industry in the state,
according to Michael Ellis, president of Metabolife International.
</P>
<P>
   Although other states have restricted some sales of ephedrine
products, Texas' proposal is by far the most far-reaching, Ellis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shocked us,'' he said, stressing that there is no medical
evidence that ephedrine products cause adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis and Dr. Ted Farber, a toxicologist for the dietary
supplement industry, disputed the number of complaints and deaths
Culmo said were possibly linked to ephedrine products.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration originally had reported it was
investigating more than 40 deaths possibly related to ephedrine,
Farber said. But recently, the federal agency revised that number
to only two, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA spokeswoman did not respond to a request for the correct
number.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA currently is considering prohibiting the marketing of
dietary supplements containing 8 milligrams or more of ephedrine
per dose. The agency also is looking at requiring product labels
that instruct consumers not to use the product for more than seven
days.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence ephedrine is safe, Ellis cited an ongoing study by
Dr. Patricia Daly of the Harvard Medical School on the effects of a
supplement containing caffeine and ephedra, an herb from which
ephedrine is extracted.
</P>
<P>
   The incomplete study, paid for by companies that market
ephedrine products, has found no adverse effects so far on
patients, Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   The death about two months ago of a 15-year-old California girl
who was taking an ephedrine-based stimulant also has highlighted
the ongoing debate over the safety of such products. Rosanna Porras
reportedly took Ripped Fuel capsules before collapsing at soccer
practice.
</P>
<P>
   She later died, and California officials are still investigating
the possibility that the herbal supplement caused her death. The
company that markets Ripped Fuel, Twinlaboratories Inc. in New
York, has said it does not believe its product was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers supports the move to ban such products from
over-the-counter sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'll admit that part of it's because of my own ignorance
for trusting some 18-year-old who recommended the stuff at the
health food store,'' he said. ``But these companies are duping
people because they stand to make a lot of money, while this stuff
is killing people.''

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A NEW DRIVEWAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I plan to have my driveway dug out and a new one put in. What
specifications should I look for?
</P>
<P>
   KAREN STOLOFF, Canton
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, you may not have to dig out the old driveway,
un- less it is badly heaving and breaking up. If it is in fair
shape, you can apply a new layer of asphalt, typically 3 to 4
inches thick. This would bring the new driveway up a few inches, so
you have to be careful at the edges. Or, regrade to bring the soil
up to the level of the new driveway. Or, install border tim- bers
or other kind of edging to protect the asphalt edges and keep the
driveway a little higher.
</P>
<P>
   But if you take out the old driveway, the ``specs'' are these: 6
inches of crushed stone to allow proper drainage under the as-
phalt, preventing undue cracking and heaving. If there is al- ready
crushed stone under, OK. The installer may use crushed asphalt
pavement, which is fine, and a good example of intelli- gent
recycling of an otherwise worthless product. For the as- phalt,
technically called bituminous concrete because it is made of stones
bound together with asphalt, an installer might use 1 1/2 to 2

Another might use 3 inches of finish. Either is acceptable.

   Q. My basement office is unfinished except for the ceiling,
which is insulated. The basement is now heated, and there are
heating ducts, and a stereo and television there too. Since heat-
ing the basement, should I remove the insulation in the ceil- ing?
Also, when the basement television is at normal volume, my wife can
hear it upstairs. And the stereo, too, when it is on
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  normal volume. How can I keep the sound in
the basement?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For starters, don't take out the insulation in the ceiling;
it not only helps keep the heat in the basement, but it also may be
helping to prevent sound in the basement from transmitting up-
stairs. But not enough, as you and your wife found out. But there
is hope, and those heating ducts are a clue to the trans- mission
of the sound from basement to upstairs. Cover those duct openings
and see what happens. If the sound transmission is reduced, you at
least know how it is being transferred. Cov- ering the ducts in
winter is not the best solution, but perhaps you could close some
of them and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   If covering the ducts makes no difference in sound trans-
mission, then you can treat the ceiling this way: Install acousti-
cal resilient channels to the joists, at right angles to the
joists. The channels allow the ceiling finish to be separate from
the joists. Since sound travels through the solid parts of a
ceiling (the joists), separating the finish from the joists will
make a big difference. Screw sound-absorbing board on the channels,
then add a layer of plasterboard for the finished job.

</P>
<P>
   Q. The chimney in my building (built in 1802 and remodeled)
faces north, and has a cap. It is painted, and it leaks. The brick
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  is spalling. One man said he would
waterproof the chimney if I remove the old paint, or he could
stucco the chimney. Another said because of the spalling, he would
have to build up the face of the brick before waterproofing. Who's
right?
</P>
<P>
   CHESTER BARRETT, Marion &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the spalling is not too deep ( 1/4 inch or so) it can be
left as is. Any sealer must go on bare brick, so trying to go over
old paint won't work. You could repaint after scraping and sanding,
or better yet, use a solid color latex stain. The stucco sounds
like the best idea but the old paint must be removed and the
chimney treated with a bonding agent before the stucco is ap-
plied. Otherwise it may not stick.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a dormer with gutters and a downspout, but the
downspout pours a lot of water onto a lower roof. Doesn't that wear
the shingles before their time?
</P>
<P>
   STEVE FUSI, Bedford
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It sure does. To correct the situation, your best bet is to
ex- tend that downspout along the lower roof so that it discharges
directly into a gutter. It may not look so hot but who will notice,
as long as the shingles are spared that erosive gushing.

NEW MAGAZINE HAS GONE TO THE DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Time was when the only thought given to
canines in Berkeley was about how to bring the running dogs of U.S.
imperialism to heel.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed in the bastion of anti-establishment
activism.
</P>
<P>
   These days, dogs are getting a lot of attention in Berkeley _
not least in the pages of the Bark, an erstwhile newsletter for dog
lovers that is on the verge of going national as a tabloid
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bark editor Claudia Kawczynska and creative director Cameron Woo
describe Bark as a hip alternative to glossy mainstream magazines
such as Dog Fancy and Dog World that dominate the market for people
who are partial to pooches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who like our publication are not glossy people,'' Woo
says. ``We're talking to people who have mutts, and who look at
dogs as companions, not as objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Woo and Kawczynska produce Bark out of the Berkeley house they
share with their dogs, Nellie, a half beagle and half border
collie, and Callie, a German shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   True to Berkeley's activist tradition, the Bark began when a
grass-roots group of dog lovers beseeched City Hall to set aside
part of Berkeley's bayside Cesar Chavez Park for dogs to slip their
leashes and run free.
</P>
<P>
   That cause gave birth to Bark last year. Originally an
eight-page newsletter, ``It was a medium to get the word out,''
Kawczynska recalls. ``We wanted to get the attention of policy
makers.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest for off-leash freedom continues, unresolved.
Meanwhile, Bark has grown like a frisky, hungry puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Now a quarterly, Bark plans to go bimonthly with its next issue,
due in mid-July. Additionally, it is growing from a local venture
into one that plans to ship copies around the country, also
beginning with the next issue. Its eight pages are surging to 28.
The press run is doubling to 20,000. And Bark is going from being a
nonprofit advocacy newsletter to a for-profit business owned by
Kawczynska and Woo.
</P>
<P>
   Kawczynska says one U.S. household in three owns a dog, so
Bark's target audience is, in theory, huge.
</P>
<P>
   The Bark sells subscriptions for $10 a year (call 510-704-0827),
but supports itself mainly through paid advertising. Single copies
are distributed free. The current, 20-page winter-spring issue, the
publication's fourth issue, has about five pages of display and
classified ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, we have been able to sell enough
advertising to pay for our printing costs,'' Kawczynska says.
``What is especially remarkable is that advertisers are now coming
to us. We are getting businesses that don't just cater directly to
the dog-loving clientele, such as pet stores, but businesses such
as real estate and travel agents, restaurants, music stores, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Editorially, Bark balances the practical and the artistic, the
earnest and the whimsical. It prints testimonials to canine
soulfulness and intelligence and laments on the deaths of pets,
tongue-in-cheek essays (the paper has a canine movie reviewer),
jokes, drawings and photographs, letters, essays about the
evolution of man's best friend, tips about traveling with pets, and
advice on how to care for Spot, Fido and Rex.
</P>
<P>
   In a piece headlined ``Dog Fights and Other Natural Disasters,''
the reader is tipped on what to do _ and what not to do _ if a
fight breaks out. ``Don't scream! ... When you scream, you become
part of their pack, cheering them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Berkeley's offbeat artistic sensibility and literary
ambition has made its way into Bark. Castro Theatre film programmer
Anita Monga and former Pacific Film Archive programmer Peter Moore
write for Bark. National Public Radio contributor Daniel Pinkwater
is contributing a short story to the next issue. Artists Mark
Ulriksen and Max Schroder have published drawings and photographs
in its pages.
</P>
<P>
   No contributors to Bark are paid. Kawczynska says she hopes to
pay them in the future, but avers that it hasn't been a problem so
far.
</P>
<P>
   She says, ``Dog people are generous people.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kawczynska adds, ``Dog people like to share their
experiences _ like this whole phenomenon of walking dogs in city
parks. This takes it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, she thinks Bark's sincerity (it's by and for people
who love dogs) and sophistication (the publication looks good and
the writing is literate) win people over.
</P>
<P>
   Woo, who works up the design and layout of Bark in his home
office on a Power Mac, says he tries to allot lots of white space,
enhance legibility and give the publication ``a smart look.''
Published on a traditional web press, Bark sticks to basic black
and white, forgoing splashy, pricey four-color processes.
</P>
<P>
   Woo and Kawczynska don't have a national distributor for the
publication, but figure they can circulate future issues of Bark
through pet shops, animal hospitals, dog shows, veterinarians'
offices and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Says Kawczynska: ``In our nonprofessional way, we have tested it
by shipping it out to smaller pet stores. There's a response out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, she says, ``It's sort of invented itself. We might as
well see where it can go.''

END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR BRING OUT EMOTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not exactly something the Centers for Disease Control
documents, and it doesn't show up in emergency rooms, but anecdotal
evidence points to a little-known phenomenon that affects children
every year at about this time: As the end of school gets closer,
preschoolers become more accident prone, schoolage children become
more sickly.
</P>
<P>
   Children of all ages have a love-hate relationship with the end
of school. Even though there is joyful excitement ala ``No more
pencils, no more books, no more teachers' dirty looks,'' there is
also dread. Few children make it through the transition to summer
without feeling some sadness, confusion, or anger about the loss of
structure, routine, familiar faces, and familiar places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met a kid who isn't affected somehow, sooner or
later,'' says developmental psychologist Charles Flatter of the
University of Maryland. For many kids, the blip passes so quickly
parents don't even notice. But for others, loss and uncertainty
take a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Every June, preschool educational director Mary Ucci anticipates
a proliferation of scrapes and bruises. She reminds her staff at
the Child Study Center at Wellesley College to be more alert than
usual, not just to physical red flags but also to emotional ones.
``Because preschoolers are upset about change, they're emotionally
distracted,'' she says. ``They're not paying attention and they
fall down more.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Benton, principal of the Fiske Elementary School in
Lexington, sees more stomachaches, headaches, and minor ailments in
June, especially in first, second, and third grades. ``It's related
to the stress of transition,'' she says. ``I tell parents not to
keep a child home unless there's a fever.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger children tend to be transparent. Ucci recalls, ``Last
year, one 4-year-old sat on the swing and sobbed, `I'm not going to
see my Mary Ruth anymore.' It doesn't take a lot to figure out
what's going on there.'' (Mary Ruth was her teacher.)
</P>
<P>
   Preschoolers are just as likely to exhibit anger as they are
sadness, though, and that can take parents and teachers by
surprise. ``If you're not a seasoned teacher, it's pretty hard to
hear a 4-year-old tell you, `I don't like your long hair!' `I don't
like your big teeth!''' says Ucci, who says these outbursts are a
defense mechanism against the hurt and loss they're feeling.
``They're so angry and sad to leave that they have to find reasons
not to like it or you anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling with such powerful feelings fuels regression. Ucci's
antidote is to offer soothing, simple activities. ``We go back to
basics, markers and papers, instead of collages,'' she says. At
home, she urges parents not to deny the feelings or try to talk a
child out of them. Offer support instead: ``Don't yell or
humiliate. Tie their shoes, pour the juice, and say, `I know you
will miss school, and we'll help you.'''
</P>
<P>
   With older children, Flatter says there are two mistakes parents
and teachers typically make.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to pay attention only to kids in marker years _
those leaving kindergarten or elementary or middle school. ``Kids
in every grade need help with closure. Just because they've done it
before doesn't make it easier,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Benton says first graders frequently have the hardest time.
``They're finally getting comfortable with the work and it dawns on
them it will be even harder in second grade,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth graders may be developmentally more vulnerable to sadness
than other children, especially if they will be leaving the school
in one more year, because they're able to sense what next year's
loss will be like, says developmental psychologist Amy
Susman-Stillman of the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Flatter, whose area of speciality is school-age
children, says the end of the year gets harder as children get
older. ``Friendships are stronger and more significant. Even
separating for the summer can be a blow,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The second mistake parents make is to not connect the onset of
grumpy, oppositional behavior to loss.
</P>
<P>
   Flatter says for some kids, ``There's an emotional discomfort
that fuels a regression and makes them literally feel sick.''
That's what can lead to the kind of physical ailments Benton sees.
</P>
<P>
   For others, the loss will hit like a ton of schoolbooks sometime
in the first weeks of no-school. ``Without reason to look at a
calendar, they literally doesn't know what day it is,'' says
Flatter. There's a feeling of panic: ``How do I organize myself?
How do I give meaning to my time?''
</P>
<P>
   The more teachers provide rituals in the last weeks of school,
the easier the transition can be.
</P>
<P>
   At Fiske, children in every grade write a letter to the incoming
class. ``It provides closure and a chance to see their own
accomplishments,'' says Benton. Kids in all grades also participate
in a self-assessment, writing what was good and bad about the year.
Benton also urges teachers to keep routines and limit-setting in
place, including homework, down to the last week. ``Familiarity and
consistency count,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once school ends, it is the lack of routine and the lack
of expectations that often gets kids of any age into trouble, says
Flatter. ``A kind of depression can set in,'' he says. The more you
set expectations around such things as bedtimes, TV, and morning
routines, and the more you include children in the planning of
activites, the better they'll do.
</P>
<P>
   Sure signs that a child is having difficulty include unusual
moodiness and oppositional behavior, unusual nastiness to a
sibling, and endless time in front of the TV or computer.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're tuned in and recognize this as a sign of the
sadness and loss your child is feeling, your child probably won't,
says Susman-Stillman. ``Especially not a boy. Even if they feel
sad, they won't admit it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Parents need to be proactive. ``Assume they are having a
reaction,'' Susman-Stillman says. ``Every child needs some
recognition of the change they are experiencing.'' But don't
approach it head-on with a direct question, as in, ``Do you think
you're missing/are going to miss school?'' A more oblique approach
works better: ``Even though most kids are glad school is over,
sometimes they miss their friends/a favorite teacher/a favorite
subject more than they expect to.'' That normalizes the experience
for a child and gives him permission to feel what he's feeling.
However, Susman-Stillman adds, it doesn't mean he will necessarily
share it with you.
</P>
<P>
   Provide the opportunity, nonetheless. She recommends a family
ritual, for instance, a dinner with relatives where each child
makes a short presentation about the school year.
</P>
<P>
   While older children may mope around in the first week or two
after school, preschoolers may be fine for two or three weeks,
then, out of the blue, something makes it concrete for them. ``They
realize, `Oh, no! I'm not going back there,' and sadness hits,''
says Ucci.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the time to talk about the future. ``Acknowledge the
feelings of the present first, which is the loss,'' she says. Pull
out the book of accomplishments that most preschoolers will have
made at the end of the year: ``Look at all you learned! Look at the
friends you made!'' Only then, she says, can you look forward: ``I
bet you'll make friends in kindergarten, too!''
</P>
<P>
   For children leaving a school, there is usually plenty of
ritual. The Fiske School has two months of activities for
graduating fifth graders, including a yearbook that Benton works on
with them. It's not unusual for feelings to surface in the course
of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely loss and anxiety for all of them,'' she
says. ``The best thing you can do is get it out in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Eighty percent of all kids stop playing organized
youth sports by the time they're 12. They burn out young because
they start so young and feel so much pressure.

WHAT WILL THE INTERNET CHANGE NEXT? TRY THE TELEPHONE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind about Web browsers. Right now the most interesting
Internet action involves that little computer terminal you use to
order pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Your telephone. It has been part of a computer network since the
1960s, when the old Bell System began swapping its mechanical phone
switches for computerized one. But this is one computer network
that hasn't been redesigned for the era of the Internet, until now.
Suddenly, we're seeing companies offering long-distance calls over
the 'Net for 8 cents a minute or less.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the old pipe dream of using desktop computers to
place ``free'' calls. Those calls were worth the price, with
tin-can acoustics and long pauses between words. But now the
techniques for sending voices over the Internet have gotten good
enough to shake up the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at Qwest Inc. of Denver. This firm has laid over
5,400 miles of fiber-optic cable along railroad rights of way. It's
Qwest's own private network, using the same software standards run
on the public 'Net. But Qwest uses its system to carry
long-distance calls for residents of nine cities, including Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, and Salt Lake City. The price _ 7
1/2 cents a minute, every day, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that you don't need a computer? Any phone will do.
Just dial an access number, your password, and the number you want
to call.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's IDT Corp., a little Internet provider in
Hackensack, N.J. It's peddling long-distance phone calls over the
Internet at 8 cents a minute. I tried it on a call to my niece in
Chicago. The voice quality was sub-AT&AMP;T, and I certainly wouldn't
have heard a pin drop. But it was quite adequate for a
how's-the-old-neighborhood chat.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Internet is forcing a major industry to rethink
its way of doing business. And this time the rethink is rooted in
the fundamental design of phone networks.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Bell's day, phones have been based on circuit
switching. That's an engineer's way of saying when you make a phone
call, one electrical circuit is entirely tied up by your chat, even
when you're just doing heavy breathing. Quite a waste of bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, all communications are diced into small blocks
of digital data, called packets, and a transmission uses only as
much of the line's capacity as it needs to send those packets. That
way you can shovel a lot more data down the wire.
</P>
<P>
   The phone companies have caught on. By using Internet-style
packet switching instead of circuit switching, they get maximum use
and profit out of their networks, even at lower prices. They'll
have to tear out their old-style switches, but they can continue to
use their existing wires. Besides, nearly all the growth in
telephone use is coming from data transmissions, anyway. So phone
companies build packet-switched systems to handle this extra
traffic, while they gradually retire the older circuit-switched
system.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry-watchers once thought Internet phoning would
terrorize the established phone companies. Instead, they're falling
in love with the idea. AT&AMP;T has launched its own trials of
Internet-based telephone service right here in Boston. And on
Tuesday, Sprint announced a dramatic overhaul of its entire
network, featuring an advanced packet-switching method called ATM.
In a few years, the Sprint network will use exactly the same
processes to transmit Grandma's phone calls and her e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Internet phoning is so cheap is that it's not subject
to special fees that traditional phone companies must pay to
maintain phone services in poorer areas. The FCC has said this tax
break will vanish once Internet-based phoning takes off. So
Internet calls aren't going to get much cheaper; there may even be
some price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with today's technology, any company with a nationwide
data network can become a long-distance phone company almost
overnight. That means plenty of competition to keep prices down.
And since the Internet covers the world, these companies are also
driving down the cost of international calling.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a day when calls to Tokyo and Toledo cost pretty much
the same. Makes the browser wars seem trivial, doesn't it?

   CHINA-TIANANMEN _ HONG KONG _ Shielding their candles from a
punishing rain, thousands of demonstrators held the first vigil on
Chinese soil Thursday night for their countrymen mowed down in the
Tiananmen Square democracy movement nine years ago. In a ceremony
dramatized by thunder and lightening amid the sweet, sad tones of
traditional Chinese music, a crowd that organizers estimated to
number 40,000 carried off a peaceful rally in Victoria Park.
Pro-democracy activists laid wreaths in memory of the victims. It
was the first memorial to the Tiananmen victims since Hong Kong was
restored to Chinese rule last summer, and thus the first such event
ever to take place in China. (Kunstel, Cox News Service).

   RETIREMENT-SAVE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and House

environmental protection is inadequate, according to a series of

MY 103-YEAR-OLD COLLEAGUE HAS THE RIGHT ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when I think that, career-wise, the finish line is looming,
I find a story in the Denver Post about a 103-year-old newspaper
columnist. By that standard I've barely begun working.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Nix Leo of Howard, Kan., has been writing for newspapers
since she was a teenager. She now writes a column for the weekly
Elk County Citizen-Advance News, and another for the monthly
magazine Tallgrass Country. In her spare time she writes her church
newsletter. ``I find that the older I get, I am more aware of the
brightness of everything,'' she wrote recently. ``I look for
beauty, adventure, discovery, and push for increasing knowledge
that awakens me to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Bless her heart. That must be the kind of attitude it takes to
keep on doing this job until you're 103, which means that my own
career prospects are getting dimmer by the minute. Can I help it if
I'm drawn in a different direction? I used to wonder if I'd reach a
point when I'd run out of column ideas, but the older I get, the
more aware I am of how many people are taking leave of their
senses, and in public too, so that running out of ideas is
impossible, no matter how hard I try.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Ralph Lauren's suit against Polo, the magazine of the
US Polo Association. Apparently Lauren owns the word polo, or
thinks he does, and has taken umbrage at the magazine's use of it.
Polo, the publication, was recently redesigned, and Lauren claims
in his suit that it now focuses ``not on equestrian sports but on
sophisticated fashions and elegant lifestyles,'' which he considers
his turf.
</P>
<P>
   And whose image has Lauren been trading upon? If anybody has a
case here it would seem to be the polo-playing set, whose style
Lauren has been ripping off for years. The suit is incredibly
stupid, but the spectacle of a lot of rich people fighting over a
four-letter word is gratifying, in a way. Maybe they should change
the name of the centuries-old sport to ralph. (``I keep a string of
ralph ponies up at Hamilton ...'')
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of being incredibly stupid, who advised Monica Lewinsky
to pose in a swimsuit in the forthcoming July issue of Vanity Fair?
Actually the item, as reported in USA Today, didn't promise Monica
in a swimsuit but in a ``beach layout,'' which could mean just
about anything. Her public image can't get much worse than it is,
so I suppose the exposure can't hurt, especially since USA Today
reports that ``the raven-haired ex-intern looks fabulous in the
Herb Ritts shots.'' I can hardly wait for the issue to hit the
stands. Next up has to be Playboy's ``Girls of Clinton'' issue,
with Monica, Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones et al.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Viagra, but what doesn't these days? I have
here the first, but certainly not the last, Viagra book, ``Viagra:
A Guide to the Phenomenal Potency-Promoting Drug.'' It's a curious
volume indeed. My favorite chapter? ``Evaluating Impotence,'' which
asks the reader to think of the problem as a game of Clue. No
kidding. The first step to determining the cause of sexual
dysfunction ``is to gather all the evidence,'' writes the author,
psychiatrist Susan C. Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn continues, a few paragraphs on, ``Certain clues would
lead us to consider Professor Plum the prime suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Plum is the probable culprit if dysfunction is brought
on by psychological factors. Colonel Mustard gets into the act a
few paragraphs later, when the cause is organic. And no, I'm not
making this up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viagra may reduce the need for some aspects of detective
work,'' Vaughn writes. This is something to be thankful for,
especially since the doctor suggests that one way to solve the
mystery is to ask your partner ``to stay awake all night and
monitor your manhood's whereabouts at all times.'' Maybe some
mysteries are better left unsolved.

AIRMAN CROCKER SNOW WRITES ABOUT THE EARLY DAYS OF FLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID MEHEGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOG BOOK &QC; 
A Pilot's Life &QC; 
By Crocker Snow &QC; 
Brassey's, 290 pp., illustrated, $29.95 &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crocker Snow is one of those people whose lifetimes coincide
with a particular historical epoch in such a way as to reveal it.
He saw his first airplane flight in 1910, was flying a biplane
himself in 1926, and managed to participate in virtually every
aspect of aeronautical development, military and civilian, from
that point until his retirement in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a prosperous Boston lawyer, Snow went to Harvard, but
dropped out of the law school to follow in the footsteps of his
older brothers, Bill and Kitchell (``Kick''), who were both
flying-mad. Bill flew air patrol in Europe during World War I,
while Kick's postwar civilian flying career ended tragically when
he was killed on takeoff from the new East Boston airfield in 1923.
Determined not to be restrained by that tragedy, Crocker Snow
persisted.
</P>
<P>
   He and a group of friends founded the Harvard Aeronautical
Society, an informal club that gave many of them their first taste
of buying, outfitting, and regularly flying planes. In 1928, Snow
and several friends went into business with Skyways Inc., a company
set up to sell planes, give lessons, and carry passengers. The
business petered out toward the end of the Depression, as did many
of the hundreds of small aircraft companies that blossomed in the
optimistic 1920s as software start-ups do today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, at the request of Governor Joseph Ely, Snow proposed a
code of aviation law that would rationalize the chaotic state of
relatively unregulated flying. Though the bill failed while James
Michael Curley was governor, a new version was enacted under the
Saltonstall administration in 1939. When the bill became law, Snow
was asked to run the state's new aeronautics commission.
</P>
<P>
   Snow returned to that job in 1946, but had, you might say, a few
adventures in between. In 1941, on the eve of war, Snow (as an
experienced Army Air Corps Reserve officer) was asked to help set
up ferry routes between North America and England by which aircraft
and supplies could be moved to Europe. He and his teammates flew
and charted routes from Presque Isle, Maine, to Goose Bay,
Labrador, then to Greenland, Iceland, and finally Prestwick,
England, setting up the fields and devising procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943 he was named commander of a B-17 bomber group then
forming in Tennessee, but was transferred to a training job before
it went into action in Europe. In early 1944, he was assigned to
the Pacific theater and became commander of the 498th Bombing
Group. After service in the campaign against Japan, Snow came home
to resume a long career in the development of civil and commercial
aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Snow has a perky and brisk style, and his account of his career
is thick with details about particular planes, flights, and
anecdotes. Although his own life is in the foreground, and aviation
history in the background, what comes through most clearly are
these details _ how planes were made, what they were like to fly _
and a succession of hard-learned facts about flying itself. Even
the death of Snow's brother Kick is followed by the author's
observation that in the event of a total power loss right after
takeoff (which is what happened to Kick's plane), the best measure
is to try for a straight-ahead crash landing instead of attempting
a 180-degree turn without power. Kick would have known that, we're
told; the author suspects he had been afraid that his passengers
might drown in the harbor if he ditched. This sort of common-sense
resourcefulness, combined with a determination to move on to the
next challenge and adventure, makes this book a fascinating
account.
</P>
<P>
   Not much about Snow's deeper views and social world gets into
the book, but now and then we get a glimpse. He acknowledges that
``my own family lifestyle was hardly affected'' by the Depression.
He plays polo and seems to have had a fine time in those lean
years. He blames the New Deal, especially the National Recovery
Administration, for ruining the climate for companies like Skyways.
He allows that Roosevelt's ``Date of Infamy'' speech after Pearl
Harbor ``was just right for the occasion,'' while mentioning that
he had never voted for Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   It is always clear that nothing in Crocker Snow's life that he
wanted to do was closed to him. He had the contacts and the money,
or access to the money, to do what he wanted. And of course, unlike
the case with so many free spirits of his generation, his luck
held. Still, what he wanted to do was to be successful and useful
in war and peace, and he assuredly was. His is a fascinating
American story, all about restlessness on the ground, all about the
yen to take off.

THE FOLLY OF CAMPAIGN-FINANCE `REFORM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They want to ban ``soft money.'' They want to control political
advertising by noncandidates. They speak appealingly of ``reform,''
of ``closing loopholes,'' of ``preventing special interests from
buying elections.'' They are, no doubt, sincere.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their good intentions, what the campaign-finance
crusaders demand will only make campaign finance more corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   US Representatives Christopher Shays and Martin Meehan are
getting lots of good press for their efforts to push through the
House of Representatives a law overhauling campaign spending rules.
Last fall, when the action was in the other chamber, it was
Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold who were getting the
applause. But McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan are not the first
campaign finance bills under the sun, and if the history of such
laws teaches anything, it is that they boomerang. With a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 and 1976, Congress determined to deodorize federal
campaigns once and for all. Then as now, the talk was of halting
corruption and closing loopholes and reining in the power of money.
To those ends, the post-Watergate reformers decreed that individual
contributions would be held to just $1,000 per candidate per
election. Political action committees would be allowed to give
$5,000. A cap was placed on the total amount a donor could donate
to all candidates in any one year. What resulted from all this
cleaning up was the system that Shays and Meehan now say needs
cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
   Because politicians could no longer accept more than $1,000 from
any single donor, they were forced to fund-raise more obsessively
than ever. Because PACs could give five times as much as
individuals, PACs became five times as influential. Office-seekers,
desperate for cash, no longer had time to ``waste'' on mere $25 and
$50 donors. The superwealthy, blocked from freely donating to
candidates they liked, searched for a loophole through which they
could contribute liberally _ and found it in the parties'
unrestricted ``building funds'': soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of dollars in politics didn't shrink after the
1970s-era changes _ it expanded. The new laws didn't make it easier
for challengers of modest means to get elected _ they made it
virtually impossible. And the power of special interests wasn't
curbed _ it was entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing will happen if Shays-Meehan becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can plug the soft money loophole. It can make it harder
for advocacy groups and unions to run TV and radio commercials. It
can make reporting requirements more intricate. In so doing, it may
well dissuade minor donors and political amateurs from getting
involved in campaigns at all.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing Congress does can stop those who have money to spend
on politics and the motivation to spend that money. When the stakes
are high enough, there are always means of funneling aid to
politicians. If not directly, then through a PAC. And if not a PAC,
then through independent TV spots. Or in-kind contributions. Or a
hired army of sign holders. Or a get-out-the-vote phone bank. Or
jobs for the politician's brother-in-law. Or a rented Goodyear
blimp flashing ``VOTE FOR THROTTLEBOTTOM,'' if that's what it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   No election ``reform'' is going to keep money out of campaigns.
No new law is going to suppress the ability of the wealthy and the
well-connected to buy access to office-holders. In political
participation as in everything else, there are inequalities.
Shays-Meehan cannot eliminate them, but it can make them worse.
</P>
<P>
   What is corrupting our politics is not money. It is a government
grown so powerful and intrusive that virtually anyone with
interests to safeguard feels the need to pay protection money to
politicians. With outlays of $1.8 trillion, Washington consumes
more than one-fifth of the wealth Americans produce each year.
There is virtually no activity or product that is safe from federal
interference. A line in the federal budget can destroy a company _
or treble its income. Change a phrase in the tax code, and scores
of workers lose their jobs. A thousand local enterprises rise or
fall on the decision of a committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Washington controls everything from mushroom standards to
computer exports to gallons-per-toilet-flush. Corporations, unions,
and interest groups know that the people in the White House and the
Capitol can do them great harm. Is it any surprise that they are
willing to pay so much to stay in their good graces?
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal last week reported on 144 individuals
who contributed $5.4 million in the last three years to the PAC of
Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader. ``I gave because I have an
interest in how he votes on maritime issues,'' one donor said. ``If
you give them money,'' said another, ``they return your calls.'' A
third: ``We saw it as a way of life in Washington.'' A fourth: ``We
thought it would be a chance to get the issue in front of Senator
Lott. We wanted to see it passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal could have picked any other group of donors to
virtually any other federal politician. The quotes would have been
the same.
</P>
<P>
   The planted axiom of campaign finance ``reform'' is that it is
possible to devise a system in which men and women whose well-being
depends on political access won't spend great sums to purchase that
access. Such a system has never existed and never will. If Shays
and Meehan really want to get money out of politics, let them bend
their efforts to getting government out of our lives.

TWO OPPOSING BOOKS FORM BATTLE LINES OVER DATING RULES  
 (WITH DATING-LIST) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TERESA TALERICO  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To call or not to call?
</P>
<P>
   Does the guy pay or do you go Dutch?
</P>
<P>
   Who makes the first move when your eyes meet?
</P>
<P>
   And what about sex on the first date?
</P>
<P>
   The best-seller lists have plenty of answers to these questions
and other dating advice for women these days. Guides to finding Mr.
Right have sprung up on bookstore shelves everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these self-professed romance-guru authors give
conflicting insights into the male psyche.
</P>
<P>
   So who _ and what _ to believe?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rules'' by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider (Mass Market
Paperback, 174 pages, $5.99), hit the shelves in 1995 and created a
stir (and a sequel last year) with its ultraconservative advice for
women.
</P>
<P>
   In April came a new book, ``What Men Want'' (Cliff Street Books,
192 pages, $19), written by three guys as a rebuttal to ``The
Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Gerstman, Christopher Pizzo and Rich Seldes _
respectively, a lawyer, accountant and doctor _ reveal what they
think single men are really after when looking for Ms. Right or Ms.
Right Now.
</P>
<P>
   The advice in these two books is often hilariously _ or sadly _
disparate. As different as Mars and Venus? Try a whole other
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at how technology has advanced, the one thing that
hasn't advanced is the communication gap between men and women,''
said Gerstman, 30. ``All these books out there seem to widen it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Rules,'' Fein and Schneider take a demure, 1950s
approach in their advice to women. Look pretty and brush up on your
current events, girls! Wear lipstick even when you jog. Never
approach him first. Don't call him. Let him pick movies and
restaurants. And even after you're an official couple, heavens to
Betsy, don't initiate sex.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa! Of course the guys had to strike back _ although it did
take the big lugs three years to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of ``What Men Want'' say they ``break the male code
of silence'' when it comes to dating, women and romance. The trio
reveal how a woman can read signs that show whether she's a ``good
for now girl'' or a woman with ``wife potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstman and Pizzo were in Seattle last week for a taping of
KOMO-TV's ``Town Meeting'' scheduled to air on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to know a man's point of view, you come to a man
himself,'' Gerstman said. ``A lot of guys don't say the things they
really feel. We try to articulate them in ways a woman can
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstman et al., advise women thusly:
</P>
<P>
   _ Playing hard to get, as ``The Rules'' advocates, is sure to
turn guys off. The trio calls it ``Machiavellian.''
</P>
<P>
   _ It's OK to approach men. It's cool to make the first move.
Guys are sometimes bashful little boys and scared of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men appreciate women who take initiative.
</P>
<P>
   _ You can call him first. For some guys, it's a relief.
</P>
<P>
   _ As for women initiating sex _ pretty please. Just don't act
like you're in a porn movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're throwing up the white flag here,'' Gerstman said. ``The
theory of (``The Rules'') is to make a man chase. But by making a
man chase, what he's in love with is the chase and not the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is some practical advice in ``The Rules'': Don't
date a married man. Don't cling. Have your own life and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   And if the ``ugly truths'' listed in ``What Men Want'' are
indeed reality, perhaps it's no wonder the women of ``The Rules''
resort to forms of manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gerstman, Pizzo and Seldes, guys:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cheat on women they love.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use women for sex.
</P>
<P>
   _ Value a woman's looks over almost everything else.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are driven by their sex urge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Would never marry if they didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   The authors are unapologetic about these ``truths,'' which they
present as self-evident. And judging from the way the book ends,
there is no reason to change them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that brings us to No. 18 in ``The Rules'': Don't try
to change him.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make a single woman cry, ``Yikes, where's the
nearest convent?''
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope. ``The Rules'' and ``What Men Want'' do agree
on a few things:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't open up too quickly with a new love interest _ as in
telling on the first date everything about your ex-boyfriends,
dysfunctional family or recovery from alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't have sex too soon _ unless you're just interested in a
casual fling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't pressure your partner.
</P>
<P>
   _ And above all, honesty still ranks high _ for both sexes _ no
matter what the current dating trends might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just be real,'' say Gerstman and his writing partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't lie,'' write Fein and Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Phew. At least some things never go out of style.

PHOTO EXHIBIT FOCUSES ON PUNISHMENTS FOR DRUG OFFENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A polemical photo exhibit, ``Human Rights and
the Drug War,'' views federal drug policy prescribing mandatory
minimum sentences, even for first offenders, through the lens of
the Bill of Rights and the United Nations declaration on human
rights and finds it abhorrent.
</P>
<P>
   While the American drug policies are not as draconian as those
of some other countries _ Malaysia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Thailand,
for example _ where some drug offenses call for the death penalty,
the United States is a world leader in incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit features a ``POW wall'' with photos of 100 inmates
and their families, a memorial to people killed by law enforcement
in connection with drug offenses and sections on medical marijuana
and property confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers of the exhibit are invited to write their comments in a
notebook placed on a lectern in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The comments indicate that the exhibit packs a punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Nazi holocaust survivor, and I had no idea what is
going on right here in my own back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It warms the heart of an old head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock 'em up. Throw away the key. What a bunch of wasted tax
dollars and space. How about putting some books out somewhere?''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, in the Skylight Gallery of the San Francisco main
library, is shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Among those featured in the exhibit is James Geddes, 45, who is
six years into a 90-year sentence in an Oklahoma prison for
cultivating and possessing five marijuana plants. ``I honestly feel
that I have been kidnapped by the state of Oklahoma,'' Geddes says.
</P>
<P>
   John Avery, a 58-year-old paraplegic, is serving a 20-year
sentence in Kentucky following his 1994 conviction for growing
marijuana in an underground greenhouse. ``They basically killed my
whole family,'' Avery says.
</P>
<P>
   Geddes and Avery are among dozens of case studies on the effect
of mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses detailed in the
photo exhibit that will be on display through June 19.

FOR DIRECTOR RICHMAN, BEING BEHIND A CAMERA FEELS RIGHT AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUAL NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle's Meg Richman has finally found her calling.
</P>
<P>
   After she went through an ``existential crisis'' while studying
visual art at the University of California/Berkeley grad school
because she kept veering off the traditional student painter's
path, a frustrated professor finally called her bluff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't you just make films?'' he cried.
</P>
<P>
   She says she had never even considered the option even though,
after ``putting text'' in her paintings and even ``installing audio
tapes in them so they became a kind of performance art,'' making
movies was a logical next step.
</P>
<P>
   Richman laughs as she sits, some years after her finding her
niche, in the Plaza Park Suites before a showing of the first
feature film she directed, ``Under Heaven,'' which is playing
tomorrow and Monday at the Seattle International Film Festival and
opens a regular run on June 19 at The Harvard Exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Heaven'' is a shot-in-Seattle contemporary retelling of
Henry James' novel, ``The Wings Of The Dove.'' It stars British
actress Joely Richardson, Canadian Molly Parker and Australian Aden
Young (``It wasn't a conscious choice to cast people from the
Colonies,'' Richman says) in a film that lushly shows off Seattle's
beauty as well as giving its three leads equally rich and diverse
roles.
</P>
<P>
   It's a risky gamble after Iain Softley's acclaimed period film
of ``The Wings Of The Dove,'' which won an Academy Award nomination
for Helena Bonham Carter. It has just exited theaters and will be
released this month on video.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult and ultimately I have no idea whether it
will make a big difference, but it's been a bit of a trauma for my
film's production company,'' she concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Under Heaven'' has its own unique perspective on the tale,
which was also ``borrowed'' by Terrence Malick for his 1977 film,
``Days Of Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Eleanor (Richardson) a lonely, dying heiress
who employs a poor young woman, Cynthia (Parker), to be her live-in
help. Cynthia schemes to get her lover, Buck (Young), hired on as
well. Telling Eleanor that Buck is her half-brother, she then
pushes the gullible, sweet-tempered man to flirt with Eleanor and
to bring a little passion into her sad life. Maybe, she thinks,
Ellie will marry Buck and they will be able to live a life of
luxury when the older woman finally dies.
</P>
<P>
   The director notes it ``was pretty easy'' to transfer James to
the current day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a fan of his work and there were obviously
certain conflicts that had to do with class and a kind of Victorian
repression that I had to figure out an equivalent for because
they're no longer applicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman has put her art background to good use in the look and
design of her movie. It features gardens from plush shoreline
homes, vistas of the Seattle cityscape, scenes in Gasworks Park and
the rich architecture of Pioneer Square.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one metaphor for Eleanor's blooming after falling for
Buck is her garden. Richman says she pored over books on
Pre-Raphaelite art to achieve the look. ``I wanted it to move from
a Seattle streets, Nan Goldin-type image back to the
Pre-Raphaelites. I wanted that kind of range.''
</P>
<P>
   For a first-time director, Richman was blessed with an ideal
cast. She admits she was a little nervous about directing Joely
Richardson, who is the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave and the late
director Tony Richardson. ``But Joely is such a down-to-earth
person and she has no snobbery in her. In all honesty, there were
moments I felt daunted, but Vanessa sometimes came round to visit
so the whole thing took on a very human scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting her dream cast took time. ``I went through an incredible
audition period for the film,'' says Richman. ``We had to have a
name actor for the role of Eleanor because we had to appease the
production company and their investment in the project. But we were
lucky because once the funding was in place, it never fell through.
It just took a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw every young, up-and-coming star in L.A. for the roles of
Buck and Cynthia. Molly and Aden were just so clearly the best. It
was kind of magical that I really got, in each case, the person I
wanted the most.''
</P>
<P>
   And she found directing to be naturally easy. ``I thought,
finally, after all these years, I'm doing the thing I was born to
do. But that said, I was prepared in a lot of different ways. I'd
taken acting courses, directing courses and done directing in the
theater. And I have that strong visual background as well as years
of writing. All the components meshed. The thing I was most
frightened of was camera movement and the impact camera movement
had on the narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman's own family helped keep the short, 29-day shoot, in
perspective and on budget. ``They were very generous in donating
things,'' she laughs. ``It definitely made it easier to be
surrounded by friends and family in Seattle and to be making a
movie in my hometown. I felt bolstered by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the process of getting everything in place for ``Under
Heaven'' wasn't always easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things the legislature could do to make this city a
far more attractive place to shoot a film,'' she says. ``There are
other states where the tax breaks the permit situation are better,
but the people here are so wonderful and, of course, it's
unparalleled as far as its beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman has completed another script _ of the Somerset Maugham
novella _ ``Up At The Villa,'' which has been picked up by Sydney
Pollack's production company. It will star Kristin Scott Thomas and
Sean Penn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know if I'll get a credit because Belinda Haas
has re-written it,'' Richman says. ``We might share a credit but as
a writer, I've never had the desire to hang out on the set.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how plastic the medium is and it can change. I can
change it, my actors can make a suggestion and change their words
into something better. I'm happy for the change.''
</P>
<P>
   And has the film business changed toward women directors? ``As
more women work in the industry, I think it will change,'' she
says. ``But it makes no difference to me if I'm thought of as a
Seattle or woman director. I'll just go forward and do my work.
What does surprise me is that because a woman's sensibility, if
there is such a thing _ and I think there is _ and it's a
culturally different sensibility, is still regarded as suspect and
there's a failure to recognize it as legitimate, strong and a
powerful point-of-view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The delicacy and subtlety of it can be perceived as
weakness,'' says Richman, and with a laugh she adds, ``And I find
that tremendously annoying.''

`THE TRUMAN SHOW' IS SOMETHING TO SAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story is that when Paramount execs sat down to design the
marketing campaign for ``The Truman Show'' last year, they suddenly
realized they had a huge problem on their hands. They knew the
movie was special, but there was nothing to compare it with, and it
was basically a Jim Carrey movie that was not a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   After delaying its release twice, they decided to show it to the
movie press early _ in fact, an unheard of two months before its
release date. And the press went crazy for it. Several national
critics called it one of the best films they'd ever seen, and
Esquire magazine dubbed it ``the film of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   As the word-of-mouth started to hum and the first rave reviews
began to appear in the slick magazines, the studio kicked in with a
barrage of pre-release television ads and a long theatrical
trailer, which collectively show every beat of the movie, including
the characters and mechanics of its surprise last act.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this campaign is that _ while it lets people
know what is in store for them _ it ruins the impact of the movie.
The maximum effectiveness of ``The Truman Show'' depends on not
knowing what's around the corner _ it doesn't even reveal its
premise until the film is half over! The element of surprise is
absolutely crucial to the wonderful experience the critics had two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So my heartfelt advice to Seattle moviegoers is that, difficult
as it may be, do whatever you can to avoid the the avalanche of TV
trailers, read no reviews (including the rest of this one), don't
talk to your friends about it and go see this remarkable movie with
as fresh and unsullied a perspective as you can.
</P>
<P>
   If you must know, however, the film tells the story of an
Everyman named Truman Burbank (Carrey), who lives in an ideal
little middle-America community on what seems to be an island off
the Florida coast: happily married, with a solid job, troubled only
by a certain wanderlust and a nagging fear of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, as we get to know his life, his personality and the
characters around him, certain oddities and incongruities begin to
pile up, and well into the movie's midsection we learn (at roughly
the same time Truman does) that it's all a sham, that he's the
unknowing subject of a bizarre, ``reality-based'' television show.
</P>
<P>
   He's actually an orphan picked for this honor at birth, his wife
and friends are all actors, his community is one vast television
studio with thousands of hidden cameras, and his fear of water has
been induced in him to keep him on his island set. It's ``The Real
World'' times 100, the ultimate paranoid delusion come to life!
</P>
<P>
   As he learns this unbelievable truth, his imperative becomes to
escape the false world and make his way to the outside and the one
person who early-on tried to tell him the truth (Natascha
McElhone). But since he's the star of the world's No. 1-rated TV
show, the behind-the-scene powers cannot afford to lose him _ plus
he's as instantly recognizable as Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Though not strictly speaking a comedy, Carrey is in no way fully
restrained and there's enough humor throughout for the film to
loosely qualify for the designation. And, to be sure, it's most
definitely a satire _ indeed, the wildest imaginable satire of
America's obsession with soap operas and reality TV.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than this. It achieves a genuine pathos as a
character piece: We really care about this guy and his plight. It
also turns its neatest trick in a magnificent last act, as Truman
goes one-on-one with his creator (Ed Harris, in the best
performance of his career), and the film becomes a devastating
religious parable.
</P>
<P>
   The exact meaning of this parable is not easy to put in a few
words, and it's also wide open to interpretation. But it's so
skillfully done that it's impossible for us not to identify with
Truman on this higher level: His situation in his world is our
situation in the cosmos. His argument with his TV-creator becomes
Man's argument with God.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey is likely to come out of this film as a much bigger star
and much more respected actor than he went in. But the truth is
that, good as he is, this is not really an actor's movie. Almost
any star would work in the part and it's not Carrey's movie at all.
It's a film that fits neatly in the groove of its director, Peter
Weir.
</P>
<P>
   In his 30-year-career, this Australian-turned-Hollywood
filmmaker has made his share of non-personal and genre films _
``Green Card,'' ``Dead Poets Society'' _ but his artistic heart has
been in a series of films that are fascinated by the mystery of
man's place in the cosmos, and willing to entertain almost any
metaphysical possibility.
</P>
<P>
   His best films _ ``Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' ``The Last Wave,''
``The Plumber,'' ``Witness,'' ``Gallipoli,'' ``The Mosquito Coast''
and ``Fearless''_ are obsessed with man's spiritual nature and the
world of hidden connections beyond our surface reality. He's the
closest thing Hollywood has ever had to a New Age director.
</P>
<P>
   His problem is that, except for ``Witness,'' the box office has
not supported his filmmaking quest. But with ``The Truman Show,''
he's cleverly sneaked his boldest expression right through the
studio system in the form of a Jim Carrey vehicle. And, unless I
miss my guess, it's going to pay off for him big time.
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show. Directed by Peter Weir. Written by Andrew
Niccol. Cast: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Natascha McElhone, Ed
Harris. Paramount. 104 minutes. Rated PG for thematic elements.

`PERFECT MURDER' LACKS SUSPENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though ``A Perfect Murder'' gets by on the strength of
Michael Douglas' star power and its glossy, noirish production
design, it ends up being a fairly lame thriller that's not half as
suspenseful or riveting as it wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   It's a remake of the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock melodrama, ``Dial M
For Murder,'' and is based on Frederick Knott's adaptation of his
own 1952 West End and Broadway play. (There was also a 1981
TV-movie remake starring Christopher Plummer and Angie Dickinson.)
</P>
<P>
   But in this version, the very British setting has been moved to
upper-crust Manhattan, and Ray Milland's suave, aging-tennis player
villain has become a grim-faced Wall Street manipulator whose
financial world is crumbling all around him.
</P>
<P>
   When he discovers that his immensely wealthy-in-her-own-right
wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) is having an affair with an artist (Viggo
Mortensen) who she doesn't know is actually a fortune-hunting
ex-con, he conspires to bribe the lover into killing her.
</P>
<P>
   The husband then sets up the perfect murder, arranging for an
intruder to break into the house and attack the wife. But, of
course, it does not go as planned, and becomes only the prelude to
a complicated cat-and-mouse game between the three characters.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Dial M'' is not considered one of Hitchcock's great
works, the filmmakers have felt little compunction to be faithful
to it in any way except in spirit, and have made significant
changes to the premise, the characters and especially the last act.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes have not improved the piece, and _ like the
Hitchcock film _ it looses steam and falls apart. While his
direction is fluid and competent, Andrew Davis (``The Fugitive'')
simply doesn't have the master's flair and streak of originality.
</P>
<P>
   The weakest link in the production is Paltrow, especially when
compared to the original's Grace Kelly _ a tough act to follow. Her
character is poorly written, and she seems such a shallow, spoiled
ninny that she fails to be the sympathetic center she's supposed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Considerable better is Douglas as the cold-blooded cad of
husband. He's both magnetic and believable. And after seeing him
play so many nice guys since his 1987 Oscar win for ``Wall
Street,'' it's also fun to have him play an even more evil version
of his Gordon Gekko character.
</P>
<P>
   Also fun is the film's production design, which goes less for a
Hitckcockian look and feel than for the gaudy, high melodrama style
of producer Ross Hunter and such over-produced kitsch classics of
the late '50s and early '60s as ``Midnight Lace,'' ``Portrait in
Black'' and ``Back Street.''
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder. Directed by Andrew Davis. Screenplay by
Patrick Smith Kelly. Cast: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo
Mortensen. Warner Bros. 107 minutes. Rated R for violence and
sexual situations.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

A LOOK A TWO POPULAR RELATIONSHIP GUIDES  
 (WITH DATING-RULES) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TERESA TALERICO  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men are the hunters, the aggressors of the dating world, so let
them take the lead, say the female authors of ``The Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, guys get tired of the pressure to approach women. Confident
women of the '90s should feel free to initiate contact, says the
trio of guys who penned ``What Men Want.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at these two popular relationship guides and their
dueling dating tips for women:
</P>
<P>
   The Rules: ``Don't talk to a man first or ask him to dance.''
</P>
<P>
   What Men Want: ``Men appreciate it when women are willing and
able to make the firt move.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules: ``Don't stare at men. ... It is never necessary to
make eye contact.''
</P>
<P>
   What Men Want: ``Eye contact can be a very effective way to
convey your interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules: ``Most men are not shy, just not really, really
interested if they don't approach you.''
</P>
<P>
   What Men Want: ``It is easier for a man to take a swing at a guy
twice his size, ask his boss for a raise, and run a marathon on a
hot day than it is for him to approach a woman ... it is the woman
we really want to meet who makes us tongue-tied.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules: ``Sometimes game playing is good.''
</P>
<P>
   What Men Want: ``Men are turned off by women who play hard to
get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules: ``Don't call him and rarely return his calls.''
</P>
<P>
   What Men Want: ``Calling a man first after the initial meeting
can score major points.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules: ``On the date itself, be quiet and reserved. ...
He'll think you're interesting and mysterious.''
</P>
<P>
   What Men Want: ``Don't believe that being hard to please or
mysteriously distant wins a man's affection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules: ``Don't be surprised if a man takes a week or two
after the first date to call. He may have a lot of things going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   What Men Want: ``If we like a woman, we will call her within a
week _ and more likely in the next two or three days. If a man
doesn't call you within the first week, forget him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules: ``Remember, let him take the lead. He declares love
first, just as he picks most of the movies, the restaurants and the
concerts the two of you go to.''
</P>
<P>
   What Men Want: ``Men will take advantage of women who let
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules: ``When a man calls you, don't stay on the phone for
more than 10 minutes. Buy a timer if you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   What Men Want: ``If you like him, there is no reason to hide it
or try to get the upper hand. Forget playing hard to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules: ``Don't initiate sex. Biologically, the man must
pursue the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   What Men Want: ``A man wants a woman with sexual power. ... She
knows when it is her turn to lead.''

THESE COPS PUT METTLE TO THE PEDAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE BARNICLE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four weeks ago, Paul Donahue went for a ride. On his 18-speed
trail bike. In Seattle, Washington. With his friends, Timmy
Connolly, Bob Sheridan and Conrad Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks later, they're still out riding. Last night, they
were in Providence. Tomorrow they'll finally be back home, in town,
right here at City Hall Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks. Seattle to Boston. A hundred and twenty miles a day.
No excuses. No sick days. No banging in with blue flu.
</P>
<P>
   Riding in the rain. In the sun. Riding through cool mountain air
in Montana as well as the congested South Side of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been great everywhere we've been,'' Donahue was
saying yesterday over a cell phone as he pedaled through
Connecticut. ``In Helena, Montana, we were met by the mayor of the
city and the governor of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helena is the capital. I think they have about 20 cops on the
force there. Imagine that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Paul Donahue is: a cop. It's what he does for a
living and it's also why he's been on the road with the other three
for the past month: To draw some attention to an outfit called
C.O.P.S. _ Concerns of Police Survivors Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Seattle, they had a big deal put together for us when we
started the trip,'' Donahue was saying. ``Their Police Department
had the first bicycle patrol in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost a motorycle cop there about three years ago. Guy got
killed on the job. His wife and children showed up to wish us well
when we left. They had a big crowd there. It was quite a send-off.
Really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the way things tend to go these days cops only
get their names in the paper when they get killed, indicted, or
accused of behaving poorly. Why, just the other day a really
terrific state trooper had his name smeared across the TV screen
along with the front pages after he stopped and arrested one of
Louise Woodward's lawyers and charged her with drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   She then accused him of asking for sex in exchange for dropping
the charges, apparently convinced the public might believe the
trooper was blind. Yet, for a couple of news cycles, her cheap
insinuation became almost as big a story as the dumb things the
shabby lawyer allegedly told the trooper about her pathetic client.
</P>
<P>
   When police are caught acting like thieves with badges,
corrupting the system by ripping off drug dealers, and lying people
into jail, that is news. But that is far from the normal pattern of
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   There simply aren't many jobs in America where the wage-earners
had left for work with the knowledge _ often buried in the back of
the mind _ that they could lose their lives in the performance of
their tasks. No office offers the constant cycle of potential
danger found on the streets or highways _ rural as well as urban _
where it can all end in a single second.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue is 47. He's been on the job 19 years and is currently
assigned to Station 14 in Brighton. Connolly is 32 and works at the
police academy. Sheridan is 39 and is assigned to the motorcycle
unit. Bailey is an accomplished triathlete and has spent most of
the past month looking over his shoulder at the other three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get up, do about 40 push-ups and then ride all day,''
Donahue pointed out. ``I have to tell you, this is a beautiful
country. It's unbelievable. The Rocky Mountains. The rivers. It's
incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the best part about America is the people. Everywhere
we've been the people have been fabulous to us. We've been staying
at places local police departments along the route hooked us up
with. Motels. Station houses. People's homes. It's been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, they were guests of the great Buddy Cianci, the
marvelous mayor of Providence and the only chief executive of any
city in the country with his own pasta sauce. This morning _ if
Cianci does not steal their bikes _ they will travel the short
distance between Providence and Foxborough, kind of a day off
actually, prior to biking their way into Boston and a reception
Friday at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The awareness they hope to raise is almost as important as the
money people have contributed to C.O.P.S. Those funds have helped
more than 8,000 families since the organization was formed 14 years
ago to assist survivors; a rather cold, antiseptic word that means
the husbands, wives, sons, and daughters of police officers who
went to work one morning and never returned. And here we have four
guys, riding just for them.

TRAVIS RAITT TO PLAY FOOTBALL IN IOWA _ AND GET HIS DEGREE AT BU
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some ways, his college days are already over and he is well
into his postgraduate career.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way Travis Raitt wanted it, of course. If the
6-foot-3-inch, 270-pound offensive lineman could have written his
own script, he would have kept the main act here, at Boston
University, where Raitt and his fellow Terriers would work their
way back into Division 1-AA national football contention.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt would have been going through this summer at BU preparing
for his final season at a school he chose four years ago because he
liked what it had to offer, both academically and athletically.
</P>
<P>
   But as anyone who has been around the Terrier program knows,
that's not the script that has been played out.
</P>
<P>
   At BU, football exists only in memory. That's been the case
because the school chose to drop the program last fall. And Raitt,
who had to choose between staying, getting a degree, and giving up
football or moving on, has taken the latter course, but with an
intriguing twist.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt is now a mercenary in the broadest sense of the word.
Starting last winter and spring and continuing through next fall,
he is attending classes at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   He also is playing football _ right now he is second-team center
and guard on the depth chart _ for the Hawkeyes, a situation that
is about a solar system away from the ``football'' atmosphere at BU
the past several months.
</P>
<P>
   But come December, Raitt will return to Boston as a student.
He'll pick up his degree in marketing from BU and either move into
the business world or, if luck stays with him, on to professional
football.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, what Raitt is doing is taking a year's fellowship in
college football at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing illegal about this. Not in the eyes of the
NCAA, which allows players from schools who drop football to
transfer and play at another university immediately without having
to sit out a season.
</P>
<P>
   For Raitt, it's an opportunity that wasn't there four years ago
when he came out of Miami Lakes, Fla., with only the service
academies, the Ivy League, and Division 1-AA schools interested in
him.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa? The Big Ten? Then it was fantasy land. Now it's months
away from being reality.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt says he's as excited as a freshman. ``It's just so
different than anything I've experienced before,'' he said
recently, sitting in the athletic offices at BU during a visit back
from Iowa. ``The Big Ten. All that tradition. Why, they had more
people at our spring game out there than saw us play all of last
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Raitt made it clear that he will return to BU because of his
friends and the value of the degree he will earn. Athletically,
however, the wounds of last season's administration decision remain
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of fond memories here,'' he said. ``But I still
don't understand it. There's still a lot of anger in us. We gave a
commitment to this school to make it the best we could make it in
football. Now they don't even acknowledge that we were ever here,
or at least that's the way it seems to us. It just seems as if we
busted our butt for this school and they gave us nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   BU contended that its decision to scrap football was based on
lack of revenue, lack of interest, and lots of other things.
Regardless of the reasons, football, part of the BU tradition since
1884, is gone and not likely to come back, despite the sincere
efforts of some special-interest groups to make another go of it.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt says the demise of the program came as a shock to most of
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was frustrating because we felt there was
nothing that we could say or do that mattered,'' said Raitt.
</P>
<P>
   The reality was that if any Terrier wanted to play football this
season, it would have to be somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was worried that no one would be interested in
me,'' said Raitt. ``But then the calls started to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Given carte blanche to go anywhere, talk to anyone, Raitt put
out feelers. He talked to people at Pittsburgh, Marshall, and
Youngstown State. He visited Arizona and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the Big Ten because it felt comfortable, just as BU had
felt four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt makes it clear he is a short-timer at Iowa. ``I took
classes this spring and I'll take classes next fall,'' he said.
``I'll also come back in the summer and start working out to get
ready for the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Raitt's arrival at Iowa was met with enthusiasm, and he was
treated as a welcome gift handed to the Hawkeye coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a tremendous kid,'' said Iowa offensive line coach
Frank Verducci. ``When he came here, we felt he was the perfect fit
for us. He gives us what we needed _ depth on the offensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   Raitt worked as second- and first-team center and second-team
guard before a minor injury knocked him out of spring drills.
</P>
<P>
   Verducci says the depth chart is meaningless in terms of Raitt.
``He's more like the sixth man on the offensive line,'' Verducci
said. ``He's going to play. Play a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is all Travis Raitt wanted to do at BU.

   THE HIBERNIA OIL PLATFORM, Off Newfoundland _ The Puma transport
helicopter, shuddering against icy wind blasts, settled on the
boxing-ring-sized landing pad perched a dizzying 300 feet above the
ocean swells.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers leaping onto the grillwork deck were clad in
rubber survival suits _ a cumbersome cross between scuba garb and
spacesuit _ that could mean the difference between survival and
quick death from hypothermia in the waters of the North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   They are roughnecks, mudmen, geologists, drill technicians and
other toilers in the oil trade. All of them had come to punch in
for another three-week, 12-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week shift on
the Hibernia platform 200 miles southeast of St. John's, smack in
the middle of ``Iceberg Alley'' where the treacherous ice mountains
sweep down from Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Newfoundland, the notoriously hard-luck province where tens of
thousands of fishery workers were cast out of work when codfish
stocks collapsed five years ago, is today pinning its economic
hopes on undersea crude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offshore oil fields are our sleeping tiger, and the tiger
is just starting to roar,'' said Chuck Furey, provincial minister
for industry.
</P>
<P>
   The colossal Hibernia rig _ rising 735 feet from the ocean floor
_ is half the height of the Empire State Building. More important,
it is the first success story of what could become the first great
oil boom of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real industry is starting to emerge, even if it's still in
its embryonic stage'' said Donald May, an economist at Memorial
University in St. John's. ``And that's something Newfoundland
desperately needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other potentially huge oil fields have been identified beneath
the turbulent seas off Newfoundland. Only last week, Gulf Canada
began seismic exploration of deposits to the south of the province
that could dwarf Hibernia's projected 1 billion barrels of
recoverable oil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, construction will soon begin on drilling rigs to be
located on the Terra Nova south of the Hibernia reservoirs. Another
offshore oil project, Husky Oil's White-rose fields, may start
pumping oil by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Hibernia platform, towed into position last June and
maneuvered into place atop a massive concrete pedestal anchored to
the sea bottom, is one of the most ambitious, expensive and
disputed engineering projects in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The dream dates back nearly two decades when petroleum
geologists first discovered two oil fields _ the Hibernia and
Avalon _ within the Jeanne d'Arc Basin on the northeast portion of
Newfoundland's Grand Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the platform took more than five years to
complete at a cost topping $4.2 billion. It was jeered across
Canada as an overpriced, government-subsidized ``mega-workfare''
project that would do little more than provide short-term
construction jobs in the impoverished province of 558,000 people,
where jobless rates run at more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last November 17, the jeers turned to wild cheers as
Hibernia came a gusher _ spewing forth more oil than the headiest
estimates had forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``So maybe we Newfoundlanders will have the last laugh, 'ey?''
said Sean Ryan, 35, an out-of-work fisherman turned oil roughneck
as he fitted a rock-chewing bit onto a drill shaft. ``So maybe
there's going to be some future for the old place after all.''
</P>
<P>
   The fiery plume of Hibernia's gas burn-off flare is visible for
miles around, and has become a well-known landmark for air crews
and seamen on the northern trans-Atlantic routes between Europe and
North America.
</P>
<P>
   Hibernia's production, now 50,000 barrels a day, is gradually
building to a peak of 135,000 barrels a day for the next 19 years.
Ten years from now, Newfoundland will be pumping 500,000 barrels a
day from this and other fields on the Grand Banks, or nearly half
of Canada's output of light oil, according to some projections.
</P>
<P>
   Other so-called gravity-based offshore platforms similar in
scale to the Hibernia rig are in operation around the world, mainly
in the North Sea fields off Scotland. But Hibernia is the first
platform ever constructed to confront the threat of icebergs with
an ultra-fortified design that contributed to the stupendous cost
of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Hibernia fields lie generally in the middle of the ponderous
flow of icebergs shed from the western shores of Greenland.
Hundreds of ships, most famously the Titanic, have been sent to the
bottom of this region of the North Atlantic after a fatal encounter
with floating ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a danger never far from our minds,'' said Howard Granger,
radio operator and weather watcher aboard the rig. ```When they
come within 24 nautical miles of the platform, we start taking very
serious notice. When they come within six nautical miles, we
react.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction might mean dispatching one of the emergency vessels
bobbing on permanent standby around the platform to lasso a
medium-sized iceberg and towing it to a safer drift. Smaller bergs
are blasted off course with water cannons pumping 2,500 tons of
seawater per hour.
</P>
<P>
   If a true monster iceberg were to bear down on the oil platform,
however, there would be no choice but to abandon the rig and hope
that the enormous concrete base _ with its collar of
five-foot-thick ``teeth'' meant to absorb impacts that no other
structure is designed to absorb _ saves the day.
</P>
<P>
   In the radio room, with its satellite down-links, radar screens
and high tech communications gear, operators plot the precise
position and exact course of every piece of ice carried down to the
North Atlantic by the cold Labrador currents.
</P>
<P>
   The Hibernia field is jointly owned by Mobil Oil Canada, Chevron
Canada, Petro Canada, Murphy Oil, Norsk Hydro and the Canadian
government, which injected $1.8 billion into the project to keep it
alive during rough economic times in the mid-1990s. About 5,800
people were employed during construction, and about 650 have
secured fulltime jobs onshore and off.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, there are 270 people living and working aboard
the platform, or a total of 540 in two shifts _ three weeks on,
three weeks off. They sleep in small, two-bed living quarters
similar to college dormitory rooms, and feast on sumptuous courses
of steak, Italian sausage, curries, fried fish, potatoes and salads
dished out in the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of alcohol or drugs is a firing offense. So is
fighting. There is a large, well-equipped gym where employees can
sweat off the pounds _ or pound out frustrations _ as well as cable
television, movie offerings, computer games and free telephone
calls home. Even bingo nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is good, and the work is hard enough that the three
weeks seem to fly by, and you're back with your family,'' said Pat
Druken, 42, who works with the ``mud,'' or lubricants used to cool
down drill bits and other sophisticated heavy equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the project has been dogged by occasional tragedy _ in
1982, an early-phase drilling rig, the Ocean Ranger, went down in a
heavy winter storm, taking all 84 hands to the bottom _ the worst
injury since the platform went up a year ago has been a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   The most frustrating part of the job, workers say, comes when a
shift ends but the fog is so deep or the weather so severe that
transport choppers cannot make the flight to carry them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose Newfoundland wouldn't be Newfoundland without
godawful weather,'' said a drilling foreman, Wayne Walters. ``But
when your 21 days are done, and you find yourself waiting day after
day for that flight home to your wife and kids, it's hard to get
sentimental about sea fog.''

<P>
   The recent nuclear tests in the South Asian subcontinent have
shaken the international community. Their consequences are much
more than just the start of a regional nuclear-arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are already saying that nuclear non-proliferation
and disarmament is now a lost cause. That may turn out to be true,
but only if the policy makers of major powers confine themselves to
short-term reaction, without drawing appropriate conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the suggestions being made in the wake of the tests
could lead to exactly the wrong conclusions. Some see them as a
pretext for refusing to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
and even abandoning negotiations on reducing and eliminating
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt in my mind that by their recent actions India
and Pakistan have not strengthened their security. To the contrary,
by launching the mechanism of mutual threats they have added a
strong element of unpredictability to the already difficult
security equation in the subcontinent. Any perceived gain in status
or ``clout'' too is a delusion. The euphoria will pass, but the
angry global reaction will continue to cause both countries serious
problems, not only international but domestic as well.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, one must recognize the validity of much of the
criticism directed at the five nuclear powers, particularly the
United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it has long been obvious that the Non-Proliferation
Treaty is bound to be shaky unless there is real movement toward
nuclear disarmament. Yet, of late both the United States and Russia
have been making it increasingly clear that they intend to rely for
their defense on nuclear weapons, advanced delivery systems and
anti-ballistic missiles. As was to be expected, the indefinite
extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty failed to lock in the
status quo or to increase the treaty's credibility and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   We have to face the truth today: That status quo has now been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   Economic sanctions offer no solution. Indeed, as we have seen,
they can cause resentment and bitterness and make the situation
even more difficult. Nevertheless, the international community
cannot afford to ignore the contempt with which it has been treated
by New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   More important, however, is to seek constructive courses of
action, primarily within the United Nations. Only a serious,
no-nonsense dialogue can persuade India and Pakistan that they must
cease the nuclear escalation and adhere to non-proliferation and
comprehensive test ban treaties.
</P>
<P>
   But the other nuclear powers too must do a lot. It can no longer
be business as usual. They must act concretely to prove that they
are serious about nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   I would also urge greater attention to the problem of nuclear
delivery systems. The United States and Russia are observing the
treaty banning intermediate and shorter-range missiles that
President Reagan and I signed in 1987. Negotiations should now
begin on enlarging this treaty to include other countries, since
missiles with a range of about 300 miles to 3,500 miles are
particularly dangerous on a regional level.
</P>
<P>
   I want to recall what happened in 1991, when the United States
and the Soviet Union agreed, on the basis of an informal
arrangement, to drastically reduce their arsenals of tactical
nuclear weapons. Similar steps today, taken unilaterally, without
engaging in protracted negotiations, would go a long way toward
normalizing the situation and persuading people that world leaders
are capable of acting to assure their security.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I have to put the actions of India and Pakistan within
the overall context of the world's post-Cold War evolution. It has
been adversely affected by the mistaken conclusion that one side
won the Cold War and thus secured for itself the right to
unconstrained leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the intentions were, things went wrong. Over the past
years, all kinds of things have been tried _ but little or nothing
was ever done to strengthen the United Nations, or to coordinate on
a regular and systematic basis the nuclear policies of the existing
powers and seriously consult with the threshold states.
</P>
<P>
   It should now be clear that in this as in other matters, one
power center is simply not capable of being the sole decision-maker
and regulator. This is a lesson to be learned if we are to have
fewer unpleasant surprises in the future.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   EDITORS: The following identification line must be printed with
the column. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (This commentary is adapted from a panel discussion entitled
``Democracy: Is It for Everyone,'' held at the Council on Foreign
Relations, in New York, on May 19, 1998.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Is democracy for everyone? I think the answer is no, not yet,
but it certainly is for more people now than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the single-most important political phenomenon of
the late 20th century has been the expansion of democracy in
country after country around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And by democracy I refer to electoral democracies _ which I
define as a political system whose most powerful decision makers
are selected through relatively fair, honest, periodic elections,
in which candidates can freely compete and in which virtually all
the adult population is eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   By that definition, the number of democracies in the world has
gone up very substantially in the past few decades, from about 40
back in 1970, to 66, according to Freedom House, in 1988, to 117
now. This expansion has, in considerable measure, been worldwide;
it has affected every part of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   There is a heavy concentration of democracies, obviously, among
wealthy countries and among those who were part of, shall we say,
Western civilization. But at least one democratic regime exists in
every major civilization or culture in the world.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to democracy as it spreads around the world? I
think it is becoming more variegated; it is taking on different
forms and acquiring different characteristics in different
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Second, democracy, as I've defined it, is simply a way of
constituting, limiting and changing governments. There is often a
tendency, however, to see it as something much more _ as, for
example, to suppose that the introduction of democracy will bring
about peace, equality, prosperity, harmony among nations and
classes and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think that is the case. For governments produced by
elections can be inefficient, corrupt, shortsighted or
discriminatory. They can pursue aggressive nationalistic policies
and pursue ruinous economic policy. Democracy is no guarantee that
other good things will happen, although they may.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tendency among people to assume that democracy won't
have unhappy consequences. However, I think we have to confront the
fact that, in this world, elections will produce results which
don't necessarily make us happy; they may produce anti-Western
governments, illiberal governments, ones that we find very
difficult to deal with _ including, when they are weak and resting
on fragile coalitions, even governments which will go off, as India
just has, and explode nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To underline this point, I think this sort of caution,
concerning democracy, is desirable because of the widespread
assumption that, if other countries will simply democratize _ if we
can encourage them to move in that direction _ they will be
friendly and cooperate with us.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this assumption underlies the thinking of virtually
everybody on every side of the China debate. If only we could make
China democratic, the thinking goes, it would be so much more easy
to deal with. Well, perhaps it would be, but, on the other hand, it
is not difficult to conceive of a democratic China simultaneously
being a China which is highly nationalistic, in which politicians
competing for office appeal to Chinese nationalism and find it
worth their while, in terms of votes, to denounce the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So while I am all in favor of promoting more democracies, I
think we ought to do it in a realistic way, with our eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think instituting a democratic system of government is
necessarily going to guarantee greater prosperity, greater
equality, elimination of ethnic conflict or the solution of a lot
of other social problems and ills. I do not mean that it will be
impossible for democratic governments to do that; only that there
is no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   I think democracy is desirable for two reasons: One, it provides
order and a mechanism for incremental change, and it provides a way
of removing from office political leaders who have turned out to be
total flops.
</P>
<P>
   Two, it is also one way _ not the only way _ of protecting
liberty in a society. And I agree that violations of liberty are
less likely if you have a democratic system of elected officials
who are going to have to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   It is timely, of course, to consider that India is a democracy.
Yet one of the reasons why the recent nuclear explosions took
place, it seems to me, was the existence of a weak coalition
government and a minority party that obviously wants to build
popular support. Indeed, apparently _ so far, at least _ it has
been extraordinarily successful in building popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, I think it is necessary, even though India is a
democracy, to recognize that lots of things make the relations
between the United States and India very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conference at Harvard University, where people
attended from the major countries and regions of the world, and
discussed the attitudes of their political intellectual elites
toward the international system, the use of force, and so forth,
one of the points that came through loud and clear was the seething
resentment under the surface, in large part, in many areas of the
world about the United States. We are the superpower and people
don't like that.
</P>
<P>
   This came through particularly clear in a paper prepared by a
scholar from India. He wrote of the divisions among the Indian
elites, including the Gandhians, yet concluded: ``For all Indian
elites, the United States represents the major diplomatic and
political threat. On virtually every issue of concern to India, the
U.S. has veto or mobilizational power, whether it is nuclear,
technological, economic, governmental or political matters. That
is, the United States can deny India its objectives and can rally
others to join it in punishing India.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, if any, on the globe will remain in the authoritarian camp?
Today 55 percent of the people in the world live under democratic
government, according to Dr. Gideon Rose, at the Council on Foreign
Relations. I believe that 50 years from now a larger percentage of
the world will be democratic. I would not guess exactly what
percentage or who will and won't be. But I will say there will be
some non-democratic regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically perhaps, given such a pivotal role on the world
stage, the situation of democracy in the United States, I believe,
is not as good as it should be. It certainly seems to have been
more vigorous in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem is the extent to which political competition
now has become increasingly competition among candidates, or
between candidates, rather than between parties, and the parties
have tended to become service organizations for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there is the tremendous impact of television, not
just in terms of the influence on voters. Rather, the big influence
of television is the tremendous demand for money, and that's what
has made fund-raising such a central preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   To glance through the daily newspapers, it seems that our
president now probably spends more time fund-raising for his party
than any other single activity. I don't know that any of the bills
in Congress are going to remedy that. Very probably there may have
to be some drastic action, such as provision of public funds for
campaigns, or at least for advertising on television.
</P>
<P>
   But then, democracies are not necessarily going to introduce
lots of good things. One can even think of democratic governments
that have been aggressive and that, in one way or another, have
terrorized parts of their population.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the young people of the country are inclined to wait for
the ideal world, or not wait, will depend upon, in large part, what
governments do and how governments act.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't think youth, or students in particular, are
necessarily going to be the central force for change in the coming
years _ and not necessarily a force for positive change. They may
be, but like so many other parts of the equation, that isn't at all
certain.

CITING OBJECTIONS TO DOMESTIC PARTNERS LAW, SALVATION ARMY CUTS
SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDEN and TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Salvation Army has decided to end its
contracts with San Francisco and shrink programs serving the
homeless, drug addicts and the aged because of a dispute over the
city's domestic partners law.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Richard Love, a spokesman for the Salvation Army, said
after 11 months of negotiation, the organization had told city
officials Wednesday it could not comply with the ordinance. It is
giving up $3.5 million in city contracts to serve the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be applying for those funds,'' Love said, ``but
we're not leaving the city of San Francisco. We've provided a
quality service here without discrimination for 118 years and we'll
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the $3.5 million was a relatively small part of the $18
million budget for the organization's San Francisco operations. The
organization plans to reduce its services beginning Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic-partners ordinance, which took effect June 1, 1997,
requires companies that do business with the city to provide the
same benefits to their workers with unmarried partners as they do
to married couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disheartening, it really is, but you can't put a
price tag on discrimination,'' said Supervisor Leslie Katz,
co-author of the benefits ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are challenging the ordinance in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Three Salvation Army programs, including meals for 1,700 senior
citizens, receive taxpayer dollars and will be reduced, though the
programs will not be closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army objects to the domestic partners law on
religious grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army's belief system, grounded in traditional
interpretation of Scripture, does not perceive domestic partnership
arrangements as similar to the sanctity granted marriage
partners,'' read an editorial in New Frontier, a Salvation Army
publication.
</P>
<P>
   But the editorial goes on to say that the group provides
services to individuals regardless of race, religion, sexual
orientation or marital status.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first religious organization to find fault with
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the city and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San
Francisco, which has affiliated agencies with city contracts,
fought the mandate. The two sides eventually reached an accord.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement allows employees of Catholic agencies _ or any
other organization doing business with the city _ to designate
someone in their household as eligible to receive
``spousal-equivalent benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   That could include a spouse, sibling, other relative or
unmarried partner. Citing church doctrine, the archdiocese has been
a vocal foe of sanctioning domestic-partner relations, gay and
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said the Salvation Army had been offered a similar deal but
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought early on we could use that language,'' said Love,
``but as it progressed, we realized it was important to speak with
one national voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Love said the Salvation Army had asked for a ``sole provider
exemption'' that allows a waiver to contractors providing a unique
good or service.
</P>
<P>
   Love said such waivers had been granted to Blue Cross,
Encyclopaedia Brittanica, the U.S. Tennis Association and the
Lawrence Hall of Science, and 300 other companies or organizations.
The city denied the Salvation Army's request, he said.

THREE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR WOULD LOWER AGE OF CONSENT
FOR ABORTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pushing the envelope on abortion rights and risking the wrath of
voters, the three candidates for the Democratic nomination for
governor said Wednesday they would lower the age requiring parental
consent for an abortion from 18 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' positions were revealed during a gubernatorial
forum held at The Boston Globe. The candidates were asked how they
would reconcile two laws: one setting the age of consent for sexual
relations in Massachusetts at 16, the other requiring women under
the age of 18 to get permission from a parent or judge to obtain an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it must be reconciled,'' said Patricia McGovern, the
former state senator from Lawrence. ``I think 16 is the age and I
do believe in a judicial consent process for children, and they are
children, or children under that age.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Donnelly, a longtime opponent of abortion rights as a
member of Congress from Dorchester, agreed the age of consent
should be 16 both for sexual relations and abortion. When he
announced his candidacy for governor earlier this year, Donnelly
said he would uphold a woman's right to an abortion if he were
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, the attorney general, said he, too, believed
the laws needed to be reconciled, though he hoped there would still
be ``a huge amount of parental consent involved and people would
think this decision through.''
</P>
<P>
   When a decision on abortion needs to be made, Harshbarger said,
it ought to be ``as easy as possible. The law should not be
directing additional barriers to these kinds of very difficult
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the issue of parental consent turns into an
election-year controversy may depend on the reaction of suburban
voters, said Lou DiNatale, a political analyst at the University of
Massachusetts-Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will suburban independents feel this is an appropriate
response to ensure the right to an abortion or will they think this
is encouraging inappropriate sexual behavior?'' asked DiNatale.
</P>
<P>
   And while the state's population favors abortion rights by a
60-40 ratio, he added, ``that's not the safe position for any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci also favors lowering
the age to 16 for requiring a young woman to get permission from a
parent or a judge for an abortion. For the last several years,
Cellucci has filed bills calling for the Legislature to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph D. Malone, the Republican state treasurer, is the only
gubernatorial candidate against changing the law. ``I am
pro-choice,'' Malone said in a statement. ``However, I support
parental notification because there is definitely a role for
parental involvement. The law as it currently stands is
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for abortion rights were ecstatic Wednesday to hear of
the candidates' positions. On the flip side, antiabortion activists
expressed dismay, particularly with Donnelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that amazing, appalling,'' said Philip D. Moran,
president of the Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund. ``If a young woman
cannot go into the hospital and have her appendix removed without
her parents' consent, I don't see why she should be able to go in
and have an abortion. There is no logic to this.''
</P>
<P>
   But abortion-rights advocates said the need for permission often
causes a minor to go out of state for the procedure, or even to
obtain an illegal and unsafe abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't fair to kids to make them go to court or go out of
state to get a constitutionally protected medical service,'' said
Susan Webber, vice president for external affairs at the Planned
Parenthood League of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress is expected to debate a bill making it a
federal crime for any adult to take a minor across state lines to
evade parental consent laws to obtain an abortion.

NEW LOOK AT SAME OLD SITUATIONS IN `SKIN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
Our rating: 3 Stars  
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In ``Under the Skin,'' a young English woman
deals with the grief and resentment generated by her mother's death
by going on a self-destructive sex-and-drinking jag. Anyone could
tell her that this is only going to make a sad situation worse,
since we've seen where this path leads in dozens of previous
movies. But just like the protagonists of all those films, she's
not about to listen to warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that saves ``Skin'' from the same old prurient/preachy
same-old is its fierce central performance by newcomer Samantha
Morton. Lacing recklessness with palpable vulnerability, Morton
makes the film's heroine, Iris, convincingly wanton yet touchingly
naive. A lot of the situations in the movie are old hat, but Morton
brings them to life through the pain of a troubled girl who's
experiencing them for the first time. And not having a uniformly
awful experience.
</P>
<P>
   The writer-director, Carine Adler, also makes her feature debut
with ``Skin.'' She's very arty _ big on colored lens filters, odd
camera angles and unnecessary slo-mo _ especially in what might
have otherwise been boldly graphic erotic sequences. She likes to
have Iris talk dirty on a voice-over track, telling us what Adler's
a bit too timid to show.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker has good insight into fractious relationships,
however, and more of the movie, fortunately, addresses that than
the supposedly shocking stuff. Iris has a fascinating push-pull,
for example, with her older, married-and-pregnant sister Rose
(Claire Rushbrook, of Mike Leigh's ``Secrets and Lies''). It's far
more interesting than any of her increasingly degrading encounters
with strange men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Skin'' suggests that a good hug and some traditional
domestic role-playing is all Iris needs to straighten out. Morton's
harrowing but fervid performance indicates, however, that it will
take more than that to truly tame this wild heart.

OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Writer-director Noah Baumbach made a bit of indie
splash three years ago with his debut feature, ``Kicking and
Screaming,'' a deft look at a group of post-college slackers
wondering what to do with their lives other than alphabetize movies
at the neighborhood video store.
</P>
<P>
   With his new film, ``Mr. Jealousy,'' Baumbach revisits the same
kinds of characters (with many of the same actors from ``Kicking
and Screaming), only now these people are 10 years older, a little
bit wiser and, yes, still wondering what to do with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Jealousy,'' though, is anything but aimless. Baumbach has
a keen eye for form and character, and even though some of his
dialogue can sound a little self-conscious at times, it is usually
interesting, revealing and, best of all, funny. And while some
filmmakers seem destined to keep making the same movie for the rest
of their lives (Ed Burns would be the most blatant example),
Baumbach here has altered the form and content enough to make you
want to keep an eye out for his next feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Jealousy'' could well be the nickname of the film's
protagonist, the appropriately named Lester Grimm (Eric Stoltz), a
man so consumed with his girlfriends' pasts that he can't relate to
them in the present. Lester is trying, though, particularly now
that he's met Ramona Ray (Annabella Sciorra), a sexy, smart and
impulsive woman who lives in the moment, but carries a lot of
history with her.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Ramona's history includes old boyfriend Dashiell (Chris
Eigeman), a successful writer who has been hailed by some as ``the
voice of his generation.'' This annoys Lester since his novel has
been stuck on page one for quite some time. One day, Lester spots
Dashiell on the street and follows him to his therapy group.
Consumed by jealousy _ and curiosity _ Lester joins the group,
using his best friend's name and problems as an alias.
</P>
<P>
   This sets up the movie's best scenes, with Dashiell and Lester
jousting in group therapy while the shrink (director Peter
Bogdanovich playing another wonderfully named character _ Dr. Poke)
referees. Baumbach also has crafted some interesting scenes between
Lester and best friend Vince (Carlos Jacott), whose impending
marriage seems to be driving an unspoken wedge between the two. The
detail, though subtle, is rich and revealing in character.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are uniformly fine, although we could have done
without much of the monotone, Joe Friday voice-over narration.
Sciorra is particularly good, having finally been given a
three-dimensional character to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Jealousy'' suggests that its title vice may not be
completely without merit since it forces us to confront our fears
and dreams and actually deal with them. It's a novel idea, apropos
for a film brimming with captivating notions about relationships
and life.

COMPLETE `TRUMAN SHOW' TOUCHES MIND, HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 Stars  
 
  
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The shadow of an arm tentatively reaches across a
plain, white wall, which looks like nothing so much as an otherwise
blank screen. The real arm casting the shadow enters the frame and
the fingertips meet.
</P>
<P>
   A simple enough shot. But a particularly eloquent one, coming as
it does toward the end of ``The Truman Show.'' The image sums up
the tensions between illusion and reality, seeing and believing,
cozy reassurance and stark exploitation, that this unusually rich
Hollywood production adroitly examines from its first exquisitely
composed frame to this one and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   A triumphant change of pace for Jim Carrey and the finest
realization of director Peter Weir's inquisitive approach to
filmmaking, ``The Truman Show'' is a marvel of artful, intelligent
entertainment. More, it's as complete a movie as it can possibly
be.
</P>
<P>
   A hugely amusing satire of television's growing influence on our
lives, the film also serves up deep thoughts on the medium's
psychological effects. It's sunny and pretty with a tone that's
souffle light _ its form mimics the kind of reassuring programming
the show within the movie lampoons _ and that makes the dark
implications roiling under the contrived warmth all the more
unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one part of an apt and imaginative visual plan
that's all about viewing and being viewed. The movie even unfolds
with an unerring sense of what needs to be shown or explained, and
when.
</P>
<P>
   And like most great films, ``Truman'' not only involves the
audience, but implicates us as well. It asks just what the hell we
think we're doing, peeking into other people's lives and judging
the entertainment value thereof. Then it makes us question how much
we sacrifice every time we opt for a fake, media-manufactured
emotion in place of a real experience.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting way back on the contortions, Carrey is middle American
innocence personified as Truman Burbank. But even though he lives
in the outlandishly clean and picturesque coastal town of Seahaven
(filmed, frighteningly, in the actual, planned community of
Seaside, Fla.), his doofy neighborliness is not the bland stuff of
'50s sitcoms. He's more like ``It's a Wonderful Life's'' George
Bailey, a decent, pleasant fellow who's nonetheless being eaten up
inside by the notion that his comforting, conformist life is
missing something vital.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, though Truman doesn't know it, every moment of
that picture-perfect life is being manipulated from the outside.
Adopted before birth by a corporation, Truman's entire existence
has been broadcast to the world for 30 years. Seahaven is a set
inside the world's largest soundstage. The ``sea'' around it, the
``sky'' above, the very atmosphere _ like everything that happens
to Truman _ is controlled by Christof (Ed Harris), the creator of
the greatest show on Earth, and a man so serenely drunk with power
he isn't even aware of his own malevolence.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's every move is captured by 5,000 hidden cameras and
microphones (we, unlike his billions of addicted TV fans, are
spared the grosser bodily functions). His lifelong best friend
Marlon (Noah Emmerich) always appears with a sixpack of beer, one
of the endless product placements that pay the show's bills. Marlon
listens sympathetically to Truman's growing misgivings, but like
everyone else, he's a paid actor who has been lying to Truman his
whole life.
</P>
<P>
   So is Meryl (Laura Linney), Truman's nurturing and
accommodating, um, wife, who offers sex and satisfying consumer
goods whenever he gets that wild hair to run off to Fiji (the
sequel will just have to tell us what her contract negotiations
were like).
</P>
<P>
   She's not the only thing keeping Truman down on the
picket-fenced farm. For example, Seahaven's travel agency, bright
and cheerful as every other place and person Truman knows, is
subtly designed to scare anyone off the idea of ever leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Because, of course, if Truman ever gets into the wider world,
the show is over. As he blindly but inexorably moves in this
direction, Christof starts thinking rewrite. And hey, if all of
those people tuned into ``Seinfeld's'' last gasp, what kind of
ratings will the death of Mr. Television himself generate?
</P>
<P>
   Though it's being touted as Carrey's dramatic breakthrough,
Truman is, quite rightly, as stylized a creation as Ace Ventura or
The Mask. Carrey and Weir, as well as writer Andrew Niccol
(``Gattaca''), understand that someone raised in a completely
falsified environment will not behave like anybody we've ever
known. The great thing about Carrey's endearingly geeky performance
is that it is also expresses pain, fear and longing that we can all
empathize with.
</P>
<P>
   And unless you've been numbed by watching too much television
for too long, you'll realize that that very fulfilling, enjoyable
feeling of empathy is one of the things ``The Truman Show'' is
warning us about.
</P>
<P>
   Critics toss around the word complex as an almost catchall
superlative for anything we like. ``The Truman Show'' is one of a
few, special movies that is not only brimming with complexity, but
forces us to respond to it in multiple ways on many levels. It may
not be the easiest way to feel good at the movies, but boy, is that
ever entertainment.

DOUGLAS DEVILISHLY GOOD IN `PERFECT MURDER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``A Perfect Murder'' is an imperfect thriller, an
eager-to-please movie that delivers a few tingles but not nearly
enough tension for its audience to willingly surrender and suspend
disbelief. That leaves the viewer in a knowing no man's land,
completely aware of whodunit and why, but not particularly
interested in sticking around to see how the whole thing turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas stars as Steven Taylor, a successful commodities
trader living perilously close to the edge financially. All's not
well on the home front, either. Steven has just learned that his
young trophy wife, Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow), is having an affair
with a struggling artist, David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen), who,
naturally, is sensitive and emotionally available for her in ways
that her controlling husband never is.
</P>
<P>
   Emily comes from old money; thus, she certainly didn't marry
Steven for his mastery of margin trading. Why she married Steven at
all is a question the film never bothers to address. Why Steven
might have married her is gradually revealed in his amoral behavior
after he discovers her indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   Steven confronts Shaw with proof of the adultery, and with
evidence of something more. It turns out Shaw _ which is not his
real name _ has been twice convicted of separating rich women from
their fortunes. But instead of using this information to chase Shaw
away, Steven attempts to employ it as blackmail and tempt Shaw into
murdering his wife. (Wouldn't divorce on the grounds of adultery
make more sense? Just asking.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Dial M for
Murder,'' a rather slight work by the legendary director that was
largely an adaptation of an old play of the same name. Director
Andrew Davis (``The Fugitive'') has opened his version up, taking
us out of the Taylors' well-appointed Manhattan penthouse and
placing much of the action in some 70 locations throughout New
York, including the United Nations building, the Ellis Island Ferry
and the Fulton Fish Market.
</P>
<P>
   The locales certainly give ``A Perfect Murder'' a high-gloss
sheen, but they can't disguise some of the movie's problems. Chief
among them is Paltrow's character. It's obvious the filmmakers want
us to see Emily as smart and perceptive, but they keep placing her
in situations where we have no choice but to think the opposite.
Her reactions to some of the plot's twists and turns simply do not
register as believable, much less sympathetic. And without a
rooting interest, the audience is left watching rather
dispassionately as the movie's house of cards story inevitably
plays out.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, playing an aging, millionaire hustler whose financial
empire is about to crumble, provides most of the film's true
pleasures. Few actors convey seething, controlled anger better than
Douglas, who takes dialogue like, ``I always thought the word
`bludgeon' had a spur-of-the-moment sound'' and makes it so
deliciously vile that you can't help but smile. He's Gordon Gekko
10 years later _ longer in the tooth, wider in the waistband and
three steps closer to hell. His reactions alone are almost worth a
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   But much of our enjoyment of Douglas' performance comes from our
knowledge of the actor's history and not the movie itself. Davis
has crafted a serviceable thriller, but fails to give the film any
distinctive touches that might separate it from similar fare.
That's why ``A Perfect Murder'' makes for passable entertainment,
but not the kind of movie anyone would look to remake 40 years from
now.

ARCHDIOCESE ACKNOWLEDGES IT PAID MILLIONS TO SETTLE CLAIMS AGAINST
PRIEST ACCUSED OF MOLESTING CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA   AND WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite past promises of openness, the Archdiocese of Boston
reluctantly acknowledged Wednesday that it paid millions of dollars
to settle claims against the Rev. John J. Geoghan, a retired priest
accused of sexually molesting more than 50 children over three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But in a tersely worded one-page statement, archdiocesan
officials still declined to admit responsibility for Geoghan's
behavior and did not apologize directly to his alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Archdiocese of Boston is terribly saddened by episodes of
clergy sexual misconduct,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the archdiocese has quietly settled 12 lawsuits
pending against it and Geoghan, paying a total of between $2.5
million and $10 million, according to several of the priest's
victims.
</P>
<P>
   But some victims said they were bitter that they won't get to
confront Geoghan, 63, in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This still smells to me like the archdiocese is trying to make
this go away as quickly as possible,'' said one victim, who alleges
Geoghan fondled him at a church north of Boston in the mid-1960s.
The victim asked not to be identified; he worried that his comments
could violate the terms of his settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Boston church officials insist that their refusal to discuss the
settlement is in the best interest of the alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to respect the rights of the people who have
been victimized,'' said John Walsh, a spokesman for the
archdiocese. ``We're just not going to go into any details.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh also would not say how many priests have been accused of
sexual misconduct or give the total amount paid to alleged victims
since Cardinal Bernard Law instituted a new policy on the issue
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Geoghan's victims said they decided to settle with
the archdiocese because they believed state law would make it
difficult to win large financial judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's charitable immunity law, verdicts against
religious and other charitable organizations in tort cases are
capped at $20,000 per plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the archdiocese's continued secrecy indicates the
Roman Catholic Church's inability to fully grasp the seriousness of
clergy sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever good intentions the archdiocese has in dealing with
this terrible problem are seriously undermined when they are not as
forthcoming as they could be,'' said the Rev. John Rother, a New
York priest who has studied the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 15 years, about 1,000 pedophile priests have been
identified nationally and the church has paid nearly $800 million
in settlements to alleged victims, according to experts who track
the problem. There are about 50,000 priests in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American bishops still view this as a public
relations problem that will pass &UR;  &LR; in time,'' said Jason Berry, a
Catholic in New Orleans who wrote ``Lead Us Not Into Temptation,''
a 1992 book on sexual abuse by the clergy. ``There is this
mentality of institutional defenses that seems to view the
messengers of bad news as culprits rather than trying to understand
why the news is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoghan still faces criminal investigations by Suffolk and
Middlesex County prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Archdiocese of Boston may have to defend itself
in Middlesex Superior Court in September. A plaintiff, Drew Fales,
46, a Maine carpenter, charges he was molested by the Rev. Robert
Barrett in 1967 and 1968 while Barrett was assigned to St. George's
Church in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who lives in Waltham, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Geoghan case, Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney who
represents several of the victims who received settlements, said he
still has 12 other court cases pending against the retired priest
and the Boston Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, church officials revealed that the settlements
to Geoghan's victims were paid from funds borrowed from the
archdiocese's internal insurance funds. Some of those loans have
already been reimbursed to the archdiocese by its commercial
insurance carrier, Walsh said, adding that the internal insurance
fund is separate from the operating fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ken McLean, who says he was sexually abused by Geoghan when the
priest was serving Blessed Sacrament Church in Saugus, says he is
bitter that no one from the archdiocese has ever offered an
apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't even acknowledge that this happened to us,'' said
McLean, who now lives in suburban Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cardinal Law issued a blanket apology to all victims
of clergy sexual abuse in the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all my heart, I beg forgiveness of all who have been hurt
by such acts of abuse,'' Law wrote last November in the Pilot, the
archdiocese's weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After dramatic revelations against James R. Porter, a former
priest in Southeastern Massachusetts who pleaded guilty in 1993 to
molesting 28 children during the 1960s and 1970s, Law implemented
detailed and aggressive guidelines on clergy sexual abuse. They
call for priests who have been accused of sexual abuse to quickly
be temporarily removed from their posts.
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney Roderick MacLeish Jr., who has represented many
victims of abuse by clergymen and been critical of the archdiocese
in the past, praised recent efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give them credit,'' MacLeish said. ``They are doing
a much better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they haven't publicly discussed the Geoghan case, church
officials insist they are not trying to downplay the problem or
evade responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not congratulating ourselves for this,'' Walsh said,
referring to the archdiocese's handling of clergy sexual abuse.
``We are not blase about this, and so when I say I think we have
done a lot, it doesn't take away from the fact that nothing will
suffice for those who have been truly victimized.''

MEDAL OF HONOR WINNERS A DISAPPEARING BREED

   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Charles A. MacGillivary wasn't thinking
of heroism when he singlehandedly wiped out three machine-gun
positions before he was struck by enemy fire that tore off his arm
above the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was splattered all to hell,'' said MacGillivary, now 81, as
he recounted the firefight, part of the World War II Battle of the
Bulge.
</P>
<P>
   He stuffed the stump of his arm in the snow to stem the bleeding
and waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I wasn't fighting for medals,'' he recalled. ``I
was fighting for my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the platoon sergeant, who was 27 at the time, was later
awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for bravery.
</P>
<P>
   MacGillivary is one of nearly 100 Medal of Honor recipients
arriving in upstate New York city of Saratoga Springs this week for
the Medal of Honor Society annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   They are a vanishing breed of old-fashioned war heroes. There
are now fewer living recipients _ 163 _ of the prestigious award
than at any time since the society was formed in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers will probably continue to dwindle because, other
than peacekeeping missions and limited conflicts since the end of
the Vietnam War, there have been no drawn-out wars involving
American service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recipients are veterans of World War II, Korea and
Vietnam. Two soldiers were awarded the medal posthumously for
action in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Smart bombs and other ``over-the-horizon'' weaponry, which can
be launched from ships that are hundreds of miles off shore, are
more prevalent in combat today than the massive ground forces that
battled for weeks straight in World War II, said Professor Daniel
Gibran of Tennessee State University, a leading expert on the Medal
of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some situations that will more readily lend
themselves to a display of courage,'' Gibran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what can win a guy a Medal of Honor, if he's
3,000 miles away and pushing a button,'' MacGillivary said.
</P>
<P>
   But some military strategists point out that smart bombs will
never completely replace the need for muddy-booted grunts. The Gulf
War, which involved thousands of ground troops after Iraqi forces
were pounded from above, supports that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have `over-the-horizon' technology, but we've had those
for decades,'' said Lt. Col. Thomas Begines, a Department of
Defense spokesman. ``There will always be a need for muddy boots on
the ground. If you look at our missions around the world,
operations other than war ... there is a requirement for a physical
presence in most cases.''

   BURNE-JONES-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Hence, my suggestion for
visitors to ``Edward Burne-Jones: Victorian Artist-Dreamer,'' the
lavish survey at the Metropolitan Museum of Art: No matter what you
think you think about his art, surrender to the dream. You won't
regret it. The show, which includes more than 170 works in almost a
dozen media, is the most comprehensive survey of the artist's work

   PA-SCHUYLKILL-OHARA (Pottsville, Pa.) _ For a fleeting moment,
you are Julian English and the road is yours, roaring in a sleek
Caddie through scenic highways of fact and fiction, past coal patch
taverns and slatty wood houses, gin cocktail parties and country
clubs vibrating to the tunes of Tommy Lake's Royal Collegians. The
terrain is Schuylkill County, the shovel-shaped anthracite coal
region of eastern Pennsylvania, which is barely disguised in the

HITCH-MOVIES (Los Angeles) _ Perfection. It's not a word often
bandied about in Hollywood, so you can understand why filmmakers
have been reluctant to tread upon Hitchcock's hallowed legacy. But
since commerce _ not perfection _ remains the primary principle at
work with studios, we're starting to see a stream of remakes _
``Psycho,'' ``Rear Window,'' ``To Catch a Thief'' and
``Spellbound'' among them _ that approach Hitchcock's work from
every conceivable angle. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
WOMEN-FILM (Los Angeles) _ Maybe someday down the line, the Los
Angeles International Women's Film Festival will pick and match
films connected by a singular theme. This first time out, however,
the philosophy was simple and direct: Let's get something going. By
Bob McCarthy. 
. 
TRUMAN-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ A triumphant change of pace for Jim
Carrey and the finest realization of director Peter Weir's
inquisitive approach to filmmaking, ``The Truman Show'' is a marvel
of artful, intelligent entertainment. More, it's as complete a
movie as it can possibly be. 4 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
PERFECT-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``A Perfect Murder'' is an imperfect
thriller, an eager-to-please movie that delivers a few tingles but
not nearly enough tension for its audience to willingly surrender
and suspend disbelief. 2{ Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
JEALOUSY-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Indie writer-director Noah
Baumbach's followup to his successful debut feature ``Kicking and
Screaming'' is a keen character film about a guy whose fixation
with his girlfriends' pasts stamps him ``Mr. Jealousy.'' 3 Stars.
By Bob Strauss. 
. 
SKIN-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ In ``Under the Skin,'' a young English
woman deals with the grief and resentment generated by her mother's
death by going on a self-destructive sex-and-drinking jag. The
thing that saves ``Skin'' from the same-old prurient/preachy
same-old is its fierce central performance by newcomer Samantha
Morton. 3 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
PENN-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Dan Penn has a few songs under his belt.
Nothing serious _ just some co-writes such as ``Dark End of the
Street,'' ``Cry Like a Baby'' and ``I'm Your Puppet.'' Yet he,
along with others in the tiny town of Muscle Shoals, Ala., invented
that enduring and beloved genre known as Southern soul. By Fred
Shuster. 
. 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ It was a ``warm, intense feeling'' the
first time guitarist Ian Cone of high-energy Home Grown heard
himself on the radio. Nowadays, Cone gets that buzz often since the
band's ska-powered summer hit, ``Surfer Girl,'' was added at
influential KROQ-FM. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ A list of thumbnail reviews of recent
CD releases. By Fred Shuster and Glenn Whipp. 
. 
GETTY-ART (Los Angeles) _ Although it fills only one small gallery,
a tiny, ornate 14-century prayer book at the J. Paul Getty Museum
is considered a ``blockbuster,'' no less a turning point in Western
art history than, say, a Cezanne landscape or a Picasso nude. By
Reed Johnson. 
. 
OSCAR-VIDEO (LoS Angeles) _ As a relatively small film coming out
during the holiday glut of movies, ``Oscar and Lucinda'' failed to
find much of an audience. But this screen adaptation of Peter
Carey's 1988 Booker Prize-winning novel is as brilliant as the
glass and water images that flow through it. By Rob Lowman.

HITCHING THEIR STAR TO THE MASTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP   
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Talk to any of the principals involved in remaking
one of seven current updates of Alfred Hitchcock films and there's
one name they'll never mention of their own volition.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they'll circle it, give it a sniff and then nervously edge
away, not wanting to draw any comparisons between their movie and
the Master. When pressed, they'll say things like: ``It's not a
remake in any way.'' Or: ``The media will make comparisons, but
this movie can stand on its own.'' Or: ``God's honest truth, we
never even looked at the original while making this.''
</P>
<P>
   But the denials only underscore the fear. At least Arnold
Kopelson, producer of ``A Perfect Murder,'' will come out and say
what everyone else is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a reluctance to go near Hitchcock,'' says
Kopelson, whose movie is loosely based on the 1954 Hitchcock
thriller ``Dial M for Murder.'' ``That's one obvious reason you
haven't seen `North by Northwest' or `Vertigo' remakes in the
works. You don't need the grief you'd get from the comparisons. And
there would be comparisons because you're dealing with perfection
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfection. It's not a word often bandied about in Hollywood, so
you can understand why filmmakers have been reluctant to tread upon
Hitchcock's hallowed legacy. But since commerce _ not perfection _
remains the primary principle at work with studios, we're starting
to see a stream of remakes _ ``Psycho,'' ``Rear Window,'' ``To
Catch a Thief'' and ``Spellbound'' among them _ that approach
Hitchcock's work from every conceivable angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Perfect Murder'' updates ``Dial M for Murder,'' a movie
Hitchcock adapted from Frederic Knott's play and directed primarily
to fulfill his contractual obligations to Warner Bros. Hitchcock
was shackled by Jack Warner's insistence on filming the movie in
3-D, and the 400-pound, immobile camera severely limited what he
could do with the movie. So, there's certainly no heresy in staging
a remake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't one of Hitchcock's best, but the basic story is very
good, and we felt like we could do something with it in the
1990s,'' says Kopelson, who also is working on a remake of the
director's lesser-known classic ``Strangers on a Train'' (which
itself already has been more or less remade twice, including the
black comedy ``Throw Momma From the Train'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to find an angle, a twist, so you can put your
own stamp on the movie,'' Kopelson continues. ``Otherwise, I
wouldn't go near one of Hitchcock's films.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't stopping Universal Pictures and director Gus Van Sant
from tackling a remake of Hitchcock's most famous film _ and, not
coincidentally, the most influential horror movie ever made _
``Psycho.'' The movie will begin filming next month, with Anne
Heche stepping into Janet Leigh's shower slippers, and Vince Vaughn
playing mother-loving, motel owner Norman Bates.
</P>
<P>
   But what's surprising _ and dismaying _ to a lot of people is
Van Sant's plan to use Hitchcock's original shooting script, which
will create a virtual scene-by-scene, colorized (can we say that in
a family newspaper?) update of the 1960 classic.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction, needless to say, has been mixed. Indeed, after
trumpeting the movie with a splashy announcement, Universal and
Imagine Films have instituted what someone at the studio called a
``publicity embargo,'' barring anyone from commenting on the new
``Psycho.'' (The fear!)
</P>
<P>
   Universal plans to have the film in theaters by December to cash
in on the new horror holiday tradition started by the ``Scream''
franchise two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh, whose book ``Psycho: Behind the Scenes of the Classic
Thriller'' was a best seller three years ago, believes the new
``Psycho'' probably will adhere more to ``Scream'' than Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that `Psycho' had was the shock factor,'' Leigh
says. ``Nobody killed the leading lady in the first third of the
movie. That was a complete surprise. So, obviously this new movie
won't catch anyone off guard. And the subsequent `Psychos' showed
everything, things Hitchcock could just hint at with his
imagination. Most movies do that these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopelson agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be afraid to do it,'' he says. ``Too many comparisons
would be made.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Auiler, author of ``Vertigo: The Making of a Hitchcock
Classic'' and currently at work on a book studying Hitchcock's
creative process, believes that what Van Sant has planned is
infinitely more interesting than a mere remake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with different levels of interpretation,''
Auiler says. ``He's staying true to Hitchcock but putting his own
spin on the movie. It's a whole new area for film. I think
Hitchcock would get a kick out of seeing a new `Psycho.' I know
he'd like it a lot better than seeing `Psycho 2,' `3' and `4'.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. But what would he think about a remake of ``To Catch a
Thief'' that changes the premise of the movie into a romance about
two thieves falling in love? Paramount Pictures has such a film in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, writer-director Robert Towne is reworking one of
Hitchcock's earliest _ and best _ movies, ``The 39 Steps,'' which,
according to producer Bruce Berman, will bear about as much
resemblance to the 1935 film as ``the film version of `The
Fugitive' bore to the TV series. (Funny. Kopelson, who produced
``The Fugitive'' used the same analogy when comparing ``A Perfect
Murder'' to ``Dial M for Murder.'')
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Reeve isn't using any analogies because his remake
of ``Rear Window,'' in which he also will star as the man in the
wheelchair who thinks he sees a murder, will be based on the
Cornell Woolrich short story and not Hitchcock's 1954 film. The TV
movie will air on ABC during the November sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be a vent-dependent quadriplegic,'' Reeve says,
``living in an apartment with the latest assistive techniques.''
His character ``is a former architect, with an outsize ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accident is a lesson in humility,'' Reeve adds. ``He
starts out as a master of the universe, and he goes through a
profound transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds ... well, we hate to say it, but it sounds like the kind
of character transformation that Hitchcock did so well in many of
his films.
</P>
<P>
   But enough with the comparisons. Even Hitchcock remade himself,
convinced that he could improve his excellent 1934 film, ``The Man
Who Knew Too Much,'' by adding 45 minutes and filming it in color
in 1956. Critics at the time didn't think much of the movie, but
audiences loved it and made it a box-office hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both movies work because Hitchcock brought different
sensibilities to them,'' Auiler says. ``And I think that's the
challenge that is attracting some people to Hitchcock's work today.
They wonder what spin they could bring to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same reason people keep producing Shakespeare's
plays. They're built to work. You don't have to worry about holding
the audience's attention. You just have to worry about doing
justice to the work.''

`PRAYER BOOK'S' LATEST CHAPTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It measures only 3{ by 2{ inches, a work of art
so painstakingly crafted and minutely scaled that you suspect it
was made by an elf.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this tiny, illustrated prayer book was created in
14th-century France by Parisian master illuminator Jean Pucelle. An
artwork literally fit for royalty, it belonged to Jeanne d'Evreux,
reigning queen of France from 1324 to 1328, who probably used it on
special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Rendered in still-vivid reds, blues, lilacs, turquoises and
pinks, ``The Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux'' is both a lavish
glorification of the word of God, and a virtuoso artistic display.
</P>
<P>
   And although it fills only one small gallery of the rambling J.
Paul Getty Museum, Thomas Kren considers the book to be a
``blockbuster,'' no less a turning point in Western art history
than, say, a Cezanne landscape or a Picasso nude.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it's like a private portable art gallery,'' says
the Getty's curator of manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``Hours'' is a work several decades ahead of its
time. Pucelle's illustrations have a sculptural, three-dimensional
quality more characteristic of Renaissance art than of the flat,
decorative, more abstract style of Gothic-era painting.
</P>
<P>
   Those qualities made Kren pounce when ``Hours'' became available
from the Cloisters, the branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York City devoted to medieval art. For the first time in its
history, the manuscript is being removed from its binder so that a
Swiss publisher can make a high-quality facsimile. In the meantime,
a selective sampling of its 209 folio pages will be shown at the
Getty through July 5 and next summer at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Gothic rulers, Jeanne d'Evreux was a pious woman who
reportedly prayed eight times a day, seven days a week. The prayer
book helped her stick to her schedule of devotions by specifying
certain prayers for certain times of day, as well as meditations on
the story of Christ and its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Two elaborate cycles of prayer services are devoted to the
Virgin Mary and to St. Louis (King Louis IX), Jeanne d'Evreux's
great-grandfather, who died in 1247 and was canonized in 1270. The
book depicts several scenes from the saint's life, including his
crusades to the Holy Land and his ministering to the needy. In one
striking image, he kneels at the bedside of a gaunt, sickly man to
feed him with his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Other prayers mark seasonal feast days, with everyday images
drawn from peasant life. Beggars and musicians cavort with bishops
in scenes of medieval Paris, while gables, arches and other
architectural motifs embellish devout reflections on the Christmas
and Easter stories.
</P>
<P>
   But the manuscript is as famous for its exuberant whimsy as for
its somber piety. Studying Pucelle's intricate pages is like
perusing an elaborate computer Web site. Text, icons and
illustrations knot together in dense thickets of symbolic meaning.
The mischievous marginal drawings of half-beast, half-human
grotesqueries provide a comic counterpoint to the earnest saints
and dour true believers. You'll need one of the Getty's magnifying
glasses, thoughtfully provided, to catch every unexpected sight gag
and between-the-lines splash of irreverence. While Kren says ``a
great deal of scholarly ink has been spilled over what the
marginalia means,'' it's believed these drawings may have
illustrated medieval parables or folk sayings.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to say what such a book might cost today, but in
Pucelle's time apparently no expense was spared. The rich colors
and laborious artistry, not to mention the parchment itself, were
precious commodities in the 14th-century world.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kren says, to the Gothic mindset, money spent in the
service of God was money well spent. The depth of belief that's
evident in ``The Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux'' is, like the book
itself, no small thing.

PROLIFIC PENN PAL FOR SOUTHERN SOUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Dan Penn has a few songs under his belt.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing serious _ just some co-writes such as ``Dark End of the
Street,'' ``You Left the Water Running,'' ``Out of Left Field,''
``It Tears Me Up,'' ``Do Right Woman,'' ``Cry Like a Baby'' and
``I'm Your Puppet'' _ enough to retire on.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, along with others in that most unlikely of tiny towns
called Muscle Shoals in rural Alabama, is partly responsible for
inventing that enduring and beloved genre known as Southern soul.
</P>
<P>
   A singer, songwriter and producer, Penn had led several r&AMP;b
groups around town in the early '60s when pal Chips Moman invited
him to visit American Sound Studio. Penn ended up producing the Box
Tops' blue-eyed soul smash, ``The Letter,'' and later helped out on
historic recording sessions by Joe Tex, Aretha Franklin, Duane
Allman and Wilson Pickett.
</P>
<P>
   Booker T. &AMP; the MG's guitarist Steve Cropper dubs Penn ``a rock
'n' roll genius. Dan bridged the gap between pure r&AMP;b and what
you'd call rock because his music has a lot of soul to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Peter Guralnick wrote that Penn was ``the secret hero''
of his thoroughly entertaining history of Southern r&AMP;b, ``Sweet
Soul Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn's boyhood friend and songwriting partner, Spooner Oldham,
played keyboards at many of the same classic soul sessions. In what
can only be considered an event, Oldham and Penn will open for Nick
Lowe at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Spooner are still kind of like we was in the '60s,''
Penn said in his gentle Southern drawl this week from his Nashville
home. ``If you close your eyes, you might see younger guys singing
these songs, and you might even hear the clinkers. But at least
it's a stripped-down version. We've been playing these isolated
shows, just the two of us, and sometimes it goes over great if
you're in the right setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn and Oldham will perform the classic soul tunes they've
co-written as well as material they collaborated on for Penn's 1994
solo album, ``Do Right Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn is in the process of recording another solo album.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the songs we wrote and the songs we wrote with other
people,'' Penn said. ``We have two sets we can do because of all
the songs we wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn said he hasn't known Lowe long. The erudite British singer
and songwriter called him when he was in Nashville a few years ago
and asked Penn and Oldham to open a show for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to turn him down, but this time he wanted me and Spooner
out in L.A., so I accepted,'' Penn said. ``He has a pretty good
band, and he's a great singer. He's smooth, man. I like his '40s
influence on the new record.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn said Lowe's low-key new album, ``Dig My Mood,'' reminded
him of a collection of songs from the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still funky, but the way he wrote the songs was kind of
strange and wonderful,'' Penn said. ``One of the reasons I took
this gig was I liked his record.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn believes there's still so much love for the soul recordings
he helped create in the '60s because there weren't many of them
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, if you look down the list of all the music we cut,
there's only a handful with that sound because it stopped around
1969,'' he explained. ``But there are a lot of reasons it holds up
today. It's that r&AMP;b with a country influence.''
</P>
<P>
   It was after the British Invasion that Penn and Moman turned out
``Dark End of the Street,'' one of Southern soul's golden moments
best covered by James Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a break from a poker game while in Nashville, the two
hammered out the tune on a piano in about an hour and returned to
play another hand.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the best ``cheatin' song'' ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Penn recalled that he was knocked out the first time he heard
Elvis Presley's Sun records, but lost interest when Presley turned
his back on his roots.
</P>
<P>
   While he loved Ray Charles, Bobby ``Blue'' Bland and Aretha,
Chuck Berry didn't register on Penn's funk meter.
</P>
<P>
   And he never liked the Beatles in the beginning, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just held my nose when they came along,'' Penn recalled. ``I
said, `Give me some black records. What is this?' But I've realized
later that the Beatles were great. But my thing was black music.
These days, I try to take it all in. I enjoy lots of different
kinds of music.'' &UR;

FRANK SINATRA/``In the Wee Small Hours,'' ``Frank Sinatra Sings for
Only the Lonely,'' ``Come Dance With Me!'' ``Sinatra's Swinging
Session!!!''
<TEXT>
<P>
   As part of a long-planned ``Entertainer of the Century''
promotion, Capitol and Reprise joined forces to release 18 of Frank
Sinatra's best albums, digitally remastered and including all the
original packaging. The four Capitol albums here include two of the
late singer's absolute finest ballads collections _ ``In the Wee
Small Hours'' and ``Only the Lonely'' _ along with two revved-up,
high-energy, swinging sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wee Small Hours'' finds Frank wistful and sometimes bitter,
ruminating on lost love as his marriage to Ava Gardner was fizzling
out. The pain shows _ brilliantly _ on numbers like ``When Your
Love Has Gone,'' ``Ill Wind'' and the title track.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Sinatra managed to top himself three years later with
another ballads concept album, ``Only the Lonely,'' that Frank
Sinatra Jr. once famously said was so sad that it ``should be sold
by prescription only.'' Sinatra's singing had matured to an even
deeper level and the songs just drip with despair. Both albums
feature Nelson Riddle's beautifully despondent arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the emotional spectrum, ``Come Dance With
Me!'' sports Billy May's sprightly arrangements on 16 tunes that
make you want to kick up your feet. The band roars, the
arrangements are brassy and Sinatra moves them along with a swing
that never stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinatra's Swinging Session!!!'' is one of his last efforts for
Capitol, cut after he launched his own label, Reprise. Legend has
it Sinatra was miffed at the situation and deliberately set out to
sabotage this album by speeding up the tempos past their breaking
point. The result is one of Sinatra's most energetic, jazzy sets;
even the ballads crackle with energy.
</P>
<P>
   A note on the remastering: For those who own these Sinatra CDs
and are wondering about the sound quality on these reissues,
there's good news and bad news. The good news: They sound great.
There's a noticeable improvement. The bad news: Now you'll feel
compelled to buy them again. 3 Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Next week: The Reprise reissues. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SMASHING PUMPKINS/``Adore''
</P>
<P>
   Smashing Pumpkins is the Journey it's OK to like. Group leader
Billy Corgan has made no secret of his passion for what was known
in the '80s as the power ballad, but on this fourth studio album
brings down the volume on his dark retro-urges with good results.
Corgan is still the post-grunge Adam Sandler, so in touch with his
inner child he almost deserves a cameo on ``Teletubbies.'' But this
time he leaves out the trademark whining and whimpering that made
the Pumpkins resemble smashing puppies. ``Adore'' has much to
recommend, such as the spare and beautiful ``Tear'' and the
electro-tinged rockers ``Pug,'' ``Annie-Dog'' and ``Ava Adore.''
But then there's ``For Martha,'' an eight-minute ode to Corgan's
recently deceased mom that pulls all the strings but may not get
many return visitors. The album's most glaring negative _ the
drumming. Without a regular percussionist, Corgan utilized either a
series of studio helpers or the dreaded one-note drum machine. In
the end, though, where the sprawling and terribly titled 1995
double-CD ``Mellon Collie'' would've made a fine single disc,
``Adore'' mostly gets it right. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GLORIA ESTEFAN/``gloria!''
</P>
<P>
   Opting for an upbeat state-of-the-nightclub collection that
sheds the introspective and largely acoustic tone of 1996's
``Destiny,'' Estefan's latest boasts material ranging from lush to
gritty while keeping the spirit in tune with the party vibe of the
vintage Miami Sound Machine records that clearly inspired the
making of ``gloria!'' Best of all is the salsa flavor that seasons
such high-energy standouts as ``Real Woman,'' ``Lucky Girl,'' ``I
Just Wanna be Happy'' and the infectious hit single, ``Heaven's
What I Feel.'' More evidence of disco's return. 2{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RICHARD X. HEYMAN/``Cornerstone''
</P>
<P>
   This alluring pure pop effort from New York tunesmith Heyman
wears its influences proudly _ Beatles, Byrds, Beach Boys and
Kinks. Yet, there's nothing fossilized about such strong
radio-ready material as ``Everything the Same,'' ``The Drone
Song,'' ``Racing After You,'' ``If We Should Ever Meet Again'' and
the gloriously ornate Brit-pop title track. Heyman, who plays most
of the instruments here, avoids the overly meticulous atmosphere of
other self-produced solo records. Thanks to Sherman Oaks indie
Permanent Press for this blast of pop-tastic fresh air. 3 Stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RALPH STANLEY &AMP; FRIENDS/``Clinch Mountain Country''
</P>
<P>
   Country crooner Hal Ketchum put it best: ``Singing with Ralph
Stanley is like painting with Picasso.'' Now that Bill Monroe has
passed on to that great front porch in the sky, claw-hammer
banjoist and singer Stanley is bluegrass' last giant. This
fantastic two-CD set features duets with 30 of old Ralph's pals,
including Bob Dylan, George Jones, Junior Brown and Patty Loveless.
Stanley, 72, is a unique and powerful singer and backed by the
always-elegant Clinch Mountain Boys. ``Clinch Mountain Country''
makes a terrific introduction to an often underrated genre as well
as a true original. 3{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VARIOUS/``The X-Files: The Album''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter, creator of ``The X-Files,'' and David Was of
soon-to-reunite Was (Not Was) have put together an uneven
compilation that should appeal to alt-rock completists or fanatic
followers of the hit TV show, which hits the wide screen June 19.
Radio is already playing Foo Fighters' reflective ``Walking After
You'' and Filter's high-energy cover of Three Dog Night's ``One,''
but those aren't the only memorable moments. We liked X's exciting
take on the Doors' ``Crystal Ship'' with Ray Manzarek on keyboards,
Soul Coughing's inventive ``16 Horses'' and Ween's ``Beacon
Light.'' There's also a new Cure track called ``More Than This''
and a sly remake of the ``X-Files'' theme by the Dust Brothers. 2{
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VARIOUS/``Soulful Divas: Bold Soul Sisters''
</P>
<P>
   This volume of the Soulful Divas series focuses on such r&AMP;b
scorchers as Ann Peebles, Aretha Franklin, Millie Jackson and
Denise Lasalle. If all you know of female soul is Randy Crawford or
Anita Baker, these 14 tracks will be a revelation. This is the
sweetly gritty sound that melds gospel and soul, the moment
Saturday night becomes Sunday morning. Songs like Laura Lee's
``Women's Love Rights,'' Jackson's wonderful ``If You're Not Back
in Love by Monday'' and Peebles' golden ``I'm Gonna Tear Your
Playhouse Down'' have one thing in common _ they're all about
testifying in love's court of law. A fine compilation. 2 Stars.

`OSCAR AND LUCINDA' A MOVIE GEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The wonderful thing about the advent of the video
age is that overlooked film gems don't necessarily have to be
relegated to years of neglect before some critic-champion rescues
them. There are numerous classic films that failed in their first
theatrical release, only to be considered years later as essential
viewing for any serious film buff. Orson Welles' ``Citizen Kane''
is a notable example.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Armstrong's ``Oscar and Lucinda'' is no ``Kane,'' but it
is one of the best films of 1997, landing on a number of critics'
top-10 lists. As a relatively small film coming out during the
holiday glut of movies, it failed to find much of an audience. But
for those who saw it, ``Oscar and Lucinda,'' which was adapted from
Peter Carey's 1988 Booker Prize-winning novel, is as brilliant as
the glass and water images that flow through it. This story of the
conflict between earthly pleasures and the contemplation of the
heavens is a delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole faith is a wager, Miss Leplastrier,'' Oscar, played
with risky panache by Ralph Fienes, tells Lucinda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bet _ it is all in Pascal and very wise it is, too _ that
there is a God. We bet our life on it. We calculate the odds, the
return, that we shall sit with the saints in paradise. Our anxiety
about our bet will wake us before dawn in a cold sweat. We are out
of bed and on our knees ... and God sees us, and sees us suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar is telling this to Lucinda (the vibrant newcomer Cate
Blanchett) over a game of cards in her shipboard room as they sail
to Australia in the mid-1800s. It is a monologue that is as much
about God as it is about gambling, for they are both addicted to
wagering _ one an obsessive gambler, the other a compulsive one.
Oscar refuses to believe that a God who asks us to bet on his
existence finds other forms of betting a sin.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins with Oscar as a young boy who has just lost his
mother. His minister father's hard ways and strict Pentecostal
faith drive Oscar to gamble that God will show him the right path.
He does this by throwing a stone over his shoulder onto a rock
where he has written in chalk the names of various religions. When
the rock lands on the Church of England repeatedly, Oscar runs away
from home and is raised by a rival minister, eventually becoming an
Anglican priest. As a young man studying at Oxford, Oscar discovers
his love of gambling, betting on almost anything. He is incredibly
successful, but although he gives most of his money to the poor,
each winning pot drives him into a deeper moral dilemma until he
resolves to go to Australia as a missionary to escape the
temptation.
</P>
<P>
   It is aboard ship that he meets Lucinda, an Australian heiress
who is desperate to be liberated from the confines of the
male-dominated culture of that time. Lucinda is returning to Sydney
after buying equipment for a glassworks she has bought with her
inheritance. Oscar and Lucinda separate upon reaching Australia,
but are soon reunited by fate. Though recognizing each other as
soulmates _ the two play cards with more passion than most people
feel when they make love _ the pair are unable to get past the
confines of their Victorian emotional prisons to express their love
for each other. Oscar, in a wild gamble, attempts to break out by
wagering that he can transport a church made of glass (one of
Lucinda's improbable dreams) to the Australian outback safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gamblers in the noble sense,'' Oscar tells her. ``We
believe all eternity awaits us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda agrees, but insists on betting her entire inheritance
against Oscar's future legacy. His mission is to transport the
glass church that she has built to a remote location in Northern
Australia by Good Friday, where he is to turn it over to the Rev.
Dennis Hasset (Ciaran Hinds). Hasset has been exiled to the Outback
for his association with the scandalous Lucinda.
</P>
<P>
   Though Oscar's trip through the outback yields numerous notable
scenes, the image of the glass church floating majestically down
the river past lush green banks is one of the most compelling
images in recent film memory. The church is a symbol, of course,
operating on one level as a physical monument to the
spiritual/worldly duality of our natures. But academic
considerations aside, it is an image that stays with you long after
the costliest Hollywood special effect has faded from your mind.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the joy of Armstrong's movie. Odd and quirky,
sumptuously photographed, with a wonderful score by Thomas Newman
(``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``Unstrung Heroes''), ``Oscar and
Lucinda'' is filmmaking at its finest.

   CHIMING IN ON `MIDNIGHT': Clint Eastwood's adaptation of
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' _ John Berendt's
best-selling book _ met with mixed reviews for good reasons. The
story is centered around a famous murder trial in Savannah, Ga.
Eastwood's attempt to capture the moral ambiguity of the scene
never coalesces. ``It's like `Gone With the Wind' on mescaline!''
says John Cusack, who plays the reporter-narrator, but too much of
the movie is disjointed. Video is probably the best way to watch
it, however. You can zip through the scenes that don't click and
take a break or two during the two-hour, 35-minute movie. It does
have some terrific acting, especially Kevin Spacey as Jim Williams,
the rich antiques dealer and semi-closeted homosexual. And there
are also some funny set pieces involving the town's eccentric
characters, particularly The Lady Chablis, a drag queen comedienne,
played by the Lady Chablis, of course.

WOMEN'S FILM FEST RE-EMERGING, '90S STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe someday down the line, the Los Angeles
International Women's Film Festival will pick and match films by a
singular theme. This first time out, however, the guiding principle
was simple and direct.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get something going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's film festivals petered out in the '70s and '80s. Yet,
today we have women emerging in some unexpected places, such as the
Moslem world and Asia,'' reveals Cornelia Emerson, publicist for
this first-ever women's cinema event hosted by UCLA Film and
Television Archive. ``So UCLA proposed it to the NEA, which issued
a grant to carry the festival through the first year.''
</P>
<P>
   While American cinema is seeing more and more female directors
reach the big time, elsewhere in the world women are only now
getting a chance to express their visions and voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``To international women, a festival such as ours is important.
The art-house circuit in the U.S. isn't as strong as it was 20
years ago. Not that many venues show foreign films at all,''
Emerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few major cities _ New York, Boston and Seattle _ even
host women's festivals anymore, though film festivals in general
are stronger than ever. So, apparently, are women's desires to tell
their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Nadia Fares, whose submission titled ``Honey and Ashes'' will
conclude the festival Sunday night, is one. This 35mm film in
Arabic and French (with English subtitles) explores the oppression
of Arab women and their life-affirming spirit, even in spite of
their patriarchal culture's acceptance of violence and mistreatment
of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey and Ashes'' is the story of three Tunisian women. One
must conceal from her father her love for a man. Another endures
physical abuse from her professor/husband. Yet another is a
successful doctor in a loveless, arranged marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Two films per night will be shown through Sunday at UCLA. They
are:
</P>
<P>
   At 7 tonight, an Australian film, ``The Well,'' from director
Samantha Lang makes its L.A. premiere. Two women's euphoria over
their freedom is shattered when one of them hits someone or
something on a deserted road and then must get rid of the body.
``The Well' draws beauty and methaphor from the eerie isolation of
the Australian Outback,'' the festival film guide says.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:30 p.m., ``Eighteen Springs,'' by Hong Kong director Ann
Hui, recasts the theme of suppressing personal desire for family
obligation. In it, two young lovers share a romance fraught with
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. Saturday, ``Gesche's Gift'' from Germany is a
psychological portrait of Gesche Gottfried, a 19th-century serial
killer whose weapon of choice was rat poison. At 9:30, falling
asleep on a bus is a young woman's ticket into a surreal world of
rave, where she spends an unforgettable night in a decadent
warehouse populated by dancers and drugs in ``Clubbed to Death.''
This film is directed by Yolande Zauberman of France.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. Sunday, classical musician Odette Springer's
documentary ``Some Nudity Required'' details her years working with
Roger Corman on his B-movie, erotic thrillers. She explores what
led her to become music director on more than 50 Corman productions
in the 1990s. ``Honey and Ashes'' will screen at 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   All screenings take place in the James Bridges Theater, at
Sunset Boulevard and Hilgard Avenue at the northeast corner of the
UCLA campus. Tickets are $6 general admission, $4 for students and
seniors. Box office opens an hour before show time.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call (310) 206-3456.
</P>
<P>
   MEN IN BLACK: In ``The Pigeon Egg Strategy,'' a group of
dark-suited assassins wearing bowler hats chase a children's author
who they believe has exposed their gang in her latest fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   The absurd comedy _ which actually is a disguised commentary on
language _ plays at 7:30 p.m. Thursday at the Raleigh Studios'
Charlie Chaplin Theater, part of ``The Alternative Screen'' program
sponsored by American Cinematheque. Also, a seven-minute short, ``5
Dreams,'' by Luke Jaeger will be shown.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is at 5300 Melrose Ave., Hollywood. Tickets cost $7
general admission, $4 for American Cinematheque members. For
tickets, call (213) 466-3456, Ext. 3.

FIRST AIRPLAY BRINGS HOME GROWN JOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It was a ``warm, intense feeling'' the first time
guitarist Ian Cone of high-energy Home Grown heard himself on the
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Cone gets that buzz often since the band's ska-powered
summer hit, ``Surfer Girl,'' was added at influential KROQ-FM.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, the Huntington Beach quartet built a sturdy
following on the indie circuit after cross-country treks with
Orange County pals like Save Ferris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I heard us on KROQ, I was pulling into the
driveway and it was amazing,'' Cone said. ``I just went crazy. I
felt satisfied, like we've finally done it. Our song was finally on
the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Grown, whose debut album ``Act Your Age'' (Outpost/Geffen)
was released this week, appears Sunday in a hometown show at the
Old World Hall in Huntington Beach. The band is known for
good-humored, lively gigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to have fun,'' Cone said. ``We're not a violent band.
We're concerned about the crowd having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   The four musicians met in high school, launching the band in
guitar class. They began writing songs four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't very career-oriented,'' Cone admits. ``We were just
doing it for fun, playing parties and stuff. It was something we
always wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone agrees it's been a quick rise to a contract with Geffen and
airplay on KROQ.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with luck and timing,'' the guitarist said. ``And
being in the right place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   ZOMBIE'S QUIET TIME: Rob Zombie, leader of the hard-hitting rock
outfit White Zombie, has been quiet lately _ too quiet.
</P>
<P>
   That changed Tuesday with the release of two albums on his own
label, Zombie A Go-Go Records. The discs are ``A-Haunting We Will
Go-Go'' by the Ghastly Ones and ``Head Shrinkin' Fun'' by the
Bomboras.
</P>
<P>
   Both local acts specialize in a trashy, surf-punk sound.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Zombie's own solo album is due later this summer,
followed by a tour with the Ghastly Ones as the opening act.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD AGAIN: Lucinda Williams' long-awaited new disc,
``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,'' is due June 30. Produced by ex-E
Street Band pianist Roy Bittan, the album features cameos from
Steve Earle, Emmylou Harris and Charlie Sexton, and already is
being hailed as one of the top efforts of the year.

MOM'S CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday June 11)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of my friends _ both mothers of young children _ died of
breast cancer this past week, within days of each other.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote the obituary for one, and fielded phone calls for
details of the other's memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Shar Kinloch, 43, was a nurse; Bryanna Latoof Green, 39, a
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   These women were resourceful. They fought their illnesses for
years with every weapon available to them: surgery, aggressive
chemotherapy, radiation, bone marrow transplants, holistic methods,
good nutrition, staunch optimism and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Their husbands and children surrounded them with strength and
love, as did myriad friends and coworkers.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps their biggest support came from each other. After
meeting during bone marrow treatments, they talked on the phone
almost daily, for hours. I imagine they shared fears not many of us
could relate to, and dark humor not many could muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know too much,'' Shar, the nurse, would tell me with her
mischievous grin. ``I'm in denial about being in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Her ``cancer dance,'' as Shar called the five years spent trying
to defeat errant cells playing havoc with her body, was mostly done
to an upbeat Buffett tune or the rolling lick of a Stones guitar
solo.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a month ago, Shar was still making her ``laps around the
county,'' volunteering at her children's school and dropping in on
her second home _ the Lakeland Regional Medical Center neonatal
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before she died, on Mother's Day weekend, she
insisted on going to one of her favorite annual events _ the
Mayfaire by-the-Lake art festival _ with Duncan and her kids,
Caitlyn, 11, and Adam, 6.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shar was in a wheelchair and on oxygen, she told me she
wanted to walk up to a few of the exhibits so ``I don't look like
too much of a dweeb.''
</P>
<P>
   Shar laughed out loud a lot, especially at life's small ironies,
and would stop in the middle of the road if something caught her
eye. She was brash and irreverent and gentle and quirky. She said,
``Bi... cycle'' at the end of every phone conversation just because
it amused her.
</P>
<P>
   Bryanna Latoof Green and I were new moms together. We had our
sons within months of each other, and commiserated over
breastfeeding, colic and sleep deprivation with all the
obsessiveness of first-timers.
</P>
<P>
   A talented reporter and writer, Bryanna never shied away from
hard topics. She wrote about parents who had AIDS, women who were
stalked by their ex-boyfriends, plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   A Louisiana native, she had all-night Mardi Gras parties at her
house most of the years she lived in Lakeland, steaming shrimp,
stirring jambalaya and stacking up muffaletta sandwiches to feed
hordes of festively dressed friends.
</P>
<P>
   Our sons were perpetual guests at each other's birthday parties
for five years. One of my favorite pictures is of the ``A-Team,''
Adam, Austin and another close friend, Alex, just past toddlerhood,
all wearing fake Groucho mustaches and glasses, with their arms
slung around each other's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   A fiercely protective mother, Bryanna was always on the lookout
for vicious dogs and salmonella poisoning. At one summer party, she
talked the host into whipping up another, special batch of homemade
ice cream for the kids just so she could be sure no one slipped raw
eggs into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Just over three years ago, Bryanna was diagnosed with breast
cancer late into her second pregnancy. She and Mark were relieved
when Joshua was born healthy and robust. One of the hardest parts
of her treatment was the mandatory isolation after a bone marrow
transplant, when she had to be away from her boys for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, she returned with Mark, Austin, 7, and Joshua, 3, to
New Orleans after achieving what we had all hoped was a lasting
remission. She wanted to live closer to her parents and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   I received the call that Bryanna had died while I was walking
out the door to see a Saturday matinee of ``Godzilla'' with my
husband and son. The disparity made me flush with guilt.
</P>
<P>
   After the Lakeland memorial service, Austin, Alex and Adam spent
the night together, running through Alex's house, eating pepperoni
pizza and watching old ``Tarzan'' movies. The A-Team, together
again. By midnight, they were asleep in a sprawling tangle of socks
and toys and blankets.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at Austin, one arm curled around his raggedy blue
stuffed bear he's had since birth, and here is what I thought: He
will be OK. Maybe not right away. Maybe not all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But these are brave kids _ Caitlyn Kinloch and Adam Kinloch and
Austin Green and Joshua Green. Kids full of courage and fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   They inherited it from their mothers.
</P>

POLITICAL SWAN SONG OF RICH OUTSIDERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lt. Gov. Gray Davis and state Treasurer Matt
Fong may be the ones celebrating campaign victories this week, but
the real history-makers in California's primary election are the
gold-plated losers.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have so many millionaire office-seekers pumped so
much of their own money into a primary election, only to suffer
dramatic defeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest bomb in the history of American
politics,'' said Garry South, campaign manager for Davis, who won
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Tuesday's primary.
``Based on the amount of money spent here, this is the biggest
disaster ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the more money they spent, the worse they did,''
said Tony Miller, a campaign-reform advocate who lost his bid for
the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor. ``I think people
are really offended at people trying to buy elections. Political
pundits underestimate the intelligence of the voters. They're not
idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants are scratching their heads trying to
figure out how millionaire Al Checchi could plow nearly $40 million
into his campaign for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and
come out with only 13 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a lot of books written on Al
Checchi,'' said John Herrington, the former Republican Party state
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Another unsuccessful candidate, Rep. Jane Harman, spent more
than $11 million of her own money in the three-way Democratic race
for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Issa forked over $13 million in his race for the
Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. But it was Fong, a small
spender by comparison, who won the nomination to challenge
incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Californians were not the only ones who appeared to reject the
expensive television commercials and sophisticated campaign
strategies of the wealthy candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This year, big-spending candidates have been drummed out of a
number of races around the country, in favor of contenders with
more political experience.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kentucky voters narrowly rejected multimillionaire
U.S. Senate candidate Charlie Owen after his infusion of personal
cash made the race the most expensive in that state's history. In
Illinois' March primary, voters rejected a gubernatorial candidate
and two congressional contenders who spent huge sums of their own
money.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts say the public's rejection of rich
outsiders shows a major shift in the mood of American voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amateur hour in politics is over,'' said Washington, D.C.,
pollster Mark Melman. ``I see this as a trend. The notion that
people want outsiders to come in and shake things up is no longer
true. People want experience.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say voters are not as likely to rock the
boat as they were in the early 1990s, when the economy was not as
healthy. In the 1992 presidential race, for example, political
neophyte Ross Perot pumped millions of dollars of his own money
into an independent campaign that helped deny George Bush a second
term and prevented the winner, Bill Clinton, from getting a
plurality of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, ``voters were so angry that they were
politically assassinating government insiders right and left,''
said Darry Sragow, campaign adviser to Checchi. ``But that is
obviously not the mood anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Checchi's accomplishments outside of politics may have
hurt the candidate the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people looked at a successful businessman, who had
accumulated a lot of personal wealth, with skepticism,'' he said.
``It appeared that voters put more value on candidates who had
worked their way through the rungs of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   But one political scientist said he did not believe that voters
rejected wealthy candidates simply because of their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some kind of voter backlash,'' said Paul Hendrie
of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics, ``but
I don't think it proves that money doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, people with a lot of money who get into
politics don't have any experience running a campaign. That hurts
them,'' he said. ``Running a business is very different than the
rough-and-tumble world of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this election, the most ever spent in a California
primary was the $9 million raised by Democrat Kathleen Brown in her
1994 bid for governor.

   260&AMP;ADD  GLOBAL POLLS SHOW MANY FEEL
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS TOO WEEK
 &HT;     Eds: Optional add can be used as a separate list or for a map.
 &HT;     By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A series of opinion polls in 30 countries show that
most people feel their countries' laws fail to adequately protect
the environment, the Canadian firm that commissioned the surveys
for multinational corporations and governments said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The results ranged from Greece, where 91 percent of respondents
agreed that environmental laws ``don't go far enough,'' to Finland,
where only 37 percent agreed with the statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 59 percent of persons agreed with the
statement, a smaller share than in all but four other nations
polled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potency of the environmental issue is so great that we're
going to see major changes in many countries, and companies doing
business in those countries will have to anticipate those
changes,'' said Doug Miller, president of Environics International
Ltd. of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also said in a telephone interview that he has been
invited to brief officials at the White House next week on the
polls, which were conducted by polling companies in each country.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Finland, Nigeria was the only country where fewer
than half of respondents (42 percent) did not agree with the
statement that national environmental laws don't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that debate over climate change in the last year
appears to underlie much of the environmental opinion, but in Asia
and southern Europe, people are concerned about health problems
growing out of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   He said it cost $1 million to commission the 30 polls and that
more than 35,000 people were interviewed, either in person or by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)

IT'S HARD NOT TO BOGART THE OREOS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: On an old episode of ``Ellen,'' one of the characters said,
``Don't bogart the Oreos!'' What is the derivation of the verb
``bogart''?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.T., Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   A: To ``bogart'' means to act in a bold, aggressive manner or to
hog something instead of sharing it.

`MR. JEALOUSY': THERAPY, AS A FRONT FOR SNOOPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
 (JT)  
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Noah Baumbach has described his second film, ``Mr. Jealousy''
(after the bright, witty ``Kicking and Screaming''), with reference
to the directorial pantheon, invoking filmmakers from Billy Wilder
to Francois Truffaut to Ernst Lubitsch as inspirations for his own
comic style. Without knowing that, it would be easier to cite the
two most imitated contemporary influences on independent comedies,
Woody Allen and ``Seinfeld'' (in that order). Articulate,
self-defeating romantics who discuss their troubles at coffee shops
are again on the loose, this time in the story of Lester Grimm
(Eric Stoltz) and his wild possessiveness about his girlfriend,
Ramona Ray (Annabella Sciorra). Since Ramona is the sort to explain
she's been home having a shampoo when her unwashed hair looks
suspiciously tousled, Lester has his hands full.
</P>
<P>
   In a film that flows less smoothly than ``Kicking and
Screaming,'' bogged down by overzealous narration and a story
that's slow to get rolling, the otherwise astute Baumbach gives
Lester the rival he deserves: Dashiell Frank, the literary
celebrity known as the voice of his generation. While Dashiell's
best-selling book is read on audiotape by Tom Cruise, Lester (who
also has literary ambitions) is a schoolteacher who isn't always
happy in his work. For instance, when he fills in as a Spanish
teacher without understanding so much as ``Si.''
</P>
<P>
   The story's central gambit has Lester joining Dashiell's group
therapy sessions (led by an amusingly donnish Peter Bogdanovich) so
he can find out more about Dashiell, Ramona's famous ex. Lester
pretends to be Vince, his own best friend, for secrecy's sake.
Lester also bristles whenever Dashiell confesses to sexual
exploits. ``How can you say at your age that you've never been
faithful to anyone?'' he exclaims. ``What kind of boyfriend  &UR; are &LR; 
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Though two appealing actors play Lester and Dashiell, the roles
are strikingly miscast. Chris Eigeman, the hilariously sulky,
nit-picking star of Whit Stillman's films and a major asset in
``Kicking and Screaming,'' plays the supposedly suave Dashiell. But
he's got Lester written all over him; Eigeman seems ready-made for
the nutty, fiendish jealousy of the title role. And Stoltz, while
credibly neurotic here, radiates the well-being and smooth
complacency that could have made Dashiell that much more galling.
The film, which is better written than staged, could have been
funnier if its actors weren't playing against type.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sciorra gives Ramona the right friskiness, though she is not
shown off to best advantage by the film's dowdily retro costumes or
its oddly somber look. Marianne Jean-Baptiste, who played the
daughter in ``Secrets and Lies,'' and Bridget Fonda are underused
in smallish roles. Also in the cast (as they were in ``Kicking and
Screaming'') are Carlos Jacott as the real Vince, who enjoys
Lester's tactfully censored versions of what the group therapy
patients have to say about him, and John Lehr as the most enjoyably
weird of Lester's friends. ``It's fun just to follow people
around,'' he assures the snoopy Lester. ``Anyone.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all the partisan squabbles between President
Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress, the one that seems
at first blush the least earth-shaking is a dry technical argument
over how to count heads.
</P>
<P>
   The way the national census for the year 2000 is to be
conducted, however, could tilt the population numbers toward one
party or the other. Its impact will be felt in the redrawing of
congressional and legislative districts, affecting the makeup of
future congresses and state houses. It could also change the
regional distribution of federal funds, which is often based on
population.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very big deal indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The political fight over the census isn't really about which
method will produce the most precise count, as both sides like to
pretend. The census is often inaccurate anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It is about how to cook the books so that voters likely to be
Republican are overcounted and those likely to be Democrats
undercounted _ or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials frequently base public policy decisions
affecting domestic concerns, such as heath care programs, on the
number of people who live in certain locations, belong to certain
ethnic groups or are otherwise statistically differentiated.
</P>
<P>
   The specific issue here is whether to supplement the traditional
method of physically counting bodies by knocking on doors and
mailing out questionnaires. The Census Bureau proposes to do the
physical count and to add a demographic technique called
statistical sampling. Using the technique, the figures actually
counted in 90 percent of the households in each census tract would
be adjusted, based on an extrapolation of those figures plus a
survey of 750,000 households nationwide. The technique, says the
bureau, would allow it to account for those people known to exist
who were not actually contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaigned on behalf of sampling in his weekend radio
address and at a Houston community roundtable talk this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau confessed after the 1990 head count that it
had missed 8.4 million people and double-counted 4.4 million
others. A substantial portion of those missing were minorities and
poor inner city families likely to vote Democratic. Some of those
who were counted twice were wealthy folks who owned two homes and
were likely to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised the troubling problem of minority undercounting,
warning that ``having an accurate census is a big part of having a
strategy for racial reconciliation in America.'' He promised to
make the census a priority issue this year and predicted that with
modern statistical devices sampling would be virtually error-free.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans charge that the president and the Democrats
don't care about a correct count and are simply scheming to adjust
the figures in a way that could prompt massive redistricting. They
fear that such population shifting could potentially change the
partisan makeup of roughly two dozen House seats and return control
of that august body to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   GOP congressional leaders have threatened to block the
administration's planned introduction of sampling by denying
federal funds for the method during budget negotiations this fall.
They have also filed suit to stop it on the shaky ground that it is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But the Constitution says that an ``actual enumeration'' must be
conducted every 10 years ``in such a manner as they (members of
Congress) shall by law direct.'' That wording would appear to allow
changes in the census process. Sampling is a well-recognized system
of counting used in political polling and other statistical
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   We Americans have always been curious about who we are and how
many of us there are. The first census in 1790 was ordered in the
first public law issued by Congress on June 1, 1789. It counted
slightly under 4 million inhabitants. This included approximately
700,000 men and women held in slavery. The most populous state was
Virginia, with 692,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 Census declared that we had ballooned to 248,709,873
people, before the discovery of the undercounting problem. Experts
predict that we will hit a population of 270 million citizens in
the 2000 census, a massive head-counting project.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to supplement the old-fashioned system with an
advanced process that is widely accepted as accurate by
professional bureaucrats and the statistical and scientific
community. It would cut the cost of taking the census and make it
easier for the bureau to do its job properly.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are having a good time making fun of the concept
of counting people who haven't been eyeballed or otherwise directly
contacted, but they are living in the past.
</P>
<P>
   And their fears of the sudden emergence of hordes of Democratic
voters seem greatly exaggerated. In any case, if those voters are
out there they deserve to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   It is time census-taking entered the 21st century.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: We like mail that likes us
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The readers write ...
</P>
<P>
   From Dan Rahn, the University of Georgia,
drahn(at)arches.uga.edu, on the subject of, ``We like people who
are like we are,'' as noted in a recent column:
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a 99-cent Whopper for lunch yesterday (actually a
74-cent Whopper _ when they give me a senior citizen discount
without asking, I just take it).
</P>
<P>
   ``In the line behind me was a raggedy, mean-looking woman who
was buying lunch for a raggedy, meaner-looking man and what looked
to be a family of three raggedy children with IQs lower than the
table they were sitting at.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was waiting for my burger the man hauled off and
knocked the crap out of one of the young'uns and cussed him about
something I hadn't seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got my lunch I went out to the nonsmoker, sunroom
section, grateful that I normally eat out there because there was a
wall between me and this family.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as I sat there, eating my burger and mulling my demeanor,
I wondered at how different God and I still are.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves those people. I mostly want to avoid them. Much as I
try to be like God, I still just like people like me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a Sunday school lesson in itself.

   ``There is nothing wrong with property ownership, except when
the owner decides that destroying, wasting, polluting property is
their right. No way.

<P>
   ``Your rant is extremist. You are showing how little you regard
your fellow humans by falsely claiming these kinds of individual

<P>
   ``Ultimately, every financial success is achieved collectively,
not individually.

   ``I know you don't want to hear that as you roll around in your

   ``The truth is the wealthy have exploited human labor to obtain
wealth. Don't pat yourself on the back as if you succeeded alone.

`BEYOND SILENCE': TORN BETWEEN MUSIC AND THE DEAF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recovery movement is filled with stories of children who
grew up having to take care of emotionally dysfunctional parents.
But what about those children who had to run interference for
emotionally healthy parents with physical disabilities? In Caroline
Link's film ``Beyond Silence,'' the story of a gifted young
musician and first-born child in a family where both parents were
deaf becomes a powerful metaphor for the inevitable communication
gap between children and parents in even the happiest of homes.
Imagine the frustration of being a gifted musician whose parents
are literally unable to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The early scenes of this German film (which was nominated last
year for an Academy Award for best foreign picture), show Lara
(Tatjana Trieb), the 8-year-old daughter of Martin (Howie Seago)
and Kai (Emmanuelle Laborit), to be resourceful beyond any ordinary
expectations. Wide-eyed and ingratiating, Lara is adept at two
languages: German and sign language. Her parents not only dote on
her, they depend on her to help them negotiate many everyday
transactions, including telephone calls, banking and even
parent-teacher conferences. Precociously sophisticated in the ways
of the world, Lara is already a skillful diplomat. When translating
into words the sign-language tantrums of her hot-tempered father,
she tactfully softens their tone.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their dependence on her, Lara has an unusually strong
bond with her parents. And in the movie's early scenes, the
relationship among the three is portrayed as idyllic in its special
intimacy and mutual gratitude. That happiness begins to erode when
Martin's sister Clarissa (Sibylle Canonica), a professional
clarinetist, gives her niece a clarinet for Christmas, and it
quickly becomes apparent that the little girl is unusually
talented.
</P>
<P>
   As Lara immerses herself in music (she is eventually drawn to
klezmer music), her regular schoolwork suffers. At the same time,
her absorption in a world that is inaccessible to her parents opens
old family wounds. Flashbacks recall Martin's childhood jealousy
over the attention paid to Clarissa for her musical talents and his
bitter sense of exclusion from the bosom of the family after he
laughs at the sight of his sister playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond Silence'' makes a sudden awkward transition when the
story jumps forward a decade, and a different actress (Sylvie
Testud) assumes the role of Lara. Ms. Testud's edgy, introverted
Lara is so opposite the adorable Shirley Temple-like child of the
first part that it's difficult to connect the two, and the movie
almost appears to be starting over from scratch. Encouraged by
Clarissa, Lara leaves her parents in the care of her younger sister
to enroll in a Berlin conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, ``Beyond Silence'' loses much of its focus as it
wanders from topic to topic. Because of her upbringing, the movie
suggests, Lara is emotionally stranded between two worlds: those of
the hearing and the nonhearing. Her father, in particular, is
desperate for her to remain his principal caretaker. Should Lara's
first allegiance be to her talent or to her parents? Lara,
following Clarissa's example, strikes out on her own.
</P>
<P>
   The movie turns unconvincingly warm and fuzzy when Mr. Right
appears in the person of Tom (Hansa Czypionka), a teacher for the
deaf who, like Lara, has normal hearing but can speak in sign
language. When she attends one of his classes in which he
introduces his deaf students to music by having them put their ears
to the floor to feel the vibrations of dance beats, the movie seems
to be sending a falsely reassuring message that music is really
accessible to everyone. The movie glides to a sentimental ending as
various estranged characters reconnect in pat, teary-eyed
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie eventually turns to mush, its hardheaded
performances tug against the sentimentality. As Martin, Seago, one
of the most active deaf actors in America, conveys both the
resilience and the frustration of a vigorous man trying to break
through his wall of silence.

PERFECT PLAN: KILL MY WIFE, PLEASE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to believe a word of the strained dialogue in ``A
Perfect Murder'' to be seduced by the movie's chilly high-gloss
ambiance and its skillfully plotted update of Frederick Knott's
play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film) ``Dial M For Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   One vicarious fantasy the movie gratifies is inhabiting a
jaw-droppingly elegant Fifth Avenue apartment with a spectacular
spiral staircase and a glorious view of Central Park. (And the
movie lets you wallow around in the place just long enough so you
begin to feel at home.) Another is that the truly rich who can
afford such grandeur must be truly dissatisfied. (Their good
fortune would be unbearable otherwise.) Steven and Emily Taylor,
the attractive childless couple who live in this palace, fit the
bill perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie opens, Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) is cavorting in bed
with a handsome young painter named David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen) in
his Brooklyn warehouse loft. Little does she know that her lover is
a ruthless con man and gigolo operating under a false name who has
spent many years in prison. Nor is she aware that her husband
(Michael Douglas), a shady Wall Street bond salesman, is about to
lose his shirt as one of his Asian schemes goes bust. Even worse,
her husband has discovered her clandestine affair and compiled a
devastating dossier on David that he is planning to use against
them both at the appropriate moment.
</P>
<P>
   Steven could be the Gordon Gekko of ``Wall Street'' a decade
later. The thrill of the chase has drained away, and all that's
left is a panicked psychopathic acquisitiveness. Douglas, who with
each film looks more like a wattled, riled-up rooster, makes Steven
a pleasure to loathe. When he approaches David with a cash offer of
$500,000 to murder his wife (Emily is independently wealthy, and
the Taylors have no prenuptial agreement) and make it look as
though she were slain by an intruder, Steven descends from villain
into monster.
</P>
<P>
   To describe any more of the plot, which departs significantly
from its source, would be to give too much away. But the story has
enough nasty twists and tantalizing clues for its ingenious
mechanics to remain engaging. Where the 1954 version starring Ray
Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings had the clunky feeling of
a filmed play, this update, directed by Andrew Davis from a
screenplay by Patrick Smith Kelly, is much more fluent and
sensuous. Its vision of late-'90s Manhattan as a luxurious shark
tank filled with chic cold fish is quite similar to the picture of
the city drawn by ``The Devil's Advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the sleekness of ``A Perfect Murder'' can't conceal
the fact that its characters are stick figures in an elaborate
three-way game featuring two cats and one very wiley mouse. Of the
three, Ms. Paltrow's Emily is the most problematic. Although the
movie halfheartedly tries to portray her as a damsel in distress,
that effort doesn't wash.
</P>
<P>
   This resourceful late-90's career woman, who works as a
translator at the United Nations, is no helpless blushing victim of
male skulduggery. She may not be quite as cunning as her husband,
but she is just as deceitful. And Ms. Paltrow, whose air is far too
worldly for her to be a convincing ingenue, gives her character a
crisp professional edge.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing her suspicions of a murder plot against her, Emily
fearlessly ventures into a seamier section of Brooklyn where she
charms a sinister drug dealer by using her linguistic skills. When
seeking privileged information about her husband's financial
status, she knows exactly where to go and whom to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Mortensen has the movie's richest role as the duplicitous
painter who is coerced into agreeing to murder his lover. In the
scenes in which he is supposed to appear sympathetic, he insinuates
enough surliness to give his character a disquieting undertone of
potential violence. But once David has been established as a rat,
the actor shows flashes of pained regret for having to kill a woman
he half loves.
</P>
<P>
   Money, money, money. The creepiest aspect of ``A Perfect
Murder'' is that there really is no contest between love and money.
The movie is right in tune with the icy Darwinian mood fostered by
the booming late-90's economy. In a climate like this, the hottest
sex in the world doesn't stand a chance against the possibility of
raking in a quick half-million.
</P>
<P>

NEW DRIVE BEGINS TO STOP ANTI-BILINGUAL EDUCATION MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's third epic legal battle in four
years over an initiative fraught with widespread social
implications is under way, this time against the anti-bilingual
education Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the initiative, which scraps most of the state's
bilingual education programs, filed suit in federal court Wednesday
seeking to invalidate it on constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 227 was approved by a broad margin, 61 percent to 39
percent, in Tuesday's primary election.
</P>
<P>
   The man who put Proposition 227 on the ballot, Ron K. Unz,
called the measure ``ironclad constitutional'' and predicted that
it would be used as a nationwide model.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reaction to approval of the ballot initiative recalls
the uproar that followed passage of Proposition 187 in 1994 and
Proposition 209 in 1996. Both initiatives faced lengthy court
battles and Proposition 187, dealing with immigrant rights, was
largely gutted.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 209, the measure that ended most public affirmative
action programs, survived court challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Unz said he believed ``the overwhelming majority of school
districts in California will be implementing our initiative at the
beginning of the school year.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he said he expected a quick settlement of the legal
issues, the history of such contentious issues suggests otherwise.
It took the courts more than a year to resolve debates over the
other two propositions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the coalition of civil rights, parent, church and
ethnic organizations that filed the class-action lawsuit to block
Proposition 227 said they were entering unchartered legal
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not arguing that there's a categorical entitlement to
bilingual education classes,'' said Ed Chen, an attorney for the
American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. ``Our point
is that (Proposition 227) not only eliminates bilingual education,
it limits (English) immersion to one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody is saying that you can give these kids
the kind of literacy they need in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Escobedo, a lawyer for Multicultural Education Training
and Advocacy Inc., said the case was unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first instance where extremely viable means of
providing equality of educational opportunity are being stripped
from the state and local school districts,'' Escobedo said.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action complaint argues that Proposition 227 is
invalid because it violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
Educational Opportunity Act of 1974 and the equal protection clause
of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   It discriminates against minorities on the basis of national
origin, the plaintiffs contend, because the law requires school
districts to take steps to take ``appropriate action to overcome
language barriers'' for non-English speakers.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to squelch the initiative, the plaintiffs must
first convince U.S. District Judge Charles Legge that
implementation of Proposition 227 should be blocked pending
resolution of the legal issues it raises.
</P>
<P>
   Legge, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, is
regarded as one of the most conservative members of San Francisco's
federal bench. The case was assigned to Legge by lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 227 prescribes one year of ``sheltered English
immersion'' for children who are not proficient in English in place
of the array of bilingual programs now offered in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely unbelievable,'' said Veronica Chavez, a
teacher in charge at San Francisco's Buena Vista Alternative
school, which teaches students by immersion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we told any English-speaking parent that we could teach
their kids (Spanish) in a year, we'd be lying, but that's what
we're now telling Spanish-speaking parents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that sheltered English immersion would
subject children to an educational experiment, deny them access to
critical parts of the curriculum and virtually assure that they
will be low academic achievers.

`THE SPICE ISLANDS VOYAGE': VOYAGE BACK TO PARADISE, BIRDS AND
ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Publication notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several threads are woven together in ``The Spice Islands
Voyage,'' Tim Severin's account of a seafaring expedition in the
Indonesian Archipelago. Severin, an Irish adventurer and travel
writer whose previous books include ``Tracking Marco Polo'' and
``In Search of Genghis Khan,'' had a traditional Moluccan
square-rigger sailboat built in order to duplicate the 19th-century
itinerary of the pioneering British naturalist Alfred Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Severin and his crew then spent several months in the Spice
Islands visiting the harbors, the nature reserves and the rain
forests that Wallace visited, taking pictures, recording sightings
of butterflies and birds, checking out the environmental record and
interviewing local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Severin uses this Thor Heyerdahl-like trip to
resurrect the memory of Wallace himself, a man, the author says,
who produced the breakthrough insights that Charles Darwin used in
formulating evolutionary theory. And so ``The Spice Islands
Voyage'' is a kind of travelogue-biography, a balanced combination
of historical re-enactment and contemporary adventure, written in
straightforwardly descriptive, unself-dramatizing fashion.
Severin's book is illustrated both by photographs and by a set of
evocative ink drawings by Leonard Sheil that add considerably to
the exotic mood.
</P>
<P>
   Severin begins with Wallace himself, a fascinating,
self-effacing genius whose life could easily sustain a volume or
two by itself. Indeed, Wallace has been the subject of at least two
biographies, both acknowledged as sources by Severin, and his
relationship with Darwin has been chronicled elsewhere as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shy, gentle man was so decent,'' Severin writes of
Wallace in his opening chapter. ``He wandered through the islands
of southeast Asia with good humor and incredible fortitude; he did
no harm, and he left no bad taste.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1858, Wallace, while laid up with malaria in the middle of
his long Moluccan sojourn, wrote a brief essay in which he
summarized the concept of the survival of the fittest, which he
correctly saw as ``the long-sought-for law of nature that solved
the problem of the origin of species.'' The essay made its way to
Charles Darwin, who had been searching for the solution to that
problem for two decades. When Darwin finally published ``On the
Origin of Species'' a couple of years later, he gave credit to
Wallace, who nonetheless faded, unprotesting, into relative
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had already been on one major expedition before his
Indonesian journey, a voyage to Brazil, which ended badly when most
of the bird and insect samples he was carrying were lost in a fire
on the ship taking him back to England. But his eight years in the
Spice Islands, one of the world's major hotbeds of bio-diversity,
rank among the major expeditions of scientific discovery. Severin,
in tracing Wallace's itinerary, deftly brings to life both Wallace
and his achievement.
</P>
<P>
   He begins by having a boat of a type known locally as a prahu
kalulis (which he named after Wallace) built by local craftsmen on
a small island called Warbal in the Kei Archipelago. He sailed it
for a thousand miles through the Seram Sea, stopping at Wallace's
ports of call from the Aru Islands in the east to Sulawesi in the
west.
</P>
<P>
   Severin does not have colossal, death-defying adventures. His
journey is not full of emotionally intense or dangerous episodes,
but rather of a continuous flow of more quietly absorbing
experiences. His boat-building foray is a charming encounter with
local people, whom he portrays with bemused affection as skilled,
trustworthy and strange. He rides out a couple of storms in his
narrow-beamed, shallow-draft vessel, and he provides some
interesting technical information about sail handling and
seamanship on a boat that is, he believes, pretty close to the kind
Wallace used.
</P>
<P>
   He spends a good deal of time on several islands trying to sight
birds of paradise, one of the rarest, most beautiful and most
endangered species on the planet. Indeed, one subplot in Severin's
journey is the detailed description he provides of the operation of
the illegal trade in exotic birds, including birds of paradise. He
sees them being captured. He visits the warehouses of the merchants
who ship them illegally to collectors in Jakarta, Singapore and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Severin makes the paradoxical discovery that endangered species
seem to do better outside the supposedly protected nature preserves
established by the Indonesian government. The preserves, he finds,
preserve very little, but where local people have an interest in a
species' survival, so that they can continue to cull it for profit,
they do not hunt it to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The starkest ecological moment in this sense comes on a visit to
a supposedly protected sea turtle nesting area where Severin and
his crew find that every nest has been thoroughly despoiled of
eggs. ``The empty desolate landscape looked like a casualty of
war,'' he writes. ``It was as if Enue Beach had been pounded by
artillery.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, on an island called Kaboei, where there was a
``flourishing and highly illegal trade in red birds of paradise,''
Severin is taken by a guide to see the evening mating dance of
these remarkable creatures. The birds of paradise never failed to
appear and ``play'' in the trees, the guide tells them.
</P>
<P>
   Severin is well aware that Wallace, operating at a different
time, shot birds of paradise and many other species so he could
sell them through a London agent and thereby finance his
expedition. Severin also notes that the danger of extinction is far
greater now than it was then. But his awareness of the persistence
of a certain relationship between the world of nature and economic
need is one of the things that give his historical re-enactment its
depth and interest.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walter C. Miller scanned the tables in the center of
the gymnasiumlike rehearsal room on the ninth floor of Radio City
Music Hall, staring into the faces of the slouching technicians,
directors and production assistants who will put on this year's
Tony Awards telecast on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' he said. ``Rosie O'Donnell is not going to be a
traffic cop on this show. She is (italics)hosting(end italics) our
show. She is a personality, and we are going to let her personality
shine. Am I understood? She will shine.''
</P>
<P>
   On last year's telecast, the first with Ms. O'Donnell, the talk
show host and Broadway enthusiast as host and the first to be held
at the expansive music hall instead of a smaller Broadway house,
she drew more national attention and higher ratings to Broadway's
top awards event, the theater's answer to the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not gonna burden her with listing everybody's credits
and so on,'' said Miller, the show's longtime director and new
executive producer. ``This year, we're gonna let the announcer do
that. She is not a traffic cop. She's gonna be our warm and fuzzy
host.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997-1998 Broadway season comes to an official close on
Sunday night when the 52d annual awards honoring artistic and
technical achievement on the Broadway stage are handed out during a
live television broadcast at Radio City Music Hall with Ms.
O'Donnell presiding.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: she will not be a traffic cop.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Donnell will open the show in full diva fashion, joining
Betty Buckley, Jennifer Holliday, Patti LuPone and eight dancers
from ``Chicago'' in a belters' medley. Later in the program, there
will be elaborate production numbers from the four nominees for
best musical (the opening extravaganzas from ``Ragtime'' and ``The
Lion King,'' ``Into the Fire'' from ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' and
``I Will Never Leave You'' from ``Side Show'') and the three
nominees for best revival of a musical (``Willkommen,'' from
``Cabaret,'' ``Sit Down, John,'' from ``1776,'' and a medley from
``The Sound of Music).
</P>
<P>
   And at 10:56 p.m., give or take, after Nathan Lane has opened
the final envelope of the evening, either Garth Drabinsky, creative
director of Livent, the corporation behind ``Ragtime,'' or Peter
Schneider, president of Walt Disney Theatrical Productions, the
corporation behind ``Lion King,'' will almost certainly be standing
on the music hall stage issuing thanks.
</P>
<P>
   A short time before, when Alec Baldwin opens the envelope for
best play, it will be revealed whether one of the two favorites for
the award, ``Art,'' by Yasmina Reza, or ``The Beauty Queen of
Leenane,'' by Martin McDonagh, have taken the award.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns to influence the 750 Tony voters are not as extensive
_ or expensive _ as the ones waged over Oscars, though some of the
awards, like the best musical Tony, can mean a fortune to a
production. Last season's ``Titanic,'' struggling before it won the
Tony, has since become one of the biggest hits on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigning for a Tony is more of a low-key thing,'' said one
Broadway professional, who declined to be named because it might
affect his own campaign. ``It's done in ads in the newspapers and
the trades, and during the endless round of cocktail parties and
minor awards presentations that follow the announcement of the
nominations.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is also a small assortment of tchotchkes that have
gone out to Tony voters: a CD from ``Cabaret,'' books from ``The
Lion King,'' assorted T-shirts and coffee mugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties have been bigger this year than before and they're
coming closer together,'' said Isabelle Stevenson, president of the
American Theater Wing, which presents the Antoinette Perry Awards
in association with the League of American Theaters and Producers.
``It never ends now. And while we used to have one big party after
the awards now, with all the big corporations and everything being
bigger, a lot of people want to have their own smaller party. It's
getting to be big business, which tends to curtail some of the
warmth of the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the awards, nominees try to give Tony
voters a reason to vote for their show, a kind of theatrical spin.
Drabinsky, for instance, has accepted some earlier awards for
``Ragtime'' by talking about how the show is very American and
traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Taymor, the acclaimed director of ``Lion King,'' has
accepted awards by praising Disney for using its corporate muscle
to bring daring, cutting-edge techniques to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few nods and grunts around the room as Miller spoke
to his troops (``the salty group that follows me around,'' he
called them). People scribbled into their notebooks. ``There is an
awful lot of good stuff on Broadway this season,'' Miller told
them. ``I don't know what we can do to mess it up but we're gonna
try not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the season that the awards cap is the most lucrative and
successful in Broadway history, despite a slump in its last days
that saw the closing of several shows. The season set records for
attendance (11.3 million) and box office grosses (more than $550
million) and keeping virtually every theater on Broadway lighted
during the season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Producers and theater owners have also tried to capitalize on
the flush times by beginning to edge up the top ticket price, which
had been stuck at $75 for years. Some added $1 service charges to
renovate theaters. Livent put in a VIP section at its Ford Center
for the Performing Arts, and prices there are set to rise to $135.
``Cabaret'' and ``Rent'' are raising top prices to $80.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just money, of course. The season was an artistic
success, as well, creating one of the most competitive Tony
contests in years, with a battle in almost every category capped by
the titanic struggle for the best musical award between
``Ragtime,'' with 13 nominations, and ``The Lion King,'' with 11.
</P>
<P>
   It is deemed all but certain by theater professionals that the
Roundabout Theater's searing revival of ``Cabaret'' will win the
best musical revival award, and the Roundabout's revival of ``A
View From the Bridge,'' by Arthur Miller, is the solid favorite for
best revival of a play, over ``The Chairs,'' ``Ah Wilderness'' and
``The Diary of Anne Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really a very good season, and I've been around a
long time,'' Ms. Stevenson said. ``It's one of the fullest seasons
that I know of and what's really gratifying is that there are so
many straight plays and such an enormous amount of talent on
Broadway. I can tell you that the Tony nominating committee was
hard-pressed to limite their nominations to four in such categories
as best play and best male performance.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, not long ago straight plays were considered such an
endangered species on Broadway that the Broadway Initiative, among
other efforts, was created, in part, to subsidize them. Now
straight plays are being presented in profusion and with marked
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season was the year of the play,'' said Jed Bernstein,
the league's executive director. ``What producers discovered this
season is that it is possible to package and produce a play
profitably, whether it's through limited runs or star vehicles or
whatever. It's doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the unusual breadth of the season has struck many.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use a department store analogy,'' Bernstein said. ``What you
hope for is to have really good stuff in every department, so you
can get all the potential customers into the store. This was a year
where that really seemed to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second year, the two-hour Tony broadcast on CBS, from 9
to 11 p.m., will be preceded by a one-hour PBS telecast produced by
WNET/Channel 13 called ``Broadway '98: Launching the Tony Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   During that hour, the awards will be presented for choreography,
musical score, musical book, orchestration, scenic design,
orchestration, lighting design, costume design, director of a play,
director of a musical and the annual award to a regional theater
company. This year, that award goes to the Denver Center Theater.
</P>
<P>
   During the CBS program, the acting Tonys will be presented,
along with the two most prestigious awards, for best play and best
musical. There will be plenty of time for production numbers,
celebrity presenters and effusive speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a veteran of many awards broadcasts, said he had decided
not to use the tactic of playing music to force loquacious winners
from the podium. Instead, he said, he will simply place a message
on the teleprompter (``Please wrap it up'') and hope for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   This year's innovation will be a segment highlighting the
nominees for best play, which are often overshadowed by the musical
production numbers. Miller asked the writers of each of the
nominated plays _ Ms. Reza, McDonagh, David Henry Hwang for ``The
Golden Child'' and John Leguizamo for ``Freak'' _ to write a
45-second synopsis of their play to be performed by a member of its
cast, in costume, on a set designed to resemble the show's actual
Broadway set.
</P>
<P>
   All of the productions except ``Art'' agreed to take part. Late
last week, the producer of ``Art'' told Miller that Alda, who had
been asked to read the synopsis, would not take part and Ms. Reza
would not write one.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Baldwin, the award's presenter, will read a
synopsis of ``Art'' written by Miller's staff and then introduce a
trio of live readings by performers in the other shows, culminating
in Leguizamo's interpretation of his own play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that he's nominated this year,'' Miller said. ``He's
such a fast-talking, fast-thinking, high-energy performer. It going
to be a great burst of energy at the end of the segment. That guy
can tell his life story (italics)and(end italics) yours in 45
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   An informal canvassing of more than two dozen theater
professionals _ an eclectic assortment of producers, theater
owners, performers and press agents _ revealed a widespread belief
that there are at least two all-but-sure winners: ``Cabaret'' for
best musical revival, and the show's star, Natasha Richardson, for
best actress in a musical. (The nominees competing with Ms.
Richardson are Marin Mazzie for ``Ragtime,'' Alice Ripley and Emily
Skinner for ``Side Show'' and Ms. Buckley for ``Triumph of Love.'')
</P>
<P>
   A sizable majority also believe that Alan Cumming, the
insinuating M.C. of ``Cabaret,'' will win the award for best actor
in a musical, although a minority favor Brian Stokes Mitchell's
star turn as Coalhouse Walker in ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sills' acclaimed performance as ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel'' is seen to be handicapped by that show's mediocre
reviews and box office struggles, while Peter Friedman's Tateh in
``Ragtime'' is seen to be overshadowed by Mitchell's performance in
the same show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitchell and Friedman will split the `Ragtime' votes and
Cumming will skate to victory,'' one producer said.
</P>
<P>
   But another producer demurred: ``The M.C. role is traditionally
a supporting one, and Mitchell really commands the stage in
`Ragtime.' I think that when the voters look in their hearts,
they'll go with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony LaPaglia is the favorite to win best actor in a play for
``A View From the Bridge,'' though some think Alfred Molina will
win for ``Art,'' a box-office success that could use a Tony or two
to catapult future national tours.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Briers, nominated for ``The Chairs,'' is considered
highly unlikely to win. But more than one person suggested that
Leguizamo could be the night's biggest surprise by winning the
award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long shot, but `Freak' has been a real phenomenon and
has brought a lot of people into a Broadway theater who have never
been in one before,'' one said of the young and Hispanic audience
attracted to the show. ``I think there is a real sentiment to give
the show something, and this is the most logical award.''
</P>
<P>
   A minority predict that Jane Alexander, returning to Broadway
this season after four years of leading the National Endowment for
the Arts, will win the best actress award for ``Honour.'' Most
others feel that the poorly received play will be overshadowed by
``Beauty Queen of Leenane'' and the award will go to Marie Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller voting block feels that Allison Janney, a favorite
among Tony voters, will win for her performance in ``A View from
the Bridge.'' Geraldine McEwan, nominated for ``The Chairs,'' is
considered a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of those asked said the best play contest is between
two favorites, with about two-thirds believing that ``Beauty
Queen'' will take the award (``It's been the biggest sensation on
Broadway since `Lion King' opened,'' said) and another third
favoring ``Art.'' (``A third of the voters are from the road and
they're going to want to have an audience-pleaser like `Art' to
bring a Tony into their towns,'' another said.)
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Freak,'' whose limited run ends next month, and ``The
Golden Child,'' which has already closed, were seen as outside
shots by only one predictor each.
</P>
<P>
   The general consensus seems to be that Terrence McNally will win
the award for writing the book of ``Ragtime,'' but that ``The Lion
King'' will take home most of the rest of the awards, including one
for Ms. Taymor's direction.
</P>
<P>
   The closest contest, if these people are correct, will come in
the best musical category. Of the 26 people who ventured a
prediction, most felt the race could easily go either way. But when
pressed for a choice, 15 felt that ``Ragtime'' would take the award
and 11 went with ``Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While `Ragtime' is a traditional Broadway musical with a great
book and great music and great performances, `Lion King' is more of
a spectacle,'' one producer said. ``A lot of people don't think
it's a Broadway musical, really. It's an adaptation of an animated
movie with puppets. I think they'll go with something more
traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, another said. ``There's more than spectacle to `Lion
King,' '' he said. ``There is something joyous about it. `Ragtime'
is too earnest and plodding. Voters will go with joyous every
time.''

`CHARLIE HOBOKEN': A MOB HIT MAN'S WEAPON: TALK, TALK AND MORE
TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Charlie Hoboken'' is a movie about a couple of hit men. Mostly
what it does is talk you to death _ slowly and painfully.
</P>
<P>
   Buried somewhere in all the talk, which mistakes the smart
alecky for the witty, is a tale of youth and risk-taking ambition
contrasted with conservative middle age, of self-centered egotism
that leads to loneliness contrasted with a generosity of spirit and
true love, and of father-son relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But for Thomas F. Mazziotti, a New Jersey insurance company
owner's son who wrote and directed this story of an insurance
company owner's son by day who is a mob hit man by night, talk _
not action _ is character. And the talk rapidly grows wearisome.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup lines like ``Do you know the word `fun' is in the word
`funeral.' So do you want to have some fun?'' have an effect as
deadening as any of the business carried out by Charlie Hoboken
(Ken Garito), the young moonlighting partner of a third-generation
assassin, Harry Cedars (Austin Pendleton). Little wonder that most
of the women that Charlie attracts to the candlelit abandoned
church where he lives don't come back after he insists on using the
astringent in his bathroom to clean their fingers and pores.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of ``Charlie Hoboken,'' Harry and Charlie have
carried out 30 successful hits in a year and a half for the Boss,
and Charlie is getting bored. An ambitious yuppie, he'd like to do
something different. Instead of shootings with a silenced pistol,
what about electrocutions, stabbings, poisons? What about working
on commissions rather than flat fees? And somewhere in the back of
his selfish mind is the idea of rising in the Boss's criminal
hierarchy, over Harry's dead body, if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, a nerd who affects leather caps, rumpled tweeds and plaid
shirts that give him the appearance of a Woody Allen clone who
wandered into the wrong movie, is happy the way things are. He's so
colorless that ``America's Most Wanted'' canceled its segment on
him. When he comes home after the night's work to his wife, Angie
(Tovah Feldshuh with a ``Dead End'' dames accent), and she asks him
about work, he replies, ``Same old, same old.'' Angie would like
children, but Harry is not so sure, given the risks inherent in his
line of work. Anyway, Charlie is sort of like a son to him.
</P>
<P>
   But Charlie isn't much of a son to his father (George Morfogen)
or his stepmother (Anita Gillette).
</P>
<P>
   And he isn't good company.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of comedy, ``Charlie Hoboken'' is more bleak than
black.

IN LOVE WITH THE PAST AND A VISION OF PERFECT BEAUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prolific Pre-Raphaelite painter and designer
Edward Burne-Jones (1833-1898) is an artist whom generations of
cognoscente have loved to hate, or at least ignore.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1870s and '80s, after two decades of relative obscurity,
Burne-Jones found himself considered England's greatest living
painter. and celebrated in France and Belgium, where his work
influenced Symbolism and he established ties with such like-minded
artists as Gustave Moreau, Pierre Puvis de Chavaunnes and Ferdinand
Khnopff.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, some contemporaries could sniffed at his
chivalric themes of Galahad, the Sleeping Beauty and Saint George,
and at his somnolent lovers and pensive sibyls. And numerous
complaints have echoed through the years.
</P>
<P>
   To some, his work has been regressive, inexcusably innocent or
too literary. Others have found his dense compositions were
overwrought and claustrophobic: too eminently Victorian. Still
others have labeled the enigmatic sensuousness of his handsome
androgynous figures decadent or morbid.
</P>
<P>
   Burne-Jones's reputation began to decline shortly before his
death. His style was superseded by Impressionism, which the
meticulous Burne-Jones found ``muzzy'' and unfinished, and by a
younger generation of artists who were awed by his achievements but
tended to look elsewhere for inspiration. (Still, it is hard to
imagine Aubrey Beardsley's unfurling line and languorous aloofness
without the precedent of Burne-Jones.)
</P>
<P>
   But, as the painter William Rothstein put it in his memoirs,
Burne-Jones's work may have ``certain weaknesses; but no man who
can draw and design so nobly and thereby impress his vision on the
world is to be swept aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, my suggestion for visitors to ``Edward Burne-Jones:
Victorian Artist-Dreamer,'' the lavish survey at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art: Whatever you think about his art, surrender to the
dream. You won't regret it.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which includes more than 170 works in several media,
is the most comprehensive survey of his work yet and the first in
this country. It has been organized by Laurence B. Kanter and Dita
Amory, curators of the Met's Robert L. Lehman collection, and
Stephen Wildman, curator of the Ruskin Library at Lancaster
University in England.
</P>
<P>
   Ignore the installation's oppressive color scheme, but give in
to the sometimes wooden paintings with their distinctive horizontal
proportions (all the better to depict reclining bodies), burnished
colors, dense-packed compositions and gilded frames.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the radiant stained glass and the two books for which
Burne-Jones made ink-on-vellum covers as gifts to Frances Graham,
the daughter of a patron. Compare the firey portrait of Maria
Zambaco, with whom he had a passionate affair in the late 1860s, to
his portraits of Georgiana, his devoted wife, or Lady Frances
Balfour: whose soft gazes disguise inner strength.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, pore over his astounding tapestries, executed in
collaboration, as were his stained-glass commissions, with his
lifelong friend William Morris, and fabricated by the craftsmen at
Morris and Co. Burne-Jones benefited incalculably from Morris's
brilliance as a designer; and his researches into the crafts,
motifs and literature of the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Especially crucial was Morris's emphasis on assertive patterns
derived from nature; they seem to have infiltrated Burne-Jones's
art, affecting everything from his depictions of lush brocades to
his habit of reducing nature to easily distinguished bands of
repeating leaves, flowers or trees.
</P>
<P>
   Such devices give Burne-Jones's work a sense of artifice and
vitality that makes him the least naturalistic, and best, of the
Pre-Raphaelites.
</P>
<P>
   The tapestries are the visual high point of the show. Their
scale fits the scope of Burne-Jones's ambition, their materials
magnified his artifice further and in the process frequently
freshened up age-old conventions. Haloes are little more than
circles of fizzy white dots, for example.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition's penultimate gallery, which contains six
tapestries depicting the quest for the Holy Grail, the angels'
ornate vestments seem studded with real gems, so precise are the
woven highlights.
</P>
<P>
   By almost any standards, there's plenty that can be called weird
and retrograde about Burne-Jones's art: its fervent historicism,
its relentless busyness, its frequent sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   He borrowed from nearly every major Early and High Renaissance
artist, from Giotto to Michelangelo and, later in life, Titian.
Burne-Jones was ``an art historian's artist,'' as the catalog puts
it.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts may not always strike the eye as being esthetically
alive, as having ideas that might fuel contemporary art, as
exhibitions from the past often do.
</P>
<P>
   But this exhibition lays out an extraordinary career. It also
says much about Victorian England, its romantic love of the past
and its confidence in its own bright future. After all, Burne-Jones
was the first English artist to be given a memorial service at
Westminster Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Burne-Jones was nonetheless a reclusive artist. He disliked
selling his paintings and even refused to exhibit them from 1870 to
1877. He avoided publicity, became more self-deprecating as his
fame increased, declined to explain the meaning of his images and
suffered paralyzing losses of confidence that resulted in paintings
and projects that were worked on for years or abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Burne-Jones had drawn incessantly since childhood. In 1856 at
22, he fled Oxford for London, driven by the desire to be an
artist. He was quickly swept up in the Gothic Revival, becoming a
protege of the critic John Ruskin, whose passionate writings on
Gothic art and architecture helped spark the revival.
</P>
<P>
   He also became a close friend of Dante Gabriel Rosetti, who
would provide most of his scant artistic training. And he fell in
with Rosetti's Pre-Raphaelites, who looked to the Italian
Primitives, wanted to unify art and poetry and viewed academic
training with a radical disdain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The young Burne-Jones was tailor-made for this milieu. In fact,
he and Morris, ultimately the founder of the English Arts and
Crafts movement, would breath new life into the Pre-Raphaelite
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Burne-Jones, like Morris, had loved the Middle Ages since
childhood, attracted, through poetry and Walter Scott's novels, to
its legends, romances and fairy tales. These stories provided
escape from a life that was itself a bit Gothic: Burne-Jones's
mother died within a week of his birth, and his father mourned for
years, taking his son on frequent visits to her grave.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder love, both lost and found, would be one of the
artist's consuming themes, or that his becalmed knights and ladies
convey intense if elusive states that include contemplation, grief,
reverie and, often, sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of Burne-Jones's work is thoroughly accounted for
here, with the exception of his drawings, which are too few, and
the absence of certain Burne-Jones chestnuts, like the Tate's
``Golden Circle,'' which will be seen only on the European leg of
this exhibition's tour.
</P>
<P>
   But other important works are present, like the Met's hauntingly
beautiful ``Le Chant d'Amour'' finished in 1877 and exhibited in
1878 at the Grosvenor Gallery to great acclaim, and ``King Cophetua
and the Beggar Maid.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting, which established Burne-Jones's reputation in
Paris, is based on a Tennyson poem and features an elaborately
stepped, gold architectural setting that looks like a Cimabue
throne reinterpreted by Piero della Francesca.
</P>
<P>
   This work, like so many here, reflects Burne-Jones's ability not
merely to borrow from the past, but to mix and remix his sources
with astounding fluidity. For example, he blended classical and
Christian themes by adorning the story of Pygmalion with the
garments and architecture of the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Finding of Medusa,'' an imposing body-color study for
his unrealized cycle of paintings based on the story of Perseus,
the recipe combines Michelangelo with Henry Fuseli to dramatic,
almost surreal effect.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to realize that despite its involvement
with literature, Burne-Jones's work is not literary in the usual
sense. It does not give precedence to subject matter. Rather it
breaks narratives into a series of autonomous scenes that
communicate primarily through a combination of charged
psychological states expressed by his figures and the visual rigor
of contrasting forms, colors, patterns and degrees of spatial
depth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Burne-Jones, working in the time before Freud and before
Fauvism, laid out the separate paths of much 20th-century art _ the
one toward expressions of raw emotion, the other toward pure form _
cranking them up to a new level, but kept them inextricably fused.
Maybe this accounts for the hothouse intensity of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Follow his confined spaces closed off by dense swatches of
repeating flowers, trees and bushes through Art Nouveau to their
logical conclusion, and you find Jackson Pollock. Follow his
withdrawn or anxious characters, and you find Francis Bacon. (But
let's not get carried away. Pursue the subject matter and stylized
realism to its logical conclusion, and you find N.C. Wyeth,
Maxfield Parrish and Norman Rockwell.)
</P>
<P>
   His work rife with once and future art styles, Burne-Jones
worked hard to keep everything up in the air. In fully mature works
like those from the ``Rose Briar'' series, based on the saga of
Sleeping Beauty, the reclining figures are surrounded by coil upon
coil of thorny, flowery briar, and nature is frequently pushed in
the direction of pure pattern.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that Burne-Jones did not depict the final scene,
where Sleeping Beauty is awakened by the Prince's kiss. That would
have been too definite for an artist who summed up his work with
the following statement, displayed at the beginning of this odd and
moving exhibition: ``I mean by a picture, a beautiful romantic
dream of something that never was, never will be, in a light better
than any light that ever shone, in a land no one can define or
remember _ only desire.'' &QL;

WHEN EXCESS WAS THE RULE IN VENICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many guests were caught off guard at the recent
opening of the Chinese Porcelain Company's exhibition of Venetian
glass, which continues through June 20 at its gallery at Park
Avenue and 58th Street. Interior designers like Albert Hadley were
hoping to find the sleek modern vases that Venini, Barovier and
other Venetian companies began to produce in the 1930s. Such wares,
designed by Carlo Scarpa, Gio Ponti and other renowned 20th-century
Italian architects, are now hotter than the Portofino sun.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery's regular Park Avenue clients were anticipating more
traditional Venetian glass: the pale, delicate goblets first
produced in the Renaissance, the glass of choice for European
rulers for 400 years (partly because it was thought to shatter if
poisoned liquid was poured in). Guests like Paul Soros and Daisy
Soros, Veronica Hearst, Beth Rudin DeWoody and Judy Peabody looked
for splendor: mosaic glass, millefiori (glass embodying slices of
varicolored rods that give it a flowery pattern) and chalcedony
(glass made to imitate ancient carved agate).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the gallery director, Khalil Rizk, surprised them with
an acid-green glass compote whose stem was a swirling duo of glass
dragons locked in combat, their open jaws revealing bright red
tongues, and a scallop-edged dish of opalescent blue whose handle
was a fanciful sea creature. Some of the other 90 pieces had swans,
serpents, seahorses, shells and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, these wares look like (and may be) souvenirs
our great-grandmothers hauled home from Venice a century ago. They
have charm, but as works of art they are difficult to take
seriously (each costs several thousand dollars).
</P>
<P>
   Rizk defended them. ``I have a soft spot for 19th-century
Venetian glass,'' he said. ``It's slightly kitschy, but I love it.
It's a very little-known period, and there's almost no literature
on it. The 1860s began the last explosion of handmade glass in
Venice. It's practically impossible to do these things now because
they would take too long and cost too much. Contemporary glass
doesn't have the virtuosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Mindel, a New York architect who collects 20th-century
Venetian glass, understands the appeal. ``Venice was always able to
articulate the design esthetic of the moment and turn it into
glass,'' he said. ``Glass is a wonderful idiom for expression,
especially in Venice, which features water and light. Venetian
glass represents water and filters light. That's what the medium is
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Porcelain Company is selling pieces belonging to
Marjorie Reed Gordon, a private New York dealer and collector of
Venetian glass. Her timing seems good. As Usha Subramaniam, the
head of 20th-century decorative arts at Phillips New York, said:
``Now that Venetian glass made after 1930 is getting more
expensive, collectors are looking at the earlier material, which is
just coming into its own. It will take a while for people to see
what's good and what's rare. At first, it all looks derivative of
past styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gordon's collection is featured in a new book by Sheldon
Barr, president of Gardner &AMP; Barr, a gallery at 213 East 60th St.
that specializes in vintage glass from Murano, an island off Venice
and the epicenter of the glassmaking industry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barr's book, ``Venetian Glass: Confections in Glass: 1855-1914''
(Harry N. Abrams), puts this unknown period into historical
perspective. It is easy to forget that Venice once nearly ceased
making glass. Napoleon helped bring about the near-halt in
production, which lasted six decades. In 1798, the year after
Venice surrendered, he handed the city over to Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeful Austria was determined to ruin the Venetian glass
industry in favor of her own Bohemian glass factories,'' Barr
writes. Austria put huge tariffs on both the import of raw
materials and the export of the glassware.
</P>
<P>
   Venice, he recounts, ``was forced to import sand from the
Fontainebleau quarries in France and wood from Dalmatia and
Istria.'' Barr adds: ``The Austrians taxed them all heavily and
made continued glass production profitless. Ultimately, the proud
Murano glass industry, once furnisher of fabulous glassware to
emperors, popes and kings, was reduced to producing glass beads for
Austria's colonial trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in the 1860s, after Venice became part of Italy, was the
glass industry fully revived, to provide work for the glassmakers
and cash for the Kingdom of Italy. The mayor of Murano and Antonio
Salviati, a Venetian lawyer, opened a museum of old Venetian glass
and started a design school. The old companies revived the
traditional antique-style glass.
</P>
<P>
   Then the craftsmen began to compete. ``The young glassmakers
started to experiment almost right away,'' said Barr, who is to
sign copies of his book at Sotheby's, 1334 York Ave., at 72d
Street, on Monday from 6 to 8 p.m. ``They were trying to outdo
their ancestors with new concoctions: exotic animals, dolphins,
dragons, seahorses, serpents _ nothing was too difficult,'' he
said, adding that they ``indulged their taste for
overembellishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest place to find vintage Venetian glass is in a
quarterly newsletter, ``Vetri: Italian Glass News,'' published in
Fort Lee, N.J., and at Gardner &AMP; Barr. Kenneth Lesko, a private
dealer in Rocky River, Ohio, has a booth devoted solely to Italian
glass at the Triple Pier Show in Manhattan. Michael Trapp, an
antiques dealer in West Cornwall, Conn., often has Venetian wares.
In Venice, Alessandro Zoppi sells fine (and expensive) examples at
his gallery, Antichita Cesana.
</P>
<P>
   Venetian glass was inspired by ancient Phoenician and Roman
glass. The Christie's antiquities sale on Friday includes a lot of
Roman glass. Most spectacular, perhaps, are a large, elegant
scallop shell in opaque green glass, circa fourth century A.D. and
estimated to sell for $3,000 to $4,000, and a five-inch Roman glass
beaker in the shape of a cone, with applied blue dots and carved
facets (estimate: $4,000 to $5,000).
</P>
<P>
   At Phillips New York, the 20th-century decorative arts sale on
Wednesday has Venetian glass from a top 20th-century company,
Venini, including blue-green striped pitchers and tumblers, and a
chandelier with clear glass arms (estimate: $8,000 to $12,000).
</P>
<P>
   Lot 377 is a 1989 prototype of a glass lamp by Frank Gehry, the
American architect. It is a sinuous cobra with translucent scales
illuminated from within.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Venice is producing a lot of muscular modern glass. A New
York architect, Adam Tihany, is one of the few commissioning
Venetian glassware that is as delicate, colorful and whimsical as
its 19th-century predecessors. When he designed the Manhattan
restaurant Remi, he installed his own collection of antique
Venetian glasses in the bar and commissioned rainbowlike
chandeliers from Carlo Moretti in Murano. For his latest
restaurant, Jean Georges, he ordered the candleholders in Venice.
``I like to work with the artisans there,'' he said. ``With that
kind of quality, why buy anywhere else?''

lowest-ranking members of his class to replace him at the podium at
commencement exercises. ``Why should I have to do more work and
give a speech?'' he planned on saying. ``I wasn't the one slacking
the last four years.'' School officials stopped him from giving the
speech. By Zeke MacCormack.

   EMILY-POST-STAMP-NYT (Undated) _ In her 1923 classic book
``Etiquette,'' Emily Post observed that ``older people invariably
feel that the younger generation is speeding swiftly on the road to
perdition.'' And so it is with stamps. Last week, the first
domestic image ever to appear on a stamp was unveiled, heralding
Emily Post's ``Etiquette.'' The stamp _ a 1920s place-setting with
Lafayette Towle silver, a goblet and hand-painted Copeland Spode
China plate _ is elegant and extremely proper. But beneath that
white damask tablecloth lurks a radical shift in the design and
subject matter of the United States postage stamp, from America's
calling card to adhesive pop icon. By Patricia Leigh-Brown.

   FRANCE-PASTRY-CHEF-NYT (Paris) _ Except for a few late-nighters
stumbling home, the Avenue des Champs-Elysees was eerily still. But
inside Laduree, a tea room, pastry shop and restaurant, everything
was astir. It was 6 in the morning, and Pierre Herme, the premier
pastry chef in Paris, was taking the first of many rounds through
the place. To the French, Herme has achieved the stature of the
legendary pastry chef Gaston Lenotre. And since last September he
has taken charge of one of Paris's most beloved tea salons and
pastry shops. By Amanda Hesser.

`KURT AND COURTNEY': A DEMIMONDE IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bleary, purple-faced, waving a fly swatter and his middle
finger, covered with tattoos and accompanied by a mean-tempered
dog, a man nicknamed El Duce lumbers over to Nick Broomfield
asking, ``Where's the booze?'' They have been introduced by a third
party identified as ``Divine Brown's pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   El Duce, whose night job is delivering ugly rants with a rock
band (the Mentors) while wearing an executioner's mask, claims to
have valuable information about Courtney Love's role in the death
of her husband. ``She offered me fifty grand to whack Kurt
Cobain,'' he says, talking tougher than he looks. He offers to
reveal more about this if Broomfield will buy him a beer.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield, whose last two films were ``Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood
Madam'' and ``Fetishes,'' is the ingratiating, kink-loving,
deceptively mild-mannered British filmmaker whose favorite
interview question seems to be ``Really?'' His handling of El Duce
is typically low-keyed. ``People might think you're not the most
reliable witness,'' he remarks in a whopping understatement. People
might also think, upon hearing later of El Duce's death, that his
demise shouldn't necessarily give rise to conspiracy theories. As
seen in Broomfield's documentary ``Kurt and Courtney,'' he looks
quite capable of having accidentally wandered in front of a train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt and Courtney'' is a prime, colorful example of
Broomfield's offbeat investigative tactic: burrowing into scuzz.
Meandering almost casually into his material, Broomfield cruises
through the Pacific Northwest searching for something, anything,
that will give his film a raison d'etre. Even when he delays in
finding it, his eye for the sordid demimonde helps him to assemble
a memorable group portrait of grunge parasites with Nirvana
connections. Everyone here has either a grievance to settle or a
story to sell. Broomfield himself doesn't have either until he
happens onto an unexpected benefactress: Courtney Love.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Ms. Love's extraordinary efforts to suppress this
film backfired into helpful publicity (it became the hottest
after-hours ticket at Sundance after official screenings had to be
canceled for legal reasons), the film itself had evolved into a
kind of ``Courtney and Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvanized by Ms. Love's stonewalling, Broomfield began to make
her the focus of much speculation. Ms. Love's long trail of enemies
leads all the way back to her father, Hank Harrison, who freely
suggests she was capable of dispatching her husband and recalls
telling teen-age Courtney ``that she couldn't smoke dope, do
heroin, turn tricks or bring any of her weird heroin buddies around
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Broomfield why, in effect, blood isn't any thicker than
water here, Harrison describes his feelings about family by asking:
``You saw `The War of the Roses?'''
</P>
<P>
   Never one to pass up trivia, Broomfield begins the film with
revelations like the sound of 2-year-old Kurt singing (as preserved
by his devoted aunt), the fact that an early girlfriend found
living with him ``fun'' and the detail that he used to enjoy firing
a BB gun at the Washington State Lottery office across the street
from his home.
</P>
<P>
   Slight as some of this is, it piles up, and its cumulative
effect is to draw the viewer into the film's determined digging.
And eventually, as the array of minor figures becomes so sordid
that El Duce fits in easily, ``Kurt and Courtney'' becomes nearly
as absorbing for the viewer as this odyssey must have become for
Broomfield.
</P>
<P>
   From the dazed, scabby so-called friend who supplied Cobain with
a gun to Ms. Love's embittered ex-boyfriend (they met cute when she
threw a drink in his face) to the private detective who sees a
James M. Cain plot in Ms. Love's rise to glamorous widowhood, the
speakers here are united by suspicion and malaise. They define the
Cobain-Love aura that is this film's real subject, just as
Broomfield's film about Heidi Fleiss explored the world that made
Ms. Fleiss possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Minghella!'' Ms. Love is heard exclaiming sweetly to the
director of ``The English Patient'' on Oscar night, in the midst of
reinventing herself as glossy Hollywood royalty. Just when it looks
as if the film will never get closer to her than that, Broomfield,
who becomes an active part of his own films, barges onto the stage
at an American Civil Liberties Union dinner where Ms. Love is
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Having included audiotapes of Ms. Love and Cobain threatening
writers in ``Kurt and Courtney,'' Broomfield denounces her publicly
and gives a final note of grandstanding to a film that otherwise
might have reached no real conclusion. Broomfield doesn't
ultimately prove, or even believe, that Cobain died under
incriminating circumstances. But he makes it wrenchingly clear why
the world in which he lived had become impossible to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt and Courtney'' was never a music documentary, but a
negligible sample of Cobain's music has been removed from the film
for legal reasons. Threats of lawsuits were also brought to bear
against the San Francisco theater that showed the film.
Broomfield's financial backing from Showtime was apparently
withdrawn because of external pressures. The film opens today at
Cinema Village. It is _ and is well worth _ a trip.

`THE TRUMAN SHOW': SO, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   trumania (troo-MAY-nee-uh) n. 1. obsessive national interest in
the surreal ordinariness of Truman Burbank, as spurred by the
30-year television show chronicling his every move. Manifested by a
willingness to find the most nondescript of Truman's experiences
more poignant and meaningful than one's own. Truman bars, T-shirts,
baseball caps, greatest hits videotape and sleeping scenes indicate
the rare depths of media madness behind this fascination. 2. An
imaginary planet, playfully named by Truman Burbank. 3. Euphoric
reception afforded to ``The Truman Show'' as an earthshaking
millennial event arriving on movie screens. Peter Weir's must-see
new film is guaranteed Oscar bait and delectably clever
entertainment, but hosannas and cartwheels are over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's instantly iconic performance as the sweet,
unsuspecting Truman will give his career deserved new impetus, but
the real star of ``The Truman Show'' is its premise.
</P>
<P>
   What if our taste for trivia and voyeurism led to the purgatory
of a whole life lived as show-biz illusion? What if that life
became not only the ultimate paranoid fantasy but also achieved
pulse-quickening heights of narcissism?
</P>
<P>
   As Truman Burbank is astonished to discover, he lives in a world
where he is the main attraction and every other living creature,
man, woman or dog, exists only as a walk-on. Keeping Truman happily
duped is all they're there for. Nothing matters more than Truman
within the pathologically cheery confines of Truman's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' has an inspired screenplay by Andrew Niccol,
whose own ``Gattaca'' had the same transfixing sci-fi intensity.
Each shows a man living a phenomenally intricate lie. (The hero of
``Gattaca'' conceals his genetic makeup.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Truman Show'' unfolds on a much grander scale. The
sparklingly antiseptic island community called Seahaven (actually
Seaside, Fla.) is part of a huge stage set. It encompasses sun,
moon, forest, ocean, bridge and about 5,000 hidden cameras that
follow Truman everywhere he goes.
</P>
<P>
   Product plugs are everywhere, since they account for the
revenues of the wildly popular ``Truman Burbank Show.'' So the same
elderly twins edge Truman up against an advertising billboard every
morning as he heads to his desk job (where there's a tiny camera
hidden inside his pencil sharpener).
</P>
<P>
   He drives to work (in a car with concealed dashboard camera)
after waving merrily to his neighbors, who live in one of
Seahaven's architecturally tidy, strenuously pleasant dwellings.
Truman himself lives in a houseful of dimples with his too-perfect
wife Meryl (Laura Linney), who coyly drops the brand names of cocoa
and lawn mowers. She can exclaim ``I made macaroni!'' in fiendishly
ecstatic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Weir, known for the thoughtfulness and idiosyncrasy of his films
and for guiding stellar actors into some of their best work, must
handle the tricky job of gradually poking holes in this deception
with optimum timing. What should the audience know about Truman's
situation, and when should the audience know it?
</P>
<P>
   As the curtain begins to rise on the lies in Truman's life,
nagging little inconsistencies abound (some shots look as though
they came from Seahaven's oddly placed cameras; many don't), but by
and large the film is extremely witty in its ways of blowing the
television show's cover.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Truman is puzzled by a piece of lighting equipment
that falls from the sky. Later, he is sprinkled by his own little
rainstorm. And when Truman moves, the stage rainstorm moves, too.
</P>
<P>
   The film supposes that suddenly, for the first time in 30 years,
Truman is beginning to notice something amiss. The apparent reason
is the party-crashing appearance of the actor who posed as his
father, and who was supposedly lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to that trauma, Truman has been inculcated with a fear of
water to keep him from leaving Seahaven. (Posters at Seahaven's
travel agency raise the prospects of terrorists, disease, wild
animals and airplanes struck by lightning. As a young schoolboy, in
one of the film's wiliest little touches, he is heard exclaiming,
``I'd like to be an explorer like the great Magellan!'' Then a
teacher chimes in hastily: ``Oh! You're too late! There's nothing
left to explore!'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Truman's ersatz father turns up looking like a derelict in the
middle of Seahaven, where everyone else resembles a wholesome extra
in a 1950s situation comedy. But no one notices him until Truman
does, because these actors have no idea how to react spontaneously
when a crisis occurs.
</P>
<P>
   They take all their marching orders from Christof (Ed Harris),
the ``televisionary'' who created Truman and his show and quite
literally presides from on high. Harris plays this pivotal role
with a sinister, laid-back authority that amounts to the film's
most satirical aspect, since it so easily links divinity with hip,
media-savvy grandiosity. (``Cue the sun!'') That would have been
clear even if Christof had been given a less rib-nudging name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show,'' which tells such an engrossing story that
it amounts to the best virtual beach book of the season, draws its
suspense from Truman's rising disillusionment and anger. That truly
makes Carrey the ideal actor for the role, since his beaming
affability so often conveys an edge of secret fury.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, affecting and refreshingly shtickless, he occupies center
stage here through sheer, beguiling force of personality. And
Carrey is charismatic enough to make Trumania a nearly plausible
conceit. He intensifies ordinary emotions so powerfully that
perhaps this guy's Warholian 15 minutes, on a television show of
halfway satirical blandness, could have lasted 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the public fascination with Truman Burbank, like the horizon
around Seahaven, doesn't quite lead anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented;
it's as simple as that,'' intones Christof. The story's central
notions really are that simple, and in the end they're too slender
to sustain a film as ambitious as this.
</P>
<P>
   Once its premise is set forth, ready-made for easy
pontification, ``The Truman Show'' doesn't go on to echo the
prophetic intuitiveness of ``Network'' or even send up the lurid
voyeurism of popular culture today. The latter part of the film,
depicting Truman's rebellion and providing him with a perfect final
line, is much more conventionally conceived than its splendid
start.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Ms. Linney, whose dazzling domestic falseness is one of
the film's most resonant ingredients, the major players around
Truman include radiant Natascha McElhone as the sweetheart who got
away (under suitably bizarre circumstances), Holland Taylor as
Truman's actressy mother and Noah Emmerich as the best friend who
shows up to deliver product plugs for a certain brand of beer.
Peter Biziou's cinematography envelops all of them in bright color
and flawlessly unnatural scenery.
</P>
<P>
   In a film with a setting that becomes a character in its own
right, the little delights of Seahaven are everywhere, from fashion
sense a la Norman Rockwell to the ``It's a Wonderful Life'' clone
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderfully dishonest-looking extras are everywhere, like the
driver who can't drive when Truman tries to leave town on a Chicago
bus. Conspicuously included among the passengers are _ but of
course _ a soldier and two nuns.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).
It includes mild profanity and fleeting violence. Older children
bred on television should enjoy it as both clever gamesmanship and
food for thought.

&HT;        NUCLEAR WASTE BILL DEAD: GINGRICH
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston and Dave Williams  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 2 -- A bill calling for construction of an
interim storage site for high-level nuclear waste in the Nevada
desert is dead for this year, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, R-Ga., released a statement late Tuesday afternoon, as
Nevada's two senators argued passionately on the Senate floor
against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I strongly support a legislative resolution to the
nuclear waste issue, it is unlikely that such a bill will make it
past the president's veto to become law this year,'' Gingrich said.
``Because of the crowded calendar and the strong opposition of some
members, I do not expect to schedule floor action this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Ensign, R-Nev., told reporters Monday that he had
received confirmation from Gingrich that the bill was dead.
However, the speaker did not comment publicly on the issue until
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with his colleague, (Rep.) Jim Gibbons, (R-Nev.), John
Ensign has been a forceful and effective voice for the citizens of
Nevada in opposing the nuclear waste bill,'' Gingrich said.

   Old (but Gold) And Slapstick
</P>
<P>
   For a look at the month ahead in video, one person to consult is
Bob Helland of Asymmetrical Entertainment, a Brooklyn mail-order
company that previews coming releases in its monthly bulletin. June
looks moderately promising. While not particularly rich in big
feature films _ ``Amistad,'' ``Wag the Dog,'' ``Welcome to
Sarajevo'' and ``Wings of the Dove'' are among the better-know
titles scheduled _ the month has several older films that people
have been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   From Home Vision come ``Forever and a Day'' (1943), with a huge
British cast including Charles Laughton, Merle Oberon and Claude
Rains, and ``Spitfire'' (1942), Leslie Howard's last film before he
was killed when the plane he was aboard was shot down by the Nazis
in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Helland also recommends ``The Slapstick Encyclopedia'' from
Kino. ``All good stuff that's never been out before, a lot of Fatty
Arbuckle and Buster Keaton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of June's old movies come in series. ``The best things are
the Universals,'' he said, a reference to three sets of old movies
_ literary adaptations, comedies and Westerns _ from Universal.
Perhaps the most awaited is ``All My Sons'' (1948). A television
version of the Arthur Miller play has been available on tape but
never the Irving Reis film starring Burt Lancaster and Edward G.
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``The Great Gatsby'' (1949), with Alan Ladd and
Betty Field as Daisy Buchanan, the earlier of two movies based on
the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. ``It's not a great film, but Field
is really fine,'' Helland said.
</P>
<P>
   The most important comedy is ``The Major and the Minor'' (1942),
which starred Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland and was Billy Wilder's
first feature film, and there are two notable Westerns, ``Man in
the Shadow'' (1957) and ``Canyon Passage'' (1946).
</P>
<P>
   `` `Man in the Shadow' only because it has a long, offbeat
performance by Orson Welles,'' Helland said, ``and `Canyon Passage'
because there are a lot of Susan Hayward fans out and because of
the Hoagy Carmichael song `Ole Buttermilk Sky.''' Helland doesn't
have time to discuss all the releases with everybody, but he will
mail you the catalog. Information: (718) 237-6031.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting and Dicing
</P>
<P>
   Mail order catalogs are ordinarily drab or drabber, so it's a
pleasure, almost a shock, to open ``The Movie Lovers Video Guide''
from Facets Multimedia, a large Chicago distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with ``33 Directors to Watch'' (Arnaud Desplechin,
Mike Leigh, Emir Kusturica, Peter Greenaway), the catalog makes a
striking case for itself by shuffling thousands of Facets listings
into scores of categories: 50 silent masterpieces, 25 Shakespeare
plays on video, 100 best British television titles, 25 films about
the Holocaust, 100 cult classics, 100 best horror stories, 100
films that fell through the cracks (like ``Gas Food Lodging,''
``Danzon,'' ``Big Night'' and other acclaimed films that never
found large theatrical audiences), 25 great cultural documentaries,
25 best dance videos, 50 top theater adaptations, five best Samurai
epics. And so on. Information: (800) 331-6197.

   The End of Violence
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Wim Wenders' darkly paranoid film, the bullying
action-movie mogul Mike Max (Bill Pullman) watches his empire fly
off the tracks for reasons he doesn't understand. First, a 400-page
document about a top-secret government surveillance project lands
in his e-mail, source unknown. Next he is kidnapped and about to be
executed when his abductors are killed instead. Mike wakes up in a
flower bed tended by Chicano gardeners who keep him housed and fed
while he tries to figure out what has happened to him. That has to
do with a satellite communications expert named Ray (Gabriel
Byrne), who holes up in a hilltop observatory and monitors the
streets of Los Angeles on dozens of video screens.
</P>
<P>
   How these pieces connect make a story, Stephen Holden wrote in
The New York Times, that ``artfully crunches together more
intriguing speculation about technology, communications and the
effects of mass media than a hundred science-fiction fantasies.'' &QL;

   Afterglow
</P>
<P>
   With the passion long drained from their marriage, the
middle-aged Phyllis (Julie Christie, in a performance that earned
her an Academy Award nomination) and Lucky (Nick Nolte), her
philandering husband, have settled into a workable understanding
with each other. Phyllis tolerates and even encourages Lucky's
affairs while he is patiently and supportively versed in the
moodiness that sends her to the doctor in search of physical
answers to her psychic anxieties. Allen Rudolph's film eventually
turns silly, but he ``writes and directs with obvious affection for
his characters and with a deep knowledge of whatever it is that
makes them tick'' (Janet Maslin).
</P>

<P>
   Scream 2
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back that blood-drenched gang from Wes Craven's slick,
funny 1996 slasher film about a pair of masked nutcases who slice
up much of the teen-age population of a leafy Midwestern town. This
time, the victims have moved on to Windsor College, but they're
just as dumb about setting themselves up to get their throats cut
or tossed off sorority house balconies. Sidney Prescott (Neve
Campbell) hangs in there once more as a plucky heroine. Gale
Weathers (Courteney Cox) has graduated from pushy television
reporter to best-selling author, but she's still relentlessly after
the story. And the ``Scream'' resident geeks, Randy and Dewey
(Jamie Kennedy and David Arquette), again offer up their bodies in
a film ``with so much tongue-in-cheek trickery that it virtually
escapes the horror genre, the one it so happily lampoons''
(Maslin).

   1997. Dimension. $107.11. Laser disk, $39.99. 120 minutes.

   WASHINGTON, June 4 -- Rarely do Democrats and Republicans agree
how to solve homelessness, but this weekend three Miami House
members will cast aside partisan differences to attack the problem
head on.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with hammers and nails, GOP Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen will join Democratic Rep. Carrie Meek to build
a Habitat for Humanity home Saturday in Liberty City. A new 12-home
Habitat development will go up near 14 Habitat homes built with the
aid of former President Jimmy Carter in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The new homes will help address a lack of affordable housing in
Dade County, Diaz-Balart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an issue that transcends politics and partisanship,'' he
said. ``I think it is really important for (lawmakers) to work on a
bipartisan basis solving problems like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami lawmakers are joining their Washington colleagues in a
nationwide congressional blitz-building campaign dubbed ``The
Houses That Congress Built'' to coincide with the first day of
National Home Ownership Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Habitat) and others like it in Dade County are making the
American dream of home ownership a powerful reality for people who
otherwise wouldn't have a chance,'' Meek said.
</P>
<P>
   The representatives will work alongside local volunteers to
build a three-bedroom one-bathroom home for 49-year-old Mozell
Adams. The Eastern Credit Financial Union employee will share the
home with her 28-year-old daughter, Tonnika, and three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Green, spokeswoman for the Greater Miami chapter of
Habitat, said the local affiliate will build 50 homes throughout
Dade this year, including 11 more in Liberty City. Since 1989, the
local Habitat chapter has built 250 homes in Dade.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 342 House members have pledged to build a Habitat
home in their congressional districts, including Rep. Jerry Lewis,
R-Calif. Lewis, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee
that focuses on housing issues, said he conceived the idea of
involving his House colleagues in a Habitat project while swimming
laps in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the great thing about this project is that it is kind
of a response that symbolizes all of our responsibilities to
govern,'' Lewis said. ``It takes us way beyond any partisan
consideration. That is what governing is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who has been involved with
Habitat since 1994, will dedicate the fifth Habitat home in his
suburban district north of Atlanta on Saturday. In all, Gingrich
has helped to build 10 Habitat homes across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker predicts as the program continues to grow, it will
become ``routine for elected leaders to return to help build homes
for needy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the vision of our country that I believe in -- the
vision that (Alexis de) Tocqueville laid out in `Democracy in
America' -- where a citizen legislature comes home from Washington
to solve problems, rather than the other way around,'' Gingrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., joined Lewis, Gingrich and 30 other
lawmakers to build the first two ``Houses That Congress Built'' in
the nation's capital last year. Kennedy said it is becoming more
important for traditional social programs to rely on nonprofit
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Congress reduces its financial commitment to affordable
housing, we must increasingly rely on volunteers and nonprofit
groups to fill the gap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat founder Millard Fuller will be in Nashville on Friday to
help Rep. Bob Clement, D-Tenn., and the local Habitat chapter try
to complete construction of a house in five hours and 30 minutes,
which would break the current record by 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller said lawmakers who volunteer with Habitat For Humanity
get a better understanding of how the poor live, and this knowledge
is important when it comes time for them to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They become personally acquainted with these families,''
Fuller said. ``It is helpful to these policymakers to meet face to
face with these low-income families so that it will become a
personal matter with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The average Habitat home in the United States has three
bedrooms, one bath and costs $38,000. Families are selected by
their level of need, willingness to become partners in the program
and ability to repay the interest-free loan to build the house.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat has chapters in 59 countries and has built 65,000 homes
around the world since 1976.

MARTIN WONG ART REVIEW: PAVING THE STREETS WITH POETRY AND DESIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The flowering of art in the East Village in the
mid-1980s was brief and uneven, but rich. Graffiti came in off the
street, bringing black and Latino artists into galleries.
Expressionist painting and conceptualism shared the field. An
explicitly gay art emerged in the work of figures like Arch
Connelly, Keith Haring, Nicholas Moufarrege and David Wojnarnowicz.
Political content was everywhere, as was the theme of childhood
innocence _ and experience _ that has played so important a role in
1990s art.
</P>
<P>
   Among the distinctive figures in that eclectic environment was
the Chinese-American artist Martin Wong. He was aligned with no
movement and espoused no particular style. But the paintings he
produced on the Lower East Side were, with their blend of visionary
symbolism, surrealist humor, romantic desire and popular culture,
emblematic of a volatile place and time.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen of those paintings are included in ``Sweet Oblivion:
The Urban Landscape of Martin Wong'' at the New Museum in Soho. A
compact retrospective organized by Dan Cameron, senior curator of
the museum, and Barry Blinderman, director of the University
Galleries of Illinois State University, it covers nearly two
decades of the artist's career, beginning with his arrival in New
York from San Francisco in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He was 32 at the time, and although he had been a painter _
entirely self-taught _ for only two years, his background in art
was multifaceted. He had studied ceramics in college. And,
thoroughly immersed in the chemical, sexual and spiritual
liberations of the 1960s, he had been a member of the legendary,
mystically oriented gay street performance troupe in San Francisco
known as the Angels of Light.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, he settled on a painting style that was instantly
recognizable as his own. His primary images were the decaying
tenements of the Lower East Side, which he depicted as looming
monumental structures like temples or mausoleums, each brick of
their facades painstakingly delineated. Then he softened and
transformed his claustrophobic urban landscapes with poetic
details.
</P>
<P>
   The boarded-up windows in his buildings were covered with
light-catching gold pigment. Streets and lots have an air of
postnuclear desolation, but the skies, painted black or orange-red,
as if flushed with the glow of conflagrations, are vibrant with
activity. Glittering constellations rise over the city in some
paintings, hand-written poems in English and Spanish in others. And
in the show's title work, ``Sweet Oblivion'' (1983), gilt-edged
hands, spelling out messages in signage for the hearing-impaired,
float like heavenly hosts on high.
</P>
<P>
   In many of these works, the human figure is absent, or present
only by implication. Such is the case in one of Wong's best-known
pieces, ``Attorney Street: Handball Court with Autobiographical
Poem by Pinero'' (1982-84), in which architecture, poetry and
traces of human activity are brought together in compositional
layering of airless, puzzlelike complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The handball court wall at the center of the picture is a
painting-within-the-painting, covered with the eye-popping graffiti
rendered in miniature. It is backed by a row of symmetrical
buildings, flanked on either side by receding chain-link fences,
and enclosed within a double frame of trompe l'oeil brick and wood.
Within the painting, a narrow band of sky is inscribed with a poem
by the Puerto Rican-born writer Miguel Pinero (1943-1988), who was
Wong's lover and muse at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Pinero appears, sometimes in person, more often in spirit,
through these paintings, perhaps most memorably in ``The
Annunciation According to Mikey Pinero (Cupcake and Paco)'' from
1984. Here Wong adapts the scene of a homosexual encounter from the
writer's Pulitzer Prize-winning prison play ``Short Eyes,'' and
renders it as a Renaissance-style Annunciation, all in fleecy,
cloudlike white and gray except for the warm brown of the
protagonist's bare skin.
</P>
<P>
   The near-religious charge of this tenderly erotic image is felt
elsewhere as well. It is there in a boxing-match cast as a Pieta in
``Down for the Count'' (1985), and in a tableau of two helmeted
firefighters kissing like dark-winged angels under a rainbow-hued
wall in ``Big Heat'' (1988). And it assumes a kind of disembodied,
sacramental weight in ``Iglesia Pentecostal'' (1986), a life-size
painting of the door of a storefront church set, like the entrance
to a sepulcher, behind a metal security grate.
</P>
<P>
   When Pinero died in 1988, a phase of Wong's work began to wind
down, though the last of the Lower East Side paintings in this
exhibition seem to be far more concerned with renewal than with
despair.
</P>
<P>
   In ``La Vida,'' the tenement windows are filled with people,
carefully individualized portraits of firefighters, neighborhood
children, lovers, the graffiti artists Daze, Lee and LA2 ( Wong had
amassed a notable collection of their work by this time), and
dozens of other friends and neighbors, living and dead. Only the
fact that all the street-level doors to the building are cemented
shut reveals this block party fiesta is a dream, a thing wished
for, maybe even believed in, but not real.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Wong's art decisively changed course in a series of
works that take his Chinese-American heritage as its subject. His
interest in traditional Chinese painting had always been strong.
(Anyone visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art bookstore when he
worked as a part-time clerk there in the 1980s could draw on his
vast literacy in the field.) And it has been subtly evident in his
work all along.
</P>
<P>
   One sees it reflected in his repeated use of texts in his
paintings, which he regarded as equivalents of colophons on
landscape scrolls. And it is discernible in instances of
near-calligraphic brushwork, as in the gracefully rendered left
foot of the kneeling figure in the ``Annunciation,'' a fleet
passage of linear play that also suggests the improvisational
fluidity of comic book graphics and graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Chinatown paintings, far from drawing on classical
sources, are highly polished modern pop images, half realistic,
half fantastic. They are drawn in part from the artist's childhood
memories of life in San Francisco, but also from the backlot
exoticisms of Hollywood films and from the gift-shop novelties that
Wong has avidly collected for years.
</P>
<P>
   This being so, it is no surprise that his depiction of Mei
Lang-Fang, the Chinese opera star famed as a female-impersonator,
takes the form of decorative calendar art. Or that Bruce Lee
appears in the Daoist afterworld beset by grimacing villains and
psychedelic dragons a la Kenny Scharf. Or that the reclining femme
fatale in ``Ms. Chinatown'' is both a portrait of a real person
(the artist's aunt Nora, who worked in a Chinatown nightclub) and
an evocation of the opium-den mysteries associated with the 1940s
actress Anna May Wong.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Chinatown in Wong's version is, as he has himself
acknowledged, ``a tourist idea, an outsider's view,'' with the mix
of affection, fascination and fantasy that such distance implies.
And one might say the same of his Lower East Side, that
romanticized inner-city El Dorado where poverty is glossed over and
desire hangs like a ceaseless throb of music in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York paintings from the 1980s, which are his
strongest and most original works, have a visual grit and
metaphorical suggestiveness that the Chinatown paintings lack. In
these images, the alchemical mix of Ashcan School realism, Pop
insouciance and folk-art mysticism is perfectly judged; the
everyday world is precious, and the otherworldly close at hand. And
an art that emerged from a distinctive cultural moment remains
stirringly evocative and beyond fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Oblivion: The Urban Landscapes of Martin Wong'' remains
at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince
Street, Soho, through Sept. 13.

   POTTSVILLE, Pa. _ For a fleeting moment, you are Julian English
and the road is yours, roaring in a sleek Caddie through scenic
highways of fact and fiction, past coal patch taverns and slatty
wood houses, gin cocktail parties and country clubs vibrating to
the tunes of Tommy Lake's Royal Collegians.
</P>
<P>
   The terrain is Schuylkill County, the shovel-shaped anthracite
coal region of eastern Pennsylvania, which is barely disguised in
the plentiful short stories and novels of John O'Hara, a
hard-drinking and cultivated son of Pottsville.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara first imagined his ``Pennsylvania protectorate,'' as he
called it, from his retreat at the Pickwick Arms Hotel in New York
in 1933. Typing on a new portable typewriter with an all-black
ribbon, he created a parallel world in ``Appointment in Samarra,''
with its fictional county of Latenengo populated by the fashionable
young married set of the whirling 1920s and a doomed small-town
aristocrat named Julian English who ended his life in a sealed
garage with his Cadillac running.
</P>
<P>
   Known locally as ``the region,'' Schuylkill County lost its
properous sheen of wealth with the decline, beginning in the 1940s,
of the coal industry. Yet the territory remains a literary retreat;
its melancholy history and early 19th-century architecture are
still fresh characters in one of America's enduring examples of the
``locale a clef.''
</P>
<P>
   The term is Matthew J. Bruccoli's whimsical description of vivid
fictional settings with tap roots in reality, like William
Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha (Lafayette County, Miss.) Thomas Wolfe's
Altamont (Ashville, N.C.) or Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg (Clyde,
Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving around Schuylkill County, I had a shock of
recognition,'' said Bruccoli, O'Hara's biographer and an English
professor at the University of South Carolina. ``John O'Hara had
not just mastered the details, but had managed to get everything
right. He had done it in such a way that for people reading about
his communities 60 years later, to make it possible for them to
have not just an understanding, but a feeling for place.''
</P>
<P>
   With its grand mansions ascending the hills of Mahantongo
Street, Pottsville is the muse for O'Hara's fictional community,
Gibbsville, Pa., featured in two other novels and many of the short
stories. So were the surrounding Schuylkill towns that he
rechristened with names like Swedish Haven, Mountain City and
Taqua.
</P>
<P>
   His renderings in fiction were so precise that descriptions of
each mythical town has a geographical twin on a map of Schuylkill
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what fact you want to check out: it's there
and he's telling you the truth about something and it wasn't just
fiction,'' said Pamela MacArthur, a Canadian who has been
meticulously exploring his descriptions for her doctoral thesis at
the University of Sussex in England.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. MacArthur said she had checked his references, from a
description of the Lenape Indians to the style of a particular
fence, and detected no flaws. ``When he was being interviewed, he
would say it's the novelist's idea, but when you come down to it,
it was fact,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest son of an affluent local surgeon, O'Hara was born
here in 1905. He worked for two years as a reporter on The
Pottsville Journal. In 1928 he left the area for a reporting job in
New York. There, he began writing the first of his torrent of short
stories that eventually totaled more than 400. ``Appointment in
Samarra,'' his first book, earned him success, notoriety and 10th
place on the Publishers Weekly best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara, who died in 1970, went on to write 13 more novels, most
set outside The Region. Films were made of such works as
``Butterfield 8,'' ``Ten North Frederick,'' ``From the Terrace''
and ``A Rage to Live.'' ``Pal Joey'' became a Broadway musical and
Hollywood film, starring Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   The author's hometown, Pottsville, is the economic hub of
Schuylkill County. A city of 16,000 people, it is dominated at its
crest by an 18th-century stone courthouse and jail fortress, where
six Irish Catholic ``Molly Maguire'' miners convicted of murdering
a constable and a mine boss were hanged on June 21, 1877, a
Thursday known as ``The Day of the Rope.''
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that Molly Maguire was an Irish widow unjustly
evicted from her home, inspiring an anti-landlord movement in the
early 19th century in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Irish miners here adopted the name in tribute to those rebels,
and were themselves caught up in violent tensions that pitted
miners against mining bosses, Catholics against Protestants, and
Irish against Welsh, English, Scottish and German immigrant
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The local county historical society at 14 North 3d Street still
houses the original Molly Maguires trial transcripts, dated
newspaper clippings and even hanks of the ropes that were used to
hang the men. But I confess that my husband and I were drawn to a
more unconventional museum, the imposing brick headquarters of
Yuengling Brewery, with its vivid blue-and-white stained glass
ceiling and a dark wooden bar where beer samples are served in
plastic cups. Through good times it has supplied the local
citizenry with local ales and during Prohibition with watered-down
.05 percent alcohol brews labeled ``near beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1829 by a German immigrant, the brewery remains in
Yuengling family hands, offering weekday tours and sample tastings
of its stout Porter and Lord Chesterfield ale.
</P>
<P>
   Just footsteps from the brewery is the graceful three-story
Victorian townhouse at 606 Mahantongo, where O'Hara spent 12 years
of his boyhood and young adult life. A prominent iron plaque marks
the home, painted in gray-and-burgundy trim, but there are no tours
of the interior because the house has been carved into apartments.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, it doesn't take much to transport a dedicated reader from
Mahantongo to its fictional double, Lantenengo Street, a gracious
neighborhood of the coal town upper crust that produced its most
eligible brides. Across the street from O'Hara's home are the grand
white pillars of the Braun School of Music. And rising up the hill
are gingerbread Victorians with spacious porches and the Tudor
Jacobean Revival mansion that housed three generations of Yuengling
brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Schuylkill County has always been a rather uneasy host to
O'Hara's legacy. Today it is more likely to celebrate the memory of
the rebellious immigrant Irish miners, who challenged their
powerful mining bosses, rather than O'Hara, who challenged the
pretensions of the indulgent country club set.
</P>
<P>
   He described that group in ``Appointment in Samarra'' as ``the
spenders and drinkers and socially secure, who could thumb their
noses and not have to answer to anyone except their families.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara's literature is rarely used as a teaching tool in the
region, said Mark T. Major, a local historian and the executive
director of the Schuylkill County's visitors bureau who said, ``The
Molly Maguires just seem more exciting, while John O'Hara isn't as
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Excitement here is also the Pennsylvania Dutch Folk Festival,
this year from June 26 through July 5, or the Molly Maguires
weekend, from June 19 through 21. That event will feature a concert
of the Irish Lads; a dramatic reading of the last words of the
condemned men hanged in Pottsville, and a walking tour of Mahanoy
City, in the footsteps of Irish and native firefighters who rioted
in 1834.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we re-enact the murder of a Tamaqua policeman that led
to the hanging of five Irish, but people were getting tired of
it,'' Major added regretfully.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you don't need a formal festival to celebrate John O'Hara
country when you can sample the sweetness of a peanut butter roll
just like the ones the author savored in his youth. At Mootz
Candies on South Centre Street in Pottsville, the third generation
of the Mootz family is still stirring up coconut creams,
porcupines, pink meltaways and black diamond coal candy licorice
that comes with its own coal bin.
</P>
<P>
   We made our own homage to O'Hara by roaming through Schuylkill
County in search of abandoned coal breakers and O'Hara-vintage
country clubs where perhaps the throbbing urge of Gershwin music
could still evoke the sensations of ``a tea dance at the club and a
girl in a long black satin dress,'' as he wrote in ``Imagine
Kissing Pete,'' a short story published in The New Yorker in the
late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lakeside Ballroom in Barnesville _ a country club where
O'Hara's characters did indeed toss down rye cocktails _ the
orchestra wasn't vibrating with Gershwin tunes. But we did stumble
into a ``Polka Blast'' in full explosion with members of the Polka
Family band serenading the Coal Crackers Polka Association below a
deep blue simulated sky and a whirling mirrored ball.
</P>
<P>
   After a vigorous polka workout, we retreated to the refuge of
Mahanoy City, a small town that was once home to an old German
brewery that produced Kaier's beer and, of course, the fireman's
riot. The brewery has long since closed, but the Victorian mansion
built and inhabited by Charles D. Kaier and his heirs is now an
opulent bed and breakfast with parquet floors, marble fireplaces,
chestnut wainscotting and 12-foot-high ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   The beer baron's mansion is within easy touring distance of
several museums that dwell on the region's coal-mining past. In
Ashland, visitors to Pioneer Tunnel can take an underground tour of
a horizontal drift mine that runs 1,800 feet into the side of
Mahanoy Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   And about a half-hour drive from Mahanoy City, in neighboring
Carbon County, is Eckley Miners' Village, a 19th-century coal
patch, or company town. Eckley's wooden houses have been preserved
by the state and were featured in the 1969 movie ``The Molly
Maguires,'' with Sean Connery and Richard Harris.
</P>
<P>
   During most of our journey, we found ourselves simply touring
the map of O'Hara's Pennsylvania protectorate, although at a much
more leisurely speed than the author's character, Julian English,
who drove as if he really did own the road.
</P>
<P>
   We passed through Cressona and Pine Grove, Tamaqua and
Frackville, each with a matching literary double in the pages of
O'Hara's literature. We traveled with a library copy of
``Gibbsville, Pa.'' and ``Appointment in Samarra,'' the latter a
Modern Library edition with yellowing pages and delicate text
bookmarked at a literary guarantee from O'Hara: ``How much of this
novel is all true? It's all true, a rather pompous remark that
needs extending.'' &QL;

CHANGES ON THE CALIFORNIA ART SCENE

   Left Their Art In San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   Even before the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's $63 million
building was completed three years ago, the trustees had been
determined to fill it with world-class art, the kind that is not
only hard to find but hugely expensive. And over the past few
years, they have consistently bought works, either at auction, from
dealers or directly from artists, in ever larger numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This week, museum officials announced that several trustees have
given the institution 23 works by prominent 20th-century artists.
The gift, which includes works by Robert Rauschenberg, Piet
Mondrian, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Robert Motherwell and
Barnett Newman, is valued at $40 million. One of the most important
portions of the gift is a group of 14 Rauschenbergs that have come
directly from the artist's collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is the single-largest commitment any museum
has made to a living artist,'' said David Ross, the peripatetic new
director of the museum, who assumed his post on Monday after seven
years as director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. ``I've had
a reasonable amount to do with this gift. Ever since I signed on
here, I started working. I disassociated myself from the Whitney in
March.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the trustees responsible for the donation wish to
remain anonymous, one who doesn't mind being known is Phyllis
Wattis, a longtime philanthropist supporting cultural organizations
in the Bay Area, including the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Garrels, the museum's chief curator of painting and
sculpture, said the gifts helped fulfill a wish list drawn up some
time ago by the museum's curators. They not only wanted to fill
gaps in the collection, they also wanted to acquire the works of
certain artists in depth.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 Rauschenbergs substantially enlarge and diversify the
museum's holdings of the artist's work. They include paintings,
drawings, photography, sculpture and his mixed-media ``combines,''
a form he invented in the early 1950s. Especially noteworthy is the
artist's famous ``Erased de Kooning Drawing, 1953'' a predecessor
of conceptual art that the title accurately describes. It is an
original drawing that the Abstract Expressionist gave Rauschenberg
with the full knowledge of his intention.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Rauschenbergs are in the artist's retrospective that
opened at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City in
September and that will travel through Europe until February 1999.
They will arrive in San Francisco next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Mondrian is represented by a major work, ``Composition III
(White-Yellow),'' which the artist made from 1935-1942. The
painting was bought from the Pace Wildenstein Gallery in Manhattan
and had been in the respected collection belonging to Burton and
Emily Tremaine, who are Manhattan collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The museum acquired Duchamp's famous urinal, called
``Fountain.'' This edition of the 1917 work was made in 1964 for
Arturo Schwartz, an Italian scholar, dealer and collector, and is
the first of the artist's ``ready-mades,'' his term for
pre-existing objects that he designated as works of art, to join
the collection.
</P>
<P>
   An important Robert Motherwell is part of the gift. ``Elegy to
the Spanish Republic, No. 57,'' from 1957-1960, comes from one of
his best-known series, in which he explored the destruction of
Spanish democracy. It is a large painting, 84 inches by 109 inches,
with vertical bands and oval shapes in black and white. The museum
``gave Motherwell his first one-person museum show, in 1946,''
Garrels said. ``This painting has been on loan to us since 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Another gift is ``Zim Zum I,'' a 1969 sculpture by the American
Abstract Expressionist Barnett Newman. It came from Annalee Newman,
his widow, and had been on long-term loan to the Tate Gallery in
London. It joins two Newman paintings in the San Francisco museum:
``Untitled (Number 3),'' a 1949 gift from Mrs. Newman, and
``Untitled,'' given to it in 1970 by Ms. Wattis.
</P>
<P>
   Works by other artists in the gift include a major 1960s
painting by Brice Marden, a Giocometti bust, a sculpture by Louise
Bourgeois, an Anselm Kiefer painting and a landscape by Wayne
Thiebaud.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Lore
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco isn't the only city on the West Coast with
passionate supporters of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Peter and Eileen Norton, whose contemporary-art
collection numbers about 1,600 works, have just bought another
major collection, that of Karen and Clyde Beswick. The purchase
merges two of this country's largest private collections of
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction cost the Nortons a reported $1.5 million and was
handled by Regen Projects, a West Hollywood gallery. It includes
about 700 works, primarily from the 1980s and 1990s, predominately
by Southern California artists.
</P>
<P>
   The Beswick collection had been tied up in court since March
1997, when Beswick was convicted of embezzling money from Brody
Smythe Direct, a Pasadena-based direct-mail company he founded. He
served 11 months in prison and is now in a halfway house in Los
Angeles. Mrs. Beswick sued her husband for divorce two years ago,
and proceeds from the sale of the art will go toward the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seized an unprecedented opportunity,'' Norton said. ``The
collection adds strength to strength.'' Besides increasing the
holdings of many artists the Nortons already had, the purchase adds
works by artists like Nan Goldin and Alexis Smith, which weren't in
their collection.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, Norton said, is forcing him to focus on and cull
his holdings. Once he decides which works he doesn't want to keep,
he said, he plans to package works in groups by theme or similarity
and donate them to small institutions that have limited money for
buying contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long-term project,'' Norton said. ``Meanwhile, our
collection will continue to grow. We lend extensively to
institutions and have about three dozen works on loan right now.''

     POLITICAL LEADERS SHOULD TRIM THEIR OWN
PENSIONS FIRST, SAY REFORMERS
 &HT;     With RETIREMENT.
 &HT;     By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton and Republican congressional
leaders tiptoed cautiously Thursday toward overhauling Social
Security, watchdog groups urged them to start by reforming their
own benefit programs.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a two-day summit on the politically supersensitive issue
of Social Security, the president joined with House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to
voice concern about whether baby boomers will have enough cash for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But private groups suggested that the leaders could demonstrate
their interest by trimming their own pensions, which far outpace
those of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American public would appreciate a gesture of
leadership by example, to show they're serious about putting Social
Security on solid ground,'' said Gary Ruskin, director of the
Congressional Accountability Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a small but meaningful gesture,'' said Ruskin,
whose group is part of consumer activist Ralph Nader's network.
</P>
<P>
   The National Taxpayers Union joined in the call. ``Probably one
of the best ways to get Social Security reform rolling is using
Congress as a test case for reform,'' said the group's spokesman,
Pete Sepp. He called the congressional pension plan ``one of the
worst affronts'' to pension policy.
</P>
<P>
   Many veteran lawmakers have pension benefits that are twice as
generous as those offered private company executives, and all
members of Congress are eligible for far more generous benefits
than other federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Former House speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, is currently receiving
$111,300 a year, while former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., is drawing $115,000. Former Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill,
continued to receive his pension even as he served prison time for
misuse of public funds. He is currently drawing $105,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Retired lawmakers also receive an annual cost-of-living
adjustment, almost unheard-of among private pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidents have much more lavish retirement packages,
including a pension that is equal to a current cabinet member's pay
(now $148,400), plus Secret Service protection, plus a limousine
and drivers, in addition to a government-paid office and funds for
the upkeep and staffing of their libraries.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief reform movement after the Republicans won control of
Congress in 1994, Gingrich and others promised to reduce the
congressional pensions. But the effort stalled and has all but
disappeared, amid published reports that Congress is planning to
give itself a pay increase this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., who took up the crusade to reform the
congressional pension program three years ago, has given up and
directed his energies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate attempt to bring congressional pensions in line with
those paid other federal workers also failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pension reform has moved to the farthest back burner,'' said
Sepp. ``In times that are relatively prosperous, members of
Congress hope they can slide back. These issues don't produce the
same outrage when no one is feeling economic pain.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change rapidly if the economic picture changed, he
said.

ART MUSEUMS PROMISE TO REVIEW HOLDINGS FOR SEIZED NAZI LOOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., Ill., Austria, Germany)  (th) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ The Association of American Art Museum
Directors pledged Thursday that its member museums would
immediately begin a review of their collections in search of
artworks that were illegally taken from their owners in the Nazi
era and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the group, which represents the 170 largest art
museums in North America, comes after several highly publicized
cases of questioned ownership that raised suspicions that museums
have largely ignored the possibility that they own or display
tainted works.
</P>
<P>
   The association, here for its annual meeting, made several
related promises that could change the way they do business. From
now on, its members said, they will review the provenance records
of works that are lent to them for exhibitions and will conduct far
more scrupulous ownership research before acquiring pieces.
</P>
<P>
   And members agreed to respond quickly to any claims that arise,
using mediation if necessary. They asked families with potential
claims to make inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hope that all families with claims would come forward,''
said Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, who is chairman of a 14-member task force created in
January to produce guidelines to deal with World War II art losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inviting dialogue, a joint effort on the problem,'' said
Robert Bergman, the director of the Cleveland Museum of Art and
also a task force member.
</P>
<P>
   The association is a voluntary group without binding authority
over its members, but the fact that it adopted even a vague set of
guidelines on looted art was called significant by past critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to study the recommendations carefully, but our
initial reaction is that the attitude the museums are demonstrating
is the beginning of the correct process,'' said Elan Steinberg,
executive director of the World Jewish Congress. ``We will
encourage them to speed it up.''
</P>
<P>
   If acted upon by all members, the measures could have
far-reaching consequences. Museums have rarely asked questions of
donors or art dealers, and if there were gaps in provenance
records, even for an artwork that changed hands in Europe between
1933 and the late 1940s, these were usually not investigated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The institutions asked even fewer questions about artworks that
they wanted to borrow for exhibitions. The Museum of Modern Art was
caught unaware late last year when two families said that two
paintings by Egon Schiele, on loan from a Viennese foundation, had
been confiscated by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern is fighting a grand jury subpoena requiring it to
keep the two disputed paintings in New York rather than return them
to Austria until a criminal investigation is completed.
</P>
<P>
   On May 13, a New York state judge ruled in its favor. But the
Manhattan District Attorney's office has appealed, and the
paintings must stay in New York pending a ruling in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, about a half-dozen claims have been made
for art taken illegally during the war years that made its way into
the collections of American museums. Nothing has yet been returned,
and many museum directors have frequently said that they do not
think the number of future claims will be large.
</P>
<P>
   Still, de Montebello said Thursday, ``I don't think any museum
anywhere is necessarily immune if the museum has in the last 50
years purchased any art, aside from American art.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply checking the artworks that they own will be an enormous
task for many museums, since most have detailed, published
information on only a small part of their collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already started looking at our collection for this,''
said James Wood, the president and director of the Art Institute of
Chicago. ``But there's a new urgency and we'll feel pressure to
speed it up, maybe bringing in some outside people to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that this work could take years, the museum directors
suggested that it might require additional money but they have yet
to consider how much or where it would come from. They urged the
creation of more and better databases of claims, claimants,
confiscated artworks and returned artworks.
</P>
<P>
   The association's task force was created specifically to address
claims from the World War II era and did not look at other
questions of provenance raised about the antiquities trade.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Art Loss Register, an international nonprofit
organization that has until now focused on current art theft, acted
to help locate art that was lost in the late 1930s and '40s: it
invited people to list wartime art losses without paying its usual
$20-per-item fee and contingency recovery fees.
</P>
<P>
   It also will start listing in its computerized database of
stolen or missing art works the wartime losses identified by
institutions, in news accounts and in historical documents.
</P>
<P>
   While the register does not adjudicate art claims, its database
of more than 100,000 items is frequently checked by auction houses,
insurance companies, museums and dealers before taking a
consignment or making an acquisition. The register has helped
recover about $75 million worth of stolen goods in the last seven
years, said Ronald Tauber, its chairman for the United States. &QL;

worst affronts'' to pension policy.
</P>
<P>
   Many veteran lawmakers have pension benefits that are twice as
generous as those offered private company executives, and all
members of Congress are eligible for far more generous benefits
than other federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Former House speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, is currently receiving
$111,300 a year, while former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., is drawing $115,000. Former Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill,
continued to receive his pension even as he served prison time for
mail fraud. He is currently drawing $105,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Retired lawmakers also receive an annual cost-of-living
adjustment, almost unheard-of among private pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidents have much more lavish retirement packages,
including a pension that is equal to a current cabinet member's pay
(now $148,400), plus Secret Service protection, plus a limousine
and drivers, in addition to a government-paid office and funds for
the upkeep and staffing of their libraries.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief reform movement after the Republicans won control of
Congress in 1994, Gingrich and others promised to reduce the
congressional pensions. But the effort stalled and has all but
disappeared, amid published reports that Congress is planning to
give itself a pay increase this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., who took up the crusade to reform the
congressional pension program three years ago, has given up and
directed his energies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate attempt to bring congressional pensions in line with
those paid other federal workers also failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pension reform has moved to the farthest back burner,'' said
Sepp. ``In times that are relatively prosperous, members of
Congress hope they can slide back. These issues don't produce the
same outrage when no one is feeling economic pain.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change rapidly if the economic picture changed, he
said.

CHASM SEPARATES CALIFORNIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Voters who had a hard time distinguishing
between California's three Democratic candidates for governor
should have no such trouble in the race between Attorney General
Dan Lungren and Lt. Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   A political chasm separates Lungren, the Republican, and Davis,
who defeated two rivals to become the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a real contest of philosophies and ideas,'' said
Dave Puglia, Lungren's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is wasting no time in highlighting the distinctions on
such issues as abortion and education.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat had a strong showing in Tuesday's election,
garnering more votes than Lungren in the open primary. But
political analysts expect the general election race to be very
tight.
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco Examiner poll taken just before the primary
showed the two veteran politicians in a statistical dead heat. In a
hypothetical head-to-head matchup, 44 percent of voters backed
Davis, while 42 percent supported Lungren; 14 percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very close _ within 4 or 5 points,''
predicted San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who joined Davis at a
campaign stop Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues that differentiate Davis and Lungren:
</P>
<P>
   Education: Lungren proposes giving parents vouchers and allowing
parents and school districts more local control. Davis opposes
vouchers and wants to give mayors and state officials more power to
take over under-achieving schools.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion: Davis supports abortion rights. Lungren would seek to
end taxpayer-funded abortions and the late-term procedure called by
opponents ``partial-birth abortions,'' and to reinstate a state law
mandating parental consent for minors.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action: Lungren supported Proposition 209, which
ended affirmative action in public hiring and education, and says
improving elementary and secondary education and community colleges
is the only way for minority students to ``rise to the top.'' Davis
opposed Proposition 209, and would give the top 4 percent of
students in every school access to the University of California
system.
</P>
<P>
   Guns: Lungren voted for the Brady anti-gun bill when he was in
Congress, but opposed recent efforts to ban so-called Saturday
night specials. Davis backs a ban on assault weapons and Saturday
night specials, and recommends legislation to require child locks
on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Having secured the nominations of their parties, both candidates
are now duking it out for moderate voters. Their supporters are
stepping over one another to paint the opponent as an extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson called
Davis ``the most vulnerable and liberal of the field, the former
chief of staff for Governor Moonbeam,'' referring to former Gov.
Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres said voters in
November had a choice between ``a decorated Vietnam veteran and
perhaps the best governor-in-training California has ever
produced'' and Lungren, ``who opposes a woman's right to choice,
favors offshore oil drilling and supports the rights of convicted
criminals to own assault weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates share some similarities in their backgrounds.
Neither is wealthy. Both have held statewide office and have strong
support among party loyalists. Both champion tough-on-crime
positions and favor the death penalty. They are Catholics, though
Davis only became a regular church-goer again in recent years at
the urging of his wife.

THE AIR IS CLEARLY GETTING WORSE

<P>
   Most of the time, we take the air we breathe for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Unless we have asthma or emphysema or some other severe
respiratory disease, we usually don't even think about our air in
Texas, the heart of the great outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past few weeks, including Clean Air Week (May
24-30), a brown, ugly haze has hung in the Texas skies off and on,
burning our eyes, causing headaches and leaving people irritable
and lethargic.
</P>
<P>
   The smoky haze caused by brush fires burning out of control in
Central America and Mexico has a lot of people talking about air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But we need to know that the ozone that moves in with hot and
humid sunny days each summer is an even greater health risk than
the fine particulate matter that has obscured the sun for the past
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Unhealthful levels of ozone the past couple of summers have
caused the Fort Worth-Dallas area to be classified as having a
``serious'' air quality problem _ just like Atlanta and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   We teach our children to play safely, avoid sunburn and insect
bites, learn to swim, and respect water and traffic rules, but the
American Lung Association says the air they breathe could be making
them sick.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone levels typically rise between May and October, when higher
temperatures and increased sunlight combine with stagnant
atmospheric conditions to ``cook'' hydrocarbon compounds and
nitrogen oxide emitted primarily by motor vehicles, power plants
and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone is the most widespread air pollutant, affecting millions
of people nationwide, and it is expected to be around long after
the brush fires are finally extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Children are especially vulnerable to all forms of air pollution
because their airways are smaller and their respiratory defenses
are not fully formed. They spend lots of time outdoors, breathing
hard, primarily through the mouth, which has no way to filter the
air before it reaches the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   To help protect our kids, the Lung Association recommends
keeping track of air pollution levels and limiting the time they
spend outdoors in vigorous play when ozone levels are unhealthful.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a new consumer guide, ``Ozone Air Pollution and Our
Kids,'' is available free by calling the Lung Association at (800)
LUNG-USA.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor air pollution is impossible to avoid completely, but
there are ways we can make its overall impact less severe. The
American Association for Respiratory Care offers the following
tips:
</P>
<P>
   Avoid toxic fumes: If you work on your car in the garage, make
sure the garage door is completely open; don't allow exhaust fumes
to enter your house; dispose of chemically saturated rags in sealed
containers; replace lids on solvent containers securely; minimize
your use of strong chemicals in and around the home and garden; and
wear a mask to minimize inhalation of fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Stay updated on pollution reports: Be aware of ozone, mold and
pollen counts before going outside; wear a mask when mowing, raking
leaves or working in the garden; choose early morning for outside
exercise, and work to limit your exposure to irritants in the
atmosphere.

ART REVIEW: WHAT SET NOGUCHI APART _ HE WAS APART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Ind., Japan)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During the two decades before he died in 1988, at 84,
Isamu Noguchi spent half of each year at a studio in Mure, a
village on Shikoku, one of Japan's four main islands, making stone
sculptures. He liked materials that he thought matched the
character of the places he worked, so in the United States he tried
metals like aluminum, and in Italy he tried marble. In Japan he
favored basalt and granite (Swedish granite sometimes), partly
because for him they, like Japan, evoked nature, the earth, a
durable past.
</P>
<P>
   Pace Wildenstein's exhibition of a dozen of Noguchi's Mure works
from the 1980s must be the most peaceful spot in the city at the
moment, with the exception, maybe, of the garden at the Noguchi
Museum in Queens, where a big, shady Katsura tree is blooming among
the rocky sculptures and tinkling fountains.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't been to the museum in a while, and among other things
the visit helped clarify what's at Pace. A Mure sculpture has
lately been installed there: ``Beginnings'' consists of five
irregular andesite blocks in a circle. Noguchi had a way of making
a delicate order out of chaos. What he does with ``Beginnings'' is
what you see throughout the Pace show.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has also put up maquettes for Mure sculptures,
including a balsa wood and plaster version of ``Awakening'' at
Pace, which proves that Noguchi sometimes labored to achieve what
looks effortless in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly I was struck by several granite table-top sculptures from
the 1960s and early '70s (``Planet in Transit,'' ``Mirage'') that
are clearly precursors to Pace works like ``Galaxy Calligraphy,''
as are the table-top models for parks and playgrounds he designed
from the 1930s on. They echo Giacometti's board games.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly they show how ambiguous and open-ended Noguchi
allowed his art to be. Their forms slip back and forth from
abstractions to landscapes in miniature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountain Landscape (Bench)'' at Pace may be the best example
of this; even its title makes the point. An oblong basalt slab, the
bottom rough, the top partly cut and polished, it recalls a plain
and mesa. It also can suggest a log. You can't be sure any of this
was Noguchi's intent. Perhaps the allusions happened in the process
of turning the stone into a bench. Or maybe Noguchi, making a
sculpture of a landscape, realized he had also made a bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Noguchi Foundation, which runs the museum, is selling the
works at Pace to raise money, among other things, to help establish
a studio museum at Mure, where Noguchi, at his death, left 160
sculptures, finished and not. The Mure studio is akin to David
Smith's studio at Bolton Landing in upstate New York; like Smith,
Noguchi made a contained world for himself, a place peopled by his
sculptures, which he arranged and rearranged throughout the
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that the Pace show only dimly summons up the
experience of Mure, but it is at least evocative. Two works in it
are fountains, one that he proposed for the Seagram Building in
1987, which consists of reddish-brown basalt boulders, each
six-sided and resting on stones, like thick tuna steaks on a
shallow bed of rice. Water gently flows from holes in the tops of
the boulders over the sides, pooling among the stones. The other
Pace fountain, made of Japanese granite, works on the same
slow-drip principle. The result is a low-level burble through the
room, very Zen.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember being more tempted to caress art. The
temptation is to touch the notches, circles, dips and cracks in the
stones, which sensuously sometimes imply bodies.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there's nonetheless a tough, astringent quality just
beneath the nuanced surfaces: a restless intensity to Noguchi's art
that may reflect his personal condition.
</P>
<P>
   His biography is familiar. Born in 1904 in Los Angeles, brought
up in Japan until he was 14, then sent to school in Indiana, he was
the son of a Japanese poet and an American writer. Noguchi's father
became a fierce Japanese nationalist, divorced himself from his
American family and started a new one in Japan _ like ``Madama
Butterfly'' in reverse, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Noguchi's relationship with his father, and so with
his Japanese identity, was vexed. The old line on him is that he
was a Japanese artist steeped in European modernism, or conversely
that he was an American who cribbed from Japan. But neither is
right. His art suggests a sense of displacement or alienation; it
is elusive. I imagine what he meant when he sometimes used the word
oasis to describe it was not that the art was serene as much as it
was apart from everything.
</P>
<P>
   After all, though he belonged to the generation of New York
School artists that included Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and
Smith and, like them, rose to success on the tide of postwar
American art, no one thinks of him in terms of the New York School.
His separateness has always defined him.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike de Kooning and the others, he maintained a commitment to
the notion of public art, which they mostly abandoned after the
30's. His lamps and furniture reflected his consistent desire to
engage the public. His later years were significantly devoted to
outdoor projects and to his museum in Long Island City, a public
space.
</P>
<P>
   His career, in this way, paralleled those of Europeans like Miro
and Leger and that of an expatriate like Calder, who also focused
increasingly on big public commissions after the war. Noguchi's
results, like theirs, were mixed. Sometimes his art turned icy,
corporate, precious.
</P>
<P>
   But it's amusing to recall that as a child he apprenticed to
Gutzon Borglum, who later did Mount Rushmore, the country's biggest
public sculpture. Borglum thought Noguchi was hopeless. Whatever
his shortcomings, Noguchi turned out to be the best sculptor of
public spaces the United States had in the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite work at Pace is a tall, rough piece of granite,
untitled, from 1983. It's a monolith on the scale of commemorative
statues of standing figures, but abstract. A circle is carved where
an eye might be. The top of the stone is rounded at a slant, like a
head, maybe, and the middle (the waist?) smoothed.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is between Rodin's ``Balzac'' and Brancusi's
``Kiss,'' if you can imagine it. Subtle discrete marks lead you
around and around the stone in an effort to make the whole come
together. Somehow Noguchi turns plain gray stone into something
rich and evocative.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's best to say he uncovered a richness that was there
but easily missed. ``There must be something in the stone, a
predisposition that permits the artist to imagine,'' he once
explained. Noguchi's great gift was to let us see with fresh eyes
what's before us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stones and Water,'' the exhibition of Isamu Noguchi's late
works from Mure, Japan, remains at the Pace Wildenstein Gallery, 32
E. 57th St., through June 26. The Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum, at
32-37 Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, in Queens, is open 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Fridays and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Saturdays and Sundays.

SUNDANCE CHANNEL: SUNDANCE OFFERS A WEEKLY FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Time, channel are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(js) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The photographer William Wegman dresses up his Weimaraners in
summer-camp clothes and sends them out to solve a mystery, Hardy
Boys style, in the funny parody, ``The Hardley Boys in Hardley
Gold.'' (``Hardly boys, they were girls and dogs,'' Wegman says in
his deadpan narrative.) That half-hour film is one of the quirky
treats appearing this Sunday when Sundance Channel finally arrives
in Manhattan in a big way. Devoted to independent film, Sundance
Channel (a spinoff of Robert Redford's Sundance Institute and Film
Festival) will be available on Time Warner Cable on a daylong
pay-per-view basis every Sunday, beginning with a free preview this
week.
</P>
<P>
   With its richly eclectic mix, Sundance Channel is a film lover's
fantasy. Sunday's highlights include ``Big Night,'' Stanley Tucci
and Campbell Scott's affecting comedy about two brothers and a
feast of Italian food, and ``The Portrait of a Lady,'' Jane
Campion's underrated, beautiful adaptation of Henry James' novel.
There is also ``Trees Lounge,'' a meandering, atmospheric character
piece written, directed by and starring Steve Buscemi as a man at
loose ends who hangs out in a local bar. Low-key and hauntingly
real, it is the quintessential Sundance movie.
</P>
<P>
   The Sundance Channel is available on Time Warner's Channel 60.
After this week's free preview, subsequent Sundays will cost $1.95
a day, less monthly or yearly.

   SHARP-DRIVING-COX (Atlanta) _ There are a lot of ways to test a
vehicle, but none is more fun than on a racetrack. Over Memorial
Day weekend, I did just that with a Dodge Neon at Lime Rock Park in
Connecticut. By Linda Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   MECHANIC-COX (Atlanta) _ With summer approaching and
temperatures climbing higher, more air-conditioning systems will
require servicing. As the price for R-12 -- or Freon, the most
common but now banned refrigerant -- continues to escalate, owners
of older vehicles with A/C systems that use this refrigerant will
become the prime targets for the retrofit hawkers. By Nora Carter.
</P>
<P>
   TESTDRIVE-COX (Atlanta) _ Face it. Mainstream family sedans --
both domestics and imports -- don't get much glory. They're like
washing machines in the sense that they only get attention when
they're not working properly. But Honda set out to change that with
the '98 Accord, and it's paid off for the Japanese-based
manufacturer and buyers. Billed as the ``All-American'' because
it's built in Marysville, Ohio, with Japan supplying only 15
percent of its parts, this Accord really is new. By Russ DeVault.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-BOS (Undated) _ Where, I am asking no one in
particular, are the outside mirror controls? I have searched the
dash, scoured the console, examined the interior minutely, but I
can find nothing remotely resembling a remote mirror control. There
must be a control in here somewhere. Now, before you start sneering
at the ``spoiled'' auto writer, consider that this is a $66,500
automobile _ plus $700 delivery, a $3,000 guzzler charge, and, in
the tested car, $500 worth of optional aluminum wheels. By John R.
White.
</P>
<P>
   CARS-WILLIAMS-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ The best has just gotten
better. It's hard to imagine the king of the sport utilities
getting any better than it was, but that's what happened when
Toyota redesigned the Land Cruiser for 1998. By G. Chambers
Williams III.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-AZR (Undated) _ Like flip sides of a coin, the new
Chrysler Concorde and redesigned Dodge Intrepid set out on
identical platforms with two different missions. The Concorde is
meant to evoke a classic style of grand-tour motoring, aimed at
mature drivers who might appreciate such things. The Intrepid is
the hotter ticket, aggressively wedge-shaped with a grille borrowed
from Dodge's main image machine, the Viper sports car. By Bob
Golfen.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-COLUMN-COX _ For many people, the most frustrating part of
vehicle ownership is getting quality service at a fair price.
Because most of us are not certified automotive technicians, when
we talk to our technician about vehicle repairs, it's not unlike
trying to feel knowledgeable about dealing in rocket science.
Normally, I feel confident about automotive topics, but a recent
experience proved that under some circumstances, I can be just as
lost at the repair shop as the next guy. By Don Sharp.

`GORILLA GAME' GUIDES INVESTORS ON HIGH-TECH STOCK HUNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gorillas and monkeys, kings and serfs, tornado warnings and
terrain mapping _
</P>
<P>
   all could be elements of a new Jumanji game.
</P>
<P>
   But instead they are descriptive terms for a hot, bestselling
investment book, ``The Gorilla Game: An Investor's Guide to Picking
Winners in High Technology'' (HarperBusiness, 331 pages).
</P>
<P>
   The book is written by high-tech consultants Geoffrey Moore and
Tom Kippola and technology analyst Paul Johnson. The colorful
language for otherwise dry number-crunching started with Moore's
other bestsellers, ``Inside the Tornado'' and ``Crossing the
Chasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Interested readers should be alerted to another newly published
book with a similar title: ``Guerrilla Investing: Winning
Strategies for Beating the Wall Street Professionals'' (Longstreet,
326 pages, $24).
</P>
<P>
   That book, by Wall Street money manager Peter Siris, describes
guerrilla investing as ``a strategy that uses both the latest
technology and time-tested, common-sense techniques to allow the
amateur, against all odds, to win.''
</P>
<P>
   (''Guerrilla'' refers to a type of military force that operates
in small, speedy groups.)
</P>
<P>
   Buying stocks from companies you know well, talking to investor
relations departments and reading income statements are some of the
actions Siris recommends when picking individual stocks. Overall,
the book is a good primer for stock-buying and for beating the
professionals at their own game, with some description of Internet
investment tools.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, in their book on gorilla (as in the ape) investing,
Moore, Kippola and Johnson describe their investment strategy as
hyperselective. Indeed, out of about 8,000 public technology
companies, only around 100 fit into the criteria they've developed
from which to pick their ``gorilla'' investment with hypergrowth
potential.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the Gorilla Game, they note, is ``to help private
investors participate in the rewards of high-tech stock gains while
standing clear of the market's unnerving volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good so far. The high-tech market is known for its
heart-stopping leaps and losses, as those on Wall Street try to
figure out whether the latest technology development will end up on
Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is gorilla investing? It's a form of growth
investing in which a single company (the gorilla) emerges from a
pack of companies and dominates a new technology. Gorilla companies
experience hypergrowth (which is when they are in the tornado) and
create new value chains, the authors write, ultimately beating the
overall market for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was a gorilla, as were Intel and Oracle. Potential
gorillas include software companies Vantive, Scopus and Clarify,
the authors predict.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the Gorilla Game can be described in a five-step
plan:
</P>
<P>
   _ Find markets that are moving into hypergrowth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy a number of stocks in that market that could turn into
gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   _ As the gorilla breaks away from the pack, sell off the rest of
the group.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hold the gorilla for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sell only when a new alternative technology threatens your
gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   Three chapters describe the rules of picking the gorilla
company. Another three gives past, present and future gorilla
company case studies. The final chapter discusses investing
specifically in Internet companies, which the authors nickname the
possible Mother of all Tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy seems sound, although most investors will find it's
a lot more work than they are willing to put into their financial
investments. Still, the book does not bog readers down with numbers
and charts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, using the imagery of gorillas, tornadoes, kings,
princes and the like, the book effectively describes its points in
a form that is easy to understand and analyze.
</P>
<P>
   The authors provide a Web page address and invite readers to
visit. They finish the book by wishing readers happy hunting.

IRS, FBI SEIZE RECORDS FROM SOUTH TEXAS PROSECUTOR, STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER and CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ A vast federal investigation unfolding here has
focused on at least 142 people, including the Webb County district
attorney, a former state district judge and investigators from the
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are trying to learn what happened to
criminal charges against 128 people over the nine years that Joe
Rubio has been district attorney in the South Texas city.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, agents from the FBI and Internal Revenue
Service have gone after the personal financial records of 14
people, including Rubio, his father and eight people who work in
Rubio's office.
</P>
<P>
   Those records include income tax returns, checkbooks, expense
accounts, payroll records and other documents, according to the
search warrant federal agents used to seize the items.
</P>
<P>
   Agents also are combing criminal files that are among the
truckload of documents and records seized Sunday when Rubio's
county courthouse office was raided.
</P>
<P>
   The search warrant sheds light on the scope and depth of the
federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Rubio and his father, Jose ``Pichino'' Rubio Sr.,
former state District Judge Ruben Garcia was among 14 people from
whom personal financial records were sought. No charges have been
filed against hte men.
</P>
<P>
   The search warrant lists 128 people who either have been
arrested by state authorities and charged with a crime or who could
be charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Davila, Joe Rubio's lawyer, said his client is the focus
of attention simply because he is in charge of the district
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd have had the goods on anyone, you'd think they'd
have made arrests,'' Davila said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a matter of going in and picking up everything to see
if anything is wrong, it's improper,'' Davila said. ``It gives Webb
County a bad image irrespective of the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Guerrero, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Houston, which is overseeing the investigation, declined to comment
on the search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the document is filed in the public record, we can comment
on it. If it is not, we cannot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents have repeatedly declined to comment on the case.

TWO STUDIOS CUTTING BACK  
 AS BUSY AS TRUMAN  
 A DELICATE TASK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Studio executives here cry ``wolf'' so often that
it's hard to believe them. They complain about the soaring costs of
films but pay millions of dollars and give elaborate perks to
actors whose movies keep failing. They grumble about the sameness
of films but produce movies that are often alike. They groan that
the marketplace is too crowded every weekend but keep churning out
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Now two of the most prolific studios, Walt Disney and Warner
Bros., say they are sharply curtailing production, largely because
of costs. Warner said it would reduce its output to about 20
pictures a year, down from an average of 28 over the last few
years. And Disney plans to release only 17 or 18 films next year;
several years ago the studio released as many as 35 movies a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every level, we'll be more selective,'' said Joe Roth, the
studio chief, whose boss, Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, fully
endorses the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Roth added that the cut was intended to limit production costs
as well as development, marketing and overhead expenses. But the
reduced output will mostly be in Disney's adult films, not its
family movies or animated features.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Donald DeLine, president of Touchstone Pictures, the
Disney unit that makes grown-up films, said he would leave the
studio after 13 years. It was under DeLine that Touchstone made
adult movies, including ``Pretty Woman,'' ``Ransom,'' ``Sister
Act,'' ``Con Air'' and the coming ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Disney family-film division _ responsible for ``George of
the Jungle'' and ``Flubber,'' among others _ is one of the studio's
more lucrative units, together with animation. ``Beauty and the
Beast'' and ``The Lion King,'' for example, have been huge profit
makers for Disney, not only because of their box-office power but
also because of spinoffs ranging from toys and merchandise to
Broadway shows. Live-action films are, by their nature, riskier.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's predecessor, Jeffrey Katzenberg, made numerous
high-concept comedies, but also gave the green light to adult
films, including ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Dead Poets Society,''
``When a Man Loves a Woman'' and ``What's Love Got to Do With It.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth and DeLine have been working on several grown-up films.
These include ``Beloved,'' based on the novel by Toni Morrison and
directed by Jonathan Demme, and ``A Civil Action,'' directed by
Steven Zaillian and starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Roth acknowledged that more time and money would now be spent on
the Disney label, meaning family films. But he insisted that the
company would continue to make movies for grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to be forced to only make your best stuff,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some talent agents and top producers are not certain.
</P>
<P>
   As Busy As Truman
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours before the glittering premiere of ``The Truman
Show'' in Los Angeles, Laura Linney was sitting nervously in her
room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. ``It's scary, a
little intimidating,'' the New York-born stage and film actress
said. ``There's so much attention, so much interest in the film.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right.
</P>
<P>
   Few films in the summer season have arrived with the
anticipation of ``The Truman Show,'' a dark fantasy directed by
Peter Weir, written by Andrew Niccol and starring Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a slightly goofy man who lives in a
picture-postcard town and doesn't suspect that his entire life,
from the moment he was born, is a television show. His family, his
friends, everyone in his life is an actor, and it finally dawns on
Truman that his life is a fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Linney plays Truman's wife, a scary and manipulative woman
who controls him with an icy smile. The role was quite complicated,
Ms. Linney said, because she was actually playing an actress
playing a role on a television show.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were moments when I was unclear about the different
layers,'' Ms. Linney said. ``All of us came up with back stories,
elaborate histories of who we were. And my back story was that this
actress _ her name is Hannah Gill _ was profoundly powerful; she
rivaled Oprah in how much money she was making; she was a really
shrewd businesswoman who made millions and millions of dollars in
product placement on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Linney laughed. ``She was also a failed child actress, one
of those little horrible kids who was in a million productions of
`Annie' but never actually played Annie,'' Ms. Linney said. ``She
went through some terrible years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Linney has not endured any such terrible years, and in fact,
at 34, has had a formidable career. She is appearing on Broadway in
``Honour,'' a play by Joanna Murray-Smith. She'll also be seen in
Armistead Maupin's ``More Tales of the City,'' starting Sunday on
Showtime. Last year she played opposite Clint Eastwood in
``Absolute Power'' and won strong notices as a prosecutor in
``Primal Fear'' opposite Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Linney lives in New York with her husband, David Adkins, an
actor she met while studying drama at the Juilliard School. The
daughter of Romulus Linney, the playwright, and Ann Perse, Ms.
Linney grew up in New York, went to Brown University and from
childhood yearned to be an actress.
</P>
<P>
   Her New York theater credits include roles in ``Hedda Gabler''
and the Broadway productions of ``Six Degrees of Separation'' and
``The Seagull'' and she starred in Philip Barry's comedy
``Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Truman Show'' was her most complex role. Ms. Linney
said she learned an enormous amount from Weir, the filmmaker, as
well as Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most actors are a little timid, self-conscious,'' she said.
``Jim cuts through all that, and he has courage like I've never
seen. He'll try anything. His impulses are immediate. It was
amazing to be around.''

<P>
   A Delicate Task
</P>
<P>
   The death of Phil Hartman this week was greeted with special
sorrow at Dreamworks.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the company had worked with the 49-year-old
comedian on ``Small Soldiers,'' a family film set to open on July
10, and were deeply fond of him. But in addition they viewed the
film as a potential summer sleeper and are now faced with delicate
questions about its advertising and trailers.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about toy action figures who come to life and clash
in a miniwar that ensnares a suburban Ohio town. It tested strongly
before preview audiences, and Dreamworks executives had hoped it
would appeal to teen-agers as well as families, especially
considering Hartman's popularity during his eight-year run on
``Saturday Night Live'' and on the NBC show ``News Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, which blends live action with computer-generated
imagery created by the Stan Winsten studio, Hartman plays a
suburban father whose son brings home one of the toy soldiers. He
is not the star, but part of an ensemble cast, including Kirsten
Dunst, Denis Leary and Jay Mohr. This will make it somewhat easier
for Dreamworks to alter the marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks executives are carefully examining how much or how
little to show of Hartman in the new trailers and newspaper
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   One change in a trailer had been made before Hartman's death. In
an early version shown in theaters, the Hartman character,
witnessing a fight among the soldiers, said, ``I think I'm having
an aneurysm.'' But the line was cut.
</P>
<P>
   Film studios about to release a movie with a starring actor who
has died have few options but to promote the film with that star.
Take the case of ``Almost Heroes,'' the comedy from Warner Bros.
that opened last weekend. It starred Matthew Perry and Chris
Farley, who died last year; the two shared star billing. Still, the
advertising for the comedy was limited, but this was largely
because the movie was poorly received by audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Spencer Tracy before the release of ``Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner'' and the death of James Dean before ``Giant'' had
no discernible impact on the success of those films, now considered
classics. They were promoted as if their stars were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   It's another problem entirely when a star dies in the middle of
making a movie. A bizarre Hollywood solution to that difficulty
came about when Jean Harlow died of kidney failure during the
making of the 1937 comedy ``Saratoga.'' She was 26. The film also
starred, among others, Clark Gable (as a bookie) and Lionel
Barrymore (as a horse breeder and Ms. Harlow's grandfather).
</P>
<P>
   The studio decided to use Ms. Harlow's stand-in, Mary Dees, in
many scenes. The effect was bizarre: Ms. Dees was seen with her
back to the camera, looking through binoculars or wearing a
wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   According to David Stenn's ``Bombshell: The Life and Death of
Jean Harlow,'' (Doubleday, 1993) the film turned out to be Harlow's
most successful, grossing $3.3 million, more than any other movie
in 1937. Many reviewers actually called the Harlow performance the
best of her career, but The New York Times thought she ``was
patently not her tempestuous self.''

IN PURSUIT OF LOVE, ROMANTICALLY OR NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1970s San Francisco of ``Armistead Maupin's More Tales of
the City,'' the characters may be homosexual, heterosexual or
transsexual, but they are all hopeless romantics.
</P>
<P>
   In the brash new comedy series ``Sex in the City,'' the heroine
cultivates an anti-romantic pose that suits Manhattan in the '90s,
with its post-politically correct attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a sexual anthropologist,'' says Carrie (Sarah Jessica
Parker), a newspaper columnist who writes: ``Welcome to the age of
uninnocence. No one has breakfast at Tiffany's and no one has
affairs to remember. Instead we have breakfast at 7 a.m. and
affairs we try to forget as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Though one is gauzy and one hard-edged, both these shows alight
on a particular patch of ground where their characters roam through
a hyperrealistic landscape searching for the meaning of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``More Tales'' comes up with comforting but pat answers. Things
have changed since the original ``Tales of the City'' appeared on
PBS in 1994, to deserved acclaim and popularity. The series was
distinguished by its matter-of-fact acceptance of all sorts of
sexual desire, and it created a warm, enviable, almost innocent
world centered around a house at 28 Barbary Lane.
</P>
<P>
   We should all have a landlady as wise and reassuring as Anna
Madrigal (Olympia Dukakis) to call us ``dear.'' That she grew
marijuana in her garden and used to be a man were mere details; the
series' openhearted tolerance was one of its most winning
qualities. Of course, that attitude evoked right-wing hostility.
PBS quickly dropped plans for a sequel (unconvincingly citing the
cost).
</P>
<P>
   That sequel, now appearing on Showtime, has about half the charm
and little of the freshness of the original series. There, Mary Ann
Singleton (Laura Linney, who returns to ``More Tales'' even perkier
than before), arrived from Cleveland and landed in San Francisco as
if she were Alice down the rabbit hole. Agog at what she saw, she
was the viewer's ideal guide.
</P>
<P>
   In the sequel, which picks up six weeks after the first story
ended, Mary Ann is on a cruise to Mexico with her gay friend Mouse
(Paul Hopkins, in one of several cast changes), wondering which of
them a handsome man is making eyes at. Viewers are four years ahead
of her, though.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Ellen,'' after hit films like ``The Birdcage,'' after
the PBS-``Tales'' flap itself, ``More Tales'' has a slightly quaint
air, despite its more explicit love scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a different screenwriter (Nicholas Wright instead of
Richard Kramer) and a script that lacks snap. And in the first few
episodes, the Barbary Lane house and Mrs. Madrigal fade into the
background. While Mary Ann is cruising, Mona Ramsey (Nina
Siemaszko, replacing the more suitably abrasive Cloe Webb) takes a
bus trip to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   At the bus station she meets the one daring addition to the
story, a wizened old brothel owner called Mother Mucca (from
Winnemucca), who wears a red wig askew and calls everyone
``Dolly.'' Mona goes to work as a receptionist at the Blue Moon
Lodge, the house Mother Mucca has run for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Neither sweet nor cuddly, Mother Mucca (played with fearless
lack of sentimentality by Jackie Burroughs) is a character who
repels and finally attracts viewers; she is just what this
soft-focus memory piece needs.
</P>
<P>
   There are plot twists that may engage series fans but will leave
newcomers wondering what the fuss was about. Mona's mother (Swoozie
Kurtz) turns up. So does her father, which will not surprise anyone
who has been following the clues.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more satisfying turns, Thomas Gibson (now
better-known from ``Dharma and Greg'') returns as the
mean-spirited, secretly homosexual Beauchamp Day. Being closeted
may be the one unforgivable sin in Maupin's world, and Beauchamp
suffers a brutal comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex in the City'' has a narrower focus, but each slight,
breezy half-hour is fresh and funny. The series is loosely based on
Candace Bushnell's columns in the New York Observer but leaves
behind the irritating, self-important tone. The series benefits
greatly from Ms. Parker's engaging portrayal of a smart woman
always searching for answers and never certain she has found them.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening episode, Carrie and a group of single female
friends decide women can have sex as casually as men do. Carrie
tries this out with an old boyfriend, and leaves feeling
``powerful'' but flustered enough to drop her handbag on the
street. Fortunately, she drops it at the feet of a rich, handsome
single man she calls Big (Christopher Noth), who serves as an
instant reminder that her heart can still flutter.
</P>
<P>
   More than she realizes, Carrie is torn between her longing for
romance and her knowledge that there is no free breakfast at
Tiffany's.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Carrie's world of art dealers, trendy clubs and
supermodels may seem hermetic, but her mating rituals have a
universal resonance. The ``toxic bachelors'' she runs across have
their counterparts everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   So do her friends, especially Cynthia Nixon as Miranda, a bitter
lawyer with a functional haircut, and Kim Cattrall as Samantha, a
slightly over-the-hill public relations woman who thinks she can be
mistaken for a model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samantha has the kind of deluded self-confidence that causes
men like Ross Perot to run for president,'' Carrie says. Like so
much of ``Sex in the City,'' that's not kind, but it's true. &QL;

`A.K.A. LEWIS CARROLL': LOOKING GLASS REFLECTED A SHY VICTORIAN
DOOR
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Could the mathematician who in 1867 published ``An
Elementary Treatise on Determinants With Their Application to
Simultaneous Linear Equations and Algebraical Geometry'' also be
the author of ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''? To be sure. His
real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898), and under it he
functioned as an Oxford don who taught math, a cleric, a poet, a
pamphleteer, a deviser of games and puzzles, an ardent theatergoer
and a gifted amateur photographer.
</P>
<P>
   But the pseudonym Lewis Carroll, a Latinization of Charles
Lutwidge in reverse order, is the name that belongs to his most
brilliant achievement, the ``Alice'' stories.
</P>
<P>
   The show ``a k a Lewis Carroll'' at the Morgan Library marks the
100th anniversary of the death of this odd and intriguing polymath,
and it reflects a life of fascinating paradoxes. A Church of
England deacon and an eminently proper Victorian, he also took
adoring photographs of little girls and often fell in love with his
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   A writer of ``serious'' if schmaltzy Victorian verse, he was
also an ironist and nonsense rhymer who had fun with sober
institutions like Oxford and the British monarchy. A very private
person who kept Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and Lewis Carroll strictly
apart, he was also a tireless celebrity chaser who sought big names
to pose for his camera.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, assembled largely from the Morgan's own
collection by Anna Lou Ashby, curator of printed books, represents
a very respectable slice of Dodgsonia. It includes letters (he
wrote thousands), personal memorabilia like his microscope and
watch (a big silver timepiece that resembles the White Rabbit's),
first editions of his books, pamphlets and other literary
endeavors, original drawings by John Tenniel, the Punch cartoonist
who illustrated ``Alice'' and its sequel, ``Through the
Looking-Glass,'' photographs of Dodgson himself and those he took
of his very young friends.
</P>
<P>
   There is a load of associated ephemera, too: the childhood ring
and purse of Alice Liddell, for whom his Alice was named; parlor
games invented by Dodgson; toys, songs and records inspired by
``Alice''; parodies of his work by other authors; drawings and cels
for Disney's 1951 animation of ``Alice,'' and a book version of the
1933 Paramount movie ``Alice in Wonderland,'' starring Gary Cooper
as the White Knight, Cary Grant as the Mock Turtle and W.C. Fields
as Humpty Dumpty.
</P>
<P>
   If a few things have been left out, like nude photographs of
girls (he thought boys were ugly), pages from his voluminous
diaries and the original ``Alice'' manuscript (now in the British
Library), no matter. There is enough Dodgson/Carroll material here
to keep a viewer hopping. And those who want to know more can turn
to the redoubtable biography by Morton N. Cohen (Knopf, 1995), and
now a Vintage paperback.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The son of an accomplished parish curate and community leader,
Dodgson was the oldest and much adored boy in a family of 11
children. Seven were girls, a fact often cited in speculations
about his interest in prepubescent females. A clever, personable
young man, especially good with words and mathematics, he grew up
in his father's country parsonages, was sent to Rugby at 14,
entered Christ Church, one of Oxford University's most fashionable
colleges, at 19, and stayed on as a don until his death. He taught,
was active in college politics, had a social life and at 24 got
hooked on the popular Victorian vice of photography.
</P>
<P>
   He was good at this then very cumbersome process, so good that
sitters beat a path to his door. From photographing fellow
academics and churchmen, he went on to their children, and so met
Alice Liddell, the 4-year-old daughter of Henry George Liddell, the
newly appointed dean of Christ Church. She was to change his life.
A number of photographs of Alice with and without her two sisters
appear in the show; two of the most engaging were taken when she
was 7. In one she proudly sports a crown of flowers, in the other
she presents a grave profile as she presses her face against the
back of a chair.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous photo of this seductive child is included,
``Alice Liddell as Beggar Girl,'' taken at the same age in the
deanery garden. Barefoot and dressed in rags, like the child
prostitutes who frequented London streets, she cocks her head in a
challenging come-hither look, one foot drawn up and resting on a
ledge. There are two versions: one a carte de visite, the other a
larger presentation copy, hand colored and dressed up in a leather
case. Also on view are photos of several other young girls, among
them Xie Kitchin, the daughter of the headmaster of Winchester
College, and Julia Arnold, the niece of Matthew Arnold and later
the mother of Aldous Huxley.
</P>
<P>
   Famously, while boating on a summer day in 1862 with the Liddell
children and an adult friend, Dodgson concocted the tale of Alice
in Wonderland to amuse them, and wrote it down later at Alice
Liddell's insistence. Originally titled ``Alice's Adventures
Underground,'' it was published in 1866 as ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland'' and is possibly the world's most widely read
children's book, rendered into more than 70 languages, including
Swahili and Yiddish. (A lineup of translations, among them a 1923
version in Russian by Vladimir Nabokov who was later to write the
pedophiliac ``Lolita,'' fills a display case in the show.) Also on
view is a facsimile edition of the original manuscript, with
drawings by the author that include a giraffe-necked Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Not the least of this show's pleasures is the number of
illustrations, some original, some in proof form, by Tenniel
(1820-1914), who created the legendary images of Alice, the White
Rabbit, the Red Queen, the Duchess, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad
Hatter and the rest of the gloriously wacky Wonderland crew. (An
early review of the book called the illustrations ``square, grim
and uncouth.'') Although many other illustrators _ the work of
Arthur Rackham, Marie Laurencin and Barry Moser is shown here,
among others _ have had a crack at ``Alice'' over the years, the
Tenniel drawings have never been surpassed.
</P>
<P>
   If this show is made up of maybe too many ``bits and scraps''
(Dodgson's description of ``Alice''), it's still an enjoyable
tribute to the shy, unmarried don who somehow found the freedom to
let the child in him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``a k a Lewis Carroll'' remains at the Pierpont Morgan Library,

SPECTURM OF INTERPRETATIONS IN THREE `SLEEPING BEAUTIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Sleeping Beauty,'' set to one of Tchaikovsky's most
sumptuous scores, is a standard against which performers may be
measured. It is also a ballet that is capable of a surprising
number of interpretations, as American Ballet Theater suggested in
well-danced performances on Monday night and Wednesday afternoon
and evening at the Metropolitan Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   A thread of otherworldliness ran through Susan Jaffe's
impressively sustained portrayal of Princess Aurora on Monday
night. Ms. Jaffe was an unusually shy Aurora in the first act,
dancing with a dreaming softness and delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the second-act Vision Scene, Ms. Jaffe's melancholy Aurora
gave full, calm measure to each step and gesture. She distilled all
that had come before in the third-act grand pas de deux, somehow
suggesting that this eager, triumphant princess would always be
haunted by her half-remembered years of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Tuttle was unconvincing as the young first-act princess
on Wednesday afternoon, in polished dancing without much heart. Her
Vision Scene was filled with softness, fluidity and unexpected
musical phrasing. She then became a queen, and a grand ballerina,
shifting between grandeur and melting love.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda McKerrow, Wednesday evening's Aurora, was an endearingly
coltish, spunky princess at the start and a wraith in her
delicately phrased Vision Scene. She embodied royal perfection in
the third act.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Manuel Carreno offered an elegantly danced performance as
the prince on Monday, but his remoteness and pedestrian acting made
a cypher of the character.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Roberts, the matinee Desire, wore his heart on his sleeve
throughout in stylish dancing filled with big, flowing mime and
polished partnering. Vladimir Malakhov's Desire, on Wednesday
night, was the idealized prince of 19th-century classicism in what
seemed like an exquisite drawing for a master painting.
</P>
<P>
   Only Christina Fagundes, at the matinee, brought the necessary
amplitude to the Lilac Fairy. Julie Kent added some charming bits
of emotional business on Monday. But Veronica Lynn was an
irritatingly well-behaved child as the evening Lilac Fairy.
</P>
<P>
   All three Carabosses were powerful, nuanced creations. On
Monday, Victor Barbee's evil fairy was a relatively young beauty.
Brian Reeder was a mocking, chill embodiment of evil as the
skirt-swirling matinee Carabosse. In the evening, Michael Owen
offered a complex portrait of a world-weary yet awesomely
commanding woman.

`FRIENDS AND ENEMIES OF NEW MUSIC': DEPENDING A BIT TOO MUCH ON THE
PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's natural for composers to look to music's past
for inspiration. Too many creators in all fields, especially
younger ones, make the mistake of trying to come up with something
entirely and shockingly new.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between drawing on models (and even
stealing ideas) from the past and simply evoking it. Such thoughts
were buzzing about on Wednesday night when the impishly titled
Friends and Enemies of New Music, a composer/performer collective,
presented its ninth anniversary concert at Weill Recital Hall.
Though the group has no fixed agenda, it seems to have attracted
mostly composers who still find potential in tonality as a musical
language. And more power to them, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the works performed, however, were not merely attentive,
but beholden to the past. For example, ``Three Silent Things,'' a
30-minute work for soprano, violin, viola, cello and piano,
composed by Daron Hagen in 1984, is curious music for a young man
to have written. A couple of the 10 texts he sets are unusual
choices, like the Adelaide Crapsey poem from which the title comes.
But most of the poets, like Walt Whitman and Robert Graves, have
been frequently turned to by American composers.
</P>
<P>
   The work begins with a Whitman text set to stern, proclamatory
music with hints of 12-tone complexity. Soon the piece shifts modes
and wistful tonality predominates. The composer deftly mixes spiky
rhythmic restlessness, jagged instrumental lines and crunchy
chords. But mostly the music recalls the lushly harmonic,
clear-textured styles of several mid-century conservative American
composers, and Hagen's own voice seems faint. Brenda Harris was the
sensitive soloist.
</P>
<P>
   Freshness and originality were similarly not the strong points
of ``The Husbands,'' a 1994 work by Tom Cipullo, for mezzo-soprano
(Mary Ann Hart) and baritone (Randall Scarlata), with flute, viola
and piano. But this work has surprises and finely wrought detail
that made it seem more individual. The text by William Carpenter
tells a mysterious tale of elderly ladies on a New England foliage
tour, who stop at a diner and meet, they believe, their deceased
husbands. The musical setting is richly harmonic, vocally
expansive, restless and often skillful. But Samuel Barber was more
modern.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, David Del Tredici was in the vanguard of
university-trained American composers who re-embraced tonality in
striking ways. He was represented here by four songs from his cycle
``Gay Life,'' written in 1996, and there is clearly a vigorous
compositional mind at work. But it was hard to tell how
straightforwardly we were to take Del Tredici's ruminative, thickly
chromatic tonal writing. For example, in his setting of an excerpt
from Lorca's sensual ``Four Ballads in Yellow,'' Del Tredici's
music sounded like Richard Strauss as a cocktail pianist.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking song was the fitful, punchy setting of Allen
Ginsberg's ``Personals Ad.'' In the piano part, fanfarelike
outbursts collided with insistent, even desperate, descending
chromatic lines. John Kelly delivered the text in the style of a
raspy cabaret singer, and Del Tredici played the piano part
vividly.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Ben Yarmolinsky's ``Amendments' was promising: to
set, with deadpan seriousness, amendments to the Constitution, the
Miranda warning and the presidential oath. But the music, with its
hymnal harmonies and oom-pah-pah dance riffs, did not have enough
profile to stand against these iconic texts, though the baritone
Ryan Allen brought an amusing, pontifical quality to his singing.
John Link's ``Whirligig'' for marimba, which had its New York
premiere, shifts constantly from undulant repetitive patterns to
bursts of stuttering chords. Thomas Kolor played it dynamically.
</P>
<P>
   The most original work was ``Dynaflow Drive Descant'' by Matthew
Guerrieri. Over a tape recording of Chopin's Fantasy-Impromptu as
performed in 1947 by the Harmonicats, a harmonica trio, a solo
flute makes edgy, jabbingly funny musical commentary. The
recording, played through a small boom box, became like some
weirdly familiar but disorienting accompaniment to the commanding
flute of Margaret Lancaster. And it was refreshing to have at least
one composer thumb his nose at music's past.

IN HONG KONG, 40,000 COMMEMORATE VICTIMS OF TIANANMEN SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Nine years after the Chinese military suppressed
pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, China's newest
citizens gathered here by the tens of thousands Thursday evening
for a candlelight vigil to honor those who died on June 4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first commemoration in Hong Kong of the killings
around the square since the former British colony reverted to
Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a rainstorm that cut short the ceremony and threatened
to turn Victoria Park into a flood plain, about 40,000 people
huddled under umbrellas that glowed softly with the light of
candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the hand-over, we really are fighting for democracy on
our own soil,'' said Cheung Man-kwong, a local pro-democracy
politician who led the crowd in chanting ``The people will not
forget!'' and ``We will fight to the end!''
</P>
<P>
   For Hong Kong, the rally marked the second powerful display of
democratic sentiment in two weeks. Late last month a record number
of people defied another torrential rainstorm to vote in
legislative elections. Cheung and other pro-democracy candidates
were swept to victory.
</P>
<P>
   As in past years, the rally's organizers laid wreaths and hung
placards around the soccer fields in this sprawling park to honor
the hundreds of protesters who were killed when Chinese soldiers
forced their way into Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to come, no matter what,'' said Andy Kan, a 45-year-old
real estate agent who flew from Vancouver to attend the rally.
``What happened in Tiananmen Square showed how important the fight
for democracy is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Chan, a 29-year-old secretary who stood stoically in the
rain with her husband, Simon, said Hong Kong needed to show Beijing
its commitment to democracy. ``We can't forget the people who died
for freedom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chan said she had doubted that the Hong Kong government
would allow the vigil, which has been held annually since 1990, to
continue after the hand-over. Still, she gave China little credit
for being tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are very clever,'' she said, ``They can't
suppress everything, with the whole world watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang Tai, 39, a chef at a retirement home, said he chose to
attend the vigil this year for the first time because Hong Kong was
now part of China. ``It's more meaningful this year because it will
show whether the Chinese government will allow any freedom here,''
he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the crowd was smaller than last year's turnout of
55,000, the rally's organizers claimed victory, given the
forbidding weather. Attendance has waxed and waned since 1989, when
one million people marched through Hong Kong's central business
district to protest the Tiananmen Square massacre. But the rally
continues to attract a cross-section of Hong Kong people, from
students and families to business people, who come from work in
suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   An emotional high point came when Wang Dan, a student leader of
the democracy movement who was jailed by Beijing and freed in
April, spoke to the crowd by telephone from New York, where he has
begun a life in exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope Hong Kong will be an important step in the future
democratization of China,'' Wang said, adding that he hoped to
visit the city soon.
</P>
<P>
   Wang also bantered with one of Hong Kong's most senior
pro-democracy politicians, Szeto Wah, who sounded like a concerned
uncle as he inquired about Wang's health, his studies and his
mother. As Wang signed off, a clap of thunder reverberated off the
high-rise apartments that surround Victoria Park.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears that the government would muzzle anti-Chinese
protests after the hand-over, police were scarcely noticeable
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Anson Chan, the chief secretary of the Hong Kong government,
said in an interview with a Japanese television network earlier
Thursday that the rally proved ``there is no change to the rights
and freedoms enjoyed by the Hong Kong people.'' &QL;

   280&AMP;ADD  PANEL TO STUDY HOLOCAUST-ERA
ASSETS IN U.S. ADVANCES IN HOUSE
 &HT;     By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a search for ``retrospective justice,'' the
House Banking Committee voted Thursday to create a commission to
conduct research on Holocaust-era assets under U.S. government
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inquiries into the nature of evil and how to behave in the
face of it are not the normal stuff of congressional hearings,''
said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the panel's chairman. But the
commission's work is vital so that each generation can ``learn from
the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved Thursday would form a 19-member U.S. Holocaust
Assets Historical Commission that would study what happened to
gold, gems, cash and art works that came under control of the U.S.
government after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933. The
panel would also review other public and private research on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   A final report would be submitted to President Clinton by Dec.
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton strongly supports establishing the commission,
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat told the committee
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel ``will send a message that the United States
government is determined to address the fate of Holocaust assets
here at home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat has conducted extensive studies of how Swiss banks
helped Nazi Germany obtain currency for gold looted from Holocaust
victims and how nations neutral during World War II sold Germany
crucial war materiel.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Reuters reported that three major Swiss banks
have offered Jewish negotiators more than $1 billion to settle
claims for failing to return Holocaust-era assets.
</P>
<P>
   The offer came within the past few days from Union Bank of
Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp and Credit Suisse, the report said. It
said negotiations were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat's most recent report, released this week, focuses on
how Nazi Germany used the looted gold to sustain its war effort.
</P>
<P>
   It complements a May 1997 on the Swiss banks ``by illuminating
the trade as well as the financing side of the equation,''
Eizenstat told the Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Using U.S. documents, including those captured from the Nazis, a
task force supervised by Eizenstat found that five neutral
countries fed the Nazi war effort by supplying Germany with its
major resources.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal and Spain, for example, provided Germany's wartime
supply of wolfram, a mineral used to produce tungsten, used in
steel alloy for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden provided iron ore, also used to make weapons, and Turkey
sold Germany chromium, essential for building tanks and planes.
Argentina provided a base for smuggling. Finally, Sweden supplied
Germany with food and arms, Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   These dealings took place perhaps due to fear of the Germans or
the desire to ``reap economic rewards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat noted the inconsistent actions of these nations. For
example, they all allowed thousands of Jews fleeing the Holocaust
to enter their country. The key to understanding these nations'
neutrality is understanding when it became clear that the Nazi
aggression was distinct from other European wars, Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat's report also addresses the failure of these countries
to return the looted gold it acquired from Nazi Germany. Less than
$20 million of up to $240 million acquired by the wartime neutrals,
apart from Switzerland, was returned to the Tripartite Gold
Commission, which processes claims from the central banks of 15
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat also commended other efforts to explore Holocaust-era
issues, including hearings held in February on a bill introduced by
Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., that seeks to help Holocaust survivors
recover life insurance benefits denied to them after World War II.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin finds himself in a country
which does not actually belong to or obey him any more.
</P>
<P>
   This is not only because it has become apparent that the Russian
president, as true of Mikhail Gorbachev once, feels much more
comfortable abroad than in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's popularity is down because Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed's
is up.
</P>
<P>
   By winning the race for governor last month in the vast,
mineral-rich, southern Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, Lebed, the
48-year-old, high-profile, former paratroop general, also wins
himself a place in Russia's presidential elections in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   By now it seems that not merely Lebed won a new place in
Russia's national limelight. Another factor won: It is the new hope
which has won out. Should Lebed prove to be able to maintain this
hope until Russia's presidential elections, he will enter the
Kremlin, sweeping aside all the other candidates _ including the
beleaguered Yeltsin or any Yeltsin-backed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does not like Yeltsin any more. In Lebed, it has a new
magician now or, perhaps, a new trouble on its hands. But the fear
of possible trouble is outweighed by what is almost sacred for
Russia _ a hope, a new fairy tale. For with the Krasnoyarsk
victory, millions in Russia are prepared to believe in a new fairy
tale, in a new ``father of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, of course, this military man, as commander of the
14th army division, used his power and influence to finally put a
stop to the bloody Chechen war. For that, he earned not the
congratulations, but the enmity of Yeltsin, who saw in it the
ambition of a rival to be president. As such Yeltsin sacked Lebed
from his job as Russia's top national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, Yeltsin is still able to make a number of the
unpredictable moves characteristic of him. After all, this
president enjoys rights under a Constitution tailored to suit him
and he may once again choose to shake the world by some extravagant
escapade. But he won't accomplish anything of substance.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Lebed will have a seat on the Federation Council,
the upper house of Russia's Parliament. He holds a popular moral
authority _ indeed an immunity which Yeltsin himself used to enjoy
from any real or imagined accusations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, unless Lebed fails to learn anything from the mistakes
made by his former and present rivals, he is likely to enter the
Kremlin no matter what barricades are thrown up in his path.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes are rather obvious; the general must have memorized
them by now. Lebed will not try to play the role of a rowdy
politician like the ultra-nationalist Zhirinovsky. He will not
confuse people with statements about restoring Sevastopol and
Crimea to Russia like Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov does. He will not
get himself televised after midnight in saunas or houses of ill
repute. He will not hasten to write books and keep the profits. He
will not order from France pedigree cows or indulge himself in
finding new wives and lovers.
</P>
<P>
   By now, having secured for himself a serious chance to win the
presidency, Lebed is not going to make frequent trips abroad,
ingratiatingly holding ``friend Helmut Kohl'' by the waist or
jesting with Mr. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed has already established that his one and only love is
Russia. No one doubts this. With some talent, he has recruited to
his support all those ``insulted and humiliated,'' from Kaliningrad
to Nakhodka, who are disillusioned with and rejected by the
government and Yeltsin. This growing number of Russia's dejected
will vote for Lebed in 2000, or more accurately against any
candidate nominated by the government or, even worse, backed by
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   With all that has befallen Russia _ the collapsed economy, the
social decline, the unpaid salaries, the disappearance of public
services _ Yeltsin will not be helped out in the next elections by
the tricks that have worked in prior races: not the Moscow bankers'
money, nor the intellectual horror of the Moscow elite, nor the
Federation Council's gubernatorial jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   The most helpless one in this tussle will be President Yeltsin.
Even now, those surrounding Yeltsin, in their minds, have already
fled. As for the power structures and the military that Yeltsin has
in fact been leaning on since 1993, while trying to appear loyal to
him, they will try to coordinate their every move with every move
Lebed makes. The generals may wear the stars that Yeltsin pinned on
them, but they will serve him looking over their shoulder at the
other man.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also danger. The measure of confidence the newly
elected Krasnoyarsk governor is going to get if he wins the Russian
presidential elections will make people accept not just his
presidency, but also his dictatorship. Lebed will be saying that
his rule is a special brand of leadership _ a monarchy of the law,
conscience and order. Who will argue against it in Russia's current
poverty-stricken state?
</P>
<P>
   As for fascism, no one has proven yet that Russia is afraid of
fascism. Yeltsin has already laid a foundation of tolerance toward
limited fascism and, in many cases, the State Duma has openly
sabotaged the passing of antifascist legislation.
</P>
<P>
   As for the vaccination against fascism the people are said to
have received, this is a dangerous myth. Those who lived under
communism are not to be intimidated by fascism.
</P>
<P>
   Now about money.
</P>
<P>
   They say that despite an $80,000 limit on spending set by
Krasnoyarsk's regional law, Lebed's victory cost a fantastic sum of
money, and that should the ``oligarchs'' who in the past found it
in their interests to support Yeltsin, erect a strong political
obstacle for Lebed, the general would not be able to scrape up the
rubles to pay his fare to Moscow. But it is also reasonable to note
that a change of heart could see them voluntarily contributing to
the ``Lebed of Krasnoyarsk,'' so that he might become the ``Lebed
of Moscow'' _ with no gratitude guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if Lebed gains in popularity and scores further victories,
one of the chapters in future Russian history is likely to be
called ``oligarchs in the general's servants' room.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Lebed seems to be sure to win, unless something
extraordinary intervenes.

DELIVER US: `JUNK MAIL' BELONGS IN DEAD-LETTER BOX 
</HEADLINE>

   UNDATED- It must be a small world after all, or at least the
part of it belonging to the world's mail carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, according to the Norwegian suspense film ``Junk
Mail,'' that mail carriers in Norway pull Newmans: They read other
people's letters and dump mail so they won't have to make
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Those revelations are slightly more interesting than the rest of
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Roy (Robert Skjaerstad) is a creepy, gloomy mail carrier who
emerges as the hero only because he is half a degree less creepy
and gloomy than everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Alienated from the rest of society, Roy spies on a young woman,
Line (Andrine Saether), then becomes involved with her when he
inadvertently stops her from committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Line is mixed up in something mysterious, involving stolen money
and a nasty thug, which puts Roy in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The more he runs from trouble, the further into it he gets.
However, perhaps that's not strange for a character who finds being
sent to the hospital in a coma rather enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junk Mail'' has all the trappings of an ordinary suspense
film. Halfway through, however, I began to suspect it was intended
by first-time Norwegian director Pal Sletaune to be a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the humor is as dry as an Arizona June at about 4 in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the post office gives Roy an award for refusing to
give up his mailbag when he's mugged by three junkies. In
actuality, Roy was trying his hardest to give up the bag, but the
strap kept getting caught on his jacket.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junk Mail'' does offer some sage advice: Don't move to Oslo,
or, if you do, handle your communications through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junk Mail'' won an award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997.
It's unclear why. But I don't think I'd like to see the competition
it beat.
</P>
<P>
   Unrated, ``Junk Mail'' contains an R-level of profanity and
nudity. In Norwegian with English subtitles. 2 stars. &QL;

   CHINA-TIANANMEN _ HONG KONG _ Shielding their candles from a
punishing rain, thousands of demonstrators held the first vigil on
Chinese soil Thursday night for their countrymen mowed down in the
Tiananmen Square democracy movement nine years ago. In a ceremony
dramatized by thunder and lightening amid the sweet, sad tones of
traditional Chinese music, a crowd that organizers estimated to
number 40,000 carried off a peaceful rally in Victoria Park.
Pro-democracy activists laid wreaths in memory of the victims. It
was the first memorial to the Tiananmen victims since Hong Kong was
restored to Chinese rule last summer, and thus the first such event
ever to take place in China. (Kunstel, Cox News Service).

REPUBLICANS BLAST ADMINISTRATION OVER MILITARY DEPOT CONTRACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican lawmakers threatened Thursday to stop
the Air Force from issuing contracts on work at two military depots
in California and Texas, citing a memo they said showed the Clinton
administration tried to manipulate the process.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters denied there was White
House pressure in the process and told the House National Security
Committee that his memo was written ``in haste'' and did not
reflect the ``nuances'' of conversations with President Clinton's
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   But the House committee chairman, Rep. Floyd Spence of South
Carolina, said the memo underscored a three-year White House effort
to manipulate the closing of McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento
and Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio in exchange for political
support during the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``That memo appears to be the most recent _ and most public _
evidence of what many see as a consistent pattern of behavior on
the part of the administration to skew competition for depot
workloads in the aftermath of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure
Commission's recommendation to reduce overhead and infrastructure
among Air Force depots by closing McClellan and Kelly air logistics
centers,'' Spence said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the three-year controversy also has doomed the prospect
of future rounds of base closings because lawmakers fear further
White House meddling.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the committee said they would join Spence in
writing legislation that would remove the Air Force from the
contract process at the installations in San Antonio and
Sacramento. Those installations are both destined for closure.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, the military has moved to shutter
bases and turn over some repair and maintenance work to private
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ciro D. Rodriguez, D-Texas, called the effort a political
charade and accused the committee of disguising its true intent: to
snare more depot jobs for bases in congressional districts and
protect them from efforts to privatize maintenance work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it ironic, the comments I'm hearing,'' Rodriguez told
Republicans on the committee. ``You want to privatize welfare. You
want to privatize housing.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to depot work, Rodriguez said, committee
members were opposed to privatization that could ``impact jobs in
your back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said taking the contract system away from the Air
Force would invite further politicization of the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is currently seeking contracts for $200 million in
aircraft repair at McClellan and $660 million in aircraft engine
repair at Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Peters recused himself from the process following the release of
his April 26 memo to Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre. In that
memo, Peters said John Podesta, deputy White House chief of staff,
urged the Air Force to induce Lockheed Martin Corp. to compete for
the repair work at Sacramento and keep the workload at the base
when it closes and is turned over to the city in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Corp. also is bidding on the work, and if successful,
would move half of the workload to Hill Air Force base near Ogden,
Utah, and move repair of the KC-135 tanker aircraft to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Hansen, R-Utah, said he was incensed at the White
House's attempt to steer the contract away from his base and
charged that such behavior was ``unethical and potentially
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed also is bidding on the $660 million engine work at
Kelly. The company plans to move half of the workload to Tinker Air
Force Base outside Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Following release of the memo, Defense Secretary William Cohen
said a panel of outside advisers would review the contract process
for work at Kelly and McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   Two Air Force officials told the National Security Committee
Thursday that the process would be fair and free of political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a shrinking violet,'' said Darlene Druyun, Air Force
deputy assistant secretary. ``The integrity of the process will be
pristine.''
</P>
<P>
   J.S. Gansler, a Defense Department undersecretary, said: ``The
competition will be fair and open.''

`HEROES' A ZERO AS MEM ORY OF FARLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Those of us who were big fans of the big man maintain
many great memories of Chris Farley. ``Almost Heroes'' won't be one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   We can crack up just picturing Farley's wild romps through
``Saturday Night Live.'' We treasure those hilarious moments he
created in inadequate comedies, such as ``Beverly Hills Ninja'' and
``Black Sheep.'' We know ``Tommy Boy'' proved that when Farley had
a good story and solid support, he could be among the best, a guy
we loved and loved to laugh at.
</P>
<P>
   The rotund comedian, who died too young, left behind two final
gifts for his fans: ``Almost Heroes,'' in which he stars, and the
upcoming Norm MacDonald comedy, ``Dirty Work,'' in which he has a
small role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Heroes'' is nothing great, but it does have some of
those great Farley moments. His fans have to take what they can get
now.
</P>
<P>
   Farley and Matthew Perry (``Friend's``) play two explorers in
1804 trying to beat the Lewis and Clark expedition across the
wilderness to the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Bartholomew Hunt (Farley) is a mountain man who looks like a man
mountain, while Leslie Edwards (Perry) is a fop who brings a tea
service into the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   With their crew of trusty idiots, Hunt and Edwards bumble
through encounters with a mad conquistador, wild animals and
not-so-wild Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this kind of overdone spoof is that you don't
get caught up in the story.
</P>
<P>
   There is no story that won't be sacrificed at the slightest
opportunity for a pratfall.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Almost Heroes,'' it's mosey down the trail, do
something silly, then mosey farther down the trail.
</P>
<P>
   How much you enjoy the movie depends entirely on whether you get
caught up in the collection of slapstick, sight gags and general
silliness.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Christopher Guest, ``Almost Heroes'' has
some great moments but more than its share of clunkers, too. It
hops down that trail of laughs with one foot tied behind its back.
</P>
<P>
   Guest has a flair for offbeat gags, but ``Almost Heroes'' is
nowhere nearly as funny as his inspired ``Waiting for Guffman.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that earlier film was tied together with a good story
and characters you could care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Heroes'' has Chris Farley.
</P>
<P>
   If this were just another of Farley's films, you'd think: OK,
he's getting better . . . a definite step up from ``Beverly Hills
Ninja.`` Sometime soon, he'll get cast in a movie worthy of his
comic talents.
</P>
<P>
   Too late.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13, ``Almost Heroes'' contains minor profanity and
nudity, and some risque humor.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the movie's comedy is pitched at the perfect
level for kids, the filmmakers should have cleaned it up. 2 stars. &QL;

 &HT;    As minorities in opposite-race worlds, these two teens literally
stood out
 &HT;    By Bette Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--People do many things to stand out in a crowd. Joel
Bethea and Kelvin Lawrence simply went to high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep, I stood out,'' laughs Joel. ``Once my grandmother had to
pick me up at school, and she asked my mom how to find me. `It
isn't hard,' said my mom. `Just look for the white kid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joel is one of two white students graduating this month from
Southwest DeKalb High.
</P>
<P>
   It's equally easy to spot Kelvin Lawrence, one of six black
students in his senior class at Pope High in east Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my fabulous smile,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, both will celebrate their high school graduation.
They admit it wasn't always easy being a white face in a black
crowd or vice versa. But they didn't just survive their four years
of high school, they thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Joel helped edit the school newspaper and wrote a humor column
that, apparently, transcended racial lines. ``I heard a lot of,
`Hey, man, you're funny' comments from my fellow students,'' he
deadpans. He also showed athletic skill on the soccer field,
helping send his team to the playoffs this year. He enters Georgia
Tech in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin did so well academically at Pope that he earned a full
scholarship to Florida A&AMP;M University. A budding politician with
Democratic leanings, he threw himself into student government. This
year he served as class treasurer. He also played football, and his
fellow seniors liked him so much they voted him prom king.
</P>
<P>
   An academic decision
</P>
<P>
   For most students in public systems, address determines school
assignment. Not for Joel.
</P>
<P>
   In sixth grade he and about 60 other youngsters formed the
nucleus of DeKalb's first magnet class for gifted students. By
design, half the pupils were black.
</P>
<P>
   The group held together until the start of ninth grade, when all
but three of the white students left the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the other parents were saying, `It's OK for my
child to be in a mixed-racial classroom in sixth, seventh and
eighth grade, but now that he's getting into high school, this is
not OK,''' recalls Joel's father, Paul Bethea. ``At a meeting, a
parent actually said, `But who is he going to take to the prom?'
And I was thinking, `Goodness gracious, he's only in ninth
grade.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Betheas' chief concern was the school's academic excellence,
not its racial makeup. Ultimately, they chose Southwest because it
was closer to their Lithonia home than the other school that housed
the magnet program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't our motivation for him to go through a singular
racial experience, but to get a fine academic education at a school
where we could stay involved in PTA and other school activities,''
says Paul Bethea.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to send Joel to Southwest was made easier because
Wendy Bethea had graduated from predominantly black Bass High in
Atlanta in the 1970s. ``I knew it was possible to have a good
experience. I did,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   They knew they had made the right choice after Joel completed
ninth grade. ``The magnet program sent a card each year asking if
he wanted to transfer to another school. We told him it was his
choice. And every year he'd write, `No,' and send it back,'' Wendy
Bethea says.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin had less choice in his school. He simply attended the one
to which he was assigned, mostly white Pope High.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Cobb was about all I knew,'' he says. ``My parents moved
there when I was 4 because my father's office was nearby. I grew up
with white kids.''
</P>
<P>
   His mom, Linda Lawrence, says she never worried about Kelvin
attending predominantly white schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's easygoing and people always like him,'' she says. ``Now
when I was in school, it was different. I went to an all-white
girls school (in Louisiana) and when I walked down the halls,
they'd say, `There goes one of them.' But that was back in the
'60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the neighborhood in which Kelvin grew up, his mom
says, ``I know he'll have more opportunities in life than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering high school
</P>
<P>
   Joel and Kelvin both attended opposite-race elementary and
middle schools. Still, they found high school, in the words of
Joel, ``a bit of a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing being a different fish in a small pond, but quite
another being a different fish in a big pond. In both cases, the
pond was more like an ocean; both Pope and Southwest DeKalb have
about 2,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember walking down the hall when everyone was in there,
and you felt self-conscious. You do stick out,'' Joel says. The
presence of his friends from the magnet program meant he didn't
feel like a complete outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Joel, Kelvin had a brush with racism long before high
school. ``It was at a day care center,'' he says. ``A kid would
say, `Don't play with him.' And one day they threw rocks at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering ninth grade, he says, he was prepared for the worst and
delighted when it didn't come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninth grade was easy because I was going to school with my
friends,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In his sophomore year, however, a few students did make race an
issue. Some of them began fighting after school, white kids vs.
black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone at school knew they were fighting. It was kind of
funny,'' he says. ``As soon as the last bell rang you'd hear people
saying, `Can you give me a ride to the fight?'''
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin stayed out of the fray, but Joel wasn't so lucky. In his
freshman year, a small group of what he calls ``juvenile
delinquents'' beat up him and his white friend Louis Belott.
</P>
<P>
   Bethea was left with scrapes and bruises. There was, however, a
happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazingly, it was a positive experience,'' Wendy Bethea says.
``Because other kids began helping him and named all the kids who
were involved. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers and students were so appalled and told him they
were so saddened by it, because they didn't feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the good times roll
</P>
<P>
   By the time they became juniors, Lawrence and Bethea had settled
in to their minority status at their respective high schools. They
even began to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   One recent night after work _ he works part-time at Smoothie
King near his home _ Kelvin and a few friends sat down to talk
about him and his relationships at school. Their jocular intimacy
and ability to make light of race were apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go downtown we always take him with us,'' teased Pope
senior Joe Daniel. The group laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' said Gregg Nelson, another Pope senior, ``he's
going to be a politician and maybe the first black president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an incredible friend and he's going to go far,'' says
Kerry Alexander, another Pope senior, who was Lawrence's date to
the prom. ``It's a running thing with his friends that he's going
to become the first black president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone loves him,'' says Joe. ``I've never been around
anyone who's had a problem with Kelvin. Even my parents, who were
raised pretty prejudiced, really like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin is so comfortable with his situation that even when he
realized a white girl he was dating was ``only using'' him to get
back at her parents, he shrugged it off. ``Just another life
experience,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joel, too, became more comfortable with his status as a racial
minority. He whooped with laughter the day he received a letter
telling him he had been recommended for a college scholarship
reserved for African-Americans. ``An irony,'' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   He also admits to secretly enjoying when someone would ask him
where he went to school. ``I'd say Southwest DeKalb, and they'd go,
``'Scuse me. You go to which school?''' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   And no, he doesn't rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``With rap you've got to be really good at it,'' he notes.
``Otherwise people are going to laugh and say, `Look at that white
guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Commonalities
</P>
<P>
   Joel and Kelvin share traits that helped them thrive in
surroundings others would have found difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Each faced their years in a middle-class high school with an
open mind and a willingness to adapt to their environment. Their
opposite-race classmates admired them, both for their athletic
abilities and their brains. And each was voted ``most
intellectual'' by their fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   Both also enjoy making people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, my sense of humor helped a lot,'' says Kelvin,
sitting with Joel after having their pictures taken for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same here,'' says Joel. ``It loosens people up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors helped too, they say. Joel cites his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just their general attitude,'' he says. ``It was like, `This
is normal. It's no big deal. It's an everyday thing.' It wasn't,
`Oh, you're so wonderful for putting up with this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing,'' Kelvin opines, ``the vast majority of people
I went to school with weren't from the South. I think coming from
the North, they had more open minds and fewer prejudices.''
</P>
<P>
   As for dating, both have gone out with girls of the opposite
race. Neither Joel's nor Kelvin's parents view this as a problem.
Says Paul Bethea, ``We haven't put any restrictions on him at all
in the dating department.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither has gone steady with an opposite-race girl, so far. ``I
would, but I just haven't found anyone I've wanted to go steady
with _ white or black,'' Kelvin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't either,'' says Joel. ``But currently I'm in the
talking phase with a girl I like, and she's black.''
</P>
<P>
   The racial divide
</P>
<P>
   The two seniors share one high school experience that left them
somewhat unnerved: hearing classmates make off-putting racial
remarks in their presence.
</P>
<P>
   For Joel, the moment occurred during a casual conversation with
some black friends about college plans. A girl said she didn't want
to go to the University of Georgia if it meant she'd have a white
roommate. Realizing he was present, she quickly added, ``No
offense, Joel.''
</P>
<P>
   He bristles at such attitudes when they come from his
classmates. ``I've had a lot of them tell me, `You're the coolest
white guy I know.' Why can't I just be the coolest guy?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Kelvin's case, the incident also occurred during a group
conversation. ``Someone in the group said, `But Kelvin isn't black,
he's Kelvin.' And I thought, `That feels strange. I am black.'''
The comment disturbed him _ he took it to mean the student thought
he was all right, but not necessarily other blacks _ but he never
mentioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin struggles with the notion that although the white
students at Pope accept him, some still prejudge other blacks. He
takes that attitude personally, quoting Christ from the Bible: ``As
ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have
done it unto me.''
</P>
<P>
   More so than Kelvin, Joel talks about his classmates' general
attitude about race. ``I think a lot of them are distrustful,
uneasy, unaccustomed to being around white people,'' he says.
``They have misconceptions and preconceptions. That they're put
upon. That the school isn't as good because they're black. That
white people are given more. It's stronger in some people than
others.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's stopped trying to change their minds. ``It's a
losing battle. It's something you can't do by debating them. It's
something they have to find out on their own. Occasionally, they've
tuned me out because I'm white and it's like, `What do you know?'''
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor Kelvin claim they've made a real difference in
bringing the races closer. But Kelvin's best friend, Pope senior
J.P. Fournier, who is white, disagrees. He says Kelvin has broken
stereotypes for Pope students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they get to know a single black person like Kelvin,
who's a good, decent person, a smart person, then they have the
opportunity to be more open to all black people,'' J.P. says.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bethea says even he has grown from his son's experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I went to a meeting at Southwest DeKalb with
all those black parents, I was uncomfortable. But that passed with
time. Joel's experience has proven to me that, if you give it a
chance, people really can become colorblind.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel's best friends are Alonzo Ward II, who is black, and Navin
Ravi Maharaj, an Indian from Trinidad. All are graduating from
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo's father, Alonzo Ward, says: ``Their experience there,
well, it's just knocking down so many walls. We can only hope that
they will go out into the world and be beacons.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin and Joel do claim one thing, that they know how people
can begin to heal America's racial divide.
</P>
<P>
   Says Kelvin, ``Two words: hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel agrees: ``Give it a shot. Go over to the new neighbors.
Don't avoid them. Have a barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't prejudge people you aren't familiar with,'' Kelvin
says. ``Make a conscious effort to get to know other people with an
open mind.''

 &HT;    An off-duty hero: `Six Days' delivers Harrison Ford lite
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 7: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York
</P>
<P>
   Outside on Central Park South, the scene is barely controlled
bedlam. Security sawhorses range all over the broad street, where
irate cabbies are sounding off at hundreds of cops locking things
down in preparation for a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The whole world seems to be coming together just a few floors
beneath the window at the elegant Essex House hotel, yet Harrison
Ford is lost somewhere deep within his own thoughts, describing a
place even he's not sure actually exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every man's fantasy to have a little house on the
beach,'' Ford says, his words spilling out as spontaneously as a
young boy startled from his treehouse. ``To have his airplane, to
have a simple life and not have to worry about responsibilities
and, uh, accoutrements.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford, footloose and fancy-free. If it's not exactly
what moviegoers have come to expect from an actor whose characters
tend to be as rock-solid as his box office numbers, well, give him
a break. In recent years, it seems like whenever Ford, 55, hasn't
had to rescue America from the clutches of an evil president
(``Clear and Present Danger''), he's actually had to be president
(``Air Force One'') and rescue America from the clutches of an evil
Russian terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder then that his latest role in the upcoming
romantic comedy ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' _ boozy, beach bumming,
barely-in-business pilot Quinn Harris _ is lighter than anything
Ford has played of late?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something that was not a suit-and-tie job,''
Ford explained. ``Something where I didn't have to go around
containing the tension all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   You want uncontained tension? Try asking Ford about his ``Six
Days'' co-star Anne Heche. Here he is, star of the ``Star Wars''
and ``Indiana Jones'' series. Equally beloved by the folks who buy
and sell movie tickets; he's the National Association of Theatre
Owners' star of the century, after all, not some mere decade. Yet
for months, most of the ``Six Days'' talk in Hollywood and the
media has centered on Heche. Her growing acclaim for her supporting
performances (``Donnie Brasco,'' ``Wag the Dog'') seemed to reach
its zenith last year when she snagged the plum role of Robin
Monroe, the Type A-plus New York magazine editor who winds up
stranded on a desert island with Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of all that talk initially was on Heche's seemingly
unlimited future in films. But it quickly turned to questions about
her believability as an onscreen love interest when she publicly
confirmed in spring 1997 that she was a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a what?''
</P>
<P>
   Ford interrupts the carefully worded question, his own voice
low-pitched and vaguely ominous in tone.
</P>
<P>
   Um, a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   You know, she lives with Ellen DeGeneres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh!'' Ford smacks his forehead in an exaggerated gesture, as
if to suggest that he (or at least one of the two people in this
room) is a bit foolish. ``I thought you said thespian.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the point. It's not just that he doesn't care what Heche
does in her private life _ although clearly he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care a (expletive) about anybody's private life as
long as it doesn't make the working relationship difficult,'' Ford
says with unmistakable intensity.
</P>
<P>
   No, what really stands out about this seemingly unscripted
moment is the way it shows off Ford's comic gift. No matter how
many times he replays the scene between now and the movie's opening
next Friday, Ford doubtless will be totally convincing going from
downright alarming to disarmingly funny in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has this sort of wonderful, natural comedic ability,'' says
``Six Days'' director Ivan Reitman, who knows from funny, having
directed everyone from Bill Murray (``Ghostbusters'') to Robin
Williams (``Fathers' Day.'') ``There's a sort of sardonic, grumpy
quality to him that he can turn into humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ford is at his sardonic, grumpy best in a scene where
Quinn removes a deadly snake that swims up Robin's shorts. She
frostily warns him against smiling about where his hand is, then
grudgingly tells him ``thanks'' for essentially saving her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not without skills,'' Ford snaps as he turns away from her
and slowly lets a devilishly charming and double entendre-packing
smile play across his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hilarious and charming and more real than he's ever been
on-screen,'' says Heche in the film's press kit. She suggests it
may not all be acting on Ford's part. ``I've kind of fallen in love
with working with him.''
</P>
<P>
   With enough marauding pirates and plane crash scenes to tempt a
little boy out of his treehouse, however, ``Six Days'' isn't all
romantic comedy. Reitman likens it to the circa-1940s
``character-based comedies'' rarely made now because ``you don't
have the movie stars you used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Except maybe for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harrison Ford is a guy who holds his own with Humphrey Bogart,
Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy,'' said Reitman, who senses some irony
in Ford's popularity. ``Because he's been so successful and because
he does such populist movies, there's a tendency _ as with all
those great stars until about 50 years later _ to not appreciate
the really good work that's going on and the subtlety of what he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Heche saw Ford as ``larger than life,'' something he apparently
never noticed on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a healthy disregard for me and my .I.I. whatever I
represent,'' Ford waved his hands in the air a bit helplessly as
his mouth twisted into a wry smile. ``She was actively needling,
and that was very appropriate to the (characters') relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being larger than life does have its perks. Ford had
a say in everything from casting Heche to how the movie should end.
On the other hand, it all sounds like a lot of responsibility for
someone who says it's every man's fantasy to have none at all.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ford's home in Wyoming is awfully far away from any
beach, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right.'' Standing up for a goodbye handshake, Ford seems
unable to suppress a small grin. ``But I'm not far away from an
understanding of what the attraction would be.''

 &HT;    Look who's 40: Our biggest pop stars are hitting midlife.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years after Prince wore his skin-tight yellow butt-less pants,
Madonna's crosses dangled over cleavage and bare midriff and
Michael Jackson's silver glove glistened as he did the moonwalk,
they are still very much in the public consciousness. Mainly
because they are bigger than their music. They're mega pop stars
with instantly identifiable images who've influenced hairstyles,
clothes, sounds and stage performances through their entire
careers.
</P>
<P>
   They became stars in the decade that pop went boom: the '80s.
Jackson's 1982 ``Thriller,'' which became the biggest-selling album
ever (48 million), created a new benchmark against which all other
performers were measured.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now the standards Madonna, Michael Jackson and Prince set
for themselves, and for this music business, they find themselves
up against,'' notes longtime Rolling Stone writer Anthony DeCurtis.
``They're trying to find a way to not be blockbusters and still
have a career in this business. Country and R&AMP;B seem to be more
tolerant of aging artists. Rock 'n' roll expects you to be 20 for
the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning 40 is no longer the curse in the music business it once
was. After all, Mick Jagger, who once said he didn't want to be 40
playing ``Satisfaction'' in Vegas, is 54 and playing
``Satisfaction'' in Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these three people _ forces that they are _ are trying to
defy the rule and see what the next stage is,'' adds DeCurtis, 46,
``with, obviously, varying degrees of success. But there's not a
lot of models here. They are still pioneers.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Jackson, Madonna and the Artist who doesn't want to be
called Prince chart the course to where they go next, we thought
we'd note where they are:
</P>
<P>
   THE ARTIST
</P>
<P>
   (Prince Rogers Nelson) (Born June 7)
</P>
<P>
   -- Personal:
</P>
<P>
   After dating a harem of slinky women (Vanity, Apollonia, Kim
Basinger), he settled down with Mayte in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   -- His image:
</P>
<P>
   He's gone from a gender-bender with a name we could pronounce,
to a pretty regular-looking guy (albeit, in heels) who can spend an
hour with Oprah Winfrey. It's that name, then that symbol that
still distances him from the public.
</P>
<P>
   -- His music:
</P>
<P>
   He could stand to slow down production a bit. There was the
three-CD ``Emanci-
</P>
<P>
   pation'' last year. The three-CD ``Crystal Ball'' a few months
back. And another on the way this month. Still, this work is better
than the uninspired contract obligations he released during his
fight with Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   -- :His impact:
</P>
<P>
   He made funk rock 'n' roll. It sounds simple. But when it came
out of his malleable voice or one of the many instruments he
played, it was so compelling he made you see purple rain and doves
cry. D'Angelo, Tony Rich and Maxwell count him among their
influences. ``He showed me there were no boundaries musically,''
Rich says.
</P>
<P>
   MADONNA
</P>
<P>
   (Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone) (Born Aug. 16)
</P>
<P>
   -- Personal:
</P>
<P>
   She's been divorced for nine years from actor Sean Penn. The
single mother gave birth to Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon in October
1996.
</P>
<P>
   -- Her image:
</P>
<P>
   Ever changing as usual. But since motherhood the volume on
whatever image she chooses has toned down a lot. No more pointed
cone bras or dominatrix gear. Now it's long, simple hair and pretty
everyday-looking couture. What she says now is often more striking
than what she wears.
</P>
<P>
   -- Her music:
</P>
<P>
   It's ever changing as well. Reviewers widely hailed her latest
electronica-influenced ``Ray of Light'' CD as one of her best ever.
But at its essence, it's still very much the dance music that got
her out of her New York studio apartment and onstage singing her
first hit, ``Everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Her impact:
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, Madonna is a self-made woman. Drive personified.
She took so-so vocal skills, dance club moves and great club tracks
and became a pop star much bigger than her individual parts. Who
has she influenced? Isn't it obvious? Any dance diva since her 1983
debut, including Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson and the late Selena.
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL JOSEPH JACKSON
</P>
<P>
   (Born Aug. 29)
</P>
<P>
   -- Personal:
</P>
<P>
   After a 20-month marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, Jackson wed
nurse Debbie Rowe, the mother of their boy and girl, Prince and
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   -- His image:
</P>
<P>
   He needs more rehabilitating than he's done with his face. But
let's start there. When he started lightening his skin around 1987
_ for medical reasons or not _ he stripped away a sizable amount of
his core black audience. The overarching ambitions (``Call me King
of Pop'') widened the chasm as did the child molestation
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   -- His music:
</P>
<P>
   It's been all downhill since he split with Quincy Jones (``Off
the Wall,'' ``Thriller'') _ musically and sales wise. Where he was
once singing ``Rock With You,'' now he chirps, curses and talks his
way through gigantic productions such as ``Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   -- His impact:
</P>
<P>
   Since he was a preteen, he's been one of the world's best and
best-known entertainers. That's why he's still making a great
living performing _ outside the United States. ``No matter what
happens offstage, he's still the man when he's on it,'' says R&AMP;B
vocalist Usher, who along with Puff Daddy, considers Jackson a big
influence.

 &HT;    He's rich and wacky and into the art of discovery
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 7: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amarillo, Texas _ He's been called ``Amarillo's version of
Picasso'' and ``a lunatic.'' He once brought a bucket of cow manure
to John Connally's bribery trial in Washington, and asked Pat Nixon
in a letter to donate her clothes to his Museum of Decadent Art.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he has publicly stated that he wanted to legalize
insanity, and to ``encourage art for art's sake and use it to fight
back the ever-rising flood of philistinism.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also one of the richest men in west Texas, freely admitting
his membership in what locals call the Lucky Sperm Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy was rich, my momma was good-looking and my wife's
family owns a 200-square-mile ranch. So these are my toys,''
Stanley Marsh 3 (the third generation oil and gas heir considers
III too pretentious) says of the outdoor installations, such as
Cadillac Ranch, that he has either helped erect or commissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Marsh's day is taken up with business, including
ownership of a local TV station. But his 12th floor headquarters in
downtown Amarillo is as unconventional as the owl-eyed,
mustachioed, 60-year-old Marsh. It's a kind of open-air artists'
collective; homemade spears are stacked against one wall, a blowup
of Howard Beale's ``Network'' screed against the inanity of TV
(``I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore'') hangs
from another.
</P>
<P>
   The activities inside the floor's various offices are never
predictable: In one room this afternoon, a state senator held a
business meeting; Marsh had lent his own office to a magazine
writer, who was using it to interview a half-dozen local punks.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh's views on art are equally unconventional, especially when
he talks about how museums can pervert our notions of art and why
he prefers his art outdoors. Here's a typically Holden
Caulfield-esque sampling, spoken in Marsh's deliberate twang:
</P>
<P>
   ``Art museums make things precious,'' Marsh begins. ``When you
walk into one, there's the staff, the architecture, the rules of
parking, the hours it's opened. First, you walk by a guard, there
are cameras everywhere, then there's a docent trying to sign you up
as a member. Then you walk into a room, there's no smoking, no
breathing, no cursing allowed. Then you see an enormous gold and
bronze frame, it's huge, spotlit, while the rest of the room is lit
like the dark end of a church. Then next to the painting there's a
plaque that tells you it's by Peter Paul Rubens and that it was
donated by Mrs. Oglethorpe Peachtree Peachtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that by the time you look at the painting by Rubens, you're
so intimidated that all you can say is `It's a masterpiece!'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took that Rubens and hung it under an expressway, or in
a filling station, or in the lobby of a movie house, or in the
grocery store over the cash register, people might say, `That's a
pretty nifty painting,' or `Those girls are too fat, and anybody
who'd spend that much time painting each leaf like that must not
have much else to do.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I happen to like Rubens. But unless you've gone to a
school where you were taught how to look at such things, the museum
destroys your ability to like it or not. Museums contain things
that are not necessarily art, but which are precious. They're
depositories _ treasures that rich people have made. There's no
reason a lot of things are there, except they're very valuable and
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was king, I would take the paintings and hang them
without labels that you could see right way. And I would hang them
where people could see them. A great place would be at the top of
an escalator in a mall. Then a certain number of people would
really have their socks knocked off, and the painting wouldn't end
up being cherished. To take all this stuff and hide it in museums
is insulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I make things that are hidden, but I'm not a very good
hider. They're hidden where most people can see them when they bump
into them _ you don't have to trek to the top of the Sierra Madres.
They see it where they don't expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an Easter egg hunt.''

 &HT;    Texas has always set itself apart _ and this art is right up
there
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 7: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   Amarillo, Texas--Stanley Marsh 3 provides roadside sideshows.
The rest is up to you. ``After you see it, either you liked it or
you didn't,'' says Marsh. ``At least you're deciding.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're driving through the Texas Panhandle, here's a rundown
of what you can see:
</P>
<P>
   CADILLAC RANCH
</P>
<P>
   Best postcard in America. The authentic Caddys are arranged
chronologically by model year, from '49 to '63. They lean east at
the same slope as Egypt's great Pyramids _ a nice, New Agey touch
to an installation inspired by the horizon-to-horizon oceanscape
the plains here resemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was a dolphin idea,'' art conspirator Doug Michaels
has recalled of being shown the spot by Marsh in the late '70s.
``(We) were standing in a wheat field off Route 66 in the rain. And
you know how the wheat waves and ripples in the wind? Well,
suddenly we imagined a dolphin tail fin sticking up out of the
wheat. Then the dolphin tail fin became a Cadillac fin. That was
it. That was Cadillac Ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillacs were exhumed and reburied a couple miles west last
year _ it seemed like half the city stood on the plains to watch _
when nearby development threatened their seclusion. ``The girls
(the cars) didn't like the smell of the city,'' Marsh has
explained. ``They like the fragrance of cow manure and wheat and
new-broken sod.''
</P>
<P>
   The classic cars are now covered in graffiti, with some parts
stolen by souvenir hunters. That jibes with the site's
for-the-people credo (like other Marsh sites, you just walk up to
it and look), but also makes it feel more neo-hippie than it
should.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cadillac Ranch is one odd, oddly awesome thing to stand
out there among, on what seems like the edge of the world _ this
strange metal crop seemingly made in the image of modern man's
highest aspiration: cool wheels. Don't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   FLOATING MESA
</P>
<P>
   The riskiest payoff, but worth a look-see. The drive winds
through burnt, rolling, ravine-filled land just outside Amarillo _
the real West. Then, in the distance, sprout three big,
dictionary-definition mesas _ an even realer West.
</P>
<P>
   In a certain light _ probably best in early morning _ the mesa
on the far right can look a little peculiar. There's a band of sky
between the top and the rest, leaving the top to look as if it's
... floating?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a stranger, from a long way off, maybe you think
it's a cow patty in the sky. Or maybe a flying saucer,'' says
Marsh, who had 180 feet of 8-foot-tall fence painted the same color
as a light gray sky and erected around half the mesa.
</P>
<P>
   It can also look like 180 feet of 8-foot-tall painted fence
around a mesa. But it's such a nutty concept _ and such an
interesting drive _ it's worth checking out.
</P>
<P>
   OZYMANDIAS
</P>
<P>
   A weird winner. Two massive concrete legs severed above the
thigh, as if a larger warrior monument had been eroded by the wind,
rain and sun of millenniums. A sendup of the Shelley poem by the
same name that exults the impermanence of man-made monuments, it
was, says Marsh, ``Put up to make fun of myself. A monument to a
poem that makes fun of monuments.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in the middle of another wheat field, off a small
interchange several miles from Cadillac Ranch, this is the jokiest,
frankly funniest of Marsh's outdoor installations. It's fronted by
a replica of a Texas historic marker engraved with the site's
amusingly bogus story: that Shelley and his wife traveled across
Texas in the early 19th century and came across this statue, which
inspired him to write his famous poem. The rest of it _ including
its famous ``visage'' _ was destroyed by Lubbock high school
students after a football game with their archrivals in Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a camera: America's second-best postcard.
</P>
<P>
   GRAVE OF THE UNKNOWN PET
</P>
<P>
   A quick chuckle on Soncy Road, on the way to Ozymandias. My
Marsh-ordered tour guide (we traveled to the sites in a pink '59
Caddy) called it ``One of the small things not many people know
about.'' A 10-foot high wooden copy of the obelisk in the movie
``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' it is a monument to all those pets
who've been lost and never found. Marsh suggests you visit it on
the anniversary day your pet (``snake, cat, dog'') disappeared and
feed a ``biscuit or a sandwich'' to the prairie dogs that live in
the field surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNS
</P>
<P>
   They're everywhere: empy lots, beside highways, on country roads
outside of town. Marsh plunks a sign in the yard of anybody who
wants one, free of charge. There are now so many, they're virtually
the official state shrub.
</P>
<P>
   In some neighborhoods, a message is related Burma Shave-style _
in successive signs down the road _ philosophizing on the nature
of, say, art. Others are more haphazard. Marsh won't give specific
locations for signs. I'm reluctant, too, for the same reason: Half
the effect is coming upon them out of the blue. But you won't be
disappointed if you head down Soncy Road, near downtown _ they're
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Among the signs out there: ``IF I WERE YOU,'' ``WITHOUT A NET,''
``I WAS MADE THIS WAY,'' ``BRING BACK PUBLIC HANGING'' and ``LAUGH
AND THE WORLD LAUGHS WITH YOU _ CRY AND YOU CRY ALONE.''
</P>
<P>
   One read ``STEAL THIS SIGN.'' Until somebody did.

the National Register of Historic Places. Lacking in addresses and
other concrete facts, this is more a well-illustrated reverie than
a true guide.

 &HT;    Driven to act, a free-spirited Texan makes the Panhandle a place
to pause.
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 7: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amarillo, Texas --The Texas Panhandle is ``drive through''
country. If you're here, you're probably driving through on your
way somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The late, great Route 66 once drifted through these booming
flatlands, hoodwinking passers-by to brake for roadside rattlesnake
farms and oddball reptile museums. But the stop-and-start Route 66
has long been replaced by clear-the-runway U.S. 40. The highway's
offramps let you make a pit stop for gas and a Yoo-Hoo, then head
right back out, Amarillo already a tiny toy town in your rearview
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   And then, just as what passes for sprawl in Amarillo peters out
_ what the. ... ? Over there. If you're headed west, on the left.
In the middle of that wheat field.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't wheat. Ten vintage Cadillacs buried halfway into the
Panhandle hardpan nose first _ one plunked right behind the other,
as if the Texas twister gods had tossed them down there like a
series of big Fourth of July yard darts, their double row of tail
fins angled high and sharp and skyward.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Cadillac Ranch, a piece of roadside pop art now nearly
as much an icon to modern, car-propelled Texas as the Alamo was to
the wagon wheel state that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   What's it doing there?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense to this,'' explains Stanley Marsh 3, a
60-year-old local millionaire and all-purpose eccentric who 20
years ago collaborated with a San Francisco designers collective
called the Ant Farm to create the Cadillac Ranch on his wife's
family's farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art,'' adds Marsh, ``is the enemy of common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense. But Marsh and his nonsensical works just might be
the salvation of Amarillo _ or at least the salvation of the
drive-through people just trying to get ... through the
relentlessly featureless stretch that unrolls between Dallas and
Tucumcari, on their way someplace they might actually want to be:
Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us end up driving across the country at least once in
our lives, and that usually means driving through Texas _ which
often means driving through its Panhandle, of which Amarillo is the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   There're a number of uncommon sights to see on your way through
here: the Helium Museum (Amarillo is the nation's helium capital);
the heavily secured Pantex Plant (where every U.S. nuclear weapon
was once assembled, and where they're now being disassembled); the
Big Texan Steak Ranch and Motel (a monument to southwestern
overkill right off U.S. 40, where anyone who polishes off the
72-ounce steak dinner within an hour gets it free).
</P>
<P>
   But there's an even more extraordinary set of sights to break up
this endlessly ordinary terrain: Stanley Marsh's outdoor art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you whether it's art or not. I just like to make
things,'' says Marsh, whose first installment, in the early '70s,
was a huge backyard likeness of a pool table with pool balls. ``As
a boy, I liked to build treehouses and Christmas tree forts and
caves. I'm still making things. If you like them, that's fine. If
you don't, that's fine, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of Marsh's ``things'' is an offbeat break that can be
viewed in about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Cadillac Ranch, there's the Floating Mesa (a real
mesa whose top looks separated from the rest of it), Ozymandias (a
statue of two giant legs), the Grave of the Unknown Pet and more
than 700 traffic-sign look-alikes proclaiming slogans such as
``ROAD DOES NOT END'' and ``WHAT'S THE VILLAGE WITHOUT THE VILLAGE
IDIOTS'' that Marsh and his crew of prairie pranksters have erected
in yards all over town.
</P>
<P>
   If you're driving through, here's a rundown:
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac Ranch: Best postcard in America. The authentic Caddys
are arranged chronologically by model year, from '49 to '63. They

<P>
   In the Pulitzer Prize-winning hands of the late novelist Michael
Shaara, the War Between the States has never been as realistically
presented as in ``The Killer Angels,'' Shaara's ``you-are-there''
depiction of the genocidal horrors of Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Shaara's son, Jeff, approached that brilliance in the 1996
release of ``Gods and Generals,'' the prequel to his father's

   The trouble with a one-trick pony is prolonged weariness. In
this case, by the time a reader is a third of the way through this
book, his or her nerves are likely to be raw at listening to an
apologetic Bobby Lee lament the loss of Stonewall Jackson. At the
halfway mark you want to scream: ``Yes, General, Ol' Bluelight is
dead. But John Gordon is sitting out there in the wings. So bring
him on!''
</P>
<P>
   This nagging flaw aside, the chaos that was the Wilderness, Cold
Harbor and Petersburg will keep historical purists flipping the
pages. Similarly riveting are Shaara's vivid depictions of Union
indecision and of Confederate incompetence on the general-officer
and political levels, especially the flaws of Richard Ewell and
Jubal Early on the field and of Jeff Davis in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   But the novel's strength is that Shaara has accomplished
something that no writer before him has _ put a human face on and a
compassionate heart within one of the war's most vilified warriors,
Sam Grant.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere is this more brilliantly depicted than at the siege
of Petersburg when Grant weighs the wages of total war against his
oldest son's desire to join the crusade:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Fred would stare out past the front lines, see only the
adventure, the daring, the heroics. ... The thought gave Grant a
cold chill. ... He stared into the dark, saw the boy's face, then
remembered another face, at Cold Harbor, the nameless young man who
had died right in front of him. No, he thought, my son will not
have the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do here, what I must order this army to do ... this
will never happen again. Once this is over, this country will carry
this forever, the faces, the blood, the horror. It will be the last
time. It must be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Last Full Measure. By Jeff Shaara.

A LEADING DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST CALLS RECAPTURE OF HOUSE `50-50' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``w'' and ``p'' categories.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Martin Frost, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said Thursday that Democrats have
a 50-50 chance of retaking the House of Representatives this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be as realistic as I can,'' the Texas Democrat told
reporters at a luncheon meeting. ``We have a very legitimate chance
of taking the House back. (Republicans) will be very, very
fortunate if they retain control.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost, the leading strategist for his party in the House races,
added, ``I think our chances are 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats need to win 11 seats to regain the 218-seat majority
needed to rule the 435-member House. After 40 years of nonstop
control of Capitol Hill, the Democrats lost both the House and
Senate after the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   Political oddsmakers give them little chance of retaking the
Senate, but increasingly the House is viewed as up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, expressed confidence that the House
would stay in GOP hands. ``We're on a roll!'' proclaimed a press
release from the National Republican Congressional Committee. ``The
Republican Party is enthused, strong at the grass roots and
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost spoke in the wake of Tuesday's primaries in California,
Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   He said Democrats are heartened by one Republican victory in
California _ that of former Rep. Bob Dornan, a strong conservative,
in the Orange County race against two moderate Republicans, lawyer
Lisa Hughes and California Superior Court Judge Jim Gray.. The
victory puts Dornan in a rematch against Rep. Loretta Sanchez in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez narrowly defeated him in a bitterly contested 1996 race.
Afterward he attributed her win to illegal immigrants casting
fraudulent ballots, a claim rejected earlier this year by a GOP-led
House task force.
</P>
<P>
   Frost said Dornan ``has national value'' as a symbol to rouse
support among Democratic voters. ``I think he'll continue to be a
problem for the Republican Party nationally, and among Hispanic
voters,'' the Texan said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Frost acknowledged that Democrats may face
problems elsewhere in California as GOP voters picked moderates who
favor abortion rights to run for seats being vacated by two
Democratic incumbents _ Rep. Jane Harman, who lost the California
gubernatorial primary to Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, and Rep. Vic Fazio,
who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Had voters picked hardline conservatives in those districts,
Democratic candidates would have been shoo-ins because the
districts are now under Democratic control, according to some party
strategists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Frost would not concede the two districts. They are
``very tough'' and ``very competitive,'' he said. But he added,
``I'm not going to say they're uphill.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fazio's seat outside Sacramento, wealthy developer Doug Ose,
a Republican, faces attorney Sandie Dunn, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   For Harman's seat in and around Torrance, south of Los Angeles,
state Assemblyman Steven Kuykendall, a Republican, faces
businesswoman Janice Hahn, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Frost pointed to a number of Tuesday results elsewhere in the
nation that he said bode well for Democrats this November.
</P>
<P>
   One was in northern New Mexico, where the state's Democratic
attorney general, Tom Udall, is challenging Republican incumbent
Rep. Bill Redmond, a minister. More than half the district's voters
are Indian or Hispanic. Redmond won a special election last year
when the seat's former occupant, Democrat Bill Richardson, left to
be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Another was in northeastern Alabama, where the Democratic
nominee is lawyer Don Bevil, son of popular former Rep. Tom Bevil,
who held the seat for 30 years before his retirement in 1997. Don
Bevil is challenging Rep. Robert Alderholt, R-Ala., who won in 1996
with 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Alabama, like other southern states, has grown increasingly
Republican in recent years. In 1990, two of Alabama's seven House
members were Republican. Now, five of eight are Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Frost also noted that in southern Mississippi, the elected
regional transportation commissioner, Ronnie Shows, a conservative,
is the Democratic nominee. Two Republicans, lawyer Delbert Hosemann
and banker Phil Davis, will compete in a runoff June 23 for the GOP
nomination. The seat is held by Republican Rep. Mike Parker, who is
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral math in Mississippi also favors Republicans.
Mississippi went from a 4-1 Democratic congressional delegation in
1990 to 3-2 Republican delegation this year.
</P>
<P>
   Frost said that blacks who traditionally vote Democratic may
prove crucial if the Alabama and Mississippi races turn out to be
close. The Alabama district is 25 percent black, and the
Mississippi district is 37 percent black, Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if President Clinton's travails over Whitewater, Monica
Lewinsky and satellite deals with the Chinese are undercutting
Democratic chances this fall, he said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues that resonate best for Democrats are health care,
education, and the future of Social Security and Medicare,'' Frost
said. ``To the extent that Democrats can talk about those issues,
they're going to penetrate whatever fog is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``My sense is the average person is befuddled by
what's going on in Washington.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `BULWORTH,' starring Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Oliver Platt
and Christine Baranski. Directed by Beatty (R, 108 minutes). A
revitalized Beatty directs this political satire with jubilant wit
and energy, playing the ultimate limousine liberal with comic
panache as a white politician suddenly turned homeboy (and turned
on to black urban culture and a passionately liberal agenda).
Taking a potentially cheap fish-out-of-water gimmick and making it
deeply, disarmingly funny, he returns to the anything-goes
tradition of 1970s dropout comedy. As the fretful, spin-controlling
aide to Beatty's wayward senator, Platt is uproariously sly (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GOOD WILL HUNTING,' starring Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben
Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Gus Van
Sant; written by Damon and Affleck (R, 125 minutes). Everybody
loves a Cinderella story, and here are two of them, one on screen
and one behind the scenes. Damon and Affleck, two young actors with
soaring reputations, have written themselves a smart and touching
screenplay, then seen it directed with style, shrewdness and
clarity by Van Sant. As a reluctant math prodigy working as a
janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Damon lives
up to his abundant hype; as the savvy psychotherapist who locks
horns with this mercurial genius, Williams has the rare serious
role that takes full advantage of his talents. With Ms. Driver as
the Harvard premed student who adds romance to the equation. This
heartfelt, inviting film is the best offbeat coming-of-age story
this side of ``Gilbert Grape'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DEEP IMPACT,' starring Tea Leoni, Morgan Freeman, Robert
Duvall, Vanessa Redgrave and Elijah Wood. Directed by Mimi Leder
(PG-13, 120 minutes). Apparently there is no better aid to family
therapy than a murderously large meteor hurtling toward Earth. So
this is a more sensitive sci-fi disaster film than most, with
lovers bonding and old wounds healing as the summer's first
colossal cinematic catastrophe looms. This thriller is vigorously
made, but it provides less grisly mayhem than might be expected. As
the planet faces extinction, attention is paid to rescuing art,
antiques, elephants and flamingoes. Special-effects wizardry
provides a suitably devastating tidal wave (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS,' starring Johnny Depp and
Benicio Del Toro. Directed by Terry Gilliam (R, 120 minutes).
Gilliam, the visually ingenious cinematic maestro behind ``Brazil''
and ``12 Monkeys,'' has filmed Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 classic of
gonzo journalism with an astonishing fidelity to the book's
psychedelic phantasmagoria. But if this is as close to recreating
the sensory world of an acid trip as a mainstream film has ever
come, the movie packs the book's vignettes together into an
overstuffed hodgepodge. Where the book conveyed a spirit of
open-ended adventure in which each new caper could be spun out into
its own little movie, the film rarely gives the book's appallingly
funny anecdotes room to breathe. Depp, who has been made partially
bald for the role of Raoul Duke, turns in a clever performance. And
Del Toro's portrayal of Raoul's gun-waving sidekick and
``attorney,'' Dr. Gonzo, is a tour de force of unfettered
goonishness (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GODZILLA,' starring Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria
and Maria Pitillo. Directed by Roland Emmerich (PG-13, 139
minutes). The ads for ``Godzilla'' proclaim that ``size does
matter.'' But it turns out that bigger doesn't necessarily mean
better. The animatronic lizard that rises from the ocean and stomps
on a number of New York City landmarks has thundering metallic
footsteps but still has the impact of a weightless cartoon monster.
The movie doesn't get scary until halfway through, when the beast's
eggs hatch (in what's left of Madison Square Garden) and an army of
more lifelike baby Godzillas threatens to devour the search party.
The storytelling and acting in this $120 million wad of gummed-up
popcorn reaches new depths of crudeness and ineptitude for a
so-called Event Movie (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `HE GOT GAME,' starring Denzel Washington and Ray Allen.
Directed by Spike Lee (R, 131 minutes). This is a Spike Lee joint
that deserves to be a Spike Lee hit, long overdue. Stunning
cinematography (by Malik Hassan Sayeed), an explosion of
spectacular gambits and a great high-concept hook make this his
biggest, boldest film in years. Washington, in a splendid and
carefully measured performance that keeps this busy film from
spinning out of control, stretches considerably to play a loser.
He's a convict with a one-week prison leave that he must use to
persuade his estranged son, a high school basketball prodigy played
with natural ease by Allen, the NBA star, to sign up with a
governor's favorite college team. Surrounding this compelling
father-son drama are humorous montages, satirical sports-world
sketches and acerbic observations to keep the film roaming eagerly,
and excitingly, all over the map (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HOPE FLOATS,' starring Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr. and
Gena Rowlands. Directed by Forest Whitaker (PG-13, 112 minutes).
This pajama-party women's picture starts out on a talk show and
stays there, raising issues like divorce, single parenthood,
mother-daughter relationships, caring for aging relatives and
summoning the courage to date after trauma. But Ms. Bullock, who is
actually seen cheerleading here, gives her best approximation of
America's sweetheart since ``While You Were Sleeping,'' and her
winning performance helps make up for the film's cute streak and
rosy, commercial glow. Ms. Rowlands does a feisty, down-to-earth
turn as the star's Texas mama, even if the story gives her
taxidermy for an offbeat hobby. As the postdivorce dreamboat,
Connick is on the tepid side. ``The Horse Whisperer'' does this
kind of serene, resuscitating romance much better (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HORSE WHISPERER,' starring Robert Redford, Kristin Scott
Thomas and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Robert Redford (PG-13,
164 minutes). There's a blunt soap opera of a movie inside Nicholas
Evans' widely popular novel. But Redford, directing himself for the
first time with intelligence and restraint, has found a visually
eloquent way to turn it into something much more thoughtful and
tranquil. Magnificently photographed by Robert Richardson, this
film is a wide-screen love affair with the West, and a story more
of peace and healing than of ardor. Though it's long and its
resolution is a problem, this is an enveloping film that richly
rewards the viewer's attention (Maslin).

 &HT;    For the ages: Tale of lust, heartbreak after 40
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Post Coitum'' is a story of heedless passion that would
probably look clumsy, contrived and ickily politically correct if
it fell into Hollywood's hands. But French director Brigitte Rouan
brings flair, sophistication, heartbreak and sexual heat to this
tale of an older woman who hurls herself into a passionate affair
with a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   Diane (Rouan) is a very attractive fortysomething _ think Susan
Sarandon crossed with Maggie Smith _ with a loving husband, two
nice teenage sons and a big-time job as an editor with a powerful
Paris publisher. But when Francois, one of her most promising
novelists (Nils Tavernier), comes down with a bad case of writer's
block, she makes a house call and meets his twentysomething
roommate, Emilio (Boris Terral), who makes no secret of his
interest in her. ``I'm a lifetime ahead of you,'' she protests
before succumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, against her better judgment, she thinks she and Emilio
have a lifetime ahead of them, too. A lifetime together. After all,
she's risking everything she cares about for him. Which may be why
she isn't listening when he says he's really happy because they're
having such fun and ``I'm not in love with you.''
</P>
<P>
   As both filmmaker and actress, Rouan traces Diane's precipitous
fall with wrenching precision. And with a knowing sympathy as
Diane's ``happiness'' takes its toll, turning her life into a
chronicle of loss, abandonment and the constant lies that come with
the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the movie's writer-director, she's generous to Emilio as
well. She makes it clear that he's not really using Diane. He has
no careerist agenda; he's an engineer who specializes in the Third
World, not an aspiring writer. And he's no himbo. Rather, he's much
like the inevitably much younger women in any given Hollywood
movie: not just physically desirable, but also funny, smart, aware,
sensitive and even a teeny bit dangerous in his self-assured
flirtatiousness. Emilio doesn't mean to destroy her life with their
fling, but at the same time, he has no idea how much she's willing
to risk in exchange for this intoxicating new sense of herself.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's full title, ``Post Coitum, Animal Triste,'' is taken
from the Roman poet Ovid: ``After sex, the animal is sad.'' Diane's
sadness is a spectacle of self-abasement and depression. And Rouan
plunges into her character's full-blown masochism with much the
same reckless courage that propels Diane into Emilio's embrace. A
raw, revealing tragicomedy of eros in which renewal is only a
breath away from rejection, ``Post Coitum'' offers truths as
inescapable as stretch marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post Coitum''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brigitte Rouan. Directed by Rouan. Not rated, but there
are steamy sex scenes. In French with subtitles. Tara. One hour, 37
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Doomed passion, charted unsparingly.

 &HT;    Dial R for remake: `Perfect Murder' lets viewers thrill to crime
in an opulent New York
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a dumpy detective stumbles through a slick Central Park
penthouse, he murmurs that old, familiar slogan, ``the rich are
different.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the prime selling point of ``A Perfect Murder.'' It's a
B-movie shot in the deep mahoganies of a Rembrandt painting, decked
out in Fifth Avenue fashions. Its thrills come equally from the
twisty plot (husband schemes to off his wealthy wife) and our
vicarious pleasure in prowling past the semi-recognizable paintings
and gleaming bathroom fixtures in the troubled couple's home.
</P>
<P>
   In Andrew Davis' glossy remake of ``Dial M for Murder'' (1954),
Michael Douglas plays the husband, Steven Taylor. He's a 1990s
variation of his Oscar-winning ``Wall Street'' character, a
business shark whose boom is going bust. Fast. It's a signature
Douglas role: scum-sucking sicko with caviar tastes, flawlessly
attired by Barney's of New York. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography
surrounds him with a feudal Manhattan still redolent of robber
barons (dig the firelit club where he plays poker with fat-cat
cronies).
</P>
<P>
   Steven's prize acquisition is his decades-younger wife, Emily
(Gwyneth Paltrow). The film's subliminal kicks include the notion
that someone as beautiful and young as Emily, with $100 million in
trust to boot, can still be unhappy. That's why we first see her in
the arms of David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen), the classic starving
artist with a libido as long as his hair.
</P>
<P>
   David isn't exactly what he seems, any more than Steven is the
tycoon he pretends to be. When the men meet, the husband encourages
the lover to ``cash out.'' In other words, kill Emily and make it
look like an accident. David will get half a million bucks for his
efforts, and Steven the rest of his wife's fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say things don't work out as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's second half involves the scheme's aftermath. The
stakes are raised considerably by the arrival of David Suchet as
the lead detective on the case. The movie could have benefited from
more of his piercing, intelligent presence.
</P>
<P>
   After consecutive bombs (``Steal Big, Steal Little'' and ``Chain
Reaction''), director Davis is back to craftsmanlike work, if not
up to his breakout hit ``The Fugitive.'' The film's burdensome
sense of dread saps life out of the slower scenes _ hey, this ain't
Bergman. One bit of foreshadowing involving a meat thermometer is
so ham-handed that you assume Davis will pull a fake-out and tweak
our expectations. Afraid not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Perfect Murder'' isn't. A plot machine, it's a little like
David Mamet's current mind-trip, ``The Spanish Prisoner.'' It puts
its attractive cast through a plot line that's twisty enough to
keep us guessing, but it's too pat and airless to be a total kick.
Still, it's a pleasant way to spend a summer evening. Plus, you
might get some interior decorating ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Perfect Murder''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Douglas. Directed by Andrew Davis. Rated R for
profanity, sex, murder and gore. One hour, 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Not perfect, but a B-movie given the A-list
treatment.

 &HT;    Carrey's breakout ``show''
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a wonderful life for Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a
perpetually beaming insurance salesman whose impossibly picturesque
hometown, Seahaven, makes George Bailey's Bedford Falls look like,
well, Pottersville.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, none of it is real. Not Seahaven, which is
actually a huge sound stage. Not Truman's pert, pretty wife (Laura
Linney) or his salt-of-the-earth, have-a-brewski buddy (Noah
Emmerich). In fact, the only real thing in Truman's life is Truman
himself. He's the unwitting star of ``The Truman Show,'' the
world's most popular long-running TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' is also the name of Peter Weir's smart,
thoughtful and thoroughly entertaining comedy-drama that's already
stirring up comparisons to ``Forrest Gump'' (misguided) and talk of
Oscar nominations (not so misguided).
</P>
<P>
   Truman, the first baby ever to be adopted by a corporation,
initially has no idea that he's being watched 24-7 by some 5,000
hidden cameras, to say nothing of billions of ``Truman'' addicts
who gather at Truman-themed bars in their Truman T-shirts to watch
the dailiness of his daily life. He has no idea that his ``god'' is
an egomaniacal producer-director named Christof (Ed Harris), who
gets a special kick out of issuing commands like ``Cue the sun.''
Or that even his most personal traumas are scripted.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, his father's accidental death by drowning when
Truman was a boy accomplishes two things. First, it helps create
Truman's horror of water, thus keeping him Seahaven-bound, even
though he dreams of Fiji. Second, it gets rid of a cast member who
has become troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   But what would happen should Truman ever discover the truth?
That's the theme that gives Weir's film its exceptional resonance.
Andrew Niccol's script isn't perfect; it's too reminiscent of other
recent ``puzzle'' films such as ``The Game'' and ``The Spanish
Prisoner,'' and its payoff isn't as ingenious as its setup. Still,
``The Truman Show'' raises all sorts of intriguing questions.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, there's the frightening pervasiveness of
so-called ``real TV,'' already on view in everything from the Loud
family chronicles of the 1970s to the ``Real World'' soap operas of
the '90s. On the other, there's a deus ex media context, in that
Truman really is always being watched by a supposedly ``superior''
being who allows him certain freedom of choice while controlling
almost everything that happens around him. In a sense, Seahaven is
a high-tech equivalent of the Garden of Eden. But when this Adam
gains knowledge, the outcome is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   The entire movie is a dazzlingly executed conceit that plays
expertly on our sense of media manipulation, as both viewer and
victim. Weir's direction keeps things crisp, challenging and often
very funny. So does his gifted cast. And of that cast, no one is
more gifted than Carrey, who uses all his limber likability to
create an indelible character that couldn't be further from his
manic ``Dumb and Dumber'' persona. His Truman is both the essence
of homogenized, media-made humanity and the embodiment of human
fallibility and unpredictability. He's the one real thing in an
artificial world. How that world both shapes and fails him is
central to the movie and to Carrey's astute performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' may end up the victim of its own hype. It's
not the best movie of the decade, as some magazines have
proclaimed. It's not the Second Coming, even if Harris' character's
name does have messianic overtones. It's not even, in some crucial
emotional ways, ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a heck of a picture. Provocative, beautifully
crafted and endlessly intriguing, it's the sort of film Hollywood
stumbles into every once in a while, then gets scared about
releasing. But don't let the overcompensation, i.e., the hype, turn
you off to ``The Truman Show.'' Rather, turn on, tune in, drop by.
You won't be sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey. Directed by Peter Weir. Rated PG for mild
language. One hour, 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Jim Carrey's performance is the centerpiece of this
thought-provoking social satire, which takes on everything from
media madness to theology.

 UNDATED: attention (Maslin).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,' starring Kate Beckinsale, Chloe
Sevigny, Chris Eigeman and Robert Sean Leonard. Directed by Whit
Stillman (R, 112 minutes). Stillman's smart, fretful, patrician
characters turn up midway between ``Metropolitan'' and
``Barcelona'' in a film that charmingly mixes postcollege career
worries with improbable discomania. A delightful cast engages in
nonstop flirtation and hair-splitting debate, rendered with
Stillman's usual acuity and humor. Ms. Beckinsale, an English
actress with a flawless American accent here and diffidence that's
just as perfect, holds court beguilingly at the center of a bright
and amusing crowd. The ideal film for anyone willing to entertain
the notion that the spread of environmentalism was sparked by the
revival of ``Bambi'' during the disco generation's formative years
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MARIUS AND JEANNETTE,' starring Ariane Ascaride and Gerard
Meylan. Directed by Robert Guediguian (not rated; 102 minutes; in
French with English subtitles). Concrete, weeds and sunshine make
the foundation for this recent French hit, a love story that's also
a romance in a larger sense. The filmmaker's respect and affection
for Marseilles' working-class people, who reflect his own roots
there, give this neighborly film its strong, hearty, down-to-earth
spirit. The characters, including a sweet, feisty heroine played by
the filmmaker's wife (who won one of the film's several Cesars),
are filled with a joie de vivre that transcends their tough
circumstances. And the film watches them share warm friendships and
populist ideas drawn from their daily experience. It's no surprise
that Frank Capra is Guediguian's filmmaking hero (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,' starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan,
Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100 minutes).
Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully acerbic comedy
finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from nasty little
Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil twin.
Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this film and
announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart of gold.
Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally skewers
preconceptions about gay and straight life, and then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `QUEST FOR CAMELOT,' with the voices of Jessalyn Gilsig, Andrea
Carr, Cary Elwes, Bryan White, Gary Oldman, Eric Idle and Don
Rickles. Directed by Frederik Du Chau (G, 100 minutes). Warner
Bros.' shaky entrance into the Disney-dominated sweepstakes of the
musicalized animated feature wants to be a juvenile feminist ``Lion
King'' with a musical heart that fuses ``Riverdance'' with
formulaic Hollywood gush. But its characters are too wishy-washy
and visually unfocused to be compelling, and the songs (by David
Foster and Carole Bayer Sager) so forgettable as to be extraneous.
In this variation on the Arthurian legend, a nondescript Celtic
farm girl named Kayley with aspirations to be a knight wrests the
magic sword Excalibur from the evil would-be emperor Ruber (a Hulk
Hogan look-alike) and saves the kingdom (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SPANISH PRISONER,' starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca
Pidgeon, Ben Gazzara and Steve Martin. Written and directed by
David Mamet (PG, 112 minutes). The most engaging of Mamet's
cinematic puzzles begins with an X-ray at an airport security
check. And the audience will wish it had a similar device for
reading the characters' sneaky minds. No such luck: The mystery
here, in a handsome and Hitchcockian film named for an elaborate
con game, stays tricky to the very end. Scott plays the inventor of
a lucrative, stealable scientific process, with Gazzara as the boss
who's in no hurry to compensate him for it. In an ensemble cast
working entirely on the calculating Mamet wavelength, Martin plays
a rich, debonair mystery man who tells the inventor all about his
pretty young sister. In her performance as a pert, unaccountably
off-kilter secretary, Ms. Pidgeon perfectly embodies the film's
sleight of hand (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITANIC,' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Gloria
Stuart. Directed by James Cameron (PG-13, 197 minutes). For once, a
much touted event movie is exactly that: a glorious throwback to
the days when epic storytelling really filled the screen. Despite
the astonishing technological advances behind Cameron's great
visual spectacle, gimmicks are never allowed to intrude on the
film's central illusion, that the audience is drawn back into the
Gilded Age and intimately involved in the fateful voyage. For all
its painstaking historical detail, this ``Titanic'' proves anything
but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of its sights and
the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young lovers whose
romance is skillfully interwoven with historical detail, Ms.
Winslet and DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry. With his
``Gone With the Wind''-caliber ambitions, Cameron dared to dream of
the impossible and came up with the movie of the year (Maslin).

 &HT;    Linney's got the bases covered
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laura Linney is everywhere these days.
</P>
<P>
   She hits movie theaters today as Jim Carrey's faux wife in ``The
Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday on Showtime, she returns to TV as Mary Ann Singleton
in the miniseries ``More Tales of the City.''
</P>
<P>
   And every day except Monday, she's appearing onstage in the
Broadway drama ``Honour'' opposite Jane Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what to think about it all, to be
perfectly honest,'' she says by phone from New York, where she
lives. Two weeks ago, she returned from a weekend in the country
with her husband and saw ``The Truman Show'' on the cover of Time
magazine. ``I've never been involved in anything that has this type
of momentum. It's been an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, she plays ``Meryl,'' the wife of Carrey's Truman
Burbank _ the only man in the world who doesn't realize his life is
being broadcast live to the world as a 24-hour documentary. Or that
Meryl is actually an actress named Hannah Gill, who knows where all
the hidden cameras are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meryl Burbank is supposed to be the perfect woman, the creator
of the home, a woman with heart and warmth and love,'' Linney says.
``She's a throwback to those television shows from the 1950s.
Hannah Gill, on the other hand, is a profoundly ambitious, powerful
woman who knows that if she doesn't keep Truman happy, she'll be
written out of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she was born and raised in New York City, ``My whole
family's from Georgia,'' Linney says. Her grandmother is from
Baxley, and her mother grew up in Douglas and on St. Simons Island.
Her father is playwright Romulus Linney, and she has cousins living
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Linney got to know Carrey on location in Seaside, Fla., by
reconstructing her entire married life with Truman. For the first
days of shooting, director Peter Weir had his actors pose for the
archival photos that speckle the film. ``We had to shoot these
stills like Truman's birthday, graduation, Thanksgiving, Christmas
and Halloween,'' she says. ``We even had this whole elaborate
creation of our wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey isn't the first comedian turned dramatic actor with whom
Linney has worked. A few years ago, she spent several months in the
Atlanta area shooting ``A Simple Twist of Fate'' with Steve Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very similar in a lot ofways,'' she says of the two
leading men. ``They've both dealt with being in a tornado of fame.
They both cornered a market. They both hit a bull's-eye in a way
that had a global impact, as far as their talent is concerned, and
they monopolized a certain area of comedy. When you have that sort
of impact, the repercussions are enormous. But there's always more
to someone than just one thing, and when you're really, really
talented, you want to be able to explore that. Both are extremely
talented men who have the opportunity to show something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her sunny, girl-next-door looks, Linney herself has been
able to do the same, moving from comedy to drama with ease.
``Because of `Primal Fear,' `Congo' and `Absolute Power,' some
people see me as this tough, smart woman who's wounded
underneath,'' she says. ``Then there's another group, the `Tales of
the City' crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   In the miniseries based on Armistead Maupin's books, Linney
plays Mary Ann Singleton, naive newcomer to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that character so much, and the people who created
it,'' she says. ``We have such a long history now, we really do
feel like family. Making (the sequel) after all this time was just
thrilling, a relief and sweet justice.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because it almost didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   When the first ``Tales of the City'' aired on Georgia Public
Television in January 1994, legislators condemned the show for its
use of nudity, sexual content and drug references. The legislators
had not actually seen the show but had read about it in an
interview with Linney in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The
controversy in Georgia and other states resulted in PBS'
withdrawing support for the proposed sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved PBS so much, which is why I felt so
disappointed,'' Linney says now. ``Everyone has a right to air what
they want to, but they would never say why (they wouldn't back the
sequel). That's still my beef with them. If it's their political
belief, fine. But say so.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds, ``But I also know that it's never a simple situation.
There were many people and affiliates who supported the show. And
as much as I would love to slam PBS, that's not quite fair.''

A LEADING DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST CALLS RECAPTURE OF HOUSE `50-50' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``w'' and ``p'' categories.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Martin Frost, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said Thursday that Democrats have
a 50-50 chance of retaking the House of Representatives this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be as realistic as I can,'' the Texas Democrat told
reporters at a luncheon meeting. ``We have a very legitimate chance
of taking the House back. (Republicans) will be very, very
fortunate if they retain control.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost, the leading strategist for his party in the House races,
added, ``I think our chances are 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats need to win 11 seats to regain the 218-seat majority
needed to rule the 435-member House. After 40 years of nonstop
control of Capitol Hill, the Democrats lost both the House and
Senate after the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   Political oddsmakers give them little chance of retaking the
Senate, but increasingly the House is viewed as up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, expressed confidence that the House
would stay in GOP hands. ``We're on a roll!'' proclaimed a press
release from the National Republican Congressional Committee. ``The
Republican Party is enthused, strong at the grass roots and
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost spoke in the wake of Tuesday's primaries in California,
Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   He said Democrats are heartened by one Republican victory in
California _ that of former Rep. Bob Dornan, a strong conservative,
in the Orange County race against two moderate Republicans, lawyer
Lisa Hughes and California Superior Court Judge Jim Gray.. The
victory puts Dornan in a rematch against Rep. Loretta Sanchez in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez narrowly defeated him in a bitterly contested 1996 race.
Afterward he attributed her win to illegal immigrants casting
fraudulent ballots, a claim rejected earlier this year by a GOP-led
House task force.
</P>
<P>
   Frost said Dornan ``has national value'' as a symbol to rouse
support among Democratic voters. ``I think he'll continue to be a
problem for the Republican Party nationally, and among Hispanic
voters,'' the Texan said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Frost acknowledged that Democrats may face
problems elsewhere in California as GOP voters picked moderates who
favor abortion rights to run for seats being vacated by two
Democratic incumbents _ Rep. Jane Harman, who lost the California
gubernatorial primary to Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, and Rep. Vic Fazio,
who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Had voters picked hardline conservatives in those districts,
Democratic candidates would have been shoo-ins because the
districts are now under Democratic control, according to some party
strategists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Frost would not concede the two districts. They are
``very tough'' and ``very competitive,'' he said. But he added,
``I'm not going to say they're uphill.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fazio's seat outside Sacramento, wealthy developer Doug Ose,
a Republican, faces attorney Sandie Dunn, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   For Harman's seat in and around Torrance, south of Los Angeles,
state Assemblyman Steven Kuykendall, a Republican, faces
businesswoman Janice Hahn, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Frost pointed to a number of Tuesday results elsewhere in the
nation that he said bode well for Democrats this November.
</P>
<P>
   One was in northern New Mexico, where the state's Democratic
attorney general, Tom Udall, is challenging Republican incumbent
Rep. Bill Redmond, a minister. More than half the district's voters
are Indian or Hispanic. Redmond won a special election last year
when the seat's former occupant, Democrat Bill Richardson, left to
be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Another was in northeastern Alabama, where the Democratic
nominee is lawyer Don Bevil, son of popular former Rep. Tom Bevil,
who held the seat for 30 years before his retirement in 1997. Don
Bevil is challenging Rep. Robert Alderholt, R-Ala., who won in 1996
with 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Alabama, like other southern states, has grown increasingly
Republican in recent years. In 1990, two of Alabama's seven House
members were Republican. Now, five of eight are Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Frost also noted that in southern Mississippi, the elected
regional transportation commissioner, Ronnie Shows, a conservative,
is the Democratic nominee. Two Republicans, lawyer Delbert Hosemann
and banker Phil Davis, will compete in a runoff June 23 for the GOP
nomination. The seat is held by Republican Rep. Mike Parker, who is
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral math in Mississippi also favors Republicans.
Mississippi went from a 4-1 Democratic congressional delegation in
1990 to 3-2 Republican delegation this year.
</P>
<P>
   Frost said that blacks who traditionally vote Democratic may
prove crucial if the Alabama and Mississippi races turn out to be
close. The Alabama district is 25 percent black, and the
Mississippi district is 37 percent black, Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if President Clinton's travails over Whitewater, Monica
Lewinsky and satellite deals with the Chinese are undercutting
Democratic chances this fall, he said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues that resonate best for Democrats are health care,
education, and the future of Social Security and Medicare,'' Frost
said. ``To the extent that Democrats can talk about those issues,
they're going to penetrate whatever fog is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``My sense is the average person is befuddled by
what's going on in Washington.''

 &HT;    A boob inside the tube: Carrey gives ace performance in TV
satire
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Alrighty, then!
</P>
<P>
   The Mugger made the cover of Time, and a slew of other slick
publications. Depending on the hype, Jim Carrey's new movie is The
Film of the Summer, The Film Of The Year, or The Film Of The
Decade.
</P>
<P>
   Get real. It's just a film. Better than most, but not as deep as
the gong-bangers would have it.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``The Truman Show'' will appeal to the chattering
classes. Newspaper columnists and TV talking heads will leap at the
chance to deplore the world it depicts. And that is a good joke by
itself, since one of the movie's subjects is the omnipresence of
The Media and the virtual reality it creates for addicted
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   So give points to veteran director Peter Weir and screenwriter
Andrew Niccol (``Gattaca'') for manipulating the manipulators of
public discourse. But their movie is about much more than TV idiocy
_ sometimes too much for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' is a fantasy about a goofus who comes to
realize that his entire life has been a television show. Literally.
Truman Burbank (Carrey) was ``adopted'' at birth by a mastermind
with the rather suggestive name of Christof. Played by a spooky and
unsmiling Ed Harris, Christof is the all-powerful director of ``The
Truman Show,'' a mega-hit watched by zillions of fans.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, Truman has lived on a gigantic soundstage.
Everyone around him in the picture-perfect ``town'' of Seahaven is
an actor, including his impossibly sweet wife, Meryl (Laura
Linney), and oh-so-sincere best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich).
</P>
<P>
   Meryl (Streep), Marlon (Brando), Burbank (the famous home of
Johnny Carson). Get it? Everyone's in on the joke but Truman. He
thinks he's an insurance salesman living happily in the best of all
possible worlds, a sitcom paradise of pleasant people and sanitized
surroundings. In fact, he's a stooge _ until the reality of the
unreality sinks in.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of stooges, Carrey turns in an ace performance. And we
don't mean Ace Ventura. In another stab at a ``serious'' role, he
has fine-tuned his shtick. The face is as expressive as ever, but
it has been de-watted. He used to wield his mugging like a weapon.
Now it's used in the service of a fetching innocence. His character
becomes vulnerable, somebody to root for, even as the movie points
out that we're being shamelessly manipulated to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey's Truman is something of a cross between nerdy Pee-wee
Herman and a gee-whiz Tom Hanks. His tag line is: ``Good morning,
and in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good
night.'' He delivers this pretty ordinary witticism with a cornball
cheeriness that forces it to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey also has room for physical comedy as he begins to
question the reality of things, especially when klieg lights drop
from the sky, rain falls only on him, and cryptic messages filter
through the radio.
</P>
<P>
   The film is sweet, slick and swift, but it has faults. Curiously
enough, its virtues tend to work against it. Its messages are
clever, but they're also so relentless we begin to feel bogged down
in a marshland of metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   The film is obviously a commentary on modern ``Live at Five''
television, or ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' where exhibitionism
amounts to the sole reason for existence _ and the audience is as
complicit as the guests.
</P>
<P>
   But other Big Questions keep coming, and coming, beginning with
the specter of Truman, as Everyman, forced to confront the
``whims'' of fate or The Big Guy in the Sky.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s sitcom quality of the film is perfect, from the
wonderfully warm yet artificial sheen of Seahaven (filmed in the
planned town of Seaside in northwest Florida) to Laura Linney's
portrayal of an ``Ozzie &AMP; Harriet'' wife. But this also serves to
make the satire seem retro, at times, more about '50s conformity
than the potential perils of cyberspace, or even the absurdity of
an entire nation mesmerized by a certain Bronco chase..
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, there was much chatter about the manipulation of
the individual. The book ``The Organization Man'' kvetched about
corporate robots in gray suits and porkpie hats. John Kenneth
Galbraith and Vance Packard bleated that ad men and marketeers were
manipulating our lives _ that average Americans, poor idiots that
we are, were helplessly in their thrall.
</P>
<P>
   There's the feeling that this movie is another example of the
intellectual class identifying a social ``problem'' that only it
sees and dictating the corrective. Because there is a whiff of this
sort of arrogance, the flick is interesting without being
consistently entertaining, despite the suspenseful balancing act
between the sweet and the sinister.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a wised-up Truman makes his bid for freedom, we
don't care all that much, though we're supposed to. Shoot, we were
just beginning to really enjoy ``The Truman Show.'' The artificial
one. Guess that makes us part of the problem.

 &HT;    By Bob Longino

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--Annabelle Gurwitch and Paul Gilmartin, hosts of TBS'
popular Friday night film hash ``Dinner &AMP; a Movie,'' are eating a
leisurely lunch at Midtown's South City Kitchen and confessing.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what many viewers think, they're not married, she
admits.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is rigged, he confides (and he should know _ he was
taught the ropes for a recent cross-promotional gig in Nashville
with Turner-owned World Championship Wrestling and, ultimately, got
pelted by wrestling fans who were shouting, ``Kill the cook!'').
</P>
<P>
   And neither one is a bona fide kitchen expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only cooking show where the people doing the cooking
aren't chefs,'' Gurwitch says. She's an actress with credits
ranging from ``Seinfeld'' to ``The Cable Guy.'' He's a stand-up
comic.
</P>
<P>
   Together they diss each other on camera while preparing dishes
that poke fun at the movies viewers see. At 10:30 EDT tonight, for
example, the flick is Richard Gere's Naval trainee-romance ``An
Officer and a Gentleman'' (1982). ``Dinner &AMP; a Movie's'' side dish:
Drop and Give Me 20 Bean Salad.
</P>
<P>
   All the recipes _ and their amazing titles _ come from the brain
of chef Claud Mann, a graduate of the California Culinary Academy
in San Francisco. ``It's never fake food,'' he says. Always the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, leads to one more confession. While Gurwitch
and Gilmartin do taste the food on the show, there was one complete
dish (a sandwich, actually) that he ate, but that she consumed
minus one key ingredient _ beef's tongue.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the upcoming new shows (All times aree Eastern
Daylight):
</P>

   -- June 12: ``Sleeping With the Enemy'' (1991) starring Julia
Roberts. 10:35 p.m. Recipe: Pecan Someone Your Own Size Pie.
</P>

   Discovery's 'Memoir' a sad reminder of RFK
</P>
<P>
   Take away the tabloid glare that now overwhelms the Kennedy
story and you're left with something as profound and sad as
anything in modern America.
</P>
<P>
   We forget. Fortunately, Discovery's three-hour rememberance,
``Robert Kennedy: A Memoir'' (8 p.m. EDT, Sunday) keeps its eye on
the prize and creates a profoundly sad documentary on the 30th
anniversary of Bobby Kennedy's murder.
</P>
<P>
   There's little new here, and no tabloid salaciousness. Yet it
gets at the heart of things in a way that's almost impossible to
turn from. It's a reminder that for many Americans Bobby Kennedy _
gunned down in 1968 after winning the Democratic primary in
California _ remains the nation's great ``what if?'' What if he'd
lived? What if he'd become president?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are drawn not only to his vision, but to the lost
potential,'' one observer says of the Kennedy's lingering hold.
``Not only in him, but in themselves and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Through interviews and an endless reel of new and familiar tape,
Bobby Kennedy is portrayed first as tough and ruthless (he calls
mob boss Sam Giancana a ``little girl'' during one hearing), then
as a figure of hope shrouded in melancholy and doom (there's
heartbreaking video of him sitting on a rock by himself in West
Virginia, where he'd broken away from his campaign to be alone, and
later said he sat there thinking for half an hour of his late
brother John). His charisma was that of a kind of dreamy, fated
fifth Beatle, and that's just what these three hours capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memoir'' neither mythologizes nor denigrates Bobby Kennedy. It
simply, thoroughly, often eloquently presents the man so many still
miss.

   War...what is it good for?
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that AMC continues its commitment to film
preservation this weekend with a three-day marathon of war movies,
including a restored version of the classic anti-war film``All
Quiet on the Western Front.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that AMC's Sixth Annual Film Preservation
Festival includes an original documentary, ``Cinema Combat:
Hollywood Goes to War'' (7:30 EDT, tonight).
</P>
<P>
   A chronological look at Hollywood and combat, the two-hour
program includes the usual intriguing mix of clips and archival
newsreels. But Martin Sheen, while a terrific actor, proves a
less-than-effective narrator (he can't help but suggest his
``Apocalypse Now'' persona, which is often at odds with some of the
more patriotic footage). Further, the collection of clips
emphasizes AMC's major weakness _ a limited cache of old movies
compared to its rival, Turner Classic Movies. For example,
``Casablanca,'' a Turner-owned film, is barely mentioned, while
something from the AMC library _ say, ``Pin Up Girl'' _ gets
seemingly unlimited screen time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, this works in the documentary's favor _ a relatively
unknown Oscar-winning classic like ``Wings'' gets the respect (and
attention) it deserves. But overall, I'd skip the documentary and
stick to the 40 features being shown in the name of preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Grades: A+ for the Preservation Festival; and C- for ``Cinema
Combat.''

   New HBO series short on reality
</P>
<P>
   They're attractive, they're successful and they're single. But
if the characters in HBO's new series ``Sex and the City'' (10:15
p.m. EDT, Saturday) bear any resemblance to reality, pray these
people never breed.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a real-life
columnist for a New York tabloid whose assignment is
``investigating'' dating habits in the '90s. Call her Ally
McSqueal. Her pals (mostly women complaining about men), slither
from swanky lunch spots to chic nightclubs, spitting out slimy
pickup lines with their forked tongues.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who doubles as narrator and player in this theater of
the self-absorbed, reels off some zingers, including a scene in
which she describes a gold-digging friend: ``Miranda has the kind
of self-delusional confidence that causes men like Ross Perot to
run for president.''
</P>
<P>
   The debut episode deals with what Bradshaw calls ``the mid-30s
power flip'' or more bluntly, whether women can have sex like men
without any expectation of long term commitment. It's a good
question, but here it's wasted (and never answered) by grating
characters and limp writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' tries hard to be provocative, but it's
mostly just a big tease and the strongest case for mandatory
sterilization we've seen in a long time.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   The Apostle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duvall wrote, directed and stars in this slow-moving but
beautifully observed character study about a Pentecostal preacher
who finds, late in the game, that being a holy man and being a good
one aren't always the same thing. The acting is uniformly strong,
with Britain's Miranda Richardson disappearing entirely in the role
of a smalltown Louisiana woman and Farrah Fawcett doing just fine
as the preacher's trophy wife. And Duvall's performance is a small
miracle. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and a scene of violence.
2 hours, 10 minutes. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced _ just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wender's great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas R
</P>
<P>
   Too much is never enough for both fabled gonzo journalist Hunter
S. Thompson and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Thus Gilliam's version of
Thompson's 1971 book about his drug-drenched visit to Vegas has a
brilliant first hour and an excessive second one. But Johnny Depp
gives an amazing, uncompromised performance as Thompson. Rated R
for vulgar language, violence and extensive drug use. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick's is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Good Will Hunting R
</P>
<P>
   A feel-good movie from Gus Van Sant sounds like an oxymoron, but
that's exactly what this pleasant, warm-hearted film is. Matt Damon
stars as a math genius who works as a janitor at MIT rather than
fulfilling his potential. Robin Williams is the eccentric
huggy-bear shrink who helps the kid embrace his brains. Damon
co-wrote the script with Ben Affleck and in this case, their excess
of heart is heartening. Rated R for language and sexual situations.
2 hours, 5 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   I Got the Hook-Up R
</P>
<P>
   This inner-city comedy about two street-corner entrepreneurs,
Black (Master P) and Blue (A.J. Johnson), who come into a cache of
cell phones, is so generic, in both style and story, that it could
be an ``In Living Color'' parody. To its credit, there are hardly
any crossed signals here. ``I Got the Hook-Up'' clearly isn't aimed
at ``The Horse Whisperer'' crowd. Still, it's a pretty shoddy
product by any standards. Rated R for extremely vulgar language,
sexual innuendo, comic violence and extensive female nudity. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   I Think I Do NR
</P>
<P>
   I think you'd rather not. A failed attempt to give a clever gay
twist to a combo of screwball farce and ``Big Chill'' reunion
movie, the film is a charmless comedy in which old college pals
re-convene at a wedding and work out old crushes...and new. Stars
Alexis Arquette. Not rated but there's vulgar language and sexual
situations (especially gay couplings). 1 hour, 32 minutes. (ER)
Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   The Last Days of Disco R
</P>
<P>
   A disco movie for anyone who wasn't into disco (and maybe even
for those who were). Master cinematic sociologist Whit Stillman
(``Metropolitan'') looks at the young and the restless and the hip
and the privileged in the early '80s whose social lives revolve
around a Manhattan disco. The fine ensemble cast is headed by Kate
Beckinsale (``Cold Comfort Farm''). Rated R for language, drug use,
female nudity and brief sex. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Les Miserables PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, well-acted version of the Victor Hugo epic ...
though you may miss the songs. Police inspector Javert (Geoffrey
Rush) once again tracks former convict Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson)
through the countryside and alleyways of 19th-century France.
Directed by Bille August (``Pelle the Conqueror''), the movie's
worth a look even if it lacks the novel's breadth and vision. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Space PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A movie that has all the flash and depth of the latest Nintendo
game. Based on the campy '60s TV show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in
vicious space spiders, genetic monsters, confusing time-travel
elements and heavy doses of family values. There's also Gary Oldman
as the evil Dr. Smith, and ``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the
arrogant pilot Major West. Predictably, the movie has an open
ending, suitable for sequels. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi
action. 2 hours. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Man in the Iron Mask PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Swashbuckling escapism at its best. Leonardo DiCaprio plays dual
(and dueling) roles in this adventure based on the Dumas novel
about a masked youth, imprisoned by his twin brother, King Louis
XIV and aided by the Musketeers (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich,
Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne). Written and directed by Randall
Wallace (``Braveheart''), the movie isn't just for Leo-maniacs; it
has a fine streak of aging-legend melancholy, too. 2 hours, 7
minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Rising R
</P>
<P>
   A gray, tired and joyless Bruce Willis vehicle that makes ``The
Jackal'' look like a classic. This one casts Willis as Art, an
undercover FBI agent who has to protect a 9-year-old named Simon
(Miko Hughes) from killers. Simon is an autistic boy who
accidentally cracks a security code devised by the shadowy,
all-powerful National Security Agency. Alec Baldwin, in his
too-familiar sinister mode, plays an NSA honcho who orders the kid
rubbed out. Rated R for violence. 1 hour, 51 minutes. (SM) Grade:
D+
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nice Guy PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Chan is back and better than ever in this
action-intensive delight about a TV chef (Chan) accidentally caught
between rival gangs looking for an incriminating tape. The star is
Buster Keaton, Baryshnikov and Bruce Lee, all rolled into one. He's
the real thing and the things he does will leave you reeling. Go
see for yourself. Rated PG-13 for violence and one curse word. 1
hour, 27 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Object of My Affection R
</P>
<P>
   Based on Stephen McCauley's novel, this comedy-drama is
fashioned as sort of a modern-day Shakespearean romp of romantic
mismatches. Nina (Jennifer Aniston) gets pregnant by her bossy
lover (John Pankow). She begins to think her new roommate George
(Paul Rudd) would make a better father _ he's polite, single, smart
and a babe. He's also gay. Shimmering with charm and sharp
performances, the movie can't quite overcome a central problem.
George and Nina are such bland, nice nudniks, it's hard to invest
in their story. Rated R for strong language and some sexuality. 1
hour, 51 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults alike. Rated PG for brief mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
(SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Players Club R
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Ice Cube, making his debut as a writer and director,
steals readily from Spike Lee's 1996 flick ``Girl 6.'' And that's
the best thing he does here. Cube's movie about a strip club
masquerades as the story of a single mother (Lisa Raye) who nobly
struggles to pay her college tuition and feed her young son by
performing at night. Instead we get a cliched view of woman, two
rapes and a catfight between the mother and another dancer. It's
prurient ``ho''-some entertainment. Don't get played by it. Rated R
for strong language, sexual content and violence. 1 hour, 43
minutes. (SM) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Post Coitum NR
</P>
<P>
   Doomed passion is charted unsparingly in this French film from
Brigitte Rouan. A chic forty-ish woman (Rouan) risks her family and
her career for a heedless affair with a younger man. A raw,
revealing tragicomedy that offers truths as inescapable as stretch
marks. Not Rated but there are steamy sex scenes. In French with
subtitles. 1 hour, 37 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Primary Colors R
</P>
<P>
   Color it a knock-out. Mike Nichols, who gave a generation a
code-word (``plastics'') now delivers its elegy with this savvy
film about a presidential hopeful and his wife who resemble certain
White House inhabitants. The movie moves from satire to something
far deeper almost effortlessly. The terrific cast is headed by John
Travolta (all gut and twinkle), Emma Thompson, and Kathy Bates. As
Pogo once said, ``We have met the enemy and he is us.'' Rated R for
language and adult situations. 2 hours, 14 minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid-pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the time of
King Arthur, a plucky girl dreams of becoming a knight and finds
herself responsible for saving Camelot. Gary Oldman, Don Rickles
and Eric Idle are among the more recognizable voices. 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Scream 2 R
</P>
<P>
   Still a scream _ in both the scary and the funny sense. Writer
Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven, the team that made
``Scream'' the unexpected hit of 1996, takes scary sequels as their
target this time around. Neve Campbell returns as our beleaguered
heroine Sidney, now enrolled in picturesque Windsor College (it's
actually Decatur's Agnes Scott), where a masked killer is prowling
around with a butcher knife. ``Scream 2'' can't recapture the
bracing experience of the first film. But it gets as close as you
could hope for. Rated R for language and violence. 2 hours. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Senseless R
</P>
<P>
   Score one for truth in advertising. In this sloppy, crude and
yes, senseless, comedy, Marlon Wayans plays a struggling college
student who enrolls in an experimental drug program to score some
quick cash. The drugs give him supersensory powers, but an overdose
has the opposite result. The movie's offensiveness _ it frequently
stoops to bathroom humor _ would be tolerable were it made with
flair. But director Penelope Spheeris, who brought a dash of
panache to ``Wayne's World,'' is in hack-for-hire mode here. 1
hour, 37 minutes. (DH) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Sliding Doors R
</P>
<P>
   Gets jammed on its own cliches. The gimmick is a pair of what-if
scenarios: what happens if a young woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes a
subway train and what happens if she misses it. Paltrow is
appealing, as is John Hannah as the stranger she meets either way.
But essentially, it's a gimmick in search of a story. Make that,
two stories. Rated R for language and mild sex. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
(ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner PG
</P>
<P>
   More fiendish fun 'n' games with David Mamet. A naive young
inventor (Campbell Scott) is the patsy/hero in a complex confidence
game. Steve Martin is surprisingly good as a well-connected but
mysterious businessman who befriends him. An insubstantial but
deliciously entertaining scam of a movie. Rated PG for language and
mild violence. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Titanic PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The ship goes down, but the movie stays afloat. Writer-director
James Cameron harnesses Hollywood's latest high-tech tricks to tell
an old-fashioned romance for the gals that doesn't neglect the
guys, either. Kate Winslet plays an upper-crust Philadelphia girl
returning from Europe on the Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio is a
scrappy artist who has admired her from afar. Rated PG-13 for
disaster-related peril and violence, nudity, sensuality and brief
language. 3 hours, 14 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly-executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Two Girls and a Guy R
</P>
<P>
   A nauseating and unconvincing movie. Two young women (Heather
Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) discover they've been dating the
same guy (Robert Downey Jr.). During the ensuing accusations,
trumped-up confrontations, etc., Downey's character says, ``This
isn't going very well.'' Understatement of the year. Rated R for
sex, language and nudity. 1 hour, 32 minutes. (ER) Grade: F
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine
sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This time, Gerard's on the trail of an
ex-CIA operative implicated in two murders, played by Wesley
Snipes. While this installment lacks some of the emotional
resonance of the original, it offers an exhilaratingly detailed
look into what it takes to be a fed _ the stakeouts, the video
surveillance, the occasional rooftop runs. Through it all, Jones
attacks his role like a pit bull. He makes single-mindedness seem
like a superhuman trait. Rated PG-13 for violence and language. 2
hours, 11 minutes. (DH) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Wedding Singer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A sweet 'n' silly love song of a movie. It's 1985. Adam Sandler
is the titular matrimonial entertainer. Drew Barrymore is a
sweetheart of a waitress. They're clearly Meant For Each Other, but

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Broadway season, which came in like a Lion King's
roar, is going out with a whimper.
</P>
<P>
   The season appears on track to be the most lucrative in Broadway
history, earning more than $550 million in gross receipts,
according to estimates from the League of American Theaters and
Producers. But on the eve of the Tony Awards, which will be handed
out Sunday night at Radio City Music Hall, there are signs of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Broadway shows have posted closing notices, and others
are hanging by a thread. Last week, ``Golden Child'' closed despite
its Tony nomination for best play. Ticket sales have slumped at
numerous shows since Memorial Day, even some that hoped to get a
boost from Tony nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' up for best musical, earned only 31
percent of its potential at the Minskoff Theater in the week after
the holiday. ``High Society'' and ``The Sound of Music'' were also
hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   Now this week, ``The Life'' announced that it will close after
more than a year at the Barrymore Theater, and the revival of ``The
Sunshine Boys,'' starring Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, announced
that it will close June 28.
</P>
<P>
   The malaise is not limited to Broadway. Despite the recent
addition of Peri Gilpen, who plays Roz on the television series
``Frasier,'' the off-broadway comedy ``As Bees in Honey Drown''
will close Sunday at the Lucille Lortel Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling shows that come up empty-handed Sunday night may find
themselves making similar hard decisions next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding is that there was a little bit of a
flattening out of the attendance curve this season, helped by the
more mild than normal winter,'' said Jed Bernstein, the league's
executive director. ``A good week's attendance is north of 200,000
and a bad week is south of 150,000. This whole year, we dipped
below 150,000 only one or two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Return of Mr. `Swanee'
</P>
<P>
   Lest we get too bogged down in the waning season, it should be
noted that the first play of the 1998-1999 season is almost upon
us.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Leight's critically acclaimed ``Side Man,'' which had a
successful off-broadway run earlier this year, is set to open June
25 at the Roundabout Theater under Michael Mayer's direction.
</P>
<P>
   And another production rumored for the coming season is a
definite. Sam Harris, seen most recently on Broadway in ``The
Life,'' will play Al Jolson in a new musical based on the singer's
life called ``The Jazz Singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolson's hits like ``Toot Toot Tootsie'' and ``Swanee'' will be
intermingled with original music and lyrics by Will Holt and an
original book by Sherman Yellen. Gabriel Barre will direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the toughest thing I've ever done,'' Harris
said. ``I'm hardly gone from the stage. At the moment, I sing 14
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   The world premiere will be at the Colonial Theater in Boston on
Nov. 3, where it will run through Nov. 29. From there, it will
transfer to a Broadway theater to be announced, with previews
beginning Dec. 17 and opening night scheduled for Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Harris describes the piece as a full-scale biography of the
famed showman, from his height in the mid-1920s through his work on
the first Hollywood talkie, his pursuit and marriage of Ruby Keeler
and gradual decline in the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a dark intensity, but it's also show biz,'' Harris
said. ``He's a megalomaniac, but he's also giving, in a very
manipulative way. He always needed an audience's approval. There
was a certain amount of desperation in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he has been studying Jolson's life and work and
thinks he has begun to come to understand him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to perform and he loved to sing, as I do,'' Harris
said. ``I love being on stage. I get sick and throw up every time
before I go on, but I love it when I'm out there. It's my favorite
place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   `Everyman' in Brooklyn
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Shakespeare Company's three-week residency at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music comes to an end this weekend with the
last performances of ``Everyman,'' a 15th-century morality play
that has not been professionally performed in America since the
first decade of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mydell, who was born in Georgia and studied acting in New
York before moving to London, where he has worked for two decades,
plays the central allegorical figure of a man preparing for death.
Mydell's mother and two sisters saw the first performance Tuesday
night, and it was a very emotional moment for the family, he said.
The play, about accepting death, has reverberations for the AIDS
crisis, and five of Mydell's siblings (there were 15 children in
all, including half-brothers and half-sisters) have died of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been sort of a grace thing, because it has allowed me
to expiate my response to my own family grief,'' Mydell said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Frances McDormand, who won an Oscar last year for ``Fargo,''
will return to the New York stage in the fall in a new version of
``Oedipus,'' written and directed by Dare Clubb for the Blue Light
Theater Company. Exact dates and a theater will be announced
shortly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Those who can't wait until Matthew Bourne's acclaimed
interpretation of ``Swan Lake,'' with all-male swans, opens at the
Neil Simon Theater in the fall can see a film of the production on
PBS's ``Great Performances'' at 9 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alec Baldwin will conclude the Manhattan Theater Club's
``Writers in Performance'' series with readings from Giacomo
Casanova's ``History of My Life'' at 7:30 p.m. Monday at City
Center.
</P>
<P>
   _ JoAnne Akalaitis' production of ``The Iphigenia Cycle'' of
Euripides, which drew wide acclaim at the Court Theater in Chicago
last year, will be presented in conjunction with the Theater for a
New Audience in January.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Pera Palas,'' a world premiere by the Turkish playwright
Sinan Unel, set in the famous Istanbul hotel of that name, begins
previews Monday at the McGinn/Cazale Theater.

COMMENTARY: HE DIDN'T DO IT ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton did not do it all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the scandals about the Clinton administration's betrayal
of democracy in China, its abandonment of human rights as an
international priority, its strengthening of Chinese missile forces
with U.S. money and engineering, its acceptance of campaign funds
from Beijing and its carefully blind eye toward the Chinese sales
of nuclear technology that suddenly bring the threat of war in Asia
_ beneath all that is the fact that he got all the help he needed,
from America's own political, economic and intellectual leadership.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it arrived with instructions on what to do or not do.
But Clinton, famous fast learner, soon did not need instruction
kits.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American public was generally uncaring, passive or
supportive, in the inane belief that his betrayals and appeasement
policies were creating huge profits for the United States. Beijing
was amused, and piled up a $50 billion trade surplus over the
United States.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American public cannot absolve itself of appeasement
responsibility and just enjoy the shame of Bill Clinton, assuming
he feels any. Americans have to make sure that investigations and
hearings continue even if they lead to jail for those who took
Chinese money and impeachment for those who permitted it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Americans have the responsibility to remember that even more
hurtful to their country than dirty money are dirty policies, and
that their own society enabled Clinton to create and commit them.
Otherwise, it will all happen again in this and the next
presidency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We will have plenty of chances to show we remember, starting
now. Administration decisions to help Chinese technology carry
missiles to target and to ignore Chinese dispatch of nuclear
technology to Pakistan led India to prove its own nuclear
capabilities by testing them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indians dropped huge hints to let Washington know in advance,
but the poor fellows failed. The stunning U.S. ineptitude showed
that the surveillance on which the no-testing treaty depends
sometimes would not work. It showed, too, that determined nations
could put together all the makings of nuclear bombs, without any
testing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some knowledgeable supporters of the treaty say it has lost
credibility as an anti-nuclear safeguard. All right, then: Should
we tickle ourselves into believing the treaty is our protection or
at last go for antiballistic missile defense? All opposed to that
defense please raise hands. Now tell us what you offer that could
substitute for both ABM and the anti-testing mirage.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Presidential campaign time is not coming _ it's here. Will we
get candidates who will face the truth about appeasement of China?
Not likely, unless the U.S. public fights hard _ because for both
parties it has been an embarrassingly bipartisan path. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, I think, can win or lose the presidency depending on
whether he repudiates or sticks to the Clintonian China policies.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Gore, do you think, as Sandy Berger, the national
political-security adviser, lectures us with straight face, that
selling China missile technology is real good for America? What job
do you plan for him?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will you support the ugly campaign of the administration and the
U.S.-China lobbies to castrate in the Senate the House bill that
puts at least some U.S. influence into fighting persecution of
Christians in China and some Muslim countries? Or will you risk
Clinton's anger by supporting an effective bill _ before the Senate
vote?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And will we let Republican candidates get away with not
repudiating the Reagan and Bush licensing of missile help for
China? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money: taking political contributions from the Communist
apparatus is moral treachery, at least. Yes _ and U.S. businesses
and economic lobbies ceaselessly manipulate and despoil our
political life by using scores of millions of dollars to buy the
services of U.S. politicians for the China lobbies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are we mad? That is a possible answer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If not, Clinton appeasement has become so obviously against U.S.
interests and democratic morality that maybe Americans will do our
duty: expose and fight that policy, as long as we have breath or
print.

 &HT;    Head start -- no head start?
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Head Start graduates are no better prepared for
kindergarten than poor children who have had no pre-school, says a
legislative study that is raising new questions about the focus and
effectiveness of the $93-million program in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The study, based on data from the Dayton City Schools, has
already set off a heated debate in a state that is among the
nation's leaders in Head Start spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Head Start classrooms are good places for kids to be _ they're
warm, they're nurturing, they have good things going on _ but we
say more attention should be given to promoting skills essential to
school success later on,'' said Nancy Zajano, director of the
Legislative Office of Education Oversight, a non-partisan research
arm of the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Head Start say the study is seriously flawed and
contradicts earlier reports showing the program benefits
disadvantaged youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very willing to cooperate in any studies with the
(legislative staff), but we take issue with this particular
study,'' said Barbara Haxton, executive director of the Ohio Head
Start Association, which sponsors much of the training for Head
Start teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not giving it a lot of credence,'' said Jaqui Sensky,
deputy chief of staff in Gov. Voinovich's office. The Ohio
Department of Education announced Wednesday it will begin
collecting data on pre-school students for a more comprehensive
analysis of Head Start's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative study comes after eight years of rapid expansion
of the program under Gov. Voinovich _ from $19 million during the
two years prior to his taking office to $146 million in the last
two-year state budget. Currently, Head Start serves 85 percent of
Ohio children living at or below the poverty level, more than any
other state. However, Ohio ranks 46th in per-pupil spending in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The study recommends shifting more money into training Head
Start teachers, placing more emphasis on developing children's
learning skills and setting up model classrooms and annual progress
reports to meet that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The same study found that a more costly, federally funded Dayton
City School pre-school program does a significantly better job than
Head Start in preparing students for kindergarten. Among other
skills, the study looked at children's ability to understand what
they hear, to follow simple instructions and to identify shapes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SAMPLE: Hed in Utopia Reg
</P>
<P>
   CONTINUED FROM 1A
</P>
<P>
   Head Start is operated by community agencies that receive $4,700
per pupil in state and federal money. Teachers generally have just
one year of training and no college degree. By comparison, the
Dayton schools pre-school program uses certified teachers with
college degrees and receives $7,200 per child. With less money,
Head Start also provides a wider array of services to families,
including parent education, job referrals and health and nutrition
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   James Williams, superintendent of Dayton schools, said he hasn't
had a chance to look at the study but agreed that Head Start could
benefit from having more certified teachers. ``I'm not saying that
the individuals that they have are not doing a good job, but we
need to find the funding... for a seamless approach to Head Start,
kindergarten and first grade.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislative office chose Dayton schools for the study
because it's the only district in the state that tests students at
the beginning and end of kindergarten on a wide range of school
readiness skills.
</P>
<P>
   Haxton and other critics say the sample of 1,230 Dayton students
was too small, that researchers didn't account carefully enough for
differences in poverty among students and that they didn't test the
students before entering Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that the true situation of these children was
taken into account,'' she said, adding that Head Start selects
students not just on their income level but factors such as a lack
of stimulation and attention at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get some kids who are four years old and have absolutely no
expressive language,'' she said. ``You would have no way of
understanding them.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the report especially object to researchers gauging
the poverty of students based on the percentage of poor families
living in their Zip Code. ``You know there's a variance in income
levels in virtually all the Zip Codes of Dayton,'' Haxton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Zajano said researchers tried their best to adjust for that
and noted that nearly all Dayton school students _ 83 percent _ are
at or below the poverty level anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Zajano said Head Start's biggest problem may be the lack of
consensus among its teachers, parents and administrators over what
children should be taught to prepare them for school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academics has an almost negative connotation in the Head Start
community,'' Zajano said. ``We're not talking about sitting kids in
rows and having them read flash cards, but we do think there needs
to be more emphasis on those (readiness) skills in a
developmentally appropriate way.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that the Ohio Department of Education lead
the way in developing that new academic emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   But Haxton said, ``We can't expect all kids to develop at the
same rate when they come to pre-school. A curriculum that is
academically based is setting expectations that can't be reached by
some children, and maybe we're already programming them to fail.''

   Head Start study
</P>
<P>
   E WHAT: The research arm of the state legislature compared the
school readiness of 1,230 Dayton kindergarten students during the
1996-97 school year. Students were divided into three groups: those
who had graduated from Head Start, those who had completed a Title
I pre-school program operated by Dayton schools and those who had
no known pre-school experience.
</P>
<P>
   E LIMITATIONS: Students were not tested before their entry into
pre-school to measure any direct gains from the programs. Income
levels of specific students' families were unknown. Instead,
researchers linked the poverty levels of students to the percentage
of poor families living in their Zip Code. Head Start students came
from Zip Codes where 30 percent of families lived in poverty. All
other students lived in Zip Codes where 26 percent of families
lived in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   E FINDINGS: Head Start students performed no better than
students who had no pre-school on seven different measures of
learning readiness. However, Title I students scored better on four
of the seven measures and on social competency skills than did the
Head Start students. The higher scores included skills in receptive
language (38.8 to 36.9), expressive language (44.7 to 43.5),
auditory memory (44.9 to 43.3), visual memory (44.4 to 43.5),
visual discrimination (33.6 to 31.8), fine motor (37.2 to 35.3) and
social competence (51.7 to 48.9).

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``I'm really not a disco type,''
declares an earnest character in ``The Last Days of Disco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is?'' comes the reply.
</P>
<P>
   Great question. Exactly the sort favored by writer/director Whit
Stillman. In context, it's deadpan and almost innocently ironic.
The only difference from Stillman's typical dialogue is that it's
short.
</P>
<P>
   His bright but rather self-deluded characters tend to gush
rivers of high-faluting analysis, as though desperate to explain
themselves, often to themselves. They're not exactly Woody Allens,
but there is a touch of the same puzzled anxiety beneath the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   A Studio 54-like disco is at the center of this romantic comedy.
It's Stillman's third in his ``young, well-bred New Yorkers in
love'' series. In terms of time, the very early '80s, the movie
fits loosely between his ``Metropolitan'' and ``Barcelona.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of recent college grads spend their days at entry-level
jobs in publishing or the D.A.'s office. They rough-it in cheap
apartments. They've come down a tad from the upper middle-class
world in which they grew up.
</P>
<P>
   At night, though, they hang out at a glitzy dance club,
quibbling, flirting, schmoozing, playing at being hip, often acting
dumb. They include roommates Alice (Chloe Sevigny) and Charlotte
(Kate Beckinsale). The former is naive and uncertain; the latter is
a chatterbox and manipulator. A tad amoral without being truly
malicious, she doesn't mind giving her pal lousy advice about love
on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crew are Des (Chris Eigeman), a Harvard dropout on the
make who is the under-boss of the club, where some hanky-panky is
going on at the till; Josh (Matt Keeslar), a sober-sided rookie
prosecutor in the D.A.'s office; and Jimmy (Mackenzie Astin), ``the
dancing ad man,'' who is barely holding on to his job by getting
clients past the ``jerk line'' of wannabes outside the club.
</P>
<P>
   The characters interact in varied, screwy ways. They form their
own little social group within the fickle disco scene. What they
have in common is that they are well-spoken schmoes whose superior
vocabularies don't give them any edge in the common sense
department. They're as puzzled by life and love as the next guy.
They just have a wonderful way of describing things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you notice that people who look alike never seem to know
each other?'' observes breezy Charlotte, who is also given to
nattering about the ``positive aspects of V.D.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental movement was started by Bambi,'' argues
another member of the crew. Another person gives a funny exegesis
on the real meaning of the movie ``Lady and the Tramp.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes, as this kooky band chatters the night away to the
sounds of what seems like every disco song ever recorded. The film
captures the period well, but the characters can also be as grating
as they are amusing. The acting is on target. Sevigny (``Kids'')
stands out as the insecure Alice. She's a fine actress with a
wonderfully expressive face. Although not strictly beautiful, it's
hard to take your eyes off her.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, ``Disco'' may be one of those movies that clicks if
you're willing to admit to recognizing yourself and your era in
this motley crew. If not, you will probably find the movie bubbly
but slight. Sort of like disco itself.

 &HT;    Customers sceptical at Florida Power &AMP; Light Co. environmental
donation campaign
 &HT;    By John Murawski
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida Power &AMP; Light Co., a Fortune 500
company with $6.1 billion in revenue last year, is asking its
customers for a handout: donations for a solar energy project.
</P>
<P>
   ``All contributions, large and small, help bring us one step
closer to making solar power a reality and preserving the
environment for future generations,'' says a bill stuffer that FPL
sent its 3.5 million customers at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   It said the money would be used to install photovoltaic units at
its Martin County power plant near Lake Okeechobee. Photovoltaic
cells convert sunlight to electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the flier touts the FPL Solar Research Partnership as
``a joint effort between FPL and our customers,'' it doesn't say
how much the project will cost, how much FPL or its customers will
have to contribute or how much power it will make.
</P>
<P>
   Customers have been skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flier asks you to write a check for extra money _ it
doesn't look like it's going to a special fund. It looks like it's
going into a black hole,'' said Constantine HadjilambrinosCQ, a
professor in the Environmental Studies Department at Florida
International University in Miami. ``FPL has enough money to do
this on their own whereas other organizations don't. I would rather
give my money to some nonprofit that's doing the same kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What FPL's flier doesn't say is that the company's goal is to
collect $70,000 to buy a 10 kilowatt facility, which will produce
enough electricity to power about five homes. The money is going to
a special fund, which FPL must report on to the state Public
Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the flier tell the customer that he, not solar energy,
is the real subject of this research project. According to FPL
officials and documents filed with the PSC, the purpose of the
project is to measure whether customers are willing to pay more for
energy that is environmentally clean. Photovoltaic energy costs up
to 10 times more to produce than does electricity made by fossil
fuels.
</P>
<P>
   After the money is collected, FPL will interview the donors and
submit a final report and conclusions to the PSC in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   All of FPL's customers are paying for the experiment: $250,000
for the company's promotion of the project and another $225,000 for
administrative and research costs. FPL shareholders won't pay a
cent.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators, who approved the project in 1996, say the
$475,000 cost to be shared by customers is minuscule and will add
less than a penny to the average annual bill.
</P>
<P>
   In the program's first six weeks of fund raising, 4,000
customers, all residential, have donated $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials are pleased with the results so far, said FPL
spokesman Bill Swank. The results also are not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fund raising began, FPL had concluded residential
customers alone would not contribute enough. After conducting focus
groups in Broward County and consulting with other utilities
working on similar projects around the country, FPL estimated only
about 1 percent of its customers would respond to the fund-raising
call and it would have to appeal to its commercial and industrial
customers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers were skeptical of FPL's intentions and wanted a
visible demonstration of FPL's commitment to the environment and to
solar power before considering contributing to the project,'' wrote
Dennis Brandt, FPL's marketing manager, to the Public Service
Commission in March.
</P>
<P>
   That commitment is still not evident, say some environmental
groups, including one that had worked closely with FPL on the
project but now refuses to help promote it.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation, or LEAF,
say FPL's bill stuffers and other marketing materials are a
turn-off. Tallahassee-based LEAF, based in Tallahassee, objects to
FPL's less than optimistic description of solar energy as
``currently very expensive to harness.'' LEAF also wants FPL to put
the photovoltaic modules in a prominent place _ a well-known
building, say _ to serve as a solar showcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put it out in the boonies where no one can see it,'' said
Gail Kamaras, director of LEAF's energy advocacy program. ``We
don't want to lend our credibility to this project until we see
some better effort on their part in terms of how they're marketing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamaras, however, does support financing it this and other such
programs through donations.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of customer subsidies, known as ``green pricing,''
was authorized by the PSC in 1994 as part of a statewide energy
conservation effort. The PSC has since found that most utilities in
Florida reject green pricing for lack of customer interest.
</P>
<P>
   But negative reactions are just as important to this experiment
as are contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a research project to find out whether customers are
truly interested in green pricing, and if so, to what extent,''
said FPL's Swank.
</P>
<P>
   FPL took up the project in 1996 after canceling a solar water
heater rebate program it deemed ineffective, prompting the PSC to
tell FPL to set up another program.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it will also provide FPL with $70,000 worth of
experimental equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a given that somewhere down the road this technology will
be viable for some applications, and they want to keep their hand
in it,'' said Jerry Venture, director of the photovoltaics and
advanced technologies division at the Florida Solar Energy Center,
which The center has worked with FPL on other photovoltaic
projects.solar experiments for more than a decade and will assist
the utility when it starts bidding.

   EVANDER _ NEW YORK _ Holyfield's performance is often directly
connected to his level of motivation. It would seem to be
relatively low here against Akinwande. He had anticipated meeting
Lennox Lewis, but that fell apart. He has since been criticized by

   TENN-VALEDICTORIAN-NYT (Memphis) _ Three years ago, Daira Hodges
was a 14-year-old honor student. But on May 9, 1995, everything
changed when an ex-boyfriend, also 14, dragged her into a vacant
classroom, choked her, stabbed her 21 times, and then went to take
an algebra test, leaving her for dead. But she regained

   REMEDIAL-EDUC-REVIEW-NYT (Undated) _ All the brouhaha last week

A DAY AFTER FATAL CRASH, SCORES OF TRAINS ARE PULLED FROM SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESCHEDE, Germany _ One day after Germany's worst rail crash in
more than 50 years, authorities pulled scores of express trains out
of service Thursday after the discovery of a broken wheel and track
damage possibly linked to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of 60 Inter City Express trains was a humiliating
step for the federal railroad service and deepened speculation that
the accident, in which at least 93 people are known to have died,
was caused by mechanical failure in a train once praised as the
safest in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every relevant part of these trains will be examined to
exclude all risks,'' said Martin Katz, a spokesman for German
Railways. The company has 104 high-speed Inter City Express trains,
Katz said, and has withdrawn trains from the first generation,
which was introduced in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have yet to say what caused the crash at 10.59 a.m.
Wednesday when Inter City Express 884, on its way to Hamburg, hit a
road overpass at 125 miles per hour, bringing tons of concrete
crashing down on it.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening officials reported a series of findings that
gave a first impression of the possible cause. Police said damage
to the tracks and debris of a train, not necessarily Inter City
884, had been found three and a half miles south of the overpass,
meaning that 884 might have begun to derail well before it hit the
bridge, its momentum carrying the cars forward until they struck
the overpass.
</P>
<P>
   That version was apparently reinforced by the account of a
survivor from the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a funny noise about two minutes before the crash,''
the survivor, Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener, said. ``People looked
frightened, and we looked at each other as if to say, `Should we
take it seriously?' But then the train went on quite normally
without braking. I was writing at a table. Then it started again,
and I held on tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Other survivors said they had heard a loud noise before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some kind of loud noise, then a bang,'' one
survivor, Susanne Kleinbrahms, told Reuters television. ``I flew
through the air and smashed into everything. That's all I know.''
</P>
<P>
   In a newspaper interview to be published Friday, Transport
Minister Matthias Wissmann discussed the possibility that a wheel
on the car directly behind the locomotive had broken and that
``this may have been of significance.'' It was unclear whether a
broken wheel caused the track damage or vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Wednesday that the locomotive had separated from
the rest of the cars, speeding alone and unscathed until an
automatic braking system halted it 2,000 yards beyond the overpass.
</P>
<P>
   The picture emerging suggests that the train partly derailed
when approaching the overpass and that its middle-section slammed
into the central supporting pillar of the bridge with an impact
that decoupled the lead locomotive.
</P>
<P>
   The head of German Railways, Johannes Ludewig, said Thursday
night that because there ``may have been a problem'' with the
chassis and rolling gear, the first-generation trains ``will go
into the workshop and will not leave the workshop until we have
found out if there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the second-generation trains, introduced in 1994, had
different rolling gear and would not be withdrawn. German Railways
had earlier imposed a 100-mph limit on the trains remaining in
service. The express trains routinely travel at 125 mph and are
capable of speeds of up to 175 mph, part of a network of express
trains in Europe at the core of a projected high-speed transit
system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials who are investigating the crash have declined to
comment on the theories about causes, saying they need first to
uncover the last cars from the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports from police and rail officials said two groups
of schoolchildren might have been among the dead. But as the rescue
effort unfolded Thursday officials said that they had found nothing
to substantiate those fears.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 hours after the wreck, rescue teams in orange
coveralls tried to enter the last of the 13 cars. Rescuers said
they expected to find bodies but no additional survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Huge cranes dug up concrete slabs that fell on the train. Power
drills worked to clear out the last flattened cars, and rescuers
lowered pallets on chains to retrieve bodies in gray blankets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hearing no sounds of life from the wreckage,'' said
Rolf Bartsch, a rescue worker in Eschede. ``Any hope for survivors
is fading.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash left Eschede and the nation shaken. ``This did not
happen just somewhere in the world,'' said Michael Rothfuchs, an
editor at the local newspaper, The Celler Zeitung. ``It happened in
Germany. It was inconceivable. And it happened on our doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in a state of mourning or bewilderment or denial,''
a pastor, Peter Wroblewski, said. ``They see this highly modern
technological flier. Then they see the wreckage. It's unreal. It's
like a movie.''

LAWMAKERS MARK TIANANMEN ANNIVERSARY BY GIVING ADVICE TO CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Marking the ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square crackdown, Democratic and Republican members of Congress
again urged President Clinton on Thursday to cancel his trip to
China, saying it ``sends the wrong message'' about the U.S.
commitment to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The request by Sens. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., Tim Hutchinson,
R-Ark., Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and
other lawmakers critical of human rights abuses in China, came one
day after Clinton called for the renewal of normal trade relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends the wrong message at the wrong time,'' Ashcroft said,
saying the trip would not be in America's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   The critics told a news conference that they also objected to
Clinton's plan to be greeted in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, the
site where thousands of pro-democracy protesters were killed in a
bloody military crackdown on June 4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``How sad it would be for the president of the United States to
tarnish the image of his office by being received in Tiananmen
Square,'' Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi and Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., wrote Clinton Thursday that
his presence in Tiananmen Square would ``desecrate the memory of
the brave individuals who lost their lives fighting for democratic
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit China since the
Tiananmen Square crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., told the news conference that he
feared Clinton's visit to China means ``that the United States will
be endorsing a government we should condemn and shirking a
responsibility we must embrace _ to give meaningful support to
democracy and human rights in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng, who was exiled to the United
States last year, also criticized Clinton for fostering relations
with Chinese officials, whom he called ``murderers and
executioners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves are always wolves in the world,'' Wei said through an
interpreter. ``Wolves never change.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said Clinton will stick
to his plans to visit China despite the lawmakers' protests.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry also defended plans for Clinton's welcoming ceremony at
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the world leaders including Israel's Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Jacques Chirac have been
received at the Great Hall of the People, which is adjacent to
Tiananmen Square, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to imagine there'd be any other way that the
Chinese would do it,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Clinton plans to address human rights concerns
during his visit, although the issue will not be the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symbolic importance of the events in Tiananmen Square will
never be lost on this government,'' McCurry said. ``Indeed, we have
addressed them many, many times.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton promised to ``deal forthrightly'' with
human rights concerns in China during his visit, while pushing for
the renewal of China's ``most favored nation'' trade status.
Congress now has 90 days to decide whether to vote to cancel the
president's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made it clear that the human rights issue would be
second to strategic and economic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said China was key to U.S. strategic interests in Asia
that are being challenged by nuclear testing by India and Pakistan.
Good relations with Beijing are crucial amid possibilities of a
nuclear race in South Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   China had helped Pakistan's nuclear program.

PRICES UP 2 PERCENT AFTER AGREEMENT TO CUT PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Mexico, Iraq)   (ja) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oil prices rose by 2 percent in the futures markets
Thursday after Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico, three of the
world's largest producers, agreed to cut production by 450,000
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The three producers issued a statement from Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, saying they had agreed on the cuts because ``the market
remains in a state of imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   The three countries were the leaders in putting together a
coalition of major oil exporters last March who agreed to cuts that
eventually totaled 1.72 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual move in March prevented oil prices from collapsing
and sent them up by about 18 percent, into the range of $16 a
barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But continuing weak demand in Asia and rising exports from Iraq
have led to an oversupply, and prices have again fallen to the
range of $14 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports Thursday that more cuts were under way led crude
oil for July delivery to rise by as much 5 percent. But after the
announcement was actually made, showing that the cuts would be
lower than traders had expected, crude oil for July delivery closed
up 31 cents, to $15.12 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. In London, the benchmark Brent crude for July delivery
rose 44 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $14.48 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predicted that when the cut is put into effect on
July 1 it would only help to keep the prices from falling and would
not lead to any significant increase.
</P>
<P>
   Vahan Zanoyan, the chief executive of the Petroleum Finance Co.,
a Washington-based consulting group, said that the
450,000-barrels-a-day cut was a ``a quick fix'' to help absorb the
increase in the exports from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be just in the nick of time to take care of Iraq,''
he said. Iraq has been exporting about 1.6 million barrels a day
and is expected to increase that this month by about 100,000
barrels a day under an easing of sanctions by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier move in late March by the three major world
producers was unusual since Mexico, which is not a member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, helped bring
together two feuding members of OPEC, the Saudis and the
Venezuelans, to support cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News quoted Dolores Dobarro, the deputy minister for
energy and mines in Venezuela, as saying after the announcement
Thursday, ``We are expecting other OPEC and non-OPEC producers to
join in making additional cuts at the next OPEC meeting.'' That
meeting is scheduled for June 24 in Vienna.

     PHOTOS SHOW, U.S.S. YORKTOWN UPRIGHT ON THE
PACIFIC FLOOR
 &HT;     By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Exactly 56 years after the epic World War II sea
battle in which she sank, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Yorktown
reappeared Thursday in eerie, blue-tinged photographs of her
resting place on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just fine,'' said Robert Ballard, the undersea explorer
whose remotely controlled search vessels found the sunken carrier.
``She's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yorktown rests upright and intact, in 16,650 feet of
unusually clear water about 1,200 miles northwest of Hawaii,
Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, which sank on June 7, 1942, three days after the
beginning of the Battle of Midway, was first photographed May 19.
</P>
<P>
   A sonar-equipped search vessel ``swept'' a 400-square-mile area
of ocean bottom and discovered a tiny spot, only one-sixteenth of
an inch long on the screens of monitors being scanned aboard a
surface vessel by Ballard and members of his crew.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 1,000 photographs taken of the ship from a
remotely operated camera vehicle revealed numerous signs of the
Battle of Midway, said Ballard, who presented video and slides from
the discovery at the National Geographic Society, one of the
sponsors of his expedition.
</P>
<P>
   The photos show a gaping hole left in the ship's port side by a
torpedo, places where bombs caused her flight deck to buckle, and a
bomb hole in the flight deck near midships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is even evidence of the fires that raged on the ship
during a pair of assaults by dive bombers from Japanese Vice
Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's carriers 200 miles away, Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard, whose previous undersea discoveries included the cruise
ship Titanic and the German battleship Bismarck, said the ship was
located by a sonar tracking vehicle that scanned the sea floor
while being towed behind a Navy ship.
</P>
<P>
   After the tiny blip appeared on sonar images, the
self-propelled, tethered camera device was lowered to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard compared this to trying to lower a penny on a string
from the top of New York's World Trade Center in a wind and placing
it on a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   The process was complicated when extreme pressures caused the
camera device's glass ballast tanks to implode with the force of
six sticks of dynamite, necessitating several days of repairs,
Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   The camera vehicle was slowly guided toward the object that
Ballard and members of his crew suspected was the Yorktown. The
first scene transmitted back to the surface was of the carrier's
still-intact bridge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Naval historians now see the Battle of Midway as the turning
point in the war in the Pacific. Although the Japanese sank the
Yorktown and a U.S. destroyer, the Hammann, they lost four of their
own carriers. More than 2,400 men were rescued from the Yorktown,
which lay in the water for three days after the battle, then rolled
over and sank.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, dive bombers from the Yorktown participated in a
devastating five-minute attack on three Japanese carriers, the
Akagi, the Kaga and the Soryu, at almost the precise moment
Japanese dive bombers, fighters and torpedo planes were attacking
the Yorktown in the first two assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors from the Japanese carriers joined Yorktown survivor
Bill Surgi, now of Rockville, Md., as consultants on Ballard's
research vessel. During repairs to the camera vehicle, sonar sweeps
were made of areas where the Japanese carriers were thought to have
sunk, but without success, Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   Surgi presented small plastic foam cups to the Navy and Newport
News Shipbulding Co. to commemorate the finding of the carrier. The
cups, which normally hold eight fluid ounces, had been attached to
the outside of the tethered camera submersible, Surgi explained,
and sea pressure at nearly 17,000 feet had compressed them to about
the size of one-ounce shot glasses.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, three raw eggs attached to the
camera vehicle returned to the surface, uncracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had them scrambled for breakfast the next day on an English
muffin,'' said Surgi, ``my last meal from the Yorktown.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Surgi and other members of the carrier's crew
recalled the bedlam of battle that ended the Yorktown's career in
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Wetherington of Dover, Fla., was a member of the ship's
fighter squadron, assigned to manually push fighters into position
to take off and pull them off the flight deck when they had landed.
</P>
<P>
   During battle, his job changed to loader for an anti-aircraft
gunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a dead-eye shot,'' Wetherington recalled, ``and
whenever he hit one of those Japanese planes, he's scream like a
banshee.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetherington, 79, said he heard only one order during the two
assaults on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was drilled in their jobs and they did them without
even thinking,'' he recalled. The order was ``abandon ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgi, 84, said his job during battle was to fight fires.
Holding his fire hose, he said, he saw a plane drop a bomb which
seemed to fall directly toward him.
</P>
<P>
   ~``I ducked and braced myself,'' he said. ``This metal helmet
I'm holding now saved my life, but my left arm was broken.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ship was abandoned, Surgi said he had trouble swimming
with only one arm, and when one of the Yorktown's destroyers
lowered cargo nets over the side for members of the carrier crew to
climb up, he was unable to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just held on and they pulled me up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The last F-47 ``Wildcat'' fighter to leave the Yorktown deck was
piloted by John Adams, now of Perdido Key, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get it started to leave with my group,'' he said.
``I sat there on the deck with the attack under way and finally got
started and took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I was launched I saw two Japanese torpedo planes
approaching the ship. I couldn't turn sharply enough to fire on the
first, but I got the second one. The first one got its torpedo into
the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. fighters, torpedo planes and dive bombers could not
return to the Yorktown because of damage inflicted by Japanese
planes, and they landed on either the Hornet or the Enterprise, its
sister ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we abandoned ship, a lot of the guys were taking their
shoes off, but I just couldn't see getting in that water
barefooted,'' said Glenn Capps, now of Milton, Fla., ``so I kept
mine on.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem came when he tried to climb the cargo net onto a
nearby destroyer and had trouble getting footholds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I got near the top and suddenly a felt a grip like a
vise on my wrist. I'll never forget the feeling of that grip. I
didn't even see his face. He was reaching back for the next guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The bomb hole located by Ballard's camera could have been the
same one that exploded near a gun mount near midships and killed 12
of 21 crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survivors was Ray Scates of Spartanburg, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wounded pretty bad,'' he recalled. ``I had six teeth
knocked out and I've still got shrapnel in my head from it that
I'll take to my grave. That was in the first assault. They gave us
morphine and we fought again that afternoon. Later I had over a
hundred stitches in my belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Scates had lied about his age to get into the Navy. When the
Yorktown sank, he was 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   William Leonard, who grew up in an Army family, attended the
U.S. Naval Academy and became a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from the Navy in 1971, a rear admiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a nice stainless steel sword down there somewhere, if
Dr. Ballard wants to retrieve it,'' he joked.

CRASHING THE COMPUTER, NOT THE CAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 7)  
(ja)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not Doom or Flight Simulator, but the AAA Foundation for
Traffic Safety has concocted a lively computer game for teen-agers
called Driver-ZED that shows half a dozen ways to crack up a car,
in city, suburban or country driving.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM game is run through a mouse, and the player has to
identify potential hazards or take action to prevent accidents. The
screen shows the view through the windshield, with rear-view and
side-view mirrors and instrument panel, including speedometer and
turn-signal indicators.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, the player's car is signaling for a left turn,
following another car also signaling for a left. A car is coming in
the opposite direction, and a pedestrian is waiting to cross the
street onto which the player wants to turn.
</P>
<P>
   To gain points, the player has to click on the pedestrian, the
approaching car and the back bumper of the car ahead as potential
hazards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Click, and the action moves ahead. The pedestrian starts across
the street, drops some papers and stoops to retrieve them; the car
ahead stops and the player's car is marooned in the middle of the
intersection as the oncoming car bears down.
</P>
<P>
   If the player spots the hazards and avoids the accidents, the
game awards points. But it is designed with teen-agers in mind; it
still shows the crackup the player averted, complete with squealing
tires, crunching metal and shattering glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' said Stephanie Faul of the AAA Foundation, ``the
kids would do the wrong thing just to see the crash.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is designed for 16-year-olds, but younger children
would probably enjoy it. It keeps score, so siblings can compete.
</P>
<P>
   Because the game is heavy on full-motion video, it requires a
premium computer: a Pentium 90 with Sigma Designs Realmagic MPEG1
video accelerator, or a 200-megahertz Pentium with 32 megabytes of
RAM.
</P>
<P>
   The $27.95 game is available from AAA at (800) 377-8999 or P.O.
Box 8257, Fredericksburg, Va. 22404. It can be ordered on the World
Wide Web at http://www.aaafts.org.

RULE WOULD REQUIRE HOUSE MEMBERS TO TAKE RANDOM DRUG TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of the House of Representatives and their
staffers would be required to submit to random drug tests under a
proposal introduced Thursday by Reps. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y.,
and Joe Barton, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for the tests to be randomly administered
four to six times a year, using urine or hair analysis, according
to Solomon. The test results would be published every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, who predicted the House would approve the rule next
week, said the program would not test for alcohol, which _ unlike
drugs _ is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon added that he'd like to extend random drug testing to
state, county and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The House had approved a similar drug test program last year but
it later fell victim to a parliamentary snarl.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., has opposed
the drug-testing policy, arguing that there isn't any need for a
House-wide mandate and that members can test themselves and their
staffers if they want to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties advocates have raised questins about the
practice, saying it violates the Fourth Amendment of the
Constitution which prohibits random searches and seizures. Courts
have held that a drug test is a search.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government isn't allowed to search your body or belongings
without good reason,'' said Arthur Spitzer, legal director of the
Washington chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``Random
testing is the opposite of having a good reason. I would hope that
most members of Congress would care enough about the Bill of Rights
that they would not act so quickly to ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Barton said he is convinced that the drug testing would
withstand legal scrutiny. He cited a recent Gallup poll showing 87
percent of Americans support drug testing for members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have approved random drug testing for police officers who
carry guns, air traffic controllers and railroad engineers, but not
for ordinary government employees. Mandatory drug testing already
exists for the military and for White House personel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be one case where the House of Representatives is
catching up to the Clinton administration,'' Barton said. ``It's an
absolute proven winner if you want to have a drug-free work
place.''

   &UR; Water!!! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A traveler became lost in the desert region of Algeria.
Realizing his only chance for survival was to find civilization, he
began walking. Time passed, and he became thirsty. More time
passed, and he began feeling faint. Reduced to crawling, he was on
the verge of passing out when he spied a tent about 500 meters in
front of him. Barely conscious, he reached the tent and called out,
</P>
<P>
   `Water...`.
</P>
<P>
   A bedouin appeared in the tent door and replied sympathetically,
`I am sorry, sir, but I have no water. However, would you like to
buy a tie?`
</P>
<P>
   With this, he brandished a collection of exquisite silken
neckwear.
</P>
<P>
   `You fool,` gasped the man. `I'm dying! I need water!`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, sir,` replied the bedouin, `If you really need water,
there is a tent about 2 kilometers south of here where you can get
some.`
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing how, the man summoned sufficient strength to
drag his parched body the distance to the second tent. With his
last ounce of strength he tugged at the door of the tent and
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Another bedouin, dressed in a costly tuxedo, appeared at the
door and &QL; 
inquired, `May I help you sir?`
</P>
<P>
   `Water...` was the feeble reply.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, sir,` replied the bedouin, `I'm sorry, but you can't come
in here without a tie!`

   Lech Walesa says he may run for president of Poland again. Good.
It'll be nice to have a leader there whose name we know how to
mispronounce.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky's new lawyers have defended folks in many
political scandals. Like war correspondents, they never run out of
work.
</P>
<P>
   The new Lewinsky lawyers are known for their ability to
negotiate deals for their clients. Imagine the products for which
they'll seek to get her endorsement contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``when people enjoy a great
deal of success, it makes them downright dumb.'' Hence, special
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr says the president is ``under serious criminal
investigation.'' Which differs from the funny kind.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the just-ended primary election in California was
almost obscenely expensive. But think what it would have cost had
the makers of ``Titanic'' been in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brown, California's former governor who has run for
president, has been voted mayor of Oakland. He may be well on his
way to election some day to his nursing home's resident complaint
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The news about Alabama's goofball governor, Fob James, isn't as
good as we first thought. He hasn't run off. Instead, he failed to
win his primary this week and has been forced into a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's government has just sold some one-week treasury bills
to raise cash. This is like a 36-hour car loan.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians plans to use the Mir space station through 1999 and
then let it burn up in space. Odd. That's how, earlier this decade,
they also treated the old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton bumped his forehead on a White House door the other
night, leaving a red knot. Sounds like a vast right hinge
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The president has ordered that new government documents be
written in plain language. Pursuant, of course, to hitherto
referenced mandates and statutes per stirps and per diem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government's writing must be in plain language,''
Mr. Clinton says. Glad there was no such rule six score and 15
years ago at Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Clarifying: Mr. Clinton wants plain _ not plane _ language. The
latter is what's spoken on Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   If the GOP doesn't rein in its ``extreme right,'' says Gerald
Ford, it will lose the presidential election. What about its
extreme wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A punk rocker, Rainy Blue Cloud Greensfelder, has been running
for City Council in Nevada City, Calif. Bet that's not her real
name. Bet it's something like Rainy Blue Cloud Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says the Census Bureau needs to get an accurate
count in 2000. Right, no fair counting the South Park kids or
Beavis and Butt-head.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Russia's financial crisis is caused by an inept tax
collection system. Besides which, the ruble sounds like the name of
those tiny cars circus clowns get out of.
</P>
<P>
   American officials worry that India and Pakistan will continue
to provoke each other with nuclear developments. An arms race? What
kind of evil empires would engage in an arms race?

   Two boll weevils grew up in South Carolina. One went to

   This guy goes into a restaurant for a Christmas breakfast while
in his home town for the holidays. After looking over the menu he

`What's with the hubcap?` The waiter sings, `Theres no plate like

   A hungry lion was roaming through the jungle looking for
something to eat. He came across two men. One was sitting under a

digest and writers cramp.

alternating recurring dreams. First I'm a teepee; then I'm a

HEARST NEW MEDIA INVESTS IN TWO FIRMS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Hearst Corporation announced Thursday that it has
made an investment in E Ink Corp., a developer of electronic
displays based on an ``electronic ink'' that can be printed onto
paper and other flexible surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic ink, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Media Lab, could lead to the creation of electronic
books, newspapers and magazines, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic ink technology allows high-resolution text and images
to be displayed in color or black-and-white. A publication using
electronic ink essentially typesets itself, receiving the text and
images either over-the-air or through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Because the information is in electronic form, it can be
continuously updated and easily manipulated, according to the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, this novel technology could dramatically change
the way we publish and distribute our books, magazines and
newspapers,'' said Kenneth A. Bronfin, Hearst New Media &AMP;
Technology senior vice president and deputy group head. ``We look
forward to collaborating with E Ink as they develop this innovation
into products that consumers will want and need.''
</P>
<P>
   Other investors in E Ink include Motorola, Inc. and the
Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst also announced that it has invested in Exodus
Communications Inc., a leading provider of Internet services to
companies using the Internet as a critical part of their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which hosts HomeArts (http://homearts.com) and
other Hearst Web sites, recently placed No. 12 in the Los Angeles
Times 100, a listing of California companies ranked by largest
increase in one-year sales revenue.

   &UR; Water!!! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A traveler became lost in the desert region of Algeria.
Realizing his only chance for survival was to find civilization, he
began walking. Time passed, and he became thirsty. More time
passed, and he began feeling faint. Reduced to crawling, he was on
the verge of passing out when he spied a tent about 500 meters in
front of him. Barely conscious, he reached the tent and called out,
</P>
<P>
   `Water...`.
</P>
<P>
   A bedouin appeared in the tent door and replied sympathetically,
`I am sorry, sir, but I have no water. However, would you like to
buy a tie?`
</P>
<P>
   With this, he brandished a collection of exquisite silken
neckwear.
</P>
<P>
   `You fool,` gasped the man. `I'm dying! I need water!`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, sir,` replied the bedouin, `If you really need water,
there is a tent about 2 kilometers south of here where you can get
some.`
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing how, the man summoned sufficient strength to
drag his parched body the distance to the second tent. With his
last ounce of strength he tugged at the door of the tent and
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Another bedouin, dressed in a costly tuxedo, appeared at the
door and &QL; 
inquired, `May I help you sir?`
</P>
<P>
   `Water...` was the feeble reply.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, sir,` replied the bedouin, `I'm sorry, but you can't come
in here without a tie!`

AUTO SAFETY: SETTING LIMITS ON TEEN-AGE DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Md., Ga., Va.)   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moved in ``f'' category.)  
(lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress and the state legislatures have bogged
down in their efforts to pass new laws on a risky group of drivers,
those who drive drunk. But lawmakers are still voting new
restrictions on another group who have a disproportionate share of
auto accidents: teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Taken collectively, teen-age drivers are a frightening prospect.
While drivers aged 15 to 20 account for just 7 percent of all
licensed drivers, according to the American Automobile Association,
they were involved in 14 percent of fatal crashes in 1996, and in
20 percent of all crashes reported to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers are involved in crashes for all kinds of reasons, but
alcohol is involved less frequently than it is for drivers in their
20s; experts say simple inexperience is the main reason for the
high accident rate.
</P>
<P>
   As with drunken driving, the teen-age accident rate has created
a cadre of victims and parents clamoring for changes. One is David
Greening of Ripon, Wis., whose son Kristopher died in a crash last
November in a car that had been traveling at more than 100 miles an
hour. Kristopher, on his way home from a track meet, was a
passenger; the driver was a 17-year-old with two previous speeding
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a license to cut hair requires over 1,000 hours of
training,'' Greening said, referring to the law in Wisconsin.
``We'll give a young driver the keys with only six hours of
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Greening, speaking at a recent meeting of safety advocates here
to press for stricter laws, quoted AAA statistics showing that
nearly a quarter of all 16-year-old drivers are involved in
accidents. ``It's just a matter of how serious it is, who is
injured, who is killed,'' he said. ``We're playing Russian roulette
with the lives of our children; when we hand them the keys to the
car we're putting a bullet in the chamber and spinning it.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety professionals make a similar point, in less dramatic
terms. The National Transportation Safety Board, for example, lists
among its 10 most wanted safety goals ``graduated driver
licensing,'' a multistep program that ensures that there are many
months and many hours of practice between the learner's permit and
the full license.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, the board chairman, said: ``Our current
driver-training programs don't teach young people to drive. They
teach them to pass a test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to provide for enhanced driving practice under the
safest possible real-world driving conditions. None of us proceed
from crawling to walking to riding a bicycle in a single step. We
need training wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   A study this year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,
comparing data from 1975 and 1996, found death rates for drivers of
all ages had declined sharply, and for 17- to 19-year-olds had
declined slightly. For 16-year-olds, though, the rate jumped to 35
for each 100,000 drivers, from 19.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two states have passed some form of graduated licensing,
partly in response to a national AAA campaign. Five states passed
laws in the last year, and in three, stricter provisions take
effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Provisions differ, but most have an extended period during which
teen-agers hold learners' permits that allow them in the driver's
seat only when supervised by fully licensed drivers, and then,
after they pass a road test, a long probationary or restricted
stage that allows driving only during lower-risk times of the day.
Then, according to the AAA model, a young driver would have to wait
until age 18 and pass a second road test to get a full license.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maryland, in a twist, will require a graduated licensing
procedure for all new drivers, regardless of age. ``We've
eliminated age discrimination,'' said Anne Ferro, administrator of
the state Motor Vehicle Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The law was signed this month by Gov. Parris Glendening and
takes effect on July 1, 1999. One reason for Maryland's action was
suspicion that novice drivers were waiting a few extra months,
until they turned 18, to avoid having to take driver's education
classes and road training.
</P>
<P>
   States' restrictions vary. Teen-agers do not have a lot of clout
in state legislatures, but lawmakers may fear that parents will
resent state limits that impinge on the flexibility and convenience
of having a teen-ager who can drive anywhere at any time.
</P>
<P>
   An AAA survey found that Georgia is one of the most restrictive
states, requiring young drivers to keep a learner's permit for 12
months, and if they pass a road test to wait two full years for an
unrestricted license. That means a driver is 18 before he or she
gets an unrestricted license.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, on the other hand, sets a six-month minimum
requirement on learner's permits, allowing drivers to get a full
license while they are still 16.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent tightening of the rules, Virginia decided to set
stricter limits on young drivers who get tickets for moving
violations. Beginning July 1, for a first violation, the driver
will be sent back to driving school, and the number of other
teen-agers allowed in his or her vehicle will be limited to three.
If a young driver has no moving violations, there is no limit to
the number of teen-agers the driver can carry as passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Several states require parents to sign logbooks showing that
they completed a certain number of hours in the car with their
children. A few states require professional training.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and New York have some form of graduated licensing
for teen-agers; New Jersey does not. New York and Connecticut also
allow faster progress toward a full license if the student takes a
driver's education course, although safety professionals differ on
the effectiveness of such classes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edwards, AAA's managing director for traffic safety, said,
``It may be asking too much of public schools or commercial
schools'' to turn out safe drivers. But, he added, ``we don't think
it's asking too much of parents to make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really know you learn how to drive by driving, not by
reading books about it,'' Edwards said. What beginners need most is
``more time behind the wheel.''

DOES DEATH END THE BOND OF SECRECY BETWEEN LAWYER AND CLIENT? 
</HEADLINE>
 BC ATTORNEY-CLIENT-PRIVILEGE-HNS  
 (For release Sunday, June 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Does the attorney-client privilege of
confidentiality die with the client?
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will take up that question Monday as it hears
arguments from lawyers for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and
attorneys representing the lawyer of the late Vincent Foster Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a boyhood friend of President Clinton and a Little Rock
law partner of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, came to
Washington in 1993 to join the new administration as deputy White
House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of his arrival, Foster was embroiled in a
controversy surrounding the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics charged that Mrs. Clinton had ordered the
firings of seven employees of the travel office in May 1993 in
order to make room for friends of the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she had no role in the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   In personal notes written at the time, Foster worried that
administration officials would face a congressional inquiry and
possibly a criminal probe of the firings. He expressed concern that
Mrs. Clinton's role would be misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, Foster consulted his lawyer, James Hamilton, about
what he should do. During their two-hour meeting Hamilton took
three pages of notes.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days later, worried about the travel office controversy,
charges about Whitewater land deals and the hostile political
atmosphere in Washington, Foster drove to Fort Marcy Park in nearby
Virginia and shot himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Starr, investigating allegations that Mrs.
Clinton lied about her role in the travel office firings,
subpoenaed Hamilton's notes.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Washington rejected the subpoena, but in
August 1997 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
ruled in a 2-to-1 decision that after a client's death, the
attorney-client privilege was no longer automatic in criminal
cases. The panel said that in some cases, such as Starr's, a
prosecutor's search for truth outweighed a dead client's interest
in confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case after Hamilton argued
that the attorney-client privilege lives on even though the client
is dead.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this bitter legal dispute could affect how
thousands of Americans consult with lawyers in their final years.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief to the Supreme Court, Starr said Hamilton's notes
were ``highly relevant'' to his office's investigation of whether
Mrs. Clinton or presidential aides lied about the her role in the
travel office firings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no dispute that Mr. Foster would have been an
important witness in this office's investigation of whether
particular individuals made false statements or committed other
federal crimes during investigations of the travel office
firings,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   Some constitutional law experts said that if Starr prevails, the
attorney-client privilege will be eroded, making people reluctant
to tell their lawyers the truth.
</P>
<P>
   David Luban, a law professor at Georgetown University here,
said, ``The whole reason we have an attorney-client privilege is to
encourage clients to be truthful, because they believe what they
say will be kept private.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the court says that privilege ends after death, there will
be many people, particularly the elderly and sick, who will not
feel safe being totally honest with their lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rice, an expert on attorney-client privilege at American
University in Washington, said the appeals court's decision assumes
that people no longer care about their reputation after they die.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, why do prominent people often request that
their personal papers and diaries not be released until 10 or 20
years after their death?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In his Supreme Court appeal, Hamilton argued that the appeals
court's decision ``defeats the fundamental purpose of the
privilege, which is to encourage full and frank communication
between attorneys and clients.'' His brief added that without the
assurance that their conversations would remain private, Foster
``would not have confided in Mr. Hamilton and the notes at issue
would not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Q. Barrett, a former Iran-Contra prosecutor who now
teaches law at St. John's University in New York, said the
interests of law enforcement cannot be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extraordinary circumstances where the interest of
law enforcement carries more weight and can override the
attorney-client privilege without destroying the reasons why we
have the privilege in the first place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury allegations against the first lady were sparked in
1996 by the discovery of a memo suggesting that former White House
official David Watkins had lied about Mrs. Clinton's role in the
firing.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins originally told the General Accounting Office, a key
investigative arm of Congress, that Mrs. Clinton played no role in
the dismissals. But in a memo to then-White House Chief of Staff
Thomas F. McLarty, Watkins wrote that the travel staff had been
sacked after ``pressure for action from the First Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court was originally scheduled to hear the case this
fall, with a decision expected at the earliest in December. But in
April, Starr convinced the justices that waiting until the end of
the year would unduly delay his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to rule on the case by early July.

   $ADV06  YORKTOWN SURVIVORS RECALL
BATTLE THAT SUNK CARRIER
 &HT;     Eds: For release Saturday, June 6. The spot story COX-YORKTOWN,
which moved Thursday, is remain usable as a sidebar.
 &HT;     By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While ocean explorers from the National Geographic
Society were presenting a remote-control video tour of the American
aircraft carrier U.S.S. Yorktown this week, survivors of the ship
toured their memories of the bedlam of a major sea battle.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was sunk by Japanese bombs and torpedoes, the
Yorktown's own planes participated in a fatal strike against three
Japanese carriers in the Battle of Midway in June 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's loss of those carriers and a fourth, which was sunk the
following day, marked the turning point in the war in the Pacific,
naval historians say.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. carriers Enterprise and Hornet, survived the sea
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Surgi, an airplane mechanic on the Yorktown, accompanied
Robert Ballard, the ocean explorer who previously located the
Titanic and the German battleship Bismarck, when he found the
Yorktown in 16,650 feet of water 1,200 miles northwest of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Surgi, now 84, said his job during battle was to fight fires. He
was holding his fire hose, he said, when he saw a plane drop a bomb
which seemed to fall directly toward him.
</P>
<P>
   ~``I ducked and braced myself,'' he said. ``This metal helmet
I'm holding now saved my life, but my left arm was broken.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ship was abandoned, Surgi said he had trouble swimming
with only one arm, but managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``An officer told me to get rid of this helmet because it would
sink me,'' he said. ``I looked back at the Yorktown and realized
this was the only thing I had from that ship. I decided to keep
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When one of the Yorktown's destroyer escorts lowered cargo nets
over the side for members of the carrier crew, Surgi said, he was
unable to climb because of the broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just held on and they pulled me up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Wetherington of Dover, Fla., was a member of the ship's
fighter squadron, assigned to manually push fighter planes into
position to take off and pull them off the flight deck after they
had landed.
</P>
<P>
   During battle, his job changed to loader for an anti-aircraft
gunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a dead-eye shot,'' recalled Wetherington, 79, ``and
whenever he hit one of those Japanese planes, he's scream like a
banshee. All this time, our destroyers were circling us like
hornets, trying to protect that carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetherington said he heard only one order during the two
assaults on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was drilled in their jobs and they did them without
even thinking,'' he recalled. The order he heard was ``abandon
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `Oh, (expression of consternation),' because
that was a big pond out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The last F-47 Wildcat fighter to leave the Yorktown deck was
piloted by John Adams, now of Perdido Key, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get it started to leave with my group,'' he said.
``I sat there on the deck with the attack under way and finally got
started and took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I was launched I saw two Japanese torpedo planes
approaching the ship. I couldn't turn sharply enough to fire on the
first, but I got the second one. The first one got its torpedo into
the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. fighters, torpedo planes and dive bombers could not
return to the Yorktown because of damage inflicted by Japanese
planes and landed on either the Hornet or the Enterprise, its
sister ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we abandoned ship, a lot of the guys were taking their
shoes off, but I just couldn't see getting in that water
barefooted,'' said Glenn Capps, now of Milton, Fla., ``so I kept
mine on.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem came when he tried to climb the cargo net onto a
nearby destroyer and had trouble getting footholds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I got near the top and suddenly a felt a grip like a
vise on my wrist. I'll never forget the feeling of that grip. I
didn't even see his face. He was reaching back for the next guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The bomb hole located by Ballard's camera could have been the
same one that exploded near a gun mount near midships and killed 12
crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survivors was Ray Scates of Spartanburg, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wounded pretty bad,'' he recalled. ``I had six teeth
knocked out and I've still got shrapnel in my head from it that
I'll take to my grave. That was in the first assault. They gave us
morphine and we fought again that afternoon. Later I had over a
hundred stitches in my belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Scates had lied about his age to get into the Navy. When the
Yorktown sank, he was 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   William Leonard, who grew up in an Army family, attended the
U.S. Naval Academy and became a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from the Navy in 1971 as a rear admiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a nice stainless steel sword down there somewhere, if
Dr. Ballard wants to retrieve it,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Although its commander had feared the Yorktown would sink, she
was still afloat the following day.
</P>
<P>
   A salvage party was sent back, aboard the destroyer Hammann, to
recover the dead and try to right the ship. However, a Japanese
submarine got through the stricken carrier's defenses and fired
four torpedoes.
</P>
<P>
   One was a miss.
</P>
<P>
   Two hit the Yorktown and the third hit the Hammann, which was
tied alongside the carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherington, a member of the salvage party, heard the
abandon-ship order again.
</P>
<P>
   The Hammann sank rapidly. Loaded with depth charges that were
set to detonate at 50 feet, it exploded under water.
</P>
<P>
   The Yorktown continue to float, but she was now fatally hit.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, 1942, she rolled over and sank, never to be seen
again until Ballard's remote cameras found her.

AUTO SAFETY: SETTING LIMITS ON TEEN-AGE DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Md., Ga., Va.)   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moved in ``a'' category.)  
(lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress and the state legislatures have bogged
down in their efforts to pass new laws on a risky group of drivers,
those who drive drunk. But lawmakers are still voting new
restrictions on another group who have a disproportionate share of
auto accidents: teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Taken collectively, teen-age drivers are a frightening prospect.
While drivers aged 15 to 20 account for just 7 percent of all
licensed drivers, according to the American Automobile Association,
they were involved in 14 percent of fatal crashes in 1996, and in
20 percent of all crashes reported to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers are involved in crashes for all kinds of reasons, but
alcohol is involved less frequently than it is for drivers in their
20s. Experts say simple inexperience is the main reason for the
high accident rate.
</P>
<P>
   As with drunken driving, the teen-age accident rate has created
a cadre of victims and parents clamoring for changes. One is David
Greening of Ripon, Wis., whose son Kristopher died in a crash last
November in a car that had been traveling at more than 100 miles an
hour. Kristopher, on his way home from a track meet, was a
passenger; the driver was a 17-year-old with two previous speeding
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a license to cut hair requires over 1,000 hours of
training,'' Greening said, referring to the law in Wisconsin.
``We'll give a young driver the keys with only six hours of
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Greening, speaking at a recent meeting of safety advocates here
to press for stricter laws, quoted AAA statistics showing that
nearly a quarter of all 16-year-old drivers are involved in
accidents. ``It's just a matter of how serious it is, who is
injured, who is killed,'' he said. ``We're playing Russian roulette
with the lives of our children. When we hand them the keys to the
car we're putting a bullet in the chamber and spinning it.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety professionals make a similar point, in less dramatic
terms. The National Transportation Safety Board, for example, lists
among its 10 most wanted safety goals ``graduated driver
licensing,'' a multistep program that ensures that there are many
months and many hours of practice between the learner's permit and
the full license.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, the board chairman, said: ``Our current
driver-training programs don't teach young people to drive. They
teach them to pass a test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to provide for enhanced driving practice under the
safest possible real-world driving conditions. None of us proceed
from crawling to walking to riding a bicycle in a single step. We
need training wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   A study this year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,
comparing data from 1975 and 1996, found death rates for drivers of
all ages had declined sharply, and for 17- to 19-year-olds had
declined slightly. For 16-year-olds, though, the rate jumped to 35
for each 100,000 drivers, from 19.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two states have passed some form of graduated licensing,
partly in response to a national AAA campaign. Five states passed
laws in the last year, and in three, stricter provisions take
effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Provisions differ, but most have an extended period during which
teen-agers hold learners' permits that allow them in the driver's
seat only when supervised by fully licensed drivers, and then,
after they pass a road test, a long probationary or restricted
stage that allows driving only during lower-risk times of the day.
Then, according to the AAA model, a young driver would have to wait
until age 18 and pass a second road test to get a full license.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maryland, in a twist, will require a graduated licensing
procedure for all new drivers, regardless of age. ``We've
eliminated age discrimination,'' said Anne Ferro, administrator of
the state Motor Vehicle Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The law was signed this month by Gov. Parris Glendening and
takes effect on July 1, 1999. One reason for Maryland's action was
suspicion that novice drivers were waiting a few extra months,
until they turned 18, to avoid having to take driver's education
classes and road training.
</P>
<P>
   States' restrictions vary. Teen-agers do not have a lot of clout
in state legislatures, but lawmakers may fear that parents will
resent state limits that impinge on the flexibility and convenience
of having a teen-ager who can drive anywhere at any time.
</P>
<P>
   An AAA survey found that Georgia is one of the most restrictive
states, requiring young drivers to keep a learner's permit for 12
months, and if they pass a road test to wait two full years for an
unrestricted license. That means a driver is 18 before he or she
gets an unrestricted license.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, on the other hand, sets a six-month minimum
requirement on learner's permits, allowing drivers to get a full
license while they are still 16.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent tightening of the rules, Virginia decided to set
stricter limits on young drivers who get tickets for moving
violations. Beginning July 1, for a first violation, the driver
will be sent back to driving school, and the number of other
teen-agers allowed in his or her vehicle will be limited to three.
If a young driver has no moving violations, there is no limit to
the number of teen-agers the driver can carry as passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Several states require parents to sign logbooks showing that
they completed a certain number of hours in the car with their
children. A few states require professional training.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and New York have some form of graduated licensing
for teen-agers; New Jersey does not. New York and Connecticut also
allow faster progress toward a full license if the student takes a
driver's education course, although safety professionals differ on
the effectiveness of such classes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edwards, AAA's managing director for traffic safety, said,
``It may be asking too much of public schools or commercial
schools'' to turn out safe drivers. But, he added, ``we don't think
it's asking too much of parents to make that happen.''
</P>

   ``We really know you learn how to drive by driving, not by
reading books about it,'' Edwards said. What beginners need most is
``more time behind the wheel.''

CRASHING THE COMPUTER, NOT THE CAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 7)  
(ja) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not Doom or Flight Simulator, but the AAA Foundation for
Traffic Safety has concocted a lively computer game for teen-agers
called Driver-ZED that shows half a dozen ways to crack up a car,
in city, suburban or country driving.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM game is run through a mouse, and the player has to
identify potential hazards or take action to prevent accidents. The
screen shows the view through the windshield, with rear-view and
side-view mirrors and instrument panel, including speedometer and
turn-signal indicators.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, the player's car is signaling for a left turn,
following another car also signaling for a left. A car is coming in
the opposite direction, and a pedestrian is waiting to cross the
street onto which the player wants to turn.
</P>
<P>
   To gain points, the player has to click on the pedestrian, the
approaching car and the back bumper of the car ahead as potential
hazards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Click, and the action moves ahead. The pedestrian starts across
the street, drops some papers and stoops to retrieve them; the car
ahead stops and the player's car is marooned in the middle of the
intersection as the oncoming car bears down.
</P>
<P>
   If the player spots the hazards and avoids the accidents, the
game awards points. But it is designed with teen-agers in mind; it
still shows the crackup the player averted, complete with squealing
tires, crunching metal and shattering glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' said Stephanie Faul of the AAA Foundation, ``the
kids would do the wrong thing just to see the crash.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is designed for 16-year-olds, but younger children
would probably enjoy it. It keeps score, so siblings can compete.
</P>
<P>
   Because the game is heavy on full-motion video, it requires a
premium computer: a Pentium 90 with Sigma Designsken neckwear.
</P>
<P>
   `You fool,` gasped the man. `I'm dying! I need water!`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, sir,` replied the bedouin, `If you really need water,
there is a tent about 2 kilometers south of here where you can get
some.`
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing how, the man summoned sufficient strength to
drag his parched body the distance to the second tent. With his
last ounce of strength he tugged at the door of the tent and
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Another bedouin, dressed in a costly tuxedo, appeared at the
door and &QL; 
inquired, `May I help you sir?`
</P>
<P>
   `Water...` was the feeble reply.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, sir,` replied the bedouin, `I'm sorry, but you can't come
in here without a tie!`

   The president has ordered that new government documents be
written in plain language. Pursuant, of course, to hitherto

<P>
   ``The federal government's writing must be in plain language,''
Mr. Clinton says. Glad there was no such rule six score and 15

</P>
<P>
   Clarifying: Mr. Clinton wants plain _ not plane _ language. The
latter is what's spoken on Air Force One.

   If the GOP doesn't rein in its ``extreme right,'' says Gerald

digest and writers cramp.

5-LEGGED TEXAS FROG MAILED TO CALIFORNIA FOR STUDY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif. and Minn.) 
 
By CINDY HORSWELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSS HILL, Texas _ Less than an inch in length, the brown frog
was so tiny that Matt Whitbeck ordinarily would have paid scant
attention.
</P>
<P>
   But something about the way the critter was maneuvering _ more
like a spider _ caused Whitbeck, a biological technician, to take a
second look.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the strange gait? The frog has five working legs.
</P>
<P>
   Whitbeck, a biological technician with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, found it last month as he was posting a sign to
mark the perimeter of a wildlife refuge along the Trinity River
near this Liberty County town in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Spring Peeper, whose scientific name is ``pseudacris
crucifer,'' had the traditional two hindlegs but three forelimbs.
</P>
<P>
   Known for its night crooning, such frogs are a common species in
Texas. But because of its extra limb, this particular frog may help
solve a biological mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists started tracking such malformed frogs about five
years ago. Research is starting to indicate that such deformities
may not be the result of genetic disorders, but rather birth
defects caused by exposures to something in the environment _
possibly agriculture chemicals, said Dr. David Gardiner, a
molecular biologist at the University of California in Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   The frog from the Trinity River Wildlife Refuge was shipped
Tuesday to his research center where it will be studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It arrived by Fed-Ex in a jar and is still alive,'' Gardiner
said. ``Most specimens don't survive very long because of their
deformities _ not just the extra limbs but other disorders that
aren't as obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first live one I've had to study,'' he added.
``Everybody's coming in to look at it. It's like a pet. We're still
working on a name.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the first deformed frog found in the Houston area and
reported to the North American Reporting Center for Amphibian
Malformations.
</P>
<P>
   The center started keeping records a few years ago after
clusters of malformed frogs started appearing in northern states,
such as Minnesota, and several Canadian provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Marcus, manager of the Trinity River Wildlife Refuge, is
aware of only two other malformed frogs that have been found
recently in Texas. Only one of those is listed on the North
American reporting center's Internet site _ a bullfrog with an
extra limb found in a pond by some children in Burleson County in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the 1960s, another unexplained group of frog
deformities was recorded in several counties in Texas. The cause of
those deformities was never determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd to see this sort of thing,'' Marcus said. ``Some
think it might relate to pollution and the fact that frogs live
near water and can easily absorb chemicals through their skin.
These frogs may be like the canary that warns miners of gas leaks.
The frogs may be telling us that we're being endangered by
pollutants.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus so far hasn't found any more five-legged frogs on his
wildlife refuge, which consists of 4,600 forested acres along the
Trinity River about 45 minutes east of Houston. He will be keeping
a lookout, but since he manages the refuge by himself he doesn't
have time to make a search.
</P>
<P>
   In hot spots in Minnesota, the concentrations of malformed frogs
have run as high as 50 percent in some areas, Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
   He said researchers want to know if whatever is causing
malformations in frogs may also be a threat to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans have the same signaling pathways that frogs do. While
humans might not grow an extra limb, our embryos may die before
birth. Frogs can survive easier because they have 3,000 embryos at
a time,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is trying to determine what kind of chemicals might
produce the deformities being found in frogs. The most common
deformity has been an extra limb, but other malformations are also
being noted, such as missing eyes, missing limbs and retained
tails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious, persistent problem because of the possible
implications to human health,'' Gardiner said. ``In some areas, the
reports of malformed frogs have stopped but that's only because
there are no more frogs left there.''

NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED IN `TALES OF THE CITY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome back to 28 Barbary Lane. It's been 4{ years since our
last visit, but only six weeks have passed in TV time. It is still
1977, and the stories unfolding in and around Anna Madrigal's
apartment house are as strange as ever. So are the people.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Singleton, the once naive transplant from Cleveland, is
looking for Mr. Right. So is her gay friend, Michael Tolliver. Mona
Ramsey is looking for her past. Newcomer Brian Hawkins is looking
through binoculars at the naked woman across the way. The wise and
wonderful Mrs. Madrigal is looking in her garden for some weed, if
you get my drift.
</P>
<P>
   So not too much has changed since the first ``Tales of the
City'' entertained PBS viewers in January 1994. Except that ``More
Tales of the City'' isn't airing on PBS. The juicy stuff that made
Armistead Maupin's serialized flights of fiction in the San
Francisco Chronicle a sensation in the '70s made some TV viewers
queasy in the '90s. Unappreciative of the pot smoking, the casual
cussing, the occasional nudity and the same-sex relationships in
the original ``Tales,'' a group of lawmakers-turned-critics
threatened to cut federal funding if PBS went ahead with a planned
sequel. PBS caved like the Mariners in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to Showtime, the premium-cable channel whose slogan is ``No
Limits.'' Maupin got a new home for his odd little ``family,'' and
the television audience _ at least the 15 million or so with
Showtime _ got five more hours of Maupin's enchanting stories.
</P>
<P>
   Though not entirely well acted, ``More Tales'' exerts a
maddeningly effective tug. Each of the six new installments has its
slow moments, but Maupin's stories, adapted by
</P>
<P>
   screenwriter Nicholas Wright, are just zany enough, in a David
E. Kelley sort of way, that woody performances and stony dialogue
are partly forgivable.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Linney, reprising the girl-next-door character of Mary
Ann, is the key figure _ literally and figuratively _ in ``More
Tales.'' She is somehow connected to every other player, including
the new man in her life, Burke Andrew (Colin Ferguson), who spent
three years in San Francisco but can't remember anything from the
period. The only clue to his past is a key found on him when police
discovered him unconscious in a park.
</P>
<P>
   Linney's strawberry-blonde likability transcends the low points,
providing vital links to Maupin's off-center tales of love,
treachery, friendship, murder, adultery, discovery, transsexuality,
voyeurism and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Siemaszko is a treat in the role of the confused Mona
Ramsey (played by Chloe Webb in the original ``Tales''). Mona knows
she's from a strange family, but she has no idea how strange until
she meets up with Mother Mucca (Jackie Burroughs), a crusty crone
who runs a brothel in Winnemucca, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gibson also returns as Beauchamp Day, Mary Lynn's
philandering philistine of a boss. If only he were so deliciously
despicable on ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, everything and everyone comes back to roost at
Barbary Lane under the watchful eye of Anna Madrigal (Olympia
Dukakis), whose solid-gold heart shines a warm light on Maupin's
well-imagined hope opera _ and on the likeliehood of a sequel to
the sequel: ``Further Tales of the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the City. Five-hour miniseries
continuing the stories of a diverse group of people living in San
Francisco in the late 1970s. Starring Laura Linney, Nina Siemaszko,
Olympia Dukakis, Thomas Gibson, William Campbell, Paul Hopkins,
Barbara Garrick, Colin Ferguson and Whip Hubley. Sunday and Monday
at 9 p.m., Showtime. Parental guideline rating: TV-MA (mature
audiences).

   &UR; 50 YEARS OF NORTH BEACH BEAUTIFICATION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They're throwing a party  &LR; Saturday  &LR; afternoon at Parkview Beauty
Salon in North Beach to celebrate owner &UR; Joe Jachetta &LR; 's 50 years in
three locations around Washington Square. The hostesses, joining
forces to cater the event with home-cooked food, are Jachetta's
band of steadfast clients, Italian women who were of a certain age
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It cost $1.50 for a wash and set on May 19, 1948, and $1.50 for
a haircut; today, it's $17.50 for a wash and set, and $15 for a
haircut, still low when compared with cutting-edge establishments.
``This shop is not a salon,'' says Jachetta. ``It's a club.'' If
you've ever seen the movie ``Steel Magnolias,'' he says, ``this is
`Steel Mortadella.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, most customers wanted to look like  &UR; Gina &LR; 
 &UR; Lollobrigida &LR; , whose hair was styled in a bouffant with spit curls.
Nowadays, although many clients are the same women, their major
demand has changed: ``They want it to last a week.'' They come in
for weekly sets _ ``at least they have it done to go to church'' _
which they preserve by wrapping their heads in toilet paper at
night, or sleeping on silk pillow cases.
</P>
<P>
   These women like to keep their hair the same color and style
that they've had for years. ``If they went home with something
new,'' says Jachetta, ``their children would say `Ma ...' ''

</P>
<P>
   ``In a life that has been filled with service, glory and
heroism,'' said the letter, which is quoted in the Hill, ``it is
safe to say about the only thing John Glenn hasn't done and the
only honor he hasn't received is the honor of appearing on a

   STADIUM-NAME (Seattle) Safeco insurance company has bought
naming rights to the Seattle Mariners' new $417 million stadium,

years, plus annual adjustments for inflation, bringing the total to
about $40 million. That's comparable to other stadium-naming deals

   &UR; 50 YEARS OF NORTH BEACH BEAUTIFICATION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They're throwing a party  &LR; Saturday  &LR; afternoon at Parkview Beauty
Salon in North Beach to celebrate owner &UR; Joe Jachetta &LR; 's 50 years in
three locations around Washington Square. The hostesses, joining
forces to cater the event with home-cooked food, are Jachetta's
band of steadfast clients, Italian women who were of a certain age
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It cost $1.50 for a wash and set on May 19, 1948, and $1.50 for
a haircut; today, it's $17.50 for a wash and set, and $15 for a
haircut, still low when compared with cutting-edge establishments.
``This shop is not a salon,'' says Jachetta. ``It's a club.'' If
you've ever seen the movie ``Steel Magnolias,'' he says, ``this is
`Steel Mortadella.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, most customers wanted to look like  &UR; Gina &LR; 
 &UR; Lollobrigida &LR; , whose hair was styled in a bouffant with spit curls.
Nowadays, although many clients are the same women, their major
demand has changed: ``They want it to last a week.'' They come in
for weekly sets _ ``at least they have it done to go to church'' _
which they preserve by wrapping their heads in toilet paper at
night, or sleeping on silk pillow cases.
</P>
<P>
   These women like to keep their hair the same color and style
that they've had for years. ``If they went home with something
new,'' says Jachetta, ``their children would say `Ma ...' ''

</P>
<P>
   ``In a life that has been filled with service, glory and

`CYMBELINE': MASTERFUL FAIRY TALE OF TROUBLED ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The wide world beyond the small one in which she has
always lived beckons through the fog, as tempting as it is unknown.
For Imogen, the sorely tried heroine of Shakespeare's
``Cymbeline,'' this shadowy future can't arrive quickly enough.
``O, for a horse with wings!'' she exclaims, and it's impossible
not to share her exhilaration and impatience. Yet her face suddenly
melts from ardent resolve into an expression that, for just a
second, betrays a terrified uncertainty. Anything could happen out
there, couldn't it? Anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   How can you not identify with such a scene? As portrayed with
life-clutching passion by Joanne Pearce in the Royal Shakespeare
Company's hot-and-cold interpretation of ``Cymbeline,'' at the
Opera House of the Brooklyn Academy of Music through Saturday,
Imogen embodies the ambivalence of everyone who has stood at the
crossroads of youth and adulthood. The moment when she decides to
break from her family and seek out the man she loves is what
concludes the first half of this production, and it's a glorious
testament to the questing, affirmative spirit of this strange,
crowded fairy tale of a romance.
</P>
<P>
   Imogen is right to be apprehensive, of course. Horrible things
will happen to her as, attired in men's clothing, she roams through
the wilds of Britain in the time of Caesar Augustus. She
unwittingly takes poison; dies (or seems to); is reborn; discovers
a headless corpse she believes belongs to her beloved, banished
husband, and joins the Roman troops that are warring against her
father, the British King of the play's title.
</P>
<P>
   A bit far-fetched, isn't it? Shakespeare's other resourceful,
cross-dressing heroines, like Viola and Rosalind, never had to
endure so much. Yet as long as Ms. Pearce is on stage, there's a
core of credibility to the extreme circumstances that surround her.
Never mind that her expansive gestures run to the melodramatic, or
that her throaty alto voice leans toward the declamatory. Ms.
Pearce's Imogen is perfectly in scale with the magnitude of
Shakespeare's play, exaggerated yet somehow wonderfully human.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything is on a level with Ms. Pearce's performance in
Adrian Noble's willfully mannered presentation of the second of
Shakespeare's late, troubled romances. As the artistic director of
the Royal Shakespeare Company, which concludes its five-work
repertory of performances at the academy with ``Cymbeline,'' Noble
has given himself the mandate of broadening the appeal of the
canon, of making it accessible to audiences unfamiliar with or
grown weary of their Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Cymbeline'' is mercifully without the desperate
attention-getting devices of the troupe's swanky, noisy ``Hamlet,''
directed by Matthew Warchus in the inaugural production of the
company's visit here. Noble provides a more successfully sustained
point of view, for sure. To make the work's unlikely, Brothers
Grimm-ish events more digestible, he places them in the context of
a severely stylized fable, both exotic and beguilingly simple.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant visual flavor, realized with flair and precision in
the set and costume designs of Anthony Ward, is Japanese. Seen
against the backdrop of an expansive cerulean sky with a hint of
menacing clouds, the emblem of a universe both benevolent and
endlessly unpredictable, the movements of the ensemble bring to
mind the iconographic postures of the Kabuki theater.
</P>
<P>
   When warriors face off in battle here, it is as Samurai
warriors. The servants in the court of Cymbeline (the busy Edward
Petherbridge, also the star of the company's ``Krapp's Last Tape'')
scurry about with the stooped stances and mincing postures of
extras in ``The Mikado.'' Cymbeline's ambitious wife (Joanna
McCallum), who unwisely goads her husband into war with Rome, plays
duplicity like a souped-up seesaw, alternating between honeyed
diplomacy and vicious eruptions of temper. And she looks like an
Asian variation on the evil queen in Disney's ``Snow White,'' a
foil to Petherbridge's subdued Cymbeline, who comes into his
majesty only in the final scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The production is winking at us a bit, it becomes clear, and
sometimes even nudging us in the ribs. Noble is deliberately
distancing his audience from the improbabilities of Shakespeare's
outlandish story (drawn in part from Boccaccio's ``Decameron''),
accenting the archetypal dimensions of many of its characters and
underscoring its mythological patterns. Yet he also asks us to be
moved by the work's deeply felt message of the redemptive powers of
forgiveness. He wants, in other words, to have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tricky balance, and sometimes the three-hour production,
which trims the folio text by roughly a thousand lines, indeed
succeeds in achieving it. Noble's reworking and streamlining of the
play's opening scene is splendid, condensing an awkward dialogue of
exposition between two courtiers into a single tale told by a
soothsayer (John Kane) around a fire, a story that elicits its
share of incredulous ``oohs'' from the listeners gathered onstage.
</P>
<P>
   As Kane mentions each of the characters who will figure in the
plot, the actors playing them stand up to cast off their identical
Zen monklike robes, assuming their roles with an infectiously eager
flourish. The implication here is irresistible: ``We're going to
tell you an incredible story,'' they seem to be saying. ``You have
to listen to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a masterly setup, and throughout the evening Ward's
ingenious use of an immense, space-dividing white sheet proves
remarkably adroit in defining the work's many different settings,
from worldly Rome to rural Wales, while retaining the sense of an
abstract, universal myth. It's an atmosphere enhanced by Hugh
Vanstone's fluid, shifting lighting. The tone isn't always matched,
unfortunately, by that of the performances, which can veer toward
kitsch and cuteness.

 NEW YORK: and cuteness.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever there's a piece of coincidence-driven plot to be
explained, the actors tend to deliver it with a dizzy ``can you
believe this'' expression. And one of Shakespeare's most intriguing
villains, the Iago-like Italian nobleman Iachimo (Paul Freeman), is
portrayed as a vain, aging roue who seems incapable of causing the
damage he does. The disturbing scene in which Iachimo hovers over
the sleeping Imogen, whom he has vowed to seduce as part of a wager
with her banished husband, Posthumus (Damian Lewis), is stripped of
its sexual menace, played instead as something approaching a
vaudeville sketch.
</P>
<P>
   The trio of nobly born men living as children of nature in the
Welsh countryside (Ian Hogg, Jo Stone-Fewings and Richard Cant)
bring to mind the comically virile, gung-ho woodsmen of ``Seven
Brides for Seven Brothers.'' And the visitation of the imprisoned
Posthumus by the ghosts of his parents (David Glover and Jenifer
Armitage) and by the fate-ordering Jupiter (Ewart James Walters) is
oddly tentative, lacking clarity and power.
</P>
<P>
   There are other moments, however, when the evening's glib,
whimsical surface is torn by searing emotions. Most of these come
from Ms. Pearce, but the intense Lewis brings a haunting feeling of
irreparable injury to the scene where he is made to believe that
Imogen has betrayed him. And as Posthumus' devoted servant, Paul
Bentall brings a charmingly wry sense of wonder to the proceedings
that is the cornerstone of the play's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a godsend of a cartoon portrait of a lout from Guy
Henry, who plays Cloten, the Queen's dimwitted son and rejected
suitor to Imogen, with dazzling comic inventiveness. Deliciously
slow on the uptake and full of addled, injured pride, Henry's
Cloten brings to mind an idle, privilege-conscious aristocrat who
has spent too many nights in the company of cocaine and fawning
friends. He has some of the outrageous, daring spark of Jim Carrey
and pushes comic business to excess on more than one occasion. But
there's an oddly affecting emotional logic at the center of this
fool, and when Henry goes over the top, you happily accompany him.
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone, though, it's Ms. Pearce who gives this
``Cymbeline'' its requisite cosmic glow. No matter how absurd the
situations in which she finds herself, and that includes waking up
next to a headless corpse, her wandering Princess gives off a vital
sincerity that forestalls nervous laughter.
</P>
<P>
   You never doubt for a second that she is feeling, with every
nerve, whatever befalls her. Because she has remained wide open to
all experience, both painful and joyous, you also believe that she
has grown and learned by the evening's end. She takes us to the
play's peak of wondering acceptance of life's extravagant variety,
which the production itself never quite reaches.

BOND PRICES FALL AFTER BRITISH INTEREST RATES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices dropped sharply Thursday, hurt by new
signs of U.S. economic strength and a surprise increase in interest
rates by the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety that Friday's May employment report from the Labor
Department might reveal further economic vitality also undermined
the bond market, where signs of a strong economy tend to elevate
fears of possible inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond fell 18/32 to a price of 104 11/32, while the
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.82 percent,
from 5.78 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond market has rallied quite noticeably recently because
of the exemplary inflation performance, the budget surplus, a
strong dollar, continued distress in Asia, a flight to quality from
overseas investors, and an expectation of slower economic growth in
the second quarter,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at
Chase Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the market's improved tone hit a sour note today on signs
of continued buoyant consumer spending, strong factory orders and
inventories, and skittishness in front of tomorrow's labor-market
statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Factory orders rose 1.2 percent in April to near forecasts for a
1.6 percent gain, while first quarterly productivity numbers
increased dramatically to 1.1 percent from 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fine said the labor-market data due Friday will likely set the
tone for the financial markets until June 10, when Federal Reserve
Board chairman Alan Greenspan delivers his eagerly awaited
testimony to the Joint Economic Committee in Congress, which could
provide clues about the central bank's leanings on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England's unexpected decision to raise interest
rates by one-quarter point to 7.5 percent also hurt the Treasury
market by raising yields on British debt securities, making them
more competitive with Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dennis Hynes, chief market strategist and managing
director of R.W. Pressprich &AMP; Co., a New York broker-dealer, said
he did not see the rate increase by the Bank of England having much
of an impact on the U.S. market. Hynes said the British bank tends
to be more forward-looking and pre-emptive than the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making a statement and saying they are concerned
about inflation and asserting themselves, though it may be at the
expense of the economy,'' he said.

INDONESIA AND FOREIGN BANKS REACH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia and a group of foreign bankers
agreed Thursday on a framework for rescheduling nearly $80 billion
in corporate and bank debt that has become one of the biggest
barriers to restarting the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   As Indonesia plunges into a deep recession, the agreement offers
hope that its weakened currency could begin to recover, that cash
will start to flow again, that moribund companies will not be
crushed by their debts, and that Indonesia's crucial export
industries will flourish again.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent turmoil here, economic activity has come to a
virtual halt as the banking system reels from a mountain of bad
loans, interest rates have soared, lending has all but stopped and
cash has become scarce throughout the economy.
</P>
<P>
   As a framework for renegotiating debt, the unexpectedly quick
action by a group of 13 foreign banks meeting with Indonesian
officials in Frankfurt gives Indonesia the best economic news it
has received in months. It is also a boost to the new government of
President B.J. Habibie, who is struggling to assert his legitimacy
in the face of calls for an early election.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the intertwined political and economic crises _ which
seem still to be on a downward spiral _ present Indonesia with a
perilous outlook in the months ahead. On a visit to Jakarta on
Thursday, Stanley Roth, the top official for Asian affairs at the
State Department, said the most important factor in economic
recovery now would be the restoration of political stability.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's agreement focused on one of the country's most
intractable problems and offered hope that solutions are possible.
Bankers cautioned, however, that the framework is a prelude to
individual negotiations between lenders and borrowers who may
choose to use it as a guide for stretching out the repayment of
loans. ``It's not a magic pill,'' said an official at one bank
involved in the pact. Banks may opt out of certain parts and they
are free to decide which loans they will renegotiate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pact was spearheaded by a steering committee involving the
Chase Manhattan Bank, the largest U.S. lender to Indonesian
companies, Deutsche Bank of Germany and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of Indonesian companies, the framework provides a
three-year period during which they would only have to pay interest
on their loans. After that, there would be a five-year period
during which borrowers could make loan payments, presumably with
renegotiated interest rates and other terms.
</P>
<P>
   It gives banks up to four years to pay some $9 billion in debts
owed to other banks that now are generally being deferred by
informal understandings. As part of the agreement, Indonesia agreed
to pay more than $1 billion in bank debt and trade financing that
had been in arrears.
</P>
<P>
   And to jump-start trade, the pact provides for financing by
foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia also agreed to set up a new government office, the
Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agency, that will both provide
sufficient availability of dollars, German marks and Japanese yen
for repayment of foreign loans and protection against currency rate
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   One of Indonesia's biggest problems is that its currency has
fallen to about 25 percent of the value against the dollar compared
to it value a year ago. With that weakness, borrowers have watched
their foreign loan payments skyrocket and many have found it
impossible to repay their borrowings.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia had formally halted debt repayments at the beginning
of this year, pending an agreement with international banks.
</P>
<P>
   But economists cautioned that the country's economic and
political problems are now so severe that there is little chance of
a quick turnaround. Inflation this year is expected to climb to 50
percent or more, and unemployment to as high as 20 percent. Overall
economic growth is projected to contract by at least 10 percent and
maybe as much as 20 percent. By contrast, the country's economic
growth averaged 8 percent a year for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts said Thursday's agreement was far more
complex than previous debt rescheduling agreements reached in
Mexico in 1995 and South Korea earlier this year because of the
large number of Indonesian banks and corporations and weak
financial reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, which recently negotiated a $40 billion Indonesian
bailout, praised the bank pact for giving ``breathing space to
recover from the current crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the pact would ``have the immediate effect of relieving
the pressure on the foreign exchange market, and will help to
revive international trade and economic activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jakarta stock exchange jumped by 3.5 percent Thursday on
news of the banking agreement. But reflecting a broad
discouragement with the country's economic prospects, the
Indonesian currency, the rupiah, showed little response, remaining
at 11,550 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Strong, chief credit officer of the Chase Manhattan Bank,
which took a lead role in the talks with Indonesia, cautioned that
a recovery was still a long way off. ``It's going to be a long
process,'' he said. The banking framework is `` a very large step,
but just one step on a path that will require a lot of work on
everybody's part.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the agreement gives the banks considerable
flexibility in deciding which loans to renegotiate, which trade
financings would be extended and to which Indonesian companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thursday's agreement, the three-year grace period for
corporate borrowers could begin in December on interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian central bank will administer the new debt
restructuring agency that will operate like a state trust fund. In
providing risk protection and the availability of foreign exchange,
it will not subsidize exchange rates. Its role is to provide a
limited cushion against fluctuations of the rates.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials estimated Thursday that companies owing
about $60 billion would participate. The remaining $20 billion is
owed by companies that are either too damaged for rescue or are
strong enough to proceed with payments on their own.
</P>
<P>
   For Indonesian banks, the four years that may be used to repay
some $9 billion in loans, applies to borrowings due through next
March. The central bank will guarantee the repayments.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to revive the country's stagnant trade sector,
Indonesia will request international banks to make their ``best
efforts'' to maintain trade financing for one year at the levels
that existed at the end of last April. The government estimates
that such a deal could release financing for between $4 billion to
$6 billion in trade for Indonesian companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thursday's agreement, individual debtors and creditor
banks must proceed on their own to reach ``an amicable agreement''
on repayments, said an American banker in Jakarta. ``If the
Indonesian company still expresses its inability to repay debt, the
international bank can start bankruptcy proceedings,'' he said. But
given the eight-year window for repayments, he said he expected
such proceedings to be rare.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government has insisted from the start that it
would not bail out bankrupt companies. Under the country's
agreement with the IMF, it has already formulated new bankruptcy
laws that are expected to be approved by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Strong said the restructuring negotiations did not touch on any
provision for debt writeoffs. ``We hope there won't be any need for
writeoffs,'' he said. ``But that decision will be taken after banks
make an independent assessment.''

AIDS ACTIVISTS MARCH WITH OPEN CASKET TO PROTEST CLINTON POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even in death, AIDS activist Steve Michael
protested in the same uncanny, confrontational manner he used when
he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   The former head of the Washington chapter of the AIDS Coalition
To Unleash Power (ACT UP), who died of the disease May 25 at age
42, lay in an open casket in front of the White House on Thursday
as more than 100 mourners gathered to protest President Clinton's
AIDS policies.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on Michael's final wishes, his mother Barbara Michael and
his companion Wayne Turner marched the body about half a mile down
Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The march, Turner said, was
to ``show the world that Bill Clinton has lied to and betrayed
people with AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on you, Bill Clinton,'' Turner said, standing behind the
casket. ``Bill Clinton, you say feel my pain. Bill Clinton, you
have caused my pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of ACT UP accuse Clinton of backing down on promises
they say he made in the early days of his presidency to make AIDS a
top priority of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   They also attacked the president for his decision to not fund
needle-exchange programs that allow drug users to swap used needles
for clean ones.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers concluded that the programs were effective
in curbing the spread of AIDS and did not encourage illegal drug
use, the Clinton administration banned federal funding for
needle-exchanges in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is a murderer,'' said Ann Northrop of New York
City. ``He is a liar, and he is letting people with AIDS die on
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Northrop was Michael's running mate when he made a token bid for
the Democratic presidential nomination in 1996, campaigning in New
Hampshire against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the White House, demonstrators carried a 30-foot
effigy of Clinton dressed as the grim reaper and held up posters
showing the president with a long, Pinocchio-like nose and signs
that read, ``Clinton lies, we die.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Michael, a Los Angeles AIDS activist, said: ``Clinton
doesn't feel personally involved because no one he cares about has
died.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened to his family, if it happened to Chelsea
(Clinton's daughter), he'd be keeping his promises,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Michael stroked and kissed her son's forehead and Turner,
35, leaned into the casket and whispered into Michael's ear. The
body was clothed in an ACT UP T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's body was returned to a funeral home after the
hour-long demonstration. The body will cremated Saturday and Turner
said he would keep the ashes at his Washington home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know. He might still have a few protests left in him
yet,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   During his lifetime, Michael chose not to lobby Congress, a
tactic used by other AIDS activists, and instead used
confrontational protests that got attention but angered those who
disagreed with his in-your-face style.
</P>
<P>
   He staged a demonstration during Clinton's last-minute Christmas
shopping spree in 1997 and yelled, ``Hey Bill! Your AIDS plan is a
sham!'' as the president left Washington's Union Station shopping
complex.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry called Thursday's
protest a ``dramatic action,'' but said the president ``takes very
seriously the fight against AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has devoted considerable resources, has
called for increasing resources to be available for the fight
against this disease,'' McCurry said. ``I think the record shows
that (Clinton) has done more than any of his predecessors.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry noted that the president had called for an expedited
effort to develop an AIDS vaccine and called for Medicare and
health insurance programs to provide coverage for the disease.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the temperature in the town of Midland in west
Texas soared to a record 111 degrees. Meanwhile, just a few hundred
miles away at North Platte, Nebraska, the mercury could only climb
to 47 degrees, a record low maximum. The unseasonably large
contrast in temperatures revealed the footprint of a strong front
extending east to west across the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, showers and thunderstorms will erupt along and ahead of
this southward-sagging front from east Texas to Georgia and the
Carolinas. The most organized area of storms will occur in the
lower Mississippi Valley, as a low pressure zone ripples east along
the front. A few of the storms could reach severe levels, with
damaging winds and hail posing a threat. Tornadoes are possible,
though a major outbreak is unlikely. Teeming rains may produce
flash flooding in areas affected by recurrent eastward-moving
showers and thunderstorms. North of the front, pockets of rain will
dampen the lower Ohio River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Cumulus clouds will build over northern New England after a
relatively clear morning, as air in contact with sun-warmed ground
rises into cold air aloft. Brief showers will dot the high ground
from upstate New York to northern Maine. Along the New England
coast, cool winds from the northwest will average 15 to 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, sunny, warm conditions will embrace the Southwest and
much of California. However, patches of fog and low clouds will
plague the coast early in the day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: STRONGEST TORNADO
</P>
<P>
   The tornado that roared through the town of Frostburg in western
Maryland Tuesday evening was the strongest to hit the state since
tornado records began to be recorded in 1950. The 15-mile long
tornado first struck near the Maryland border at Salisbury, Pa. For
most of its life, the tornado deserved a rating of F3 on the Fujita
scale, with damage consistent with wind speeds estimated between
150 and 200 mph. As the twister hit Frostburg, its rating briefly
jumped to F4, with winds of 210 mph. By convention, the overall
strength of the tornado will be listed as F4 in weather records. &QL;

SHUTTLE DOCKS WITH MIR FOR FINAL TIME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts warmly
greeted one another aboard the Mir space station after a U.S.
shuttle crew docked Thursday for a ninth and final time.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the high-flying linkup over the Caspian Sea, the
crew of the shuttle Discovery reclaimed colleague Andy Thomas, the
last of seven Americans assigned to live and work aboard the
Russian orbital outpost since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cold War rivals initiated the co-operative program to
prepare for the upcoming assembly of a new international space
station. It will be at least mid-1999 before that project is far
enough along for a reunion of the kind that unfolded Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 46, was ecstatic over the prospect of returning to Earth
next week as his near five-month voyage draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot imagine how wonderful it was to look out the window
and see a bright point of light on the horizon that I knew to be
the shuttle and watch it slowly grow in size as it loomed up close
to us,'' Thomas said. ``It was really an absolutely magnificent
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   With commander Charles Precourt and pilot Dominic Gorie at the
controls, Discovery nestled into Mir's docking mechanism at 11:58
a.m., CDT, precisely as scheduled. Mir experienced none of the
steering problems that erupted prior to the shuttle's launch
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks beautiful from here, Houston, beautiful,'' Precourt
informed mission control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masterful flying,'' acknowledged Marc Garneau, Discovery's
liaison in mission control.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, much of the drama would have been beamed to Earth by
the shuttle crew through live television. However, the video stream
was all but blacked out by a problem with the circuitry in
Discovery's high-speed communications system.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement was still evident, however, in the voices of the
astronauts and the cosmonauts as Discovery neared the outpost,
triggering an urgent exchange of greetings and range measurements
over a ship-to-ship radio frequency.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, who lack the shuttle's global satellite
communications network, managed a few brief live television views
as Discovery inched toward Mir's berthing port and of the
astronauts and cosmonauts embracing once the airtight hatches
separating the ships had swung open.
</P>
<P>
   The orbital encounter united Discovery's Precourt, Gorie, Wendy
Lawrence, Franklin Chang-Diaz, Janet Kavandi and their guest
Russian cosmonaut Valeri Ryumin with the Mir crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome, welcome,'' bellowed Mir commander Talgat Musabayev
and flight engineer Nikolai Budarin as Precourt and his crew
entered the station. ``We're glad to see you again in space. You
look good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are feeling great and glad to be here,'' Precourt assured
his hosts, offering fresh fruit, onions and large containers of
fresh water. Later, the crews celebrated with a meal together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just my second day in space,'' gushed rookie astronaut
Kavandi. ``It's just overwhelming to be on a space station
already.''
</P>
<P>
   The two spacecraft are scheduled to stay joined until Monday,
allowing the crews to exchange several tons of food, clothing,
research equipment and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NASA's ground control teams are continuing their
efforts to re-establish the shuttle's satellite television link to
the ground. More than pictures are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The link is also needed by the ground-based research teams
working with the experimental physics observatory aboard Discovery
called the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.
</P>
<P>
   The observatory was developed to search for evidence of cosmic
anti-matter aboard the new space station. The Discovery flight was
an opportunity to test its operation.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had planned to use the shuttle's frequency as a
two-way link to allow them to adjust the spectrometer's electronics
before making 100 hours of test observations.
</P>
<P>
   Repairs by the shuttle crew earlier in the flight had permitted
about one hour of ground transmissions through brief passes over
ground stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real problem is that we are still baffled by what our real
problem is,'' said NASA flight director Paul Dye, who is attempting
to coordinate a repair plan.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery is scheduled to return to Earth on June 12.

COURT REBUFFS STARR'S REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED HEARINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court delivered a swift and unanimous
rebuff Thursday to Kenneth Starr's effort to short circuit the
ordinary appellate process and get a quick ruling from the justices
on disputed claims of privilege for four grand jury witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The court said in two brief orders that it would not grant
expedited hearings, or indeed any hearings at all at this stage, on
the scope of the attorney-client privilege for White House lawyers
or on the existence of a previously unrecognized ``protective
function privilege'' for Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, is seeking testimony
from Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel and close
presidential confidant, and from three Secret Service employees as
part of his investigation into whether President Clinton had a
sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
and sought to have her cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of the U.S. District Court in
Washington rejected both claims of privilege in separate rulings
last month. Despite having won the two cases, Starr asked for an
immediate Supreme Court review to avoid, he said, any further delay
in his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The court Thursday denied both portions of Starr's requests:
that it take jurisdiction of the two cases away from the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and that it
hear the cases on an expedited timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is assumed that the court of appeals will proceed
expeditiously to decide this case,'' the court said in each of its
two one-paragraph orders.
</P>
<P>
   While the appeals court could schedule arguments as early as
next month, even such an accelerated schedule would effectively
preclude the justices, whose current term ends in a matter of
weeks, from having a final say on the issues before the November
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   How that fact may affect Starr's own timetable, either for
seeking an indictment of Ms. Lewinsky for perjury and other charges
or for sending an impeachment report to the House of
Representatives, as he hinted he might consider in one of his
Supreme Court briefs this week, is the most obvious question raised
by the court's action Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel made no reference to his long-range
strategy in a statement he issued after the court's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the Supreme Court's determination today, we will
proceed to litigate these issues as quickly as the court of
appeals' schedule will permit,'' Starr said. ``This office will
continue to take every reasonable and practicable step to bring out
the relevant facts as promptly as possible, so this investigation
can be concluded in a thorough and expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, said, ``The Supreme Court
acted appropriately today rejecting Mr. Starr's attempt to bypass
the traditional appeals process.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, pronounced the
president ``pleased'' and then said, in answer to a question on
whether the result would now be ``more delay,'' that it was ``day
1,400 of Ken Starr's tenure as an independent counsel at the rate
of $30,000 a day of taxpayers' money.'' He added: ``Now, if there's
any delay, that's the delay right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have asked the appeals court for a July hearing in
the attorney-client case, a request that the appeals court is
likely to grant in light of the Supreme Court's unusual statement
that it expected the cases to move forward ``expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguments in the Secret Service privilege case are likely to be
scheduled quickly as well. In a brief filed with the Supreme Court
on Thursday morning, the Solicitor General's office, representing
the Secret Service, said it would not oppose accelerated review,
either in the court of appeals or directly in the Supreme Court.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While requests for immediate Supreme Court review of U.S.
district court decisions are not particularly rare, such requests
are rarely granted. So Starr faced a heavy burden in trying to
persuade the justices that the current disputes posed crises on the
order of Watergate or the nationwide steel strike in 1952, two of
the handful of occasions on which the justices have granted a
request for ``certiorari before judgment,'' to use the court's
terminology.
</P>
<P>
   Starr tried to make his case by drawing repeated analogies to
United States vs. Nixon, the 1974 ruling in which the court
rejected President Richard M. Nixon's claim of executive privilege
and ordered incriminating White House tapes turned over to the
Watergate special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   That effort was blunted by the White House decision on Monday to
drop from the case an executive privilege claim that Judge Johnson
had rejected at the same time she rejected the claim of
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the White House had claimed executive privilege to
shield both Lindsey and Sidney Blumenthal, a senior aide, from
having to testify. Since Blumenthal is not a lawyer, the remaining
claim of attorney-client privilege did not apply to him, and he
appeared before Starr's grand jury Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who advises the president and first lady on
communications strategy, spent most of the afternoon before the
grand jury. His lawyer, William McDaniel Jr., said afterward that
prosecutors spent much of the session questioning Blumenthal about
the White House view of Starr and other members of the independent
counsel's office, rather than about his conversations with Clinton
on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation has been more about Mr. Starr than anything
else,'' McDaniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal was told that he would be called again to continue
his testimony. Until then, his lawyers said, Blumenthal would have
no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury also heard from Nathan Landow, a Democratic
fund-raiser and Maryland real estate developer. The independent
counsel's office has been examining whether Landow took any
improper steps to discourage Kathleen Willey, a former White House
aide, from being truthful in a deposition she gave in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Ms. Willey said Clinton made a sexual overture
to her in an Oval Office encounter in 1993; Clinton has said that
he may have given her a comforting hug and a kiss on the forehead
but that he had no sexual intent. Landow has acknowledged having
conversations with Ms. Willey, but has repeatedly denied making any
effort to influence her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Ms. Lewinsky spent several hours with her new
Washington lawyers, Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein. While lawyers
involved in the inquiry expect that the introduction of the new
legal teams means that there will be a renewed round of settlement
talks, nothing has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   In his petitions urging immediate Supreme Court review, Starr
described both cases as raising issues in urgent need of resolution
by the country's highest court and said that further litigation
would be ``inimical to the nation's well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, only this court has the moral authority and
public credibility to issue a final ruling'' on the Secret Service
case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the justices denied the petitions ``without prejudice,''
meaning that further appeals are not foreclosed, there is no
guarantee that the court will ever take up the cases.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no safe prediction of the fate of the cases in the
court of appeals. The 11-member court is known for sharp
ideological divisions, but ideology does not necessarily have much
to do with how a judge views such technical matters as the rules of
evidence at issue in both these cases.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Supreme Court next Monday will hear an appeal
on whether the attorney-client privilege automatically survives the
death of the client _ in this case, the late Vincent Foster, the
deputy White House counsel who committed suicide in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been seeking notes that Foster's lawyer took nine days
before the suicide. Last year, the appeals court rejected the claim
of absolute privilege by a 2-1 majority that was composed of one of
the court's most conservative members, Judge Stephen Williams, and
its long-time liberal stalwart, Judge Patricia Wald. &QL;

DOES DEATH END THE BOND OF SECRECY BETWEEN LAWYER AND CLIENT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: RESENDING to note Sunday release date in slug.)  
 (For release Sunday, June 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Does the attorney-client privilege of
confidentiality die with the client?
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will take up that question Monday as it hears
arguments from lawyers for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and
attorneys representing the lawyer of the late Vincent Foster Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a boyhood friend of President Clinton and a Little Rock
law partner of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, came to
Washington in 1993 to join the new administration as deputy White
House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of his arrival, Foster was embroiled in a
controversy surrounding the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics charged that Mrs. Clinton had ordered the
firings of seven employees of the travel office in May 1993 in
order to make room for friends of the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she had no role in the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   In personal notes written at the time, Foster worried that
administration officials would face a congressional inquiry and
possibly a criminal probe of the firings. He expressed concern that
Mrs. Clinton's role would be misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, Foster consulted his lawyer, James Hamilton, about
what he should do. During their two-hour meeting Hamilton took
three pages of notes.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days later, worried about the travel office controversy,
charges about Whitewater land deals and the hostile political
atmosphere in Washington, Foster drove to Fort Marcy Park in nearby
Virginia and shot himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Starr, investigating allegations that Mrs.
Clinton lied about her role in the travel office firings,
subpoenaed Hamilton's notes.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Washington rejected the subpoena, but in
August 1997 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
ruled in a 2-to-1 decision that after a client's death, the
attorney-client privilege was no longer automatic in criminal
cases. The panel said that in some cases, such as Starr's, a
prosecutor's search for truth outweighed a dead client's interest
in confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case after Hamilton argued
that the attorney-client privilege lives on even though the client
is dead.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this bitter legal dispute could affect how
thousands of Americans consult with lawyers in their final years.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief to the Supreme Court, Starr said Hamilton's notes
were ``highly relevant'' to his office's investigation of whether
Mrs. Clinton or presidential aides lied about the her role in the
travel office firings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no dispute that Mr. Foster would have been an
important witness in this office's investigation of whether
particular individuals made false statements or committed other
federal crimes during investigations of the travel office
firings,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   Some constitutional law experts said that if Starr prevails, the
attorney-client privilege will be eroded, making people reluctant
to tell their lawyers the truth.
</P>
<P>
   David Luban, a law professor at Georgetown University here,
said, ``The whole reason we have an attorney-client privilege is to
encourage clients to be truthful, because they believe what they
say will be kept private.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the court says that privilege ends after death, there will
be many people, particularly the elderly and sick, who will not
feel safe being totally honest with their lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rice, an expert on attorney-client privilege at American
University in Washington, said the appeals court's decision assumes
that people no longer care about their reputation after they die.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, why do prominent people often request that
their personal papers and diaries not be released until 10n or 20
years after their death?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In his Supreme Court appeal, Hamilton argued that the appeals
court's decision ``defeats the fundamental purpose of the
privilege, which is to encourage full and frank communication
between attorneys and clients.'' His brief added that without the
assurance that their conversations would remain private, Foster
``would not have confided in Mr. Hamilton and the notes at issue
would not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Q. Barrett, a former Iran-Contra prosecutor who now
teaches law at St. John's University in New York, said the
interests of law enforcement cannot be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extraordinary circumstances where the interest of
law enforcement carries more weight and can override the
attorney-client privilege without destroying the reasons why we
have the privilege in the first place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury allegations against the first lady were sparked in
1996 by the discovery of a memo suggesting that former White House
official David Watkins had lied about Mrs. Clinton's role in the
firing.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins originally told the General Accounting Office, a key
investigative arm of Congress, that Mrs. Clinton played no role in
the dismissals. But in a memo to then-White House Chief of Staff
Thomas F. McLarty, Watkins wrote that the travel staff had been
sacked after ``pressure for action from the First Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court was originally scheduled to hear the case this
fall, with a decision expected at the earliest in December. But in
April, Starr convinced the justices that waiting until the end of
the year would unduly delay his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to rule on the case by early July.

   VENICE, Italy _ The Grand Princess _ twice the size of the
Titanic _ sailed into port on Sunday night and seemed to eclipse
even the cupola of St. Mark's Cathedral. As passengers spilled out
to inspect the canals of Venice, most of Venice stared, awestruck,
at the world's largest cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the newest and the biggest,'' Marguerite Salomone of
Monterey, Calif., said, explaining why she and her husband,
Alfonso, had signed up a year ahead for a 12-day Mediterranean
cruise on an untested ship carrying 2,600 passengers. ``Anything
new is always better.'' She paused. Then, looking at the
quarter-mile walk to the elevator, she added, ``I'm not sure bigger
is better, though.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is exactly what Princess Cruises' parent company, the
Peninsular &AMP; Oriental Steam Navigation Co. of Britain, is betting
on.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;O has ordered two sister ships for the Grand Princess, which
will also be able to carry 109,000 gross tons, from the Italian
shipbuilding company Fincantieri. One of P&AMP;O's chief rivals, Royal
Caribbean, plans to launch two even larger ships next year that
will each carry 136,000 tons and accommodate 3,100 passengers.
Until the launching of the Grand Princess, the biggest cruise ship
ever built had a carrying capacity of 101,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has also ordered two huge cruise ships from Fincantieri,
whose shipyards are so busy that deliveries were delayed this
March, forcing Disney to cancel all its cruises for four months and
offer refunds to about 90,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise industry, boosted first by the hit television show
``The Love Boat'' and more recently by the movie ``Titanic,'' has
calculated that bigger ships provide economies of scale. And it
thinks it can draw in more passengers with ever more varied and
baroque forms of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Princess, which cost $450 million and is 50 feet
taller than the Statue of Liberty, has three grand dining rooms,
seven casual restaurants and cafes and 12 bars.
</P>
<P>
   It has three theaters offering a dizzying mix of cabaret and Las
Vegas-style variety shows and comedy acts (Alan King and Red
Buttons were the headliners for the maiden trip), a discotheque
with a glass skywalk, a casino, four swimming pools, miniature golf
and a game room with virtual-reality rides, including deep-sea
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a kind of virtual-reality medical unit, with
satellite hookups that allow ships' doctors to consult specialists
at Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. There is also a wedding
chapel, which also offers a ``vows renewal'' service. There are no
provisions for burials at sea, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Princess is less a ship than a floating amusement
park; the strongest hint that it is a descendant of the old stately
ocean liners are the rarely used shuffleboard sets on a few of its
18 decks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the passengers are repeat customers lured by novel
amenities, not by Leonardo Di Caprio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients signed up long before the movie came out, and have
been on Princess cruises before,'' Stephanie Woods, 28, an
assistant cruise director, said. ``But you can tell they have seen
the movie: they pay more attention during the safety drills.'' (The
Grand Princess, unlike the Titanic, has enough lifeboats to
accommodate passengers and crew.)
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled maiden voyage of the Grand Princess, leaving from
Southampton, England, on May 14, was canceled at the last minute
when P&AMP;O decided some of the fixtures and fittings were not up to
standard, and offered refunds to passengers who paid between $4,000
to $10,000 each. Company directors were haunted by the public
relations disaster that afflicted Cunard when the QE2 began its
first cruise of the 1994 season before refitting work was
completed. QE2 passengers complained of exploding toilets and brown
water.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers who left Istanbul on May 26 on the Grand Princess,
and made stops in Turkey, Greece and Italy (the cruise ends in
Barcelona on June 6), reported some glitches, like dripping
air-conditioners and malfunctioning laundromats, but there were few
deep-felt complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, passengers acted like old hands lending their experience
to a virgin ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food isn't quite up to par yet,'' Bernice Mehrbrodt, 67,
of Santa Barbara, Calif., confided as she inspected the menu in the
500-seat Leonardo da Vinci restaurant, decorated with frescos of
Madonnas. ``But it's the first time out, and there are always a few
kinks. We're having a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband paid $8,500 for their cruise package,
including meals and shows. Passengers pay extra for their alcohol,
onshore excursions and such niceties as massages and spa
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Four cruise veterans who were admiring the roofs of Venice from
a glassed-in nook of the discotheque compared notes on past and
present voyages.
</P>
<P>
   John Clark of Toronto sailed on the German liner the Bremen in
1932 and shared a dining-room table with the King of Saudi Arabia
aboard the Spanish liner Queen Anna Maria in 1966. He expressed
some scorn for the more middle-class cruises prevalent today. ``I
am 92,'' he explained grumpily. ``The only trip that will take me
is a cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   His companions were more impressed by the world's biggest cruise
ship, but also expressed some wistfulness of scale. ``I'm glad we
came,'' said Jacqueline Smith, 74, of Fort Worth, Texas. ``I'm
having the best time I've ever had. But secretly, I think I like
the smaller ships better.''

ALCOHOL, DRUG ABUSE A PROBLEM FOR MILLIONS OF OLDER WOMEN, REPORT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Fla., Minn.)  (th) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When her husband died, leaving her a widow at the age of 77, Dr.
Genevieve May started drinking to assuage her grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't get up in the morning,'' she said. ``I realized I
was using alcohol to raise my spirits. It raises your spirits for a
little while, and then you become depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   At 83, Dr. May, a California psychiatrist, checked into the
Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., to be treated for
alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Now 88 and sober for five years, Dr. May understands how a
vulnerable older woman can easily succumb to addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``With people dying around you, you feel more lonely and
isolated,'' she said. ``One tolerates alcohol less as one ages, and
then you have this extra stress of loss.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1.8 million American women 60 years and older abuse
alcohol, and 2.8 million women abuse psychoactive or mood-altering
prescription drugs, says a report released Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia University in New York City, calls the levels of
such abuse a hidden epidemic among the country's 25.6 million women
60 years and older.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the report, which draws on national surveys and interviews
with 400 doctors, said that of 1.8 million older women with alcohol
problems, barely 11,000 are currently in treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not give comparable statistics for older men. But
other studies have found alcohol abuse somewhat more common among
men than women, whose heavy drinking is more likely to go unnoticed
because they tend to do it alone. Older women also have more access
to prescription drugs and are more likely than men to overuse them
or combine them with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, titled ``Under The Rug: Substance Abuse
and the Mature Woman,'' research suggests that older women can
recover more successfully than younger ones who abuse drug or
alcohol. But most older women are also ashamed to seek treatment,
their children are hesitant to confront them and doctors sometimes
mistake their addiction for other ailments like Alzheimer's disease
or depression, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Ford, the former first lady who went public with her own
problems with alcohol and painkillers after leaving the White House
over two decades ago, said doctors tended to pass over such
conditions ``and move on to more medical stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they find it hard to spend the time on it,'' Mrs. Ford
said in a telephone interview from Washington. ``It can be rather
time-consuming with a patient unless they know how to detect it.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, part of
the Department of Health and Human Services, cited age
discrimination as another factor. The report said: ``There is an
unspoken but pervasive assumption that it's not worth treating
older adults for substance-use disorders. Behavior considered a
problem in younger adults does not inspire the same urgency for
care among older adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Egan, director of services for older adults at the
nonprofit Hanley Hazelden Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., put it
this way: ``We don't tend to serve our older adults in this country
_ we put them out to pasture. We say, `Mom's earned the right to
sit home and get zonked at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.'''
</P>
<P>
   The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse found that
women who saw a doctor were 37 percent likelier than men to get a
prescription for a tranquilizer and 33 percent likelier to get a
prescription for an antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   The center said that women 60 years or older took an average of
five prescription drugs at the same time and that 1 in 4 older
women, or 6.4 million Americans, used at least one psychoactive
prescription drug. The effects of such drugs are intensified by
alcohol.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The abuse embraces a pharmacopeia of tranquilizers, sedatives,
antidepressants and pain-relievers. Mrs. Egan, of the West Palm
Beach center, points out that so many drugs can leave older
patients lethargic, disoriented and addicted. But, she said,
``their most common statement is, `But the doctor prescribed it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Hassett, 57 and a trustee for the Hazelden Foundation, a
national nonprofit network of treatment and prevention centers,
said she saw women of her generation struggle with feelings of
shame about admitting their addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a different structure growing up than young people
today, so it's very difficult for older people,'' explained Mrs.
Hassett, a former public relations executive from New York who said
she had been sober for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many older women also feel uncomfortable in programs that deal
with drugs like heroin or crack cocaine. The Columbia center's
report said that only 3.8 percent of the older women surveyed had
tried an illegal drug and that none used them now.
</P>
<P>
   Mary, a 74-year-old Minnesotan who did not want to be identified
by her full name, said she began drinking after her husband died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I saw the light, I didn't think it was a problem,'' she
said. ``After realizing what I'd done to myself and my family, I
realized it was a very big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Her children persuaded her to enter treatment, where group
therapy sessions were dominated by younger drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my stupidity, I would say, `What is crack?''' Mary said.
``I had difficulty relating to the younger people, not that they
didn't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   She relapsed four times until finding the Hazelden program for
older adults, where, she said, ``We could relate to one another's
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary, who said she had been abstinent for 20 months, credited
her three children for their support: ``I said to them, `Thank
goodness you didn't give up on your mom.' They could have said, `To
heck with her.''' &QL;

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

   &UR; FOR ECONOMISTS, THE VALUE OF PRESERVATION BEYOND PRICE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER PASSELL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

 &UR; By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

</P>
<P>
   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

<P>
   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is difficult to know for sure, but there may be more kinds of
creatures living on Earth now than ever before in the planet's
4.6-billion-year history. Or at least there were that many before
human beings appeared very late in the game and began changing the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   At first, life consisted of microscopic, single-cell balls, rods
and filaments. For perhaps 3 billion years, these microbes were all
the life there was on this wet, stark and rocky world.
</P>
<P>
   Not until about 600 million years ago, after the Earth emerged
from its deepest ice age ever, did bigger species evolve. Then
life's variety exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of biological variety has been on an upward curve
since then. From sequoias and nematodes to fungi and elephants,
millions of species populate the world.
</P>
<P>
   The curve has not been a smooth one. At least five times in the
last 600 million years, planetwide environmental cataclysms, like
drastic climatic change and colliding asteroids, have wiped out
whole families of organisms. Such events have threatened to erase
life, but succeeded only in partly clearing the stage for new and
different families.
</P>
<P>
   Between extinction spasms, in the background hum of evolution,
single species winked out here and there to be replaced by new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this continuous turnover, scientists believe, more
than 95 percent of all species that have ever existed are extinct
today.
</P>
<P>
   Now one species, Homo sapiens, has become so powerful an
influence on the rest of the biosphere that many experts fear it is
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a sixth major extinction.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is happening simply because people are acting
naturally _ harvesting wild species to burn, eat or sell;
expropriating and destroying wild habitat to make way for human
works like farms, cities and suburbs; moving plants and animals
around the globe in a mix-and-match game in which a relatively few,
superadaptable plant and animal species are crowding out a larger
number of less hardy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the numbers is magnified greatly by technology's
power to shape the landscape and exploit the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   This combination has been especially worrisome for the rain
forests, where most of the world's species are found and
large-scale clearing is under way.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many species live on Earth. About 1.4
million have been described and named, but biologists believe there
are at least 10 times that many.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can put precise numbers on the rate of present-day
extinction, although several scientists have made rough stabs.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively conservative estimate says that for some species
found only in one locality, the rate may be 100 to 1,000 times the
normal ``background'' rate between mass extinctions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists who study the situation doubt that humans are
driving other creatures toward extinction at a growing rate.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever extent they are doing so, people are reducing the
variety of life on Earth _ what conservation biologists now call
biological diversity, or just biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Biodiversity is not merely a matter of different kinds of
species. It applies to many layers of nature on different scales.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is expressed by the number of genetic
variations within a species, the raw material of evolution; destroy
the wrong genes, and the species might not be able to adapt and
survive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, biodiversity is expressed in the bewildering
variety of types of ecosystems, the tightly interwoven communities
of plants, animals and microbes that are nature's working units.
</P>
<P>
   Forests, wetlands and grasslands are examples of one level of
ecosystem variety, and each comprises numerous interconnected
subunits, right down to the microscopic. It is these interconnected
communities that constitute the fabric of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree human activity is narrowing the variety of
life, scientists say, it is doing so on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter? Conservationists and biologists offer a
number of answers. On the practical level, wild species provide the
raw material for medicine and food. Who knows what undiscovered
plant might provide a cure for our era's killer diseases?
</P>
<P>
   Acting together, wild species support the human economy by
providing an array of services like water purification, soil
formation, pollination, flood control and, in our age, outdoor
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   On a more fundamental level, they support human life: Without
humans, the biosphere would not miss a beat. But without insects
and microbes, humans would disappear quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say natural systems are intrinsic to psychological
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many conservationists assert a moral imperative: It is
simply wrong to destroy large slices of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Moral arguments aside, are all species equally valuable?
Scientists believe that in many ecosystems, a few keystone species
hold everything together, and that if they are removed, the system
will collapse and all the other species in it will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in most instances, no one is sure which are
the crucial species.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, scientists have found, the greater the variety of
plant species in an ecosystem, the more productive it is over all.
</P>
<P>
   So, conservationists argue, it is necessary to save as many
species as possible. They have their work cut out for them, since
the catalogue of imperilment is long.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the World Conservation Union, in Gland, Switzerland,
added nearly 34,000 plant species _ one of every eight known plant
species in the world, and nearly one of three in the United States
_ to its growing ``red list'' of imperiled organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In possibly an even more important gauge of overall biological
vitality, an earlier assessment, by United States Federal
Government scientists, found that vast stretches of the natural
landscape, amounting to at least half the area of the contiguous 48
states, had declined to the point of endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   This report, the first ever done on the state of health of the
nation's individual ecosystems, found that 30 of them, some of
which dominated vast regions before the arrival of Europeans, have
been destroyed or degraded by 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the trackless ocean is immune. Overfishing has pushed
some marine species _ the cod and the blue-fin tuna, for example _
to the brink of commercial extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs in some parts of the world are under severe assault;
in parts of Asia, fishermen squirt sodium cyanide into the water to
stun fish, in doses strong enough to kill the corals that maintain
the reef ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The abundant evidence for the threat to biodiversity should not
be overinterpreted. The recent red-listing of plants includes many
simply because they are rare. While many may be vulnerable, humans
do not threaten them just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The red list of plants can be read another way, too: While one
in eight plants was judged imperiled, almost 90 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   On the action front, there are bright spots. Over the last
century, a worldwide conservation movement has struggled to stem
the human assault on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Endangered Species Act is regarded as the
strongest protection law in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, more than 160 countries, not including
the United States, have ratified a treaty obligating governments to
protect plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
   But victories are scattered or overturned. Recently, a federal
court, for instance, invalidated the Yellowstone wolf restoration
project, and a legal battle is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, habitat continues to disappear at an
``unprecedented'' rate, according to the United Nations. The
magnitude of the sixth extinction, if that is what is occurring,
will become clear in time.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century may reveal whether the clever brain bequeathed
to Homo sapiens by the evolution of biological diversity can be
used to save diversity as well as destroy it.

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is difficult to know for sure, but there may be more kinds of
creatures living on Earth now than ever before in the planet's
4.6-billion-year history. Or at least there were that many before
human beings appeared very late in the game and began changing the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   At first, life consisted of microscopic, single-cell balls, rods
and filaments. For perhaps 3 billion years, these microbes were all
the life there was on this wet, stark and rocky world.
</P>
<P>
   Not until about 600 million years ago, after the Earth emerged
from its deepest ice age ever, did bigger species evolve. Then
life's variety exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of biological variety has been on an upward curve
since then. From sequoias and nematodes to fungi and elephants,
millions of species populate the world.
</P>
<P>
   The curve has not been a smooth one. At least five times in the
last 600 million years, planetwide environmental cataclysms, like
drastic climatic change and colliding asteroids, have wiped out
whole families of organisms. Such events have threatened to erase
life, but succeeded only in partly clearing the stage for new and
different families.
</P>
<P>
   Between extinction spasms, in the background hum of evolution,
single species winked out here and there to be replaced by new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this continuous turnover, scientists believe, more
than 95 percent of all species that have ever existed are extinct
today.
</P>
<P>
   Now one species, Homo sapiens, has become so powerful an
influence on the rest of the biosphere that many experts fear it is
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a sixth major extinction.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is happening simply because people are acting
naturally _ harvesting wild species to burn, eat or sell;
expropriating and destroying wild habitat to make way for human
works like farms, cities and suburbs; moving plants and animals
around the globe in a mix-and-match game in which a relatively few,
superadaptable plant and animal species are crowding out a larger
number of less hardy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the numbers is magnified greatly by technology's
power to shape the landscape and exploit the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   This combination has been especially worrisome for the rain
forests, where most of the world's species are found and
large-scale clearing is under way.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many species live on Earth. About 1.4
million have been described and named, but biologists believe there
are at least 10 times that many.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can put precise numbers on the rate of present-day
extinction, although several scientists have made rough stabs.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively conservative estimate says that for some species
found only in one locality, the rate may be 100 to 1,000 times the
normal ``background'' rate between mass extinctions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists who study the situation doubt that humans are
driving other creatures toward extinction at a growing rate.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever extent they are doing so, people are reducing the
variety of life on Earth _ what conservation biologists now call
biological diversity, or just biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Biodiversity is not merely a matter of different kinds of
species. It applies to many layers of nature on different scales.
</P>

 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been more than 20 years since advocates of
saving the snail darter, a minnow-sized fish believed to be on the
brink of oblivion, blocked the mighty Tennessee Valley Authority
from building the $137 million Tellico Dam.
</P>
<P>
   That case went to the Supreme Court, which sided with the fish,
and only when Congress intervened did the dam go forward.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Weyerhauser Corp. is negotiating a voluntary
plan to protect dozens of species on hundreds of thousands of acres
of rich forest habitat in Oregon over several decades, during which
development of the land will be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   These cases are strikingly different manifestations of the
Endangered Species Act, a law evolving so rapidly that it almost
resembles a new species itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the law was mostly used to block development
and preserve the habitat of a species close to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious and
subtler, as the government and landowners design management plans
to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of private
land, but at the same time not block development.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fundamental change in how the law should work. It also
reflects the realization that the Endangered Species Act's true aim
is to protect healthy and biologically diverse habitats, and not
just one imperiled species after another.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be done without the involvement of private
landowners. So Congress and the Clinton administration are trying
to give developers a bigger role in protecting the nation's
biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Endangered Species Act was under attack
by business groups, the Clinton administration began to
aggressively encourage the use of ``habitat conservation plans,''
or HCPs, on private lands, which are estimated to provide habitat
to 80 percent of all protected species.
</P>
<P>
   HCPs are binding, voluntary agreements in which a landowner
adopts conservation measures, sometimes going beyond what the law
strictly requires, in exchange for permission to develop some
property even if endangered wildlife and habitat are hurt in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A landowner might agree to leave some forest untouched to
protect wetlands from sediment and stream banks from erosion and to
preserve natural corridors for animals. Otherwise, homes can be
built, sewers trenched and driveways paved.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat conservation plans were authorized by Congress in 1982.
But before 1994, there were only about 20 such active arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, by the end of last year there were more than 200;
hundreds of more are coming. And their size is increasing from
fewer than 1,000 acres at the outset to tens or even hundreds of
thousands of acres in recent cases.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, advocates said, would reassure property owners
and provide incentives to protect the diversity of life on their
land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration credits the new arrangements for
helping to ensure the recovery of hundreds of species. But it is an
approach that creates suspicion and even hostility among some
environmentalists and conservation biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under many HCPs, development is permitted and habitat is
destroyed despite great uncertainty about whether the landowners
have provided enough mitigation to sustain species in the long
run,'' said the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife in a
report written by Laura Hood, a biologist, and published in
February. Hood examined 24 such plans.
</P>
<P>
   The critics' fire is particularly directed at a part of the plan
that has proved crucial to winning acceptance by property owners:
the guarantee of ``no surprises'' to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises clause tells the landowner whose plan includes
permission to harm some of the species or habitat during
development _ a so-called incidental take permit _ that the
government will place no additional restrictions on how the land is
used during the plan's life, usually several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The promise holds even if unforeseen circumstances arise, which
may demand further steps to preserve species.
</P>
<P>
   If the landowner agrees and the federal government picks up the
costs, additional conservation measures can be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landowners with private or commercial land have a legitimate
concern,'' said Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of Interior. ``They
want some assurance that once they agree to be a party to an HCP
and to mitigate the effects of their activities on listed species,
we won't come back later for a second bite from the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A deal is a deal,'' Babbitt added.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem, some skeptical scientists say, is that nature
is full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great uncertainty in natural systems, but HCPs and
no-surprises agreements act as though that is not the case,'' said
Dr. Gary K. Meffe, a professor of biology at the University of
Florida and the editor of the journal Conservation Biology.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises policy is at the heart of a bill offered by the
Republican Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Dirk A.
Kempthorne of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supports the bill, as do many Senate
Democrats. But so far, sponsors have been unable to bring it to the
Senate floor, partly over disputes about how to pay the
government's costs in the future, when surprises arise and
no-surprises clauses trigger federal payments to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kempthorne's proposal, supported by Senator Pete V.
Domenici of Arizona, the budget committee chairman, to pay these
costs by selling big tracts of publicly owned land, caused an
immediate uproar among conservation advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Most major environmental groups oppose the Chafee-Kempthorne
bill and instead favor a proposal written by Representative George
Miller, a California Democrat, for consideration by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says his bill would better ensure that endangered species
can actually begin to recover by setting aside critical habitat for
them and by restricting the use of the no-surprises guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's bill is very unlikely to win approval this year,
and the prospects for rewriting the law before Congress adjourns
for the November elections appear dim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, conservation groups are fighting some proposed HCPs
by enlisting scientists to challenge the no-surprises provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society in Portland, Ore., for example, assembled
scientists to review Weyerhauser's proposed HCP for tracts of its
Oregon property.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhauser and federal agencies are negotiating a complex plan
for species conservation and ecosystem management on approximately
400,000 acres of land in the Willamette Valley, foothills of the
central Cascade mountains and the Oregon coast ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would be implemented for 40 years with up to four
additional 10-year extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cover not only northern spotted owls (there are
about 160 owl sites on the land) but many other species, including
marbled murrelets, Umpqua River cutthroat trout, American peregrine
falcons, Columbian white-tailed deer, bald eagles, Aleutian Canada
geese and Oregon chubs.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for incidental take permits, which allows
Weyerhauser to damage the habitat of some of these species during
logging operations, the company agrees to accept detailed
prescriptions on how to manage the logging.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 40 percent of the land at a time will be reduced to
seedlings, and less than 60 percent at a time to seedlings and
saplings combined.
</P>
<P>
   The company will keep buffers around streams and leave behind
snags, large trees and big logs, all imperative to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Wininger, a timber manager at Weyerhauser, said that
the plan includes flexibility to change practices along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the water in streams is not within prescribed
temperature ranges, the company must change the amount of forest
left to shade the streams. But that is not enough to satisfy some
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel has several concerns with freezing a management
program in place for the 40- to 80-year term of the HCP,'' the
Audubon scientists' report said. ``The next 40 years of scientific
research will certainly produce new data and insights. One need
only consider the change in science's understanding of spotted owls
and other species affected by the proposed HCP in the last 40
years.''

   WASHINGTON _ It has been more than 20 years since advocates of
saving the snail darter, a minnow-sized fish believed to be on the
brink of oblivion, blocked the mighty Tennessee Valley Authority
from building the $137 million Tellico Dam.
</P>
<P>
   That case went to the Supreme Court, which sided with the fish,
and only when Congress intervened did the dam go forward.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Weyerhauser Corp. is negotiating a voluntary
plan to protect dozens of species on hundreds of thousands of acres
of rich forest habitat in Oregon over several decades, during which
development of the land will be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   These cases are strikingly different manifestations of the
Endangered Species Act, a law evolving so rapidly that it almost
resembles a new species itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the law was mostly used to block development
and preserve the habitat of a species close to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious and
subtler, as the government and landowners design management plans
to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of private
land, but at the same time not block development.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fundamental change in how the law should work. It also
reflects the realization that the Endangered Species Act's true aim
is to protect healthy and biologically diverse habitats, and not
just one imperiled species after another.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be done without the involvement of private
landowners. So Congress and the Clinton administration are trying
to give developers a bigger role in protecting the nation's
biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Endangered Species Act was under attack
by business groups, the Clinton administration began to
aggressively encourage the use of ``habitat conservation plans,''
or HCPs, on private lands, which are estimated to provide habitat
to 80 percent of all protected species.
</P>
<P>
   HCPs are binding, voluntary agreements in which a landowner
adopts conservation measures, sometimes going beyond what the law
strictly requires, in exchange for permission to develop some
property even if endangered wildlife and habitat are hurt in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A landowner might agree to leave some forest untouched to
protect wetlands from sediment and stream banks from erosion and to
preserve natural corridors for animals. Otherwise, homes can be
built, sewers trenched and driveways paved.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat conservation plans were authorized by Congress in 1982.
But before 1994, there were only about 20 such active arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, by the end of last year there were more than 200;
hundreds of more are coming. And their size is increasing from
fewer than 1,000 acres at the outset to tens or even hundreds of
thousands of acres in recent cases.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, advocates said, would reassure property owners
and provide incentives to protect the diversity of life on their
land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration credits the new arrangements for
helping to ensure the recovery of hundreds of species. But it is an
approach that creates suspicion and even hostility among some
environmentalists and conservation biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under many HCPs, development is permitted and habitat is
destroyed despite great uncertainty about whether the landowners
have provided enough mitigation to sustain species in the long
run,'' said the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife in a
report written by Laura Hood, a biologist, and published in
February. Hood examined 24 such plans.
</P>
<P>
   The critics' fire is particularly directed at a part of the plan
that has proved crucial to winning acceptance by property owners:
the guarantee of ``no surprises'' to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises clause tells the landowner whose plan includes
permission to harm some of the species or habitat during
development _ a so-called incidental take permit _ that the
government will place no additional restrictions on how the land is
used during the plan's life, usually several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The promise holds even if unforeseen circumstances arise, which
may demand further steps to preserve species.
</P>
<P>
   If the landowner agrees and the federal government picks up the
costs, additional conservation measures can be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landowners with private or commercial land have a legitimate
concern,'' said Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of Interior. ``They
want some assurance that once they agree to be a party to an HCP
and to mitigate the effects of their activities on listed species,
we won't come back later for a second bite from the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A deal is a deal,'' Babbitt added.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem, some skeptical scientists say, is that nature
is full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great uncertainty in natural systems, but HCPs and
no-surprises agreements act as though that is not the case,'' said
Dr. Gary K. Meffe, a professor of biology at the University of
Florida and the editor of the journal Conservation Biology.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises policy is at the heart of a bill offered by the
Republican Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Dirk A.
Kempthorne of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supports the bill, as do many Senate
Democrats. But so far, sponsors have been unable to bring it to the
Senate floor, partly over disputes about how to pay the
government's costs in the future, when surprises arise and
no-surprises clauses trigger federal payments to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kempthorne's proposal, supported by Senator Pete V.
Domenici of Arizona, the budget committee chairman, to pay these
costs by selling big tracts of publicly owned land, caused an
immediate uproar among conservation advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Most major environmental groups oppose the Chafee-Kempthorne
bill and instead favor a proposal written by Representative George
Miller, a California Democrat, for consideration by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says his bill would better ensure that endangered species
can actually begin to recover by setting aside critical habitat for
them and by restricting the use of the no-surprises guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's bill is very unlikely to win approval this year,
and the prospects for rewriting the law before Congress adjourns
for the November elections appear dim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, conservation groups are fighting some proposed HCPs
by enlisting scientists to challenge the no-surprises provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society in Portland, Ore., for example, assembled
scientists to review Weyerhauser's proposed HCP for tracts of its
Oregon property.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhauser and federal agencies are negotiating a complex plan
for species conservation and ecosystem management on approximately
400,000 acres of land in the Willamette Valley, foothills of the
central Cascade mountains and the Oregon coast ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would be implemented for 40 years with up to four
additional 10-year extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cover not only northern spotted owls (there are
about 160 owl sites on the land) but many other species, including
marbled murrelets, Umpqua River cutthroat trout, American peregrine
falcons, Columbian white-tailed deer, bald eagles, Aleutian Canada
geese and Oregon chubs.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for incidental take permits, which allows
Weyerhauser to damage the habitat of some of these species during
logging operations, the company agrees to accept detailed
prescriptions on how to manage the logging.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 40 percent of the land at a time will be reduced to
seedlings, and less than 60 percent at a time to seedlings and
saplings combined.
</P>
<P>
   The company will keep buffers around streams and leave behind
snags, large trees and big logs, all imperative to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Wininger, a timber manager at Weyerhauser, said that
the plan includes flexibility to change practices along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the water in streams is not within prescribed
temperature ranges, the company must change the amount of forest
left to shade the streams. But that is not enough to satisfy some
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel has several concerns with freezing a management
program in place for the 40- to 80-year term of the HCP,'' the
Audubon scientists' report said. ``The next 40 years of scientific
research will certainly produce new data and insights. One need
only consider the change in science's understanding of spotted owls
and other species affected by the proposed HCP in the last 40
years.''

   THOMPSONVILLE, Mich. _ I Finally understood why Adam was so
enticed by Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through
our orchard near the northern coast of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 apple trees _ some gnarled and thick at the trunk
like an old ash, others mere saplings _ stood scattered on a sandy
ridge between the maple forest and a dun-colored meadow.
</P>
<P>
   It was September 1991, weeks before the fruit fully matured.
Still, the orchard's scent was sweet and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A dry summer had produced unblemished apples that hung from the
limbs in a wondrous display of variety and color. Big, red round
apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree, and they
had a light, candy taste.
</P>
<P>
   There were large green apples, a kind that had probably been
stored during the winter in straw-lined pits to be eaten in spring.
</P>
<P>
   And there were smaller green apples with brown patches that
might have originated from the old Roxbury Russet varieties popular
in northwestern Michigan around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist who covered farming and wrote about modern
agriculture's shrinking genetic resources, I was struck by the
number of varieties, none of which could be found at the markets in
the towns of Benzonia or Frankfort nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '70s, plant breeders have worried that the
abundance of the world's food supply is balanced on a narrowing
supply of wild and domestic plant genes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a handful of varieties bred for peak production
make up the bulk of the world's rice harvest. Meanwhile,
irreplaceable genetic traits that enabled old varieties of rice to
grow in harsh conditions have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is playing out for wheat, corn, barley,
tomatoes and most other major food plants. Homogenization in the
market is one result. Hunger can be another. The Irish potato
famine was caused by a plant disease that raced through crops
containing no genetic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As the new owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in
Manistee County, Mich., my wife and I wanted to know more about the
place we had just bought and who had preceded us.
</P>
<P>
   Although historical records are incomplete, sometime during the
1880s, Hiram Hier moved to the township and built a plain two-story
home for his wife and two children on a rise above Nurnberger Road.
</P>
<P>
   Like other homesteaders, he planted different varieties of apple
trees _ in his case, three neat rows down the south-facing slope of
the widest ridge on his land.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 19th century, American farmers were encouraged
to spread seeds and see what came up. Hier almost surely followed
the protocol, as did his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Long growing seasons moderated by Lake Michigan, well-drained
soils and high ridges, which kept untimely frosts at bay, had
already distinguished Michigan's west side as one of the nation's
prime fruit-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 20th century, the fruit belt of northwest and
western Michigan was producing more than 50 commercial varieties of
apples, authorities say. Among the old favorites, some of them
recognizable in my orchard, are Snow apples, which are pure white
to the bite; the Wolf River, a big, round baking apple; Maiden's
Blush, an early ripening yellow apple with a bewitching dark-pink
patch on the side that receives the most sunlight; and Golden
Russet, with skin the color of brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, apple varieties were so diverse, it was just
like human beings,'' said John Kilcherman, a farmer in Northport,
Mich., who cultivates 240 heirloom varieties for his thriving
mail-order business. ``There were as many apples as there were
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I walked our land and tried to count the number
of varieties, concluding there were at least 14.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a simple task. The old trees that Hier had planted
were mostly dead, and a forest of maple and ash had grown up around
them. Hier's son, Lee, was the last to farm the place, and when he
died in the 1960s, deer began spreading the seeds. Young
fruit-bearing trees are now growing throughout the property.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, I was certain there were more varieties
available than in almost any commercial supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Even along the Lake Michigan coast, the center of a $100 million
apple-growing industry, the nation's fourth largest, the markets
offer paltry pickings. Red Delicious, Jonathan and McIntosh are
Michigan's big three. Northern Spy, an old variety, is still grown
widely for use in pies and to make cider.
</P>
<P>
   Shelf life, texture, uniform ripening and disease resistance are
the most sought-after traits. Distinctive taste is barely in the
first tier of breeding goals.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, moreover, are reluctant to experiment by introducing
unfamiliar varieties. Production costs are too high and profit
margins too slim, and tearing out a productive orchard to test an
unknown is too big a leap for most growers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, apples have not descended to the level of the
modern tomato. Cornell University keeps a well-stocked germ-plasm
repository in Geneva, N.Y., which is collecting wild seeds from the
Caspian Sea region and from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Wild apple trees are still so prevalent in this so-called center
of diversity that they constitute 40 percent of the native forest,
said James Luby, an apple breeder and a professor of horticulture
at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are 6,000 known commercial apple varieties in
the world, a deep reservoir of genetic material for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I'm more interested in apples developed in the
last century. In mid-May, the blossoms open and our trees look as
if they are covered in snow.
</P>
<P>
   In October, friends come to pick apples and haul them to
Swanson's mill three miles away to be pressed into the most
delicious tart cider.
</P>
<P>
   We have baked our apples into crisps and pies, eaten them
straight from the trees and stored some of the harder green ones
into the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving a diversity of strains may be part of a global
solution. But for us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures
that are all the more precious because we can't find them anywhere
else.

<P>
   Ten years ago, two botanists from the New York Botanical Garden
eagerly hiked up a hill in Haiti to examine what would prove to be
one of only seven known remaining specimens of Attalea
crassispatha, a very rare palm tree.
</P>
<P>
   To the scientists, the palm, with its unusual flowers and
soaring trunk, was a special, splendid thing. But to the farmer
about to cut it down, it was blocking his plans to expand his
sparse field of stunted corn stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A polite discussion ensued, recalled Dr. Michael Balick, one of
the botanists. With a Haitian colleague translating, he tried his
best to persuade the farmer to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about his children and grandchildren, about the
global value of maintaining biological diversity,'' Balick
explained. ``He said, `But what value is it to me today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Balick said the hilltop debate in the shadow of the palm was a
turning point, marking when he began to realize that efforts to
preserve the diversity of life cannot rely on abstract arguments,
but must be grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation
to fit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for
seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans. The
farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convinced to begin to preserve it, not only as a source
of nuts, but also for income derived through the sale of the seeds
so the tree could be grown elsewhere,'' Balick said.
</P>
<P>
   Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel
stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered
species around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify
preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer
drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals
extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that
are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests,
preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
   And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from
maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like
the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a
healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific advocate exists for almost every living thing, even
those that most people loathe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian
Institution, is perhaps the world's staunchest booster of beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of
beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is
about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru _ just beetles, just
one tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our everyday experience, insects are usually problems _
mosquitoes, roaches, that kind of thing,'' Erwin said. ``But,
really, 98 percent of all insect species provide ecological
services that keep the environment going.''
</P>
<P>
   An important service is taking out the garbage, with fly maggots
and dung beetles recycling rotting meat or feces into useful
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   And without the thousands of bees, beetles and other insects
that pollinate flowering plants, Erwin said, ``we'd all be eating
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem
is as critical as the benefits of preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the
structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is
more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform
landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are
more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and
fabric of our own lives,'' Klemens said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with people he has encountered on both
continents, he has found that ``if given a choice, people in Africa
and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of
their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Balick said: ``It's still very important to talk about its
importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some
of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic
benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to
small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal
plants for some part of primary health care,'' he noted. ``You'd
think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful,''
he said. ``And that puts great pressure on ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's a goner,'' Henderson said.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the big picture and in the long run, it's true: To paraphrase
Yosemite Sam, there is biological gold in them thar rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The active ingredient in roughly one in four prescription drugs
comes from plants. And biotechnology companies are eager to gain
access to exotic environments containing tens of millions of plant
and animal species that have yet to be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   In the most visible deal, Merck, the giant pharmaceutical maker,
is paying Costa Rica cash plus royalties to preserve the country's
fragile tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
   But economists speak with virtually one voice in warning that
biodiversity is not going to pay for itself. The creation of
property rights in the wilderness can play only a minor role in
protecting endangered habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential return to bioprospecting has been greatly
exaggerated,'' argued David Simpson, a senior fellow at Resources
for the Future, an environmental research organization in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the major contribution of economics in the
biodiversity debate will likely be the forcing of policy makers to
deal more realistically with intangible, nonuse values. That is the
kind of thing usually left to philosophers. And since such
intangibles are more immediately interesting to the citizens of
affluent countries than to the largely poor custodians of tropical
``hot spots'' of biodiversity, the lesson's starting point is that
there are no free rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, species preservation comes down to tradeoffs _ in
deciding how much we are willing to sacrifice in the name of
preserving natural habitats,'' concluded Martin Weitzman, an
economist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, economists assume that the keys to
everything, from more effective drugs to more nutritious,
disease-resistant crops, are secreted in tropical forests. Why,
then, isn't the repository for these natural wonders valued
accordingly?
</P>
<P>
   What counts, Simpson said, is scarcity. And while there may be
millions of potentially useful species, there is also vast
biochemical redundancy in the environment. Thus the value of any
acre is limited by the fact that an identical species probably
grows on thousands of other acres, and that many of the useful
chemicals will show up in hundreds or even thousands of species.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution decreed, after all, that both coffee and tea contain
caffeine as a defense against predators. And where naturally
occurring chemicals are extremely rare, the value of looking for
them is offset by the high cost of such a task.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Roger Sedjo and John Reid, his colleagues at
Resources for the Future, estimated the potential value of
preservation in 18 biodiversity hot spots around the world. And
while their figures are necessarily crude _ extrapolating from
useful new chemicals found in exotic environments and the cost of
developing drugs from them _ they are deliberately designed to err
on the high side.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate value of undiscovered species might be,
the three researchers calculate that the current bioprospecting
rights for pharmaceuticals are worth a maximum of $8 an acre in
western Ecuador to $2 an acre in the Philippines to a mere 40 cents
an acre in the eastern Himalayas. That may be enough to justify
biosurveys, but hardly counters pressure for other uses like
grazing or gathering firewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' Simpson said, ``exaggerated claims of the
pharmaceutical companies' willingness to pay to preserve exotic
environments has been counterproductive,'' as poor countries balk
at what they view as efforts to claim their natural treasures for a
song.
</P>
<P>
   In the stalemate, rain forests continue to be destroyed by
farmers and prospectors seeking short-term gains.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean biodiversity has little value, said Robert
Stavins, an environmental economist at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard. But it implies that ``the lion's share of
the value is intangible,'' Stavins said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, what can economists contribute to the debate? For
one, they can help a society sort through its priorities by looking
at what people are willing to pay to support those values. The
evidence is that public policy toward endangered species reflects
only the narrowest of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In research to be published this summer in the Journal of
Economic Perspectives, Weitzman and Andrew Metrick, a Harvard
colleague, look for the priorities reflected by the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service's spending to protect 142 invertebrate
species that are listed as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect that the biological distinctiveness of a
species would increase its standing. So ought the probability that
intervention would preserve the species. Last but hardly least is
cost: With limited funds, priorities should reflect the resources
needed to keep the species intact.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Metrick-Weitzman analysis shows that the more
endangered a species is, the less money is spent to preserve it.
And the higher the cost of preserving a species in terms of
dislocating economic activities, the higher the priority the
species gets.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic uniqueness seems to play little or no role in priority.
Think of the northern spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to count most in determining spending priorities are
size (the bigger the better) and taxonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Mammals and birds, which economists dub ``charismatic
megafauna,'' are popular with preservationists, while amphibians
and fish go to the rear of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Stavins put it more plainly. The species we defend most
aggressively, he said, are ``warm and cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   That may worry biologists who are concerned about the potential
disappearance of broad categories of plants and smaller animals
that help knit healthy ecosystems. But the focus on fur balls may
or may not bother taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have no business telling people what they should
value, Weitzman argued, but they have plenty to contribute on the
subject of rationality.
</P>
<P>
   If we are committed to biodiversity, economists can help make
the cost-benefit calculations critical to obtaining the most bang
for a buck. And they can help people to think seriously about how
to provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' Mr. Weitzman said, ``then we should be honest about
our desire to have charismatic megafauna effects dominate our
decisions.''

</P>
<P>
   Evolution decreed, after all, that both coffee and tea contain
caffeine as a defense against predators. And where naturally
occurring chemicals are extremely rare, the value of looking for
them is offset by the high cost of such a task.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Roger Sedjo and John Reid, his colleagues at
Resources for the Future, estimated the potential value of
preservation in 18 biodiversity hot spots around the world. And
while their figures are necessarily crude _ extrapolating from
useful new chemicals found in exotic environments and the cost of
developing drugs from them _ they are deliberately designed to err
on the high side.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate value of undiscovered species might be,
the three researchers calculate that the current bioprospecting
rights for pharmaceuticals are worth a maximum of $8 an acre in
western Ecuador to $2 an acre in the Philippines to a mere 40 cents
an acre in the eastern Himalayas. That may be enough to justify
biosurveys, but hardly counters pressure for other uses like
grazing or gathering firewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' Simpson said, ``exaggerated claims of the
pharmaceutical companies' willingness to pay to preserve exotic
environments has been counterproductive,'' as poor countries balk
at what they view as efforts to claim their natural treasures for a
song.
</P>
<P>
   In the stalemate, rain forests continue to be destroyed by
farmers and prospectors seeking short-term gains.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean biodiversity has little value, said Robert
Stavins, an environmental economist at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard. But it implies that ``the lion's share of
the value is intangible,'' Stavins said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, what can economists contribute to the debate? For
one, they can help a society sort through its priorities by looking
at what people are willing to pay to support those values. The
evidence is that public policy toward endangered species reflects
only the narrowest of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In research to be published this summer in the Journal of
Economic Perspectives, Weitzman and Andrew Metrick, a Harvard
colleague, look for the priorities reflected by the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service's spending to protect 142 invertebrate
species that are listed as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect that the biological distinctiveness of a
species would increase its standing. So ought the probability that
intervention would preserve the species. Last but hardly least is
cost: With limited funds, priorities should reflect the resources
needed to keep the species intact.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Metrick-Weitzman analysis shows that the more
endangered a species is, the less money is spent to preserve it.
And the higher the cost of preserving a species in terms of
dislocating economic activities, the higher the priority the
species gets.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic uniqueness seems to play little or no role in priority.
Think of the northern spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to count most in determining spending priorities are
size (the bigger the better) and taxonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Mammals and birds, which economists dub ``charismatic
megafauna,'' are popular with preservationists, while amphibians
and fish go to the rear of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Stavins put it more plainly. The species we defend most
aggressively, he said, are ``warm and cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   That may worry biologists who are concerned about the potential
disappearance of broad categories of plants and smaller animals
that help knit healthy ecosystems. But the focus on fur balls may
or may not bother taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have no business telling people what they should
value, Weitzman argued, but they have plenty to contribute on the
subject of rationality.
</P>
<P>
   If we are committed to biodiversity, economists can help make
the cost-benefit calculations critical to obtaining the most bang
for a buck. And they can help people to think seriously about how
to provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' Mr. Weitzman said, ``then we should be honest about
our desire to have charismatic megafauna effects dominate our
decisions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ As recently as two years ago, a small
German company like Kinowelt Medien AG had almost no hope of
selling stock to outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   European stock exchanges were not interested in an obscure
family company in Munich that distributes American movies to German
theaters. Individual investors were so cautious they rarely bought
stocks at all. And American-style venture capitalists were few and
far between.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. On May 12, Kinowelt was the most ardently sought
company on the German stock exchange. Within minutes after its
shares were traded for the first time, the price tripled to 160
marks, or about $90, from 55 marks. Since then, shares have soared
to 374 marks, or $211, nearly seven times the opening price. They
closed Thursday at 307 marks, or $173.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy over Kinowelt is just one example of a fever that is
sweeping Europe. In a historic switch that has both amazed and
alarmed financial analysts, investors from Frankfurt to Brussels,
Belgium, to Amsterdam, Netherlands, have fallen madly in love with
entrepreneurs, new companies and anything that remotely resembles a
high-technology stock.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the appetite in the United States, where Internet
start-up companies have been going public at huge valuations, the
infatuation here is still in its early stages. But compared with
Europe's past, it is a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this frenzy is a broad shift among Europeans toward
investing in stocks. Because interest rates have declined sharply
across the continent, investors who traditionally put all their
money in conservative bonds and savings accounts are chasing stocks
in search of better returns. In the last few months, Europe's
mainstream stock markets have climbed much faster than those in the
United States, and the newest European markets, featuring many of
the start-ups, have grown the fastest of all.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, many of Europe's most promising biotechnology
and electronics start-ups found it so difficult to raise money at
home that they listed their shares in the United States. Some even
moved their corporate headquarters across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two years, once-stodgy exchanges have started a
series of ``new markets'' tailored to small companies with names
like Transtec, Qiagen and Aixtron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it, but taxi drivers in Frankfurt
recognized my name from television,'' said Klaus Kleber, a managing
director of LHS Group Inc., a German company that produces computer
software for communications systems. Just three years ago, LHS
moved to Atlanta and later went public in the United States. But it
sold a second batch of shares in Frankfurt last year, and company
officials say that most of LHS's stock is now trading in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But many financial experts warn that the wild run-up in prices
has already become a classic speculative bubble, fueled by euphoric
and often naive investors who simply assume they can make an
overnight profit by selling any new stock for more than they paid
as soon as they buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is illogical,'' warned Richard Loeffler, a managing
director of Deutsche Beteiligungs AG, a venture capital arm of
Deutsche Bank that invested in some of the companies that have gone
public. ``People have heard for so long that we don't have enough
entrepreneurs, that we lag behind in high technology, so when they
see companies that seem to be in biotechnology or computer software
they just buy these stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular new stock is Mobilcom, a small German
company that provides cellular telephone service mainly by leasing
and reselling capacity from Germany's three main carriers. Mobilcom
went public last fall at 62.50 marks, or $35, but it has since
soared to 1,400 marks, or $789 _ a 22-fold increase. Though
Mobilcom's sales are only $181 million, its market capitalization
is about $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria is everywhere. In Brussels last month, zealous
investors overwhelmed the rickety Belgian stock exchange during an
initial stock offering by Kinopolis Group, a developer of multiplex
movie theaters. Investors had oversubscribed the stock offering by
75 times, setting the stage for a huge jump in price as soon as
shares began trading. But because the Belgian stock exchange puts
limits on daily price swings, Kinopolis stock was not allowed to
start trading until several days after the public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Even unglamorous and low-technology companies have been swept up
in the surge.
</P>
<P>
   Consider WET Automotive Systems AG, a 30-year-old German family
company that makes seat-heaters for cars. When WET conducted a $27
million initial offering last month, investors ordered 63 times the
number of available shares. Shares jumped to 96 marks from 54 marks
as soon as trading began. It is now selling for 107.50 marks, or
$61.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 100 percent profit the first day is not bad,'' said Bodo
Ruthenberg, the company's founder. Ruthenberg owns 65.6 percent of
the stock, which has a net worth of $108 million.
</P>
<P>
   For all the giddiness, bankers and financial analysts say the
boom at least partly reflects important changes in Europe that were
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The new stock exchanges that cater to smaller and younger
companies, they say, are providing a crucial source of capital that
has long been present in the United States but absent in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Because small and comparatively untested companies were all but
prohibited from selling their shares to the public, American-style
venture capitalists were reluctant to invest because they had
little way to cash out after several years. The main sources of
financing were either bank loans or a company's profits _ of little
help to companies with novel ideas or technologies but few assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a venture capitalist, you could invest but there was no way
to harvest your profit after three or five years,'' said Jos
Peters, head of Capricorn Partners, a Belgian venture capital firm,
who helped start a European electronic-trading system for small
companies called Easdaq. ``You were stuck with paper value. What
Easdaq has done is to close the circle so that people can attract
money at a valuation that reflects the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Easdaq, started just two years ago, is a miniature clone of
Nasdaq, the American electronic brokerage exchange. It also
embodies a traditional American approach to shareholder protection:
Instead of demanding that companies reach a certain size and show a
long record of sales and profits, Easdaq requires companies to
adopt international accounting standards and to follow strict rules
about disclosing information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal stock exchanges took the view that they had to
protect the investor and that they were only for blue-chip
companies,'' said Jacques Putzeys, the chief executive of Easdaq.
``We take the view that we protect the investor against not having
enough information.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly in response to Easdaq, mainstream stock exchanges have
started ``new markets'' in Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and
Brussels. The most explosive of these has been Frankfurt's, where
new companies are going public every few days and where investors
are literally begging brokers for shares regardless of the
company's business.
</P>
<P>
   For promising biotechnology and electronics companies, the new
exchanges have been a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   Qiagen, a German biotechnology company founded in 1984, had
already generated a modest profit and annual sales of about $30
million when it wanted to go public several years ago. But because
German financial institutions had little familiarity with
biotechnology, the founders turned to the United States and went
public on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, you couldn't sell most of the young biotech
companies here,'' said Peer Schatz, Qiagen's chief financial
officer. ``There were virtually no comparable biotech companies
listed in Frankfurt. There were no analysts who specialized in the
field. And there were no banks to support us. The U.S. markets were
much more open.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Qiagen returned with a second stock offering in
Germany that raised $47 million. ``The change is really dramatic,''
said Metin Colpan, Qiagen's chief executive. ``Everyone is now
talking about stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts say the speculative euphoria could be reaching
the levels that typically mark an overheated market that is poised
for a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``German retail investors generally have no idea what kind of
company they have bought,'' said Pierre Drach, president of
Independent Research, an investment research company in Frankfurt.
``Institutions are the main holders of the initial public offering,
but then come the retail clients who buy for three times or four
times as much.''
</P>
<P>
   That may well have been the case with Transtec AG, a company
that markets computer systems and components. Founded 17 years ago
by Bernhard Bruscha, a former physicist, Transtec made a stunning
debut on the Frankfurt market on April 3 _ only to decline steadily
almost every day since then.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement about Transtec had been building for days before the
offering, as bankers put out word that investors had placed orders
for 120 times the number of shares being offered. Even before the
shares officially began to trade, speculators in Germany's informal
``gray market'' were offering to pay three times the opening price
of 71 marks, or $40, to people who had been promised shares in the
offering.
</P>
<P>
   When Bruscha arrived at the stock exchange to watch trading
begin, a television news crew and several radio reporters were
waiting to interview him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have sold our entire offering to just two
institutional investors,'' Bruscha said. ``It was really amazing.
During our road show, we would sit down for one-on-one meetings and
they would just say, `OK, we'll take 500,000 shares.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Transtec shares immediately jumped to 195
marks, or $110, in the first minute of trading. Even Bruscha
admitted that the price seemed high.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a fundamental, analytical point of view, our bankers had
estimated that the value was in the mid-50s or maybe 60 marks,'' he
said. Given the apparent demand, the company and the bankers had
pushed up the offering price to 71 marks _ about 27 times projected
earnings. But at triple that price, ``I would have to say that's a
bit rich.''
</P>
<P>
   But since then, the shares have headed relentlessly downward.
The price dropped to 179 marks on the second day of trading and to
162 marks on the third. At the close of trading Thursday, Transtec
shares could be bought for 118.60 marks, or $67.

TEXAS WOMAN PART OF GROUP TO CLAIM DUAL CITIZENSHIP IN MEXICO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Maria Jimenez of Texas and 99 other people
reclaimed their Mexican birthright Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But for Jimenez and others, the ceremony in an inner courtyard
of the ornate National Palace marked a milestone rather than a
realization of their dreams of dual citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a voice but not a vote,'' said Jimenez, a native of
the border state of Coahuila who became a U.S. citizen and is the
Houston director of the American Friends Service Committee, a
Quaker civil rights organization. ``(But) for those of us who have
been struggling for dual citizenship, this is a step forward.``
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo presided over the ceremony, which put
the official seal on a newly enacted program bestowing
``nationality'' on Mexicans living abroad who have become citizens
of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans, welcome to your homeland,'' Zedillo told the group,
which also included Mario Molina, a Mexico City-born U.S. citizen
who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate all of you because these documents return, from
a legal point of view, something that each of you has kept intact
in your heart, at times for many years: the will to be Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a law enacted in March, Mexicans who become citizens of
other countries can retain their Mexican nationality, holding on to
inheritance, property and other rights.
</P>
<P>
   The recovered nationality does not bestow the benefits of
citizenship. Those with dual nationality won't be able to vote in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3,738 people, most of them in the United States, had filed
to reclaim their Mexican nationality from the time the program
started in March until the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents have said that the recognition of their dual
nationality would allow Mexicans to become politically active
citizens in the United States and other countries without
permanently abandoning Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, we free the consciences of millions of countrymen
who flatly refuse to obtain the citizenship of the United States in
order not to betray Mexico,'' Jose Chapa, a 78-year-old radio
journalist from Chicago who initiated the push for dual nationality
a decade ago, said in a speech at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can leave this political limbo and be actors in our own
destinies with the power to vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Mexican government had given us this constitutional
instrument before the anti-immigrant, xenophobic and racist wave in
California, I don't think the Pete Wilsons and Pat Buchanans would
have done us so much damage.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the issue that worries many in the United States
concerned about the huge influx of Mexican immigrants in recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Although scores of nations recognized dual nationality, critics
say the status for Mexicans living in the United States will
further slow their assimilation into U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worse possible time to introduce this question of
divided loyalties into the equation,'' said K.C. McAlpin, a
Houstonian working at The Federation for American Immigration
Reform, or FAIR, a Washington, D.C., group intent on limiting
immigration into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises unnecessary and dangerous questions that should not
exist in the minds of many Americans (about) the allegiance of
citizens of Mexican origin,'' he said. ``Citizenship in any
sovereign country should mean commitment to that country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jimenez, Chapa and others quickly point to the military
records of many Mexican Americans _ which include a
disproportionate number of Medals of Honor _ when challenged about
their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   And they argue that, at a time when Mexico and the United States
are moving closer together economically, Mexicans who are U.S.
citizens can play an influential role south as well as north of the
Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, who teaches chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, told Zedillo and other Mexican officials at Thursday's
ceremony that he intends to form an international commission to
seek solutions to Mexico City's deadly air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I express my faith in truth and science and my conviction that
my colleagues and I can make a useful contribution,'' Molina said.
``I reiterate that my personal efforts will only be guided by a
commitment to give Mexico my best effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government has traditionally been reluctant to
accept international advice or help in dealing with ecological
crises or natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Congress may consider granting voting rights to
Mexican citizens living in the United States. Absentee balloting
could dramatically influence the direction of Mexico's fledgling
democracy. Opposition candidates in recent years have campaigned in
Mexican communities throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience,'' Jimenez said, ``is that Mexicans (in the
United States), are very critical of their (Mexican) society and
their government because they know the reality of it.''

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for

   &UR; WHY CARE? &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

<P>
   An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

 &UR; By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

<P>
   It is difficult to know for sure, but there may be more kinds of
creatures living on Earth now than ever before in the planet's
4.6-billion-year history. Or at least there were that many before
human beings appeared very late in the game and began changing the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   At first, life consisted of microscopic, single-cell balls, rods
and filaments. For perhaps 3 billion years, these microbes were all
the life there was on this wet, stark and rocky world.
</P>
<P>
   Not until about 600 million years ago, after the Earth emerged
from its deepest ice age ever, did bigger species evolve. Then
life's variety exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of biological variety has been on an upward curve
since then. From sequoias and nematodes to fungi and elephants,
millions of species populate the world.
</P>
<P>
   The curve has not been a smooth one. At least five times in the
last 600 million years, planetwide environmental cataclysms, like
drastic climatic change and colliding asteroids, have wiped out
whole families of organisms. Such events have threatened to erase
life, but succeeded only in partly clearing the stage for new and
different families.
</P>
<P>
   Between extinction spasms, in the background hum of evolution,
single species winked out here and there to be replaced by new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this continuous turnover, scientists believe, more
than 95 percent of all species that have ever existed are extinct
today.
</P>
<P>
   Now one species, Homo sapiens, has become so powerful an
influence on the rest of the biosphere that many experts fear it is
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a sixth major extinction.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is happening simply because people are acting
naturally _ harvesting wild species to burn, eat or sell;
expropriating and destroying wild habitat to make way for human
works like farms, cities and suburbs; moving plants and animals
around the globe in a mix-and-match game in which a relatively few,
superadaptable plant and animal species are crowding out a larger
number of less hardy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the numbers is magnified greatly by technology's
power to shape the landscape and exploit the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   This combination has been especially worrisome for the rain
forests, where most of the world's species are found and
large-scale clearing is under way.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many species live on Earth. About 1.4
million have been described and named, but biologists believe there
are at least 10 times that many.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can put precise numbers on the rate of present-day
extinction, although several scientists have made rough stabs.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively conservative estimate says that for some species
found only in one locality, the rate may be 100 to 1,000 times the
normal ``background'' rate between mass extinctions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists who study the situation doubt that humans are
driving other creatures toward extinction at a growing rate.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever extent they are doing so, people are reducing the
variety of life on Earth _ what conservation biologists now call
biological diversity, or just biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Biodiversity is not merely a matter of different kinds of
species. It applies to many layers of nature on different scales.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is expressed by the number of genetic
variations within a species, the raw material of evolution; destroy
the wrong genes, and the species might not be able to adapt and
survive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, biodiversity is expressed in the bewildering
variety of types of ecosystems, the tightly interwoven communities
of plants, animals and microbes that are nature's working units.
</P>
<P>
   Forests, wetlands and grasslands are examples of one level of
ecosystem variety, and each comprises numerous interconnected
subunits, right down to the microscopic. It is these interconnected
communities that constitute the fabric of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree human activity is narrowing the variety of
life, scientists say, it is doing so on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter? Conservationists and biologists offer a
number of answers. On the practical level, wild species provide the
raw material for medicine and food. Who knows what undiscovered
plant might provide a cure for our era's killer diseases?
</P>
<P>
   Acting together, wild species support the human economy by
providing an array of services like water purification, soil
formation, pollination, flood control and, in our age, outdoor
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   On a more fundamental level, they support human life: Without
humans, the biosphere would not miss a beat. But without insects
and microbes, humans would disappear quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say natural systems are intrinsic to psychological
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many conservationists assert a moral imperative: It is
simply wrong to destroy large slices of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Moral arguments aside, are all species equally valuable?
Scientists believe that in many ecosystems, a few keystone species
hold everything together, and that if they are removed, the system
will collapse and all the other species in it will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in most instances, no one is sure which are
the crucial species.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, scientists have found, the greater the variety of
plant species in an ecosystem, the more productive it is over all.
</P>
<P>
   So, conservationists argue, it is necessary to save as many
species as possible. They have their work cut out for them, since
the catalogue of imperilment is long.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the World Conservation Union, in Gland, Switzerland,
added nearly 34,000 plant species _ one of every eight known plant
species in the world, and nearly one of three in the United States
_ to its growing ``red list'' of imperiled organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In possibly an even more important gauge of overall biological
vitality, an earlier assessment, by United States Federal
Government scientists, found that vast stretches of the natural
landscape, amounting to at least half the area of the contiguous 48
states, had declined to the point of endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   This report, the first ever done on the state of health of the
nation's individual ecosystems, found that 30 of them, some of
which dominated vast regions before the arrival of Europeans, have
been destroyed or degraded by 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the trackless ocean is immune. Overfishing has pushed
some marine species _ the cod and the blue-fin tuna, for example _
to the brink of commercial extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs in some parts of the world are under severe assault;
in parts of Asia, fishermen squirt sodium cyanide into the water to
stun fish, in doses strong enough to kill the corals that maintain
the reef ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The abundant evidence for the threat to biodiversity should not
be overinterpreted. The recent red-listing of plants includes many
simply because they are rare. While many may be vulnerable, humans
do not threaten them just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The red list of plants can be read another way, too: While one
in eight plants was judged imperiled, almost 90 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   On the action front, there are bright spots. Over the last
century, a worldwide conservation movement has struggled to stem
the human assault on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Endangered Species Act is regarded as the
strongest protection law in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, more than 160 countries, not including
the United States, have ratified a treaty obligating governments to
protect plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
   But victories are scattered or overturned. Recently, a federal
court, for instance, invalidated the Yellowstone wolf restoration
project, and a legal battle is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, habitat continues to disappear at an
``unprecedented'' rate, according to the United Nations. The
magnitude of the sixth extinction, if that is what is occurring,
will become clear in time.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century may reveal whether the clever brain bequeathed
to Homo sapiens by the evolution of biological diversity can be
used to save diversity as well as destroy it.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been more than 20 years since advocates of
saving the snail darter, a minnow-sized fish believed to be on the
brink of oblivion, blocked the mighty Tennessee Valley Authority
from building the $137 million Tellico Dam.
</P>
<P>
   That case went to the Supreme Court, which sided with the fish,
and only when Congress intervened did the dam go forward.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Weyerhauser Corp. is negotiating a voluntary
plan to protect dozens of species on hundreds of thousands of acres
of rich forest habitat in Oregon over several decades, during which
development of the land will be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   These cases are strikingly different manifestations of the
Endangered Species Act, a law evolving so rapidly that it almost
resembles a new species itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the law was mostly used to block development
and preserve the habitat of a species close to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious and
subtler, as the government and landowners design management plans
to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of private
land, but at the same time not block development.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fundamental change in how the law should work. It also
reflects the realization that the Endangered Species Act's true aim
is to protect healthy and biologically diverse habitats, and not
just one imperiled species after another.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be done without the involvement of private
landowners. So Congress and the Clinton administration are trying
to give developers a bigger role in protecting the nation's
biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Endangered Species Act was under attack
by business groups, the Clinton administration began to
aggressively encourage the use of ``habitat conservation plans,''
or HCPs, on private lands, which are estimated to provide habitat
to 80 percent of all protected species.
</P>
<P>
   HCPs are binding, voluntary agreements in which a landowner
adopts conservation measures, sometimes going beyond what the law
strictly requires, in exchange for permission to develop some
property even if endangered wildlife and habitat are hurt in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A landowner might agree to leave some forest untouched to
protect wetlands from sediment and stream banks from erosion and to
preserve natural corridors for animals. Otherwise, homes can be
built, sewers trenched and driveways paved.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat conservation plans were authorized by Congress in 1982.
But before 1994, there were only about 20 such active arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, by the end of last year there were more than 200;
hundreds of more are coming. And their size is increasing from
fewer than 1,000 acres at the outset to tens or even hundreds of
thousands of acres in recent cases.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, advocates said, would reassure property owners
and provide incentives to protect the diversity of life on their
land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration credits the new arrangements for
helping to ensure the recovery of hundreds of species. But it is an
approach that creates suspicion and even hostility among some
environmentalists and conservation biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under many HCPs, development is permitted and habitat is
destroyed despite great uncertainty about whether the landowners
have provided enough mitigation to sustain species in the long
run,'' said the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife in a
report written by Laura Hood, a biologist, and published in
February. Hood examined 24 such plans.
</P>
<P>
   The critics' fire is particularly directed at a part of the plan
that has proved crucial to winning acceptance by property owners:
the guarantee of ``no surprises'' to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises clause tells the landowner whose plan includes
permission to harm some of the species or habitat during
development _ a so-called incidental take permit _ that the
government will place no additional restrictions on how the land is
used during the plan's life, usually several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The promise holds even if unforeseen circumstances arise, which
may demand further steps to preserve species.
</P>
<P>
   If the landowner agrees and the federal government picks up the
costs, additional conservation measures can be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landowners with private or commercial land have a legitimate
concern,'' said Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of Interior. ``They
want some assurance that once they agree to be a party to an HCP
and to mitigate the effects of their activities on listed species,
we won't come back later for a second bite from the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A deal is a deal,'' Babbitt added.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem, some skeptical scientists say, is that nature
is full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great uncertainty in natural systems, but HCPs and
no-surprises agreements act as though that is not the case,'' said
Dr. Gary K. Meffe, a professor of biology at the University of
Florida and the editor of the journal Conservation Biology.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises policy is at the heart of a bill offered by the
Republican Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Dirk A.
Kempthorne of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supports the bill, as do many Senate
Democrats. But so far, sponsors have been unable to bring it to the
Senate floor, partly over disputes about how to pay the
government's costs in the future, when surprises arise and
no-surprises clauses trigger federal payments to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kempthorne's proposal, supported by Senator Pete V.
Domenici of Arizona, the budget committee chairman, to pay these
costs by selling big tracts of publicly owned land, caused an
immediate uproar among conservation advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Most major environmental groups oppose the Chafee-Kempthorne
bill and instead favor a proposal written by Representative George
Miller, a California Democrat, for consideration by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says his bill would better ensure that endangered species
can actually begin to recover by setting aside critical habitat for
them and by restricting the use of the no-surprises guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's bill is very unlikely to win approval this year,
and the prospects for rewriting the law before Congress adjourns
for the November elections appear dim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, conservation groups are fighting some proposed HCPs
by enlisting scientists to challenge the no-surprises provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society in Portland, Ore., for example, assembled
scientists to review Weyerhauser's proposed HCP for tracts of its
Oregon property.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhauser and federal agencies are negotiating a complex plan
for species conservation and ecosystem management on approximately
400,000 acres of land in the Willamette Valley, foothills of the
central Cascade mountains and the Oregon coast ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would be implemented for 40 years with up to four
additional 10-year extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cover not only northern spotted owls (there are
about 160 owl sites on the land) but many other species, including
marbled murrelets, Umpqua River cutthroat trout, American peregrine
falcons, Columbian white-tailed deer, bald eagles, Aleutian Canada
geese and Oregon chubs.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for incidental take permits, which allows
Weyerhauser to damage the habitat of some of these species during
logging operations, the company agrees to accept detailed
prescriptions on how to manage the logging.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 40 percent of the land at a time will be reduced to
seedlings, and less than 60 percent at a time to seedlings and
saplings combined.
</P>
<P>
   The company will keep buffers around streams and leave behind
snags, large trees and big logs, all imperative to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Wininger, a timber manager at Weyerhauser, said that
the plan includes flexibility to change practices along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the water in streams is not within prescribed
temperature ranges, the company must change the amount of forest
left to shade the streams. But that is not enough to satisfy some
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel has several concerns with freezing a management
program in place for the 40- to 80-year term of the HCP,'' the
Audubon scientists' report said. ``The next 40 years of scientific
research will certainly produce new data and insights. One need
only consider the change in science's understanding of spotted owls
and other species affected by the proposed HCP in the last 40
years.''

<P>
   THOMPSONVILLE, Mich. _ I Finally understood why Adam was so
enticed by Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through
our orchard near the northern coast of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 apple trees _ some gnarled and thick at the trunk
like an old ash, others mere saplings _ stood scattered on a sandy
ridge between the maple forest and a dun-colored meadow.
</P>
<P>
   It was September 1991, weeks before the fruit fully matured.
Still, the orchard's scent was sweet and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A dry summer had produced unblemished apples that hung from the
limbs in a wondrous display of variety and color. Big, red round
apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree, and they
had a light, candy taste.
</P>
<P>
   There were large green apples, a kind that had probably been
stored during the winter in straw-lined pits to be eaten in spring.
</P>
<P>
   And there were smaller green apples with brown patches that
might have originated from the old Roxbury Russet varieties popular
in northwestern Michigan around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist who covered farming and wrote about modern
agriculture's shrinking genetic resources, I was struck by the
number of varieties, none of which could be found at the markets in
the towns of Benzonia or Frankfort nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '70s, plant breeders have worried that the
abundance of the world's food supply is balanced on a narrowing
supply of wild and domestic plant genes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a handful of varieties bred for peak production
make up the bulk of the world's rice harvest. Meanwhile,
irreplaceable genetic traits that enabled old varieties of rice to
grow in harsh conditions have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is playing out for wheat, corn, barley,
tomatoes and most other major food plants. Homogenization in the
market is one result. Hunger can be another. The Irish potato
famine was caused by a plant disease that raced through crops
containing no genetic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As the new owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in
Manistee County, Mich., my wife and I wanted to know more about the
place we had just bought and who had preceded us.
</P>
<P>
   Although historical records are incomplete, sometime during the
1880s, Hiram Hier moved to the township and built a plain two-story
home for his wife and two children on a rise above Nurnberger Road.
</P>
<P>
   Like other homesteaders, he planted different varieties of apple
trees _ in his case, three neat rows down the south-facing slope of
the widest ridge on his land.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 19th century, American farmers were encouraged
to spread seeds and see what came up. Hier almost surely followed
the protocol, as did his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Long growing seasons moderated by Lake Michigan, well-drained
soils and high ridges, which kept untimely frosts at bay, had
already distinguished Michigan's west side as one of the nation's
prime fruit-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 20th century, the fruit belt of northwest and
western Michigan was producing more than 50 commercial varieties of
apples, authorities say. Among the old favorites, some of them
recognizable in my orchard, are Snow apples, which are pure white
to the bite; the Wolf River, a big, round baking apple; Maiden's
Blush, an early ripening yellow apple with a bewitching dark-pink
patch on the side that receives the most sunlight; and Golden
Russet, with skin the color of brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, apple varieties were so diverse, it was just
like human beings,'' said John Kilcherman, a farmer in Northport,
Mich., who cultivates 240 heirloom varieties for his thriving
mail-order business. ``There were as many apples as there were
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I walked our land and tried to count the number
of varieties, concluding there were at least 14.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a simple task. The old trees that Hier had planted
were mostly dead, and a forest of maple and ash had grown up around
them. Hier's son, Lee, was the last to farm the place, and when he
died in the 1960s, deer began spreading the seeds. Young
fruit-bearing trees are now growing throughout the property.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, I was certain there were more varieties
available than in almost any commercial supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Even along the Lake Michigan coast, the center of a $100 million
apple-growing industry, the nation's fourth largest, the markets
offer paltry pickings. Red Delicious, Jonathan and McIntosh are
Michigan's big three. Northern Spy, an old variety, is still grown
widely for use in pies and to make cider.
</P>
<P>
   Shelf life, texture, uniform ripening and disease resistance are
the most sought-after traits. Distinctive taste is barely in the
first tier of breeding goals.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, moreover, are reluctant to experiment by introducing
unfamiliar varieties. Production costs are too high and profit
margins too slim, and tearing out a productive orchard to test an
unknown is too big a leap for most growers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, apples have not descended to the level of the
modern tomato. Cornell University keeps a well-stocked germ-plasm
repository in Geneva, N.Y., which is collecting wild seeds from the
Caspian Sea region and from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Wild apple trees are still so prevalent in this so-called center
of diversity that they constitute 40 percent of the native forest,
said James Luby, an apple breeder and a professor of horticulture
at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are 6,000 known commercial apple varieties in
the world, a deep reservoir of genetic material for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I'm more interested in apples developed in the
last century. In mid-May, the blossoms open and our trees look as
if they are covered in snow.
</P>
<P>
   In October, friends come to pick apples and haul them to
Swanson's mill three miles away to be pressed into the most
delicious tart cider.
</P>
<P>
   We have baked our apples into crisps and pies, eaten them
straight from the trees and stored some of the harder green ones
into the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving a diversity of strains may be part of a global
solution. But for us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures
that are all the more precious because we can't find them anywhere
else.

<P>
   THOMPSONVILLE, Mich. _ I Finally understood why Adam was so
enticed by Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through
our orchard near the northern coast of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 apple trees _ some gnarled and thick at the trunk
like an old ash, others mere saplings _ stood scattered on a sandy
ridge between the maple forest and a dun-colored meadow.
</P>
<P>
   It was September 1991, weeks before the fruit fully matured.
Still, the orchard's scent was sweet and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A dry summer had produced unblemished apples that hung from the
limbs in a wondrous display of variety and color. Big, red round
apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree, and they
had a light, candy taste.
</P>
<P>
   There were large green apples, a kind that had probably been
stored during the winter in straw-lined pits to be eaten in spring.
</P>
<P>
   And there were smaller green apples with brown patches that
might have originated from the old Roxbury Russet varieties popular
in northwestern Michigan around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist who covered farming and wrote about modern
agriculture's shrinking genetic resources, I was struck by the
number of varieties, none of which could be found at the markets in
the towns of Benzonia or Frankfort nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '70s, plant breeders have worried that the
abundance of the world's food supply is balanced on a narrowing
supply of wild and domestic plant genes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a handful of varieties bred for peak production
make up the bulk of the world's rice harvest. Meanwhile,
irreplaceable genetic traits that enabled old varieties of rice to
grow in harsh conditions have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is playing out for wheat, corn, barley,
tomatoes and most other major food plants. Homogenization in the
market is one result. Hunger can be another. The Irish potato
famine was caused by a plant disease that raced through crops
containing no genetic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As the new owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in
Manistee County, Mich., my wife and I wanted to know more about the
place we had just bought and who had preceded us.
</P>
<P>
   Although historical records are incomplete, sometime during the
1880s, Hiram Hier moved to the township and built a plain two-story
home for his wife and two children on a rise above Nurnberger Road.
</P>
<P>
   Like other homesteaders, he planted different varieties of apple
trees _ in his case, three neat rows down the south-facing slope of
the widest ridge on his land.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 19th century, American farmers were encouraged
to spread seeds and see what came up. Hier almost surely followed
the protocol, as did his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Long growing seasons moderated by Lake Michigan, well-drained
soils and high ridges, which kept untimely frosts at bay, had
already distinguished Michigan's west side as one of the nation's
prime fruit-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 20th century, the fruit belt of northwest and
western Michigan was producing more than 50 commercial varieties of
apples, authorities say. Among the old favorites, some of them
recognizable in my orchard, are Snow apples, which are pure white
to the bite; the Wolf River, a big, round baking apple; Maiden's
Blush, an early ripening yellow apple with a bewitching dark-pink
patch on the side that receives the most sunlight; and Golden
Russet, with skin the color of brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, apple varieties were so diverse, it was just
like human beings,'' said John Kilcherman, a farmer in Northport,
Mich., who cultivates 240 heirloom varieties for his thriving
mail-order business. ``There were as many apples as there were
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I walked our land and tried to count the number
of varieties, concluding there were at least 14.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a simple task. The old trees that Hier had planted
were mostly dead, and a forest of maple and ash had grown up around
them. Hier's son, Lee, was the last to farm the place, and when he
died in the 1960s, deer began spreading the seeds. Young
fruit-bearing trees are now growing throughout the property.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, I was certain there were more varieties
available than in almost any commercial supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Even along the Lake Michigan coast, the center of a $100 million
apple-growing industry, the nation's fourth largest, the markets
offer paltry pickings. Red Delicious, Jonathan and McIntosh are
Michigan's big three. Northern Spy, an old variety, is still grown
widely for use in pies and to make cider.
</P>
<P>
   Shelf life, texture, uniform ripening and disease resistance are
the most sought-after traits. Distinctive taste is barely in the
first tier of breeding goals.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, moreover, are reluctant to experiment by introducing
unfamiliar varieties. Production costs are too high and profit
margins too slim, and tearing out a productive orchard to test an
unknown is too big a leap for most growers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, apples have not descended to the level of the

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Ten years ago, two botanists from the New York Botanical Garden
eagerly hiked up a hill in Haiti to examine what would prove to be
one of only seven known remaining specimens of Attalea
crassispatha, a very rare palm tree.
</P>
<P>
   To the scientists, the palm, with its unusual flowers and
soaring trunk, was a special, splendid thing. But to the farmer
about to cut it down, it was blocking his plans to expand his
sparse field of stunted corn stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A polite discussion ensued, recalled Dr. Michael Balick, one of
the botanists. With a Haitian colleague translating, he tried his
best to persuade the farmer to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about his children and grandchildren, about the
global value of maintaining biological diversity,'' Balick
explained. ``He said, `But what value is it to me today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Balick said the hilltop debate in the shadow of the palm was a
turning point, marking when he began to realize that efforts to
preserve the diversity of life cannot rely on abstract arguments,
but must be grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation
to fit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for
seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans. The
farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convinced to begin to preserve it, not only as a source
of nuts, but also for income derived through the sale of the seeds
so the tree could be grown elsewhere,'' Balick said.
</P>
<P>
   Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel
stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered
species around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify
preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer
drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals
extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that
are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests,
preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
   And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from
maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like
the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a
healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific advocate exists for almost every living thing, even
those that most people loathe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian
Institution, is perhaps the world's staunchest booster of beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of
beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is
about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru _ just beetles, just
one tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our everyday experience, insects are usually problems _
mosquitoes, roaches, that kind of thing,'' Erwin said. ``But,
really, 98 percent of all insect species provide ecological
services that keep the environment going.''
</P>
<P>
   An important service is taking out the garbage, with fly maggots
and dung beetles recycling rotting meat or feces into useful
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   And without the thousands of bees, beetles and other insects
that pollinate flowering plants, Erwin said, ``we'd all be eating
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem
is as critical as the benefits of preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the
structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is
more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform
landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are
more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and
fabric of our own lives,'' Klemens said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with people he has encountered on both
continents, he has found that ``if given a choice, people in Africa
and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of
their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Balick said: ``It's still very important to talk about its
importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some
of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic
benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to
small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal
plants for some part of primary health care,'' he noted. ``You'd
think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful,''
he said. ``And that puts great pressure on ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's a goner,'' Henderson said.

     SUPREME COURT DENIES STARR'S REQUEST FOR
SPEEDY RULING ON PRIVILEGE
 &HT;     By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for President Clinton, the Supreme
Court on Thursday denied independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
request for a speedy ruling on whether a White House attorney and
U.S. Secret Service agents can be forced to testify in Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The order sends Starr's request back to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington and into a legal process analysts said could
take up to a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   However, the analysts said the order could also prompt Starr to
provide an impeachment report to Congress sooner than he might
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The White House quickly applauded the Supreme Court decision,
and used the occasion to intensify its public relations offensive
against Starr's probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is ... Day 1,400 of Ken Starr's tenure as an independent
counsel, at the rate of $30,000 a day of taxpayers' money,'' said
spokesman Michael McCurry. ``It's long past time for this thing to
be over and done with.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office responded with a terse prepared statement, saying
he would proceed with his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is seeking the testimony of Secret Service agents and
Clinton's closest legal counselor, Bruce Lindsey, in his
investigation of whether Clinton had an affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and then urged her and others to lie
about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has denied the charges, which have dogged his presidency
since they surfaced in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Supreme Court order presents Starr with a dilemma:
whether to wait for his request to work its way through the appeals
process and hope for a favorable ruling, or to simply proceed with
his case without the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The latter approach would focus Starr's spotlight once again on
Lewinsky, who has tried unsuccessfully to strike a deal under which
she would offer limited testimony in exchange for immunity from
prosecution for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has testified under oath that she had no affair with
Clinton, contradicting her widely reported taped conversations
about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has always been the single most important witness in this
case, from day one, and what the Starr office has been trying to do
is to build a case without her, just in case they didn't get her
testimony,'' said former associate independent counsel Bruce E.
Yannett, a partner with the New York law firm Debevoise and
Plimpton.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Thursday's order on attorney and Secret Service
privilege, Yannett said, ``it is likely the Starr office will
proceed without this evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, Yannett said, Starr could turn over his evidence in
the weeks or months ahead to a congressional panel, which would
then evaluate the strength of the evidence to determine whether to
convene impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling capped a frenzied week of legal action in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the White House dropped its assertion that national
security interests entitled the administration to withhold certain
testimony behind the legal shield of ``executive privilege.''
Experts had said the Supreme Court might agree to take up this
question quickly.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers maintained, however, that Lindsey's
conversations with the president were protected from investigatory
scrutiny by attorney-client privilege, a long-established tenet
aimed at ensuring the confidentiality of communications between
lawyers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey asserted such protection earlier this year before a
grand jury that was hearing testimony in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has also appealed a U.S. District Court judge's
order requiring two uniformed Secret Service agents and one
attorney with the agency to testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   White House attorneys claim that forcing the agents to testify
could compromise presidential security in the future, an argument a
federal district court has said was outweighed by the need for
Starr to fully investigate his case.
</P>
<P>
   With both of those issues pending, Starr asked the Supreme Court
to leapfrog the federal appeals courts to rule on them
expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that because ``a president is under serious criminal
investigation,'' potentially affecting the business of the White
House, a quick ruling was in order.
</P>
<P>
   The nine justices didn't make a formal ruling on the matter, but
simply denied Starr's request, in effect leaving both issues in the
hands of the lower court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is assumed that the Court of Appeals will proceed
expeditiously to decide this case,'' the Supreme Court order said.
</P>
<P>
   However the appeals court rules, however, the decisions are
likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court, meaning a final
resolution of the matter could take some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking many months, perhaps as much as a year,'' said
Yannett.
</P>
<P>
   That would put a resolution of the matter well beyond November's
congressional elections, an important point for Clinton. Only
Congress may impeach a sitting president, and if Democrats were to
gain the 11 seats they need to regain control of the House, they
presumably would be less inclined than Republicans to pursue an
aggressive impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ultimately going to be decided in the political
arena,'' said Yannett. ``The White House has understood that from
the beginning.''

   To the scientists, the palm, with its unusual flowers and
soaring trunk, was a special, splendid thing. But to the farmer
about to cut it down, it was blocking his plans to expand his
sparse field of stunted corn stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A polite discussion ensued, recalled Dr. Michael Balick, one of
the botanists. With a Haitian colleague translating, he tried his
best to persuade the farmer to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about his children and grandchildren, about the
global value of maintaining biological diversity,'' Balick
explained. ``He said, `But what value is it to me today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Balick said the hilltop debate in the shadow of the palm was a
turning point, marking when he began to realize that efforts to
preserve the diversity of life cannot rely on abstract arguments,
but must be grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation
to fit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for
seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans. The
farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convinced to begin to preserve it, not only as a source
of nuts, but also for income derived through the sale of the seeds
so the tree could be grown elsewhere,'' Balick said.
</P>
<P>
   Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel
stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered
species around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify
preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer
drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals
extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that
are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests,
preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
   And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from
maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like
the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a
healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific advocate exists for almost every living thing, even
those that most people loathe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian
Institution, is perhaps the world's staunchest booster of beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of
beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is
about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru _ just beetles, just
one tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our everyday experience, insects are usually problems _
mosquitoes, roaches, that kind of thing,'' Erwin said. ``But,
really, 98 percent of all insect species provide ecological
services that keep the environment going.''
</P>
<P>
   An important service is taking out the garbage, with fly maggots
and dung beetles recycling rotting meat or feces into useful
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   And without the thousands of bees, beetles and other insects
that pollinate flowering plants, Erwin said, ``we'd all be eating
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem
is as critical as the benefits of preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the
structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is
more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform
landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are
more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and
fabric of our own lives,'' Klemens said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with people he has encountered on both
continents, he has found that ``if given a choice, people in Africa
and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of
their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Balick said: ``It's still very important to talk about its
importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some
of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic
benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to
small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal
plants for some part of primary health care,'' he noted. ``You'd
think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful,''
he said. ``And that puts great pressure on ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's a goner,'' Henderson said.

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the big picture and in the long run, it's true: To paraphrase
Yosemite Sam, there is biological gold in them thar rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The active ingredient in roughly one in four prescription drugs
comes from plants. And biotechnology companies are eager to gain
access to exotic environments containing tens of millions of plant
and animal species that have yet to be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   In the most visible deal, Merck, the giant pharmaceutical maker,
is paying Costa Rica cash plus royalties to preserve the country's
fragile tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
   But economists speak with virtually one voice in warning that
biodiversity is not going to pay for itself. The creation of
property rights in the wilderness can play only a minor role in
protecting endangered habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential return to bioprospecting has been greatly
exaggerated,'' argued David Simpson, a senior fellow at Resources
for the Future, an environmental research organization in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the major contribution of economics in the
biodiversity debate will likely be the forcing of policy makers to
deal more realistically with intangible, nonuse values. That is the
kind of thing usually left to philosophers. And since such
intangibles are more immediately interesting to the citizens of
affluent countries than to the largely poor custodians of tropical
``hot spots'' of biodiversity, the lesson's starting point is that
there are no free rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, species preservation comes down to tradeoffs _ in
deciding how much we are willing to sacrifice in the name of
preserving natural habitats,'' concluded Martin Weitzman, an
economist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, economists assume that the keys to
everything, from more effective drugs to more nutritious,
disease-resistant crops, are secreted in tropical forests. Why,
then, isn't the repository for these natural wonders valued
accordingly?
</P>
<P>
   What counts, Simpson said, is scarcity. And while there may be
millions of potentially useful species, there is also vast
biochemical redundancy in the environment. Thus the value of any
acre is limited by the fact that an identical species probably
grows on thousands of other acres, and that many of the useful
chemicals will show up in hundreds or even thousands of species.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution decreed, after all, that both coffee and tea contain
caffeine as a defense against predators. And where naturally
occurring chemicals are extremely rare, the value of looking for
them is offset by the high cost of such a task.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Roger Sedjo and John Reid, his colleagues at
Resources for the Future, estimated the potential value of
preservation in 18 biodiversity hot spots around the world. And
while their figures are necessarily crude _ extrapolating from
useful new chemicals found in exotic environments and the cost of
developing drugs from them _ they are deliberately designed to err
on the high side.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate value of undiscovered species might be,
the three researchers calculate that the current bioprospecting
rights for pharmaceuticals are worth a maximum of $8 an acre in
western Ecuador to $2 an acre in the Philippines to a mere 40 cents
an acre in the eastern Himalayas. That may be enough to justify
biosurveys, but hardly counters pressure for other uses like
grazing or gathering firewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' Simpson said, ``exaggerated claims of the
pharmaceutical companies' willingness to pay to preserve exotic
environments has been counterproductive,'' as poor countries balk
at what they view as efforts to claim their natural treasures for a
song.
</P>
<P>
   In the stalemate, rain forests continue to be destroyed by
farmers and prospectors seeking short-term gains.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean biodiversity has little value, said Robert
Stavins, an environmental economist at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard. But it implies that ``the lion's share of
the value is intangible,'' Stavins said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, what can economists contribute to the debate? For
one, they can help a society sort through its priorities by looking
at what people are willing to pay to support those values. The
evidence is that public policy toward endangered species reflects
only the narrowest of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In research to be published this summer in the Journal of
Economic Perspectives, Weitzman and Andrew Metrick, a Harvard
colleague, look for the priorities reflected by the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service's spending to protect 142 invertebrate
species that are listed as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect that the biological distinctiveness of a
species would increase its standing. So ought the probability that
intervention would preserve the species. Last but hardly least is
cost: With limited funds, priorities should reflect the resources
needed to keep the species intact.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Metrick-Weitzman analysis shows that the more
endangered a species is, the less money is spent to preserve it.
And the higher the cost of preserving a species in terms of
dislocating economic activities, the higher the priority the
species gets.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic uniqueness seems to play little or no role in priority.
Think of the northern spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to count most in determining spending priorities are
size (the bigger the better) and taxonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Mammals and birds, which economists dub ``charismatic
megafauna,'' are popular with preservationists, while amphibians
and fish go to the rear of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Stavins put it more plainly. The species we defend most
aggressively, he said, are ``warm and cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   That may worry biologists who are concerned about the potential
disappearance of broad categories of plants and smaller animals
that help knit healthy ecosystems. But the focus on fur balls may
or may not bother taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have no business telling people what they should
value, Weitzman argued, but they have plenty to contribute on the
subject of rationality.
</P>
<P>
   If we are committed to biodiversity, economists can help make
the cost-benefit calculations critical to obtaining the most bang
for a buck. And they can help people to think seriously about how
to provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' Mr. Weitzman said, ``then we should be honest about
our desire to have charismatic megafauna effects dominate our
decisions.''

COMMENTARY: PLEA-BARGAIN FOR MERCY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's how to plea-bargain us all out of the whole ordeal:
</P>
<P>
   1. President Clinton concedes that he had consensual sexual
relations with Monica Lewinsky, as intimated by her former lawyer,
William Ginsburg, and resigns.
</P>
<P>
   2. Vice President Gore becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   3. Republicans agree that President Gore, in his first speech to
the country, does not have to say ``Our long national nightmare is
over,'' but only that ``Our incredibly complicated national bad
dream is now in abeyance.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Prosecutor Kenneth Starr agrees not to seek a 15-year prison
term for Clinton for lying about his activities with Ms. Lewinsky.
In a statement to the court, Starr will concede that a gentleman
must inevitably lie about such matters, but prove, by citing
appropriate precedents, that the president of the United States has
a constitutional duty not to be a gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   5. Starr will also be permitted to send a stern note home to
Mrs. Clinton about her husband's behavior, but only if he can
compose such a note at a cost of less than $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. This note may suggest, but may not require, that Mrs. Clinton
make Clinton write, 1,000 times on a yellow legal pad, ``I will
never again fib to a special prosecutor, or any lawyer earning more
than $300 per billable hour, about my sexual activities, whether
consensual or accidental.''
</P>
<P>
   7. Simultaneously with the president's resignation, Starr will
submit a written apology to the public for pretending that he was
not ``out to get Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   8. This apology will not include, as Clinton's lawyers demanded,
an admission that Starr's unctuous behavior grievously misled the
public about his personality since, when fooling around after
hours, Starr often abandoned his sanctimonious style and told
politically incorrect and raucous, if not bawdy, jokes.
</P>
<P>
   9. A distinguished group of 20 investigative reporters will
conduct a three-day seminar on C-Span to help the public understand
what Whitewater was about.
</P>
<P>
   10. The public will be asked to contribute to a so-called South
Seas Fund, the purpose of which will be to finance construction, on
an atoll south of Tahiti, of a $10 million house with sauna and
swimming pool. This will be presented to Paula Jones as a gift from
the nation, with the understanding that if she returns to America a
special prosecutor will be appointed with power to find legal
justification for putting her in jail.
</P>
<P>
   11. To show what can happen to people who vex special
prosecutors, Starr will be permitted to have Susan McDougal
televised wearing an orange jailbird suit while breaking stones in
a chain gang. Should Ms. McDougal, however, agree to say ''yes''
whenever asked if Clinton is a shady character, Starr will request
that the warden let her wear a less gaudy jailbird suit, possibly
something in teal blue.
</P>
<P>
   12. Linda Tripp will be restored to the White House job she held
before Clinton people transferred her to the Pentagon. Concurrently
with said transfer, she will be provided with a food-taster to
accompany her whenever she dines in the White House mess.
</P>
<P>
   13. Hillary Clinton will appear on NBC's ``Today'' show to say
she was completely wrong when she said her husband was the victim
of ``a vast right-wing conspiracy'' to destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   14. On the evening after Mrs. Clinton's breakfast-show
appearance, Starr will appear on David Letterman's show and, if
asked, will state his belief that the mysteriously missing Rose Law
Firm documents, which Mrs. Clinton couldn't find in Arkansas,
turned up _ amazingly enough _ in the White House parlor only
because they were transported there from Arkansas by an evil
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   15. Should Letterman roll on the floor laughing, or offer Starr
a good bargain on the Brooklyn Bridge, Starr agrees, nevertheless,
to maintain an expression of sober and sincere credulity until
Letterman's next commercial break.
</P>
<P>
   16. All parties agree to sign a declaration of repentance for
encumbering the public with squalor, vulgarity and eleventh-rate
politics and for insisting that their show was not totally
inconsequential to the destiny of the republic.
</P>

ALCATEL TO BUY GEAR MAKER IN STOCK DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alcatel Alsthom of France, one of the world's largest makers of
telecommunications equipment, enhanced its position in the United
States Thursday with the announcement of its acquisition of DSC
Communications Corp. for $4.4 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   DSC is the second medium-sized telecommunications-equipment
company in two days to agree to a takeover. Ciena Corp. agreed on
Wednesday to be acquired by Tellabs Inc. for $7.1 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation has been one of the major themes for the last few
years among companies that sell telecommunications services. Now
the merger wave is spreading into companies that manufacture the
complex electronic gear that actually allows sophisticated
communications networks to function.
</P>
<P>
   Many big telecommunications carriers do not enjoy dealing with
dozens of suppliers and are looking to vendors that can provide a
broad range of equipment. The equipment makers are trying to
oblige.
</P>
<P>
   A big difference between the Ciena and DSC deals is that Ciena
is a young, fast-growing company that is looking for heft to
compete against industry giants like Northern Telecom of Canada and
Lucent Technologies Inc., while DSC is an older company that has
stumbled recently and whose chairman has already announced plans to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   But for Alcatel, acquiring DSC gives the company a larger
presence in the U.S. market. Alcatel sold $14.1 billion worth of
telecommunications gear last year but only $1.5 billion of those
sales were in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Alcatel's sales in the United States are of transmission
equipment that allows long-distance carriers to send information
down fiber-optic pipelines at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   DSC had sales of $1.6 billion last year, largely of equipment
that switches phone calls from one circuit to another and of gear
that helps local phone companies deploy digital technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's world, if you want to be a worldwide player in
telecommunications, you have to have a presence in the United
States,'' Serge Tchuruk, Alcatel's chairman, said in a phone
interview. ``It is a country that in some respects leads the way in
the big revenue shift from so-called narrowband to broadband: data
and Internet and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel's strong desire to increase its presence in the United
States was reflected in the large premium the company agreed to pay
for DSC's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, DSC's stockholders will receive
0.815 of an Alcatel American depository receipt for each share of
DSC stock.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel's ADRs closed on Wednesday, before the deal was
announced, at $43.4375 on the New York Stock Exchange. That made
the deal worth about $35.40 for each share of DSC.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of DSC closed Wednesday at $19.6875 in Nasdaq trading,
meaning that Alcatel paid a premium of about 80 percent for control
of DSC.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel will also assume DSC's net debt of $40 million. DSC will
be merged into Alcatel's U.S. telecommunications subsidiary. Krish
Prabhu, chief executive of that operation, will become president
and chief executive of the combined unit. In April, James Donald,
DSC's chairman, announced that he would retire soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, DSC's shares rose by nearly 40 percent, or $7.8125,
to $27.50, while Alcatel's ADRs fell by $4.3125, to $39.125, on
fears that Alcatel had paid too much for DSC.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was `My God, that's a lot of money they're
paying for it,''' said Sean Faughnan, who follows Alcatel for J.P.
Morgan Securities in London. ``Then when I did some of the number
crunching, it didn't look so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald declined to be interviewed. But in a statement he said,
``This transaction provides increased value to DSC's
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel paid a large premium for DSC, but DSC would have been
much more expensive just a few years ago _ when its stock briefly
traded above $60 in the fall of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But since then DSC has disappointed investors. According to
First Call, which tracks analysts' forecasts, DSC posted operating
earnings discounting one-time charges and credits of $1.63 a share
in 1995. That figure fell to 44 cents in 1996 before rebounding a
bit to 85 cents last year. Analysts polled by the firm forecast
that the company would record a loss of 7 cents this year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute much of the blame to DSC's management, saying
that the company failed to adequately develop new products to
remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``DSC was a franchise that had some assets that were fairly
valuable,'' said Steven Levy, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
``It's going to require new management and a much more focused
management in terms of new product generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel is experienced in turnarounds. The company lost $5.4
billion in 1995 before cutting 10,000 jobs and returning to
profitability the following year.
</P>
<P>
   DSC was advised by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. Alcatel was advised by
Lehman Brothers. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz was counsel for
DSC. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom was counsel for Alcatel.

A REDEDICATED SELES SENDS HINGIS PACKING 
</HEADLINE>
 (ja) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ This was no screeching apparition in black scaring the
world's top player, Martina Hingis, half out of her wits on the
French Open's center court in what turned out to be a one-sided
semifinal that sent a clear message on a hazy afternoon at Roland
Garros.
</P>
<P>
   This was Monica Seles, her stakes raised and her mind at peace
following the devastating loss of her father-coach, Karolj, to
cancer 10 days before this Grand Slam began. This was a version of
Seles not seen since she was, like Hingis, a teen-ager on top of
the world, a teen-ager who had no inkling she would someday be
stabbed in the back by a deranged German fan of her chief rival,
Steffi Graf, and no inkling that her father would be stricken with
cancer just when she was ready to return to the game they both
loved.
</P>
<P>
   With a ferocity that proved her promise to recommit herself to
tennis was no idle threat, Seles dismantled Hingis, the precocious
performer who had beaten her in all five prior meetings, including
one right here in this round a year ago. The 24-year-old Seles
unveiled a pulverizing display of whiplash playmaking along with a
take-no-prisoners resolve in delivering the stunned Swiss teen-ager
a 6-3, 6-2 throttling that spoiled Hingis' hope of winning a fourth
consecutive slam in the only slam she hasn't yet conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess she surprised everybody,'' said Hingis, who buried her
stricken face in a towel on the last changeover, far from normal
behavior for her. ``She just played a great match today, just let
me run and didn't make any mistakes: I mean, she's been around for
a quite a while, and then all of a sudden she was gone for almost
four years, and here she is back, in better shape, probably better
than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, this slam final will be teen-ager-less for a change, a
battle of hardened veterans between Seles and Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario who share five French Open titles between them, including
the 6-2, 6-4 finale in 1991 when Seles defeated Sanchez Vicario to
win the second of three consecutive titles here.
</P>
<P>
   Guaranteeing this slam a Spanish finalist and possibly a Spanish
champion in both the men's and women's singles events, Sanchez
Vicario bobbed and weaved her way into a final-round duel with
Seles by thoroughly outhustling second-seeded Lindsay Davenport,
6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ashamed of anything,'' said Davenport, an Olympic gold
medalist who has yet to reach a slam final and made 56 unforced
errors in this semifinal, ``but I didn't play great today. I guess
I beat myself, but she kind of forced it on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario, who won this title at 17 in 1989 and collected
it again in 1994, trails Seles by 14-2 in a rivalry that began
nearly 10 years ago and has favored Seles all three times they have
met on clay.
</P>
<P>
   Though Thursday's match-up between Seles and Hingis, who at 16
became the youngest No. 1 player in the sport's history just over a
year ago, seemed slanted toward the teen-ager, Seles revved up her
play to a level even Hingis, ever a quick study on-court, couldn't
match. Hingis later admitted it was a level she had not yet seen at
this tournament; Seles called it a level that only hints at the
heights she plans, in the next five years, to attain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to come out and be really aggressive today, and I
knew I had that in me,'' said Seles, whose rapier returns trapped
Hingis behind the baseline and led to the Swiss losing her serve
five times, notably the last games of both sets. ``I wasn't sure if
I could do that today, but I expected this of myself, and to do it
against the best-ranked player who has been really dominating is
good for me to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into this tournament I really wasn't that confident in
my game, but in a weird way, I had a peace of mind,'' Seles said.
</P>
<P>
   She had practiced briefly on May 15, the day after her father
died, just to remind herself that tennis, and this imminent slam,
might provide her best vehicle for getting on with her life exactly
the way her father had advised her to. On impulse, she hopped a
plane for Paris along with her mother, Ester, and toy terrier,
Ariel, a week after her father died.
</P>
<P>
   ``After deciding that I'm going to play,'' Seles said Thursday,
``I felt really content with the decision. That helped, because in
the last two years, I was never really content with any decision I
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles knew her father felt guilty when she skipped events, like
this year's Australian Open, in order to be with him. ``But when I
walked out the door to go and play tournaments, I felt guilty for
leaving him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Seles was precisely where she wanted to be, on center
stage, playing precisely the game she wanted to play: hardball. She
closed out the match with a wicked backhand passing shot at break
and match point.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, the owner of nine slam singles crowns, has left herself
just one victory short of making a consummate comeback, here at the
same slam where she won her first major in 1990. Seles is wearing
her father's wedding ring on a necklace because she felt it would
be a way to keep him close to her, but she denied that she's
playing this slam in memory of him or dedicating it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss him tremendously, but win or lose, it doesn't make a
difference in me thinking about my dad or not thinking about him,''
Seles said. ``And it's not the same as it was before the stabbing,
but it never will be. And I don't want it to be.''

RUSSIA CUTS INTEREST RATES IN SIGN THAT STABILITY IS RETURNING

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia slashed its sky-high interest rates Thursday in
a further sign that calm was returning to its financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank raised interest rates, to 150 from 50 percent,
last week in a drastic move to defend the ruble. But Thursday the
bank reduced the rate, to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only sign that the government was making
progress. Yields on treasury bills continued to fall. And the new
head of Russia's tax service promised to raise badly needed revenue
by auditing the accounts of 1,000 prominent Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a pervasive sense among investors and Russian
officials that the nation's financial problems are deep-seated and
that restoring the confidence of foreign investors will be a
prolonged and difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is groaning under a mountain of debt, and its interest
rates are still very high compared to inflation, which is running
under 10 percent, according to new estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign investors are counting on the creation of a
multi-billion-dollar reserve to help prop by the ruble. Organized
by the International Monetary Fund, it would provide the Central
Bank with a line of credit if its reserves ran low.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the expectation that such a IMF reserve will be created
over the next several weeks is one reason Russia's financial
markets have become more stable.
</P>
<P>
   Western and Russian officials have continued to discuss such a
reserve, which could be $10 billion. At the same time, however,
some Russian officials have sought to demonstrate that the economic
situation is under control by declaring that emergency financial
assistance will not be needed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Putting on a brave face, Russian Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadornov suggested that Russia could get by cutting its budget
deficit and raising financing through Eurobonds.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sold a $1.25 Eurobond issue on Wednesday, though the
price was reduced compared with other debt. Zadornov said that the
government planned to sell two additional dollar-denominated
Europeans this year.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has made similar comments,
though he has previously talked about the need for more IMF
assistance. He also dispatched a top-level Russian delegation to
Washington last week to seek U.S. support for expanded IMF aid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian officials continued their public campaign to
highlight their reforms and mollify foreign investors. Kiriyenko
pressed his case in Paris during a previously scheduled visit.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin is expected to strike the same theme
when he visit Germany early next week, also on a previously
scheduled visit. Meanwhile, Yeltsin plans to use his weekly radio
address Friday to try to reassure the Russian public.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in interest rates was announced by the Central
Bank this evening. Known as a refinancing rate, it represents the
rate at which the Central Bank provides rubles to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the yields of treasury bills continued to fall. The
Russian government had raised the rates on treasury bill to more
than 80 percent last week to prevent investors from dumping their
securities and exchanging their rubles for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the yield on the treasury bills fell to about 45
percent, as some investors returned to the market. The yield was 30
percent before the latest financial crisis and hovered around 20
percent in November.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial markets are operating ``smoothly and
reliably,'' Kiriyenko said Thursday.

LUKAS GOES FOR ANOTHER JEWEL IN HIS CROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBBIE ARRINGTON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. Just in case anyone forgot, trainer D. Wayne Lukas
wore a new baseball cap to his barn Thursday morning, inscribed
with ``10 Crowns.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how many Triple Crown races Lukas has won, including six
in a row starting with the 1994 Preakness. He's got three Kentucky
Derbies and three Belmonts in his string. And Saturday, he will be
looking for one more classic.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas entered two fresh horses Grand Slam and Yarrow Brae in the
Belmont Stakes in an attempt to block Real Quiet's quest for a
Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   While trainer Bob Baffert and Real Quiet have captured racing's
spotlight, Lukas has stood casually by, taking it all in. A Peb
cartoon in the Daily Racing Form this week portrayed Real Quiet,
Baffert and owner Mike Pegram in bed, hiding under the covers, as
Lukas howled. The caption read: ``Watch out - the spook is back!''
Said Lukas, ``I liked that a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand Slam has the best credentials in the race,'' Lukas said
of this Gone West colt. ``I may be a party of one, but I think he
was the best 2-year-old in the country last year. He's got the best
pedigree of his class. He's a track and stakes record holder, a
multiple Grade I winner and he's undefeated on this track.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got Jerry Bailey for a rider; he's King Kong in New
York,'' Lukas added. Bailey is winning here with 42 percent of his
mounts. ``And his trainer has won three Belmonts.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem: Grand Slam is coming back from a devastating
injury, suffered in last November's Breeders' Cup Juvenile at
Hollywood Park. In that race, the Baffert-trained Johnbill
repeatedly clipped Grand Slam's back leg, ripping the flesh from
hock to ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like someone had torn the skin all the way down
around his hoof like a sock,'' said Lukas. ``The tendons were
hanging out. I had never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wayne Ilwraith, operating at the Cypress Equine Medical
Clinic, performed two hours of surgery to reconstruct Grand Slam's
leg. Some 290 stitches were needed to mend the wound.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Grand Slam had to stay standing for two months, tied
up by wires in his stall to keep him on his feet. But after 60 days
of healing, he managed to tear the wound completely open again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried when I saw it,'' said Lukas. ``I couldn't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, a team of veterinarians decided to hack off the old
skin and muscle and try a different technique. ``They gave me
absolutely no hope of the horse ever racing again,'' added Lukas.
``But then, vets and doctors tend to be pessimists, so if the
surgery works, they look like heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a miracle making it to the post parade,'' he
continued. ``But now, I'm not worried about the injury at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam failed in his first comeback attempt at Santa Anita
this spring, but has blossomed anew at Belmont, winning the Peter
Pan Stakes May 24. Coming back only 13 days later in the 1-{-mile
Belmont will prove a tough test, admitted Lukas. ``Win or lose, I
still think I have the best horse.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Yarrow Brae has raced in the shadow of another
Lukas 3-year-old, Cape Town, who broke a leg in the Preakness and
has been retired. Yarrow Brae comes off a win in the Illinois
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very nice horse, too,'' said Lukas. ``If you want some
coffee money, put a show bet on him. He'll surprise you.''

   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican authorities, who at first complained they
knew nothing about a U.S. money-laundering sting operation against
Mexican bankers, now concede they were told about it more than two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even though at least some people in the Mexican attorney
general's office knew, authorization for undercover activities by
U.S. agents in Mexico was never approved, the agency said in a
statement released late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The concession came as a team of U.S. Customs Service officials
met with Mexican officials to talk about the three-year sting,
which ended last month with the arrests of more than 100 people,
including at least 22 Mexican bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over Operation Casablanca _ in which the banking
officials were lured to the United States and charged _ prompted
President Ernesto Zedillo to call for an investigation into the
activities of U.S. agents operating in Mexico without knowledge or
permission of the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Rosario Green presented American Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on Monday with a list of Mexican laws the
Customs agents had violated.
</P>
<P>
   Green has said that Mexico would file charges and seek the
extradition of the Customs agents who operated across the border
without permission.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said it
was premature to talk of extradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are jumping ahead. The first thing that has to be
done before you extradite is to determine whether there is a basis
for filing charges, and whether charges will be filed,'' Reno told
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury Department confirmed that
Customs agents met here with representatives of the Mexican
attorney general's office, treasury department and foreign ministry
to talk about Operation Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a law enforcement technical team informing them of
the specifics of the indictments,'' the spokeswoman said by
telephone. ``They agreed to further meetings and an exchange of
information on Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   During the operation, Customs agents masqueraded as drug sellers
with money to launder. The Mexican bankers who were charged
allegedly were willing to participate in money-laundering schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers were lured to Nevada on the promise of attending the
opening of a gambling casino last month and were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican attorney general's office said in its statement that
a former assistant attorney general for international affairs had
admitted that three Customs officials visited him in January 1996
to tell him of the developing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rafael Estrada Sarnano (told) Attorney General Jorge Madrazo
Cuellar ... that he definitely remembers having met with (U.S.
Customs service officials in Mexico) who informed him of a money
laundering scheme in Mexican banks in the states of Sonora and Baja
California,'' the communique stated.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada worked under former Attorney General Antonio Lozano
Gracia, who was fired by Zedillo in December 1996. Estrada said he
told Lozano of the meeting with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano told a news conference Thursday that the visit was
informal and that the Customs agents spoke only in generalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't notify anything of concrete dates, nor locations
nor people,'' Lozano said. ``It was simply a conversation in
general.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the nature of substance of the conversation, the
attorney general's office said Mexico did not approve undercover
activities by foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can in no way be considered as an authorization or
validation for informants or undercover witnesses in the service of
the United States government ... to have conducted activities on
(Mexican ) soil,'' the agency said.

ADVERTISING: BROADWAY THEATERS TRY UNIFIED APPROACH TO MASS
MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although the current Broadway season formally ends
with the Tony Awards on Sunday evening, the theater industry's
efforts to market itself will actually be stepped up immediately
afterward, with the debut next week of a ``Live Broadway'' platinum
Visa credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion is the latest installment of an effort by the
League of American Theaters and Producers to stimulate demand
nationwide for live theater and, essentially, establish
``Broadway'' as a highly visible brand. The card will be offered
jointly by the league, which is the trade group for Broadway
productions in New York and throughout North America, and First USA
Bank, a subsidiary of Banc One Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Continental Airlines signed up as the league's first
national corporate sponsor, paying a reported $750,000 annually in
cash and services over five years.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Schweppes became the league's second corporate
sponsor. Gerald Johnson, director of promotions for Dr Pepper/Seven
Up Inc., which is a division of Cadbury Schweppes PLC, said that
the company had struck a one-year deal for an unspecified sum, with
the possibility of an extension, to make Schweppes ``the exclusive
tonic and mixer of Live Broadway.'' Live Broadway is the league's
official logo, developed by Landor Associates, the corporate
identity firm, and introduced last year to heighten public
awareness of the Broadway stage.
</P>
<P>
   Schweppes will run a supermarket sweepstakes this summer
featuring a prize trip to New York that includes Broadway tickets.
It will also put the Live Broadway logo on its packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of all these initiatives, said Jed Bernstein, the
league's executive director, ``is to return Broadway to its place
on the mainstream entertainment menu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadway is one of the greatest untouched marketing platforms
for Corporate America,'' he said. ``If a sponsor tries to get
involved in any sport now, the price of entry is very high because
it's a crowded stage. But Broadway has done little in this area,
and we're creating a very efficient way for corporations to take
advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meg Meurer, the league's director of marketing and new business
development, said Broadway productions _ performed either on the
New York stage or in theaters around the country that are league
members _ faced stiff competition from all forms of entertainment,
including sports events, concerts, video games and even the
Internet. The league's goal, she said, is to make Broadway theater
``the most upscale form of mass entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by Research International, a
division of WPP Group PLC, the average Broadway theatergoer in New
York is 41 years old, well educated and affluent, with an annual
household income of $91,000. Slightly more than half of these
theatergoers live in the New York area, while the rest are
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   First USA finds the league's audience attractive, said Stu
Upson, senior vice president for sports and entertainment
marketing, because ``it's loyal and the demographics are good.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Next week First USA will send out its first direct mail for the
Live Broadway credit card to more than a million people culled from
lists provided by the league's 500 members in 90 cities. The card,
which will give holders points toward Broadway tickets, backstage
tours and memorabilia, will also be promoted through telemarketing
and in places like the new Times Square Visitors Center, which will
open in August and contain a league box office.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Meurer and Bernstein, the league is seeking
additional sponsors in three categories _ automotive, financial
services and telecommunications. Bernstein said it had already
raised some $10 million in cash, merchandise and media donated by
sponsors and promotional partners, which also support its toll-free
information line.
</P>
<P>
   Theater industry executives and observers generally applauded
these initiatives. George Wachtel, a New York-based arts consultant
who previously was the league's director of research, deemed the
sponsorships ``helpful in a business where Broadway shows can't
afford to sell theatergoing as a life style.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Viertel, the producer of ``The Sound of Music,'' ``Smokey
Joe's Cafe'' and ``Forever Tango,'' and a member of the league's
executive committee, said he believed the league was successfully
addressing the problem of ``promoting Broadway as an idea when each
of us has a vastly different product.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Erlick, a consultant in New York who advised the league on
its First USA project, suggested that the theater industry
``traditionally has been fractionalized, with independent,
competitive producers doing their own branding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The league's programs create a hook for it to break through
the clutter more convincingly than individual producers can on
their own,'' he said. ``It gives them greater marquee value, more
of a pedigree.''

   REVAMP-PROPOSAL (Los Angeles) _ Saying the public is demanding
``closer-to-home local governance,'' San Fernando Valley civic

REAL QUIET DRAWS POST NO. 8
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBBIE ARRINGTON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT,N.Y. _ Real Quiet will meet plenty of fresh-faced
opposition in Saturday's Belmont Stakes. On Thursday morning, the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness champion drew post No. 8 in a full
field of 13 for the last jewel in his Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Of the opposition, only two - Victory Gallop and Basic Trainee -
ran in both prior races. Derby runners-up Chilito, a last-minute
addition to the Belmont cast, Parade Ground and Hanuman Highway are
back after a breather. Preakness also-rans Classic Cat and Hot
Wells will try to silence Real Quiet's thunder again, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the five newcomers may have the best chance of upsetting
Real Quiet, a 6-5 favorite to become the first Triple Crown
champion in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from the opinion that if Real Quiet gets beat, it will
come from a new horse,'' said trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who will
saddle highly regarded Grand Slam and Yarrow Brae for the Belmont.
``But I'm a terrible handicapper.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jo and Raffie's Majesty both look like distance horses,
say their connections, and have been pointed to this 1-{-mile
marathon for months. Limit Out is a highly regarded sprinter who
will try to carry his speed past a mile.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 11 Triple Crown champions has ever had to beat more
than seven rivals for their place in racing history. Of the 13
Derby-Preakness winners who failed in the Belmont, only Canonero II
in 1971 had to run against 12 opponents; he finished fourth to 34-1
long shot Pass Catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont Park officials stuck with tradition instead of following
ESPN's urging for a controversial NBA-style draw/draft used for the
Derby and Preakness. ``Suddenly, the draw has become brain
surgery,'' said Hank Greenberg of ESPN. ``So, we'll do it the
old-fahsioned way.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet's post was the last picked. If the Belmont had
followed the same draw format as the Derby and Preakness, he would
have been stuck with post No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet's trainer Bob Baffert, who is 0-for-7 at this track,
seemed pleased being behind the eight ball. ``My main concern right
now is leaving New York 1-for-8,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five horses have won from post No. 8 before; post No. 1 with 22
winners has a distinctive edge in the Belmont history book.
</P>
<P>
   BELMONT NOTEBOOK
</P>
<P>
   ICE THOSE SILVER BULLETS: Mike Pegram, Real Quiet's
beer-and-burger-loving owner, has become as well known for his
eating habits as his horse. While out for dinner Wednesday night
with Baffert at a Manhattan steakhouse, their waiter immediately
recognized the pair and brought Pegram an ice bucket packed with
eight Coors Lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like having my own private cooler,'' said Pegram.
``People don't only know my name, but they give me what I want
before I even ask for it.''
</P>
<P>
   TRIPLE CROWN COOKIES: Back at the barn Thursday morning,
entrepreneur Tara Dalrymple gave Baffert several tins of special
Triple Crown Cookies, baked by her Ocala, Fla.-based Saratoga South
Cookie Company. The Derby mint cookie is laced with bourbon; the
Preakness chocolate-chip is topped with a sugar Black-Eyed Susan;
and the Belmont oatmeal cookie is crowned with a chocolate horse.
Dalrymple also sells cookies named after three Baffert-trained
horses: Silver Charm, Anet and Semoran.
</P>
<P>
   While finishing a TV interview, Baffert handed the bag of
goodies to a security guard with these instructions: ``If anyone
goes for that bag, shoot 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   BELMONT A BREEZE?: The Derby has its Mint Julep and Belmont
officials want an official drink for their classic race, too. For
Thursday's breakfast, they mixed up a big batch of Belmont Breeze:
Seagram's whiskey, Harvey's Bristol Cream sherry, a dash of sweet
and sour, cranberry and orange juices, club soda and 7-Up. Created
by Manhattan's famed Rainbow Room, the Belmont Breeze is served in
a tall glass over ice with mint and a twist of lemon. Few tasters
thought it would replace Long Island Iced Tea.

     TOBACCO BILL THREATENED BY PARTISAN WRANGLING
 &HT;     By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Sen. John McCain watched with mounting anxiety,
the Senate erupted into partisan posturing Thursday that could doom
passage of a comprehensive tobacco bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening now is what I feared would happen to this
bill. It is starting to get very partisan,'' said McCain, R-Ariz.,
chief sponsor of the $516 billion measure. ``A lot of things are
being said that are not necessarily helpful to the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate action has been delayed a week as both parties jockeyed
over a proposal by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, _ a tobacco bill
opponent _ to use roughly $50 billion to reduce the so-called
``marriage penalty'' in which couples with roughly equal incomes
pay higher taxes than they would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the amendment lay the larger question of whether the
Senate was prepared to pass a bill that envisions a broad expansion
of federal regulatory powers over tobacco financed by a
$1.10-a-pack increase in cigarette prices.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties began playing their political cards Thursday,
trading accusations that could become campaign fodder this fall if
the tobacco bill fails.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., set off the verbal volley
by offering a petition _ likely to be voted on Tuesday _ to force a
vote on whether to finish the bill next week. Daschle admitted
Democrats probably won't be able to get the 60 votes needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to this: do you want to pass a tobacco
bill or not? And we're getting a resounding `no' '' from the
Republicans. ``They don't want a tobacco bill,'' Daschle said,
arguing that the GOP strategy was to delay the bill until Congress
ran out of time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., accused Democrats of trying
to load the bill with expensive government programs they knew
Congress would reject.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a bill, this (cloture petition) is a good step
toward having nothing happen because this sours the well,'' Lott
said. ``Do you want a bill or do you want an issue? Do you want to
do something about this problem, or do you want to play games?''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the Senate rejected, 29-66, Lott's motion to kill
an amendment by Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., to impose stiffer
targets on reducing teen smoking and to penalize individual
manufacturers, rather than the industry in general, if the targets
were not met.
</P>
<P>
   After the motion was rejected, Lott _ who had earlier said the
Durbin amendment would kill the bill _ moved to accept it by voice
vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain described action on the Durbin amendment as ``just
another vote,'' and predicted the major decisions about the bill
would be made in a future House-Senate conference committee.

SHUTTLE ARRIVES AT MIR TO RETRIEVE AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The American astronaut Andrew Thomas
officially ended his 130-day mission aboard the Russian space
station Mir on Thursday when the shuttle Discovery arrived to pick
him up.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member crew of the shuttle will be the last from the
United States to dock at Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a 46-year-old mechanical engineer born in Australia,
said he was thrilled to look out the Mir window and see ``a bright
point of light across on the horizon, which I knew to be the
shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery will remain docked until Monday to deliver food,
water, personal items and technical equipment for two Russian
astronauts who will remain aboard the station until August. The
combined crews hauled the first of the supplies, including several
100-pound bags of water, into the space station Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The mission wraps up the first phase of NASA's international
space-station program. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration paid Russia $400 million so that seven astronauts
could spend time learning how to live and work on Mir.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of the program is the construction of a $40
billion orbiting outpost, and the first assembly flights for that
are scheduled for November and December.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle completed its ninth and final rendezvous with Mir at
12:58 p.m. EDT as the two spacecraft soared 239 miles above
Russia's border with Kazakhstan, northwest of the Caspian Sea.
Discovery is the third of NASA's four shuttles to visit Mir.
</P>
<P>
   A problem with Discovery's television antenna kept the shuttle
crew from beaming down crisp, colorful coverage of the historic
linkup, but the Mir crew stepped in with a hand-held camera to
relay views through Russia's little-used Altair
communications-satellite system. Later, they sent fuzzy,
sepia-toned images of the hatch opening and initial greetings
through ground stations in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1986, the station has long outlived its five-year
design life. It has also survived several crises including a flash
fire and a collision with a cargo vessel last year.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery is expected to return to Earth on June 12.

SAYS IT MAY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT DRUG STING
</HEADLINE>
      AFTER WEEKS OF ANGRY WORDS, MEXICO NOW &HT;     By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After weeks of attacking the United States for
failing to notify it of a covert U.S. operation against drug-money
laundering, a top Mexican justice official now admits Mexico may
have had prior knowledge of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The admission comes on the heels of a threat Tuesday by Mexican
Foreign Minister Rosario Green to seek the extradition of U.S.
Customs agents so Mexico could prosecute them for participating in
undercover activities on Mexican soil.
</P>
<P>
   The agents' activities were part of ``Operation Casablanca,'' a
three-year investigation that was disclosed May 18 after U.S.
authorities arrested two dozen Mexican bankers and announced the
indictment of three top Mexican banks on money-laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government, which at first welcomed the indictments,
has for weeks repeatedly accused the United States of breaking
Mexican law and binational agreements that require disclosure of
information about drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday evening, however, Mexico's Attorney General
issued a statement that includes a different version of events _ as
told by American officials who were in Mexico on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, according to the statement, United States
Treasury Department and Justice representatives were in Mexico City
to brief Mexican officials on the Casablanca indictments.
</P>
<P>
   During the briefing, the U.S. officials told their Mexican
counterparts that on Jan. 16, 1996, two U.S. Customs agents met in
Mexico City with a man who was then Mexico's Deputy Attorney
General of International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans said that meeting's purpose with the deputy ``was
to inform him about the operation that later was named `Casablanca'
and ask for help,'' according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of their request for help to investigate a
money-laundering scheme, the Americans said that they never
received a response from Antonio Lozano Gracia (CQ), Mexico's
Attorney General at the time.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference on Thursday, Lozano Gracia said it was
``absolutely false'' that the Americans had asked for help or
disclosed that an investigation was underway in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He said the U.S. Customs agents in 1996 had an ``informal
conversation'' with one of his deputies about a laundering scheme
they had discovered that included hiding drug proceeds in trucks
and smuggling the money into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson in Washington had no
comment Thursday on the dispute over whether Mexico knew about an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only confirm there was a briefing in 1996,'' the
spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, United States authorities have said that Mexico had
not been informed of the Casablanca sting operation because of
concerns for the safety of U.S. agents.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a press conference in Washington on Thursday,
Attorney General Janet Reno said that it was ``premature'' to
discuss a threat to extradite U.S. Customs agents who had been sent
to Mexico as part of Operation Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the Mexican government does not assume guilt until it
has thoroughly investigated a matter,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important that we learn from all of this the
need to communicate very clearly and very carefully, and we will
continue to try to do that in every way that we can,'' Reno added.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican displeasure with Operation Casablanca may be on the
agenda when President Clinton meets Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo June 10 and 11 after the United Nations World Drug Summit
next week in New York.

STOCKS RALLY ON GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS; DOW UP 66.76 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market rebounded Thursday, as investors
were soothed by reports that the economy remains resilient and
merger activity is still vibrant.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 87.44 points,
heavy buying of blue-chip issues helped the Dow climb 66.76 points,
or about eight-tenths of a percent, to close at 8,870.56.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Broader measures were even stronger. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index gained 1.1 percent to close at 1,094.83 and the
Nasdaq composite soared 1.6 percent to 1,769.95. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's gain, though, still leaves most major stock indexes
far off their all-time highs. And Motorola's warning, after the
close of trading Thursday, that its second-quarter earnings would
probably not meet analysts' expectations may deal Wall Street a
still sharper blow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through a correction phase,'' said Hugh Johnson, a
market strategist at First Albany Corp. ``We're having some big up
and down days in a largely direction-less market.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Motorola's warning may be another sign that profit growth
is weakening this year, and that Asia remains a concern, the U.S.
economy continues to expand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, for instance, the Commerce Department said that
factory orders were brisk in April and that retail sales in May
were the strongest in more than four years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the shares of retail outlets like Wal-Mart, The Gap
and Circuit City were in heavy demand Thursday, sending shares of
those companies sharply higher. But investors were also keen on oil
and technology issues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oil shares climbed along with oil prices on expectations that
Saudi Arabia and other oil producing states would agree to reduce
oil production and thereby lift oil prices. When an agreement to
cut oil production by 450,000 barrels a day came Thursday, the
price of a barrel of oil rose 2 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications stocks also soared after Alcatel, the
Paris-based maker of telephone equipment, said it would acquire DSC
Communications Corp. of Plano, Texas, for about $4.4 billion in
stock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Tellabs Inc., another equipment maker, said it
would purchase Ciena Corp. for about $6.9 billion. That kind of
merger activity sent the shares of other telephone equipment and
networking stocks sharply higher Thursday on speculation that there
could be more telephone combinations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's gains come in the midst of a broader slump in the
stock market, one that had seen the Dow fall 4.4 percent from its
record high, posted May 13, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq drop
9.1 percent off its all-time high of 1,917.61, set April 22. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There has been a concern among investors that share prices got
ahead of corporate earnings prospects, that shares are vastly
over-priced and that inflation could increase this year because of
rising wage pressures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the counter-point, according to many analysts, has been a
near-perfect landscape of strong economic growth, low interest
rates a whirlwind of merger and acquisition activity, and an
apparently burning desire by people everywhere to buy and own
stocks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans are also witnessing the lowest unemployment rate in 25
years, and the prospect of the first federal budget surplus since
1969. And even if profit growth has slowed, many analysts and
investors are betting that profit growth will strengthen later this
year and into 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a seemingly perfect world, though, the debate is centering on
profits: will they or won't they climb ahead in the second part of
the year, after a sharp slowdown that saw just 2.5 percent growth
in the first quarter of 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``However you look at it, earnings growth has slowed sharply,''
said James Glassman, head of the U.S. research group at Chase
Securities. ``Equity analysts are expecting a strong second half of
the year with double-digit growth. But if that doesn't happen, I
don't know how the stock market's going to take it.''

WELFARE (Phoenix) - Thousands of Arizona's former welfare families
are walking away from free state health care benefits and no one is
sure why. While bureaucrats debate what to do, these former welfare
families are increasingly dependent on costly emergency room care
at taxpayers' expense _ even though most remain eligible for state
insurance coverage. Arizona is not alone. Arizona's welfare reform
began a year earlier than most states, but researchers already are
tracking this unexpected impact nationwide. By PAT KOSSAN. Story

 &QL; 
PEYOTE (Phoenix) - A Kearny man, who claimed he possessed the
hallucinogen drug peyote for religious purposes, actually used it

confiscated drug returned to him, a judge ruled this week. By JUDI
VILLA. Story would move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LOGCABINS (Phoenix) _ President Lincoln lived in one, and Gen.
Ulysses S. Grant directed the last campaigns of the Civil War from
another. Log cabins are part of the American consciousness. But now
they are crumbling. On Thursday, the National Park Service
announced a public-private partnership to save more than 400 log
structures, beginning with the Gatekeeper's Cabin on the North Rim
of the Grand Canyon. The cabin will be restored to its original
appearance using tools, material and techniques from a bygone era.

and then deprive him of a comic outlet is a mistake. By BOB

PERFECT-MOVIES (Undated) - Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow - In
``A Perfect Murder,'' director Andrew Davis tries to remake

and ups the stakes. By BOB FENSTER. 2 stars. Story will move in the

WILDE-MOVIES (Undated) - Stephen Fry, Jude Law, Jennifer Ehle -
Oscar Wilde had a million of them: witty epigrams that set British

FILM MAY NOT SATISFY FANS OF WILDE'S CERE BRAL WIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - ``The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong
passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this world, there are only two tragedies. One is not
getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Wilde had a million of them: witty epigrams that set
British society abuzz at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde,'' the biopic about the Irish writer who was the
cleverest man of his generation and the most scandalous, offers us
but a taste of Wilde's genius.
</P>
<P>
   It's like drinking from the fountain of wisdom but getting only
a sip.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the movie concentrates on Wilde's discovery of his
homosexuality and his destruction through the hypocrisy of English
society and the excesses of the man he loved.
</P>
<P>
   We first meet Wilde (Stephen Fry) when he comes off the lecture
tour of America and prepares to marry a proper Englishwoman
(Jennifer Ehle) so that he may always have a ready audience.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde fathers two sons, only to discover late in life that his
true nature is homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his confusion can be traced to the structure of
upper-class British society at that time: The proper intellectual
gentleman was expected to enjoy primarily the company of other men.
Women lived their quiet lives in back rooms, brought out and
dressed for formal occasions only.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde, who believes that pleasure is the best teacher, rushes
forward into London's underground homosexual society, while
maintaining the facade of his family life.
</P>
<P>
   Then he meets the young Lord Douglas (Jude Law), with whom he
falls in love, even though he knows it's an act of
self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is a social rebel, at war with his tyrannical father.
The younger man's outrageous behavior threatens to disgrace Wilde
and entangle him with a legal system that abhors homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a man born ahead of his time, it's Wilde. His
actions now would cause no scandals, if they were even noticed.
Instead, his proclivities would ensure his stature within high
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde'' features a first-rate performance by Fry, best known
for playing the imperturbable butler in the British TV series
``Jeeves and Wooster.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Brian Gilbert (``Tom &AMP; Viv``) creates a harsh, detailed
portrait of English society, the kind of rich production we have
come to expect from British films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde'' will best satisfy audiences looking for social
history, particularly concerning the evolution of society's views
on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   But it will least satisfy those who treasured Wilde's genius as
a writer, playwright and the wit of his times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde'' is rated R for nudity, sex and profanity. 3 stars. &QL;

CARREY'S GENIUS SHACKLED BY A TEDIOUS `TRUMAN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - First, it's not a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Jim Carrey is not Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   Third, ``The Truman Show'' is a weird movie.
</P>
<P>
   But the weirdest thing about it: Ultimately, it's not weird
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey stars, in a primarily straight role, as Truman, a guy who
lives in a beautiful island town and has a perfectly normal life,
except for one thing: It's all phony.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, Truman's life has been the world's favorite TV
soap opera. And everyone in the world knows it except for Truman.
</P>
<P>
   His wife (Laura Linney) and every other person in the town are
really actors playing his wife and every other person in town.
</P>
<P>
   The town itself is fake; it's really a huge TV set.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the movie is devoted to setting up this
outlandish scenario, at which point Truman begins to suspect that
something is wrong with his neat little world and that a vast
conspiracy is keeping him on the island.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is rarely played for laughs, despite the immense
comic potential of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, director Peter Weir (``Fearless``) uses the movie to
ask serious questions about the nature of reality and illusion,
which may work for people who have always felt that reality was an
iffy proposition.
</P>
<P>
   However, Weir's philosophy does not run deep.
</P>
<P>
   It devolves into questions that sink the film's concept:
</P>
<P>
   _If people spend all their lives pretending to live in a town,
aren't they actually living in a town?
</P>
<P>
   _What's the difference between a wife and a woman who spends 24
hours a day pretending to be a wife?
</P>
<P>
   As for the movie's profound message, it asks the riveting
question: Aren't we all watching too much television?
</P>
<P>
   What are they saving for the sequel: Aren't we all eating too
much junk food?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' is built on a fascinating concept. But the
director and writers don't do enough to develop that concept.
</P>
<P>
   While ignoring the potential for wild humor in the situation,
Weir spends so much time establishing the seeming normalcy of
Truman's life that the movie quickly gets boring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other soap operas, nothing much happens to Truman.
</P>
<P>
   I can see why the producers wanted Carrey for the part. He's
bound to bring in some of his fans to see a movie that, starring
another actor, might have played the art houses.
</P>
<P>
   But to cast Carrey and then deprive him of a comic outlet is a
mistake. Carrey has a fount of wild comic talents, almost none of
which are called for in ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through, Carrey makes one of his trademark loony
faces, and the audience howls hopefully. Everyone's thinking: At
last, Jim Carrey is going to be Jim Carrey. But it doesn't last.
</P>
<P>
   From Carrey's perspective, he's obviously trying to expand his
acting range into films more serious than ``Dumb and Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   But does he really want to expand into the realm of the
ordinary?
</P>
<P>
   That nondescript territory is already crowded with scores of
actors, none of whom can do to a manic comedy what Carrey can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' scores points for its clever idea. But they
should have brought this one back to the drawing board and
rewritten it.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG, ``The Truman Show'' contains nothing offensive. But
it's still not a good movie for kids younger than 12 because it's
too sad and confusing. 3 stars. &QL;

HITCHCOCK REDO FAR FROM PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Take two actors who have played the same roles too
many times before, put them in a movie that's been made too many
times before, and you have the multiple-deja-vu experience of ``A
Perfect Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas is the arrogant millionaire, but when isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow is the desired, aristocratic woman who can't be
possessed. Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Perfect Murder'' is a remake of ``Dial M For Murder,'' a
thriller made by Alfred Hitchcock in 1954, remade on TV in 1981 and
overproduced by every community theater group in the country .
</P>
<P>
   Why did director Andrew Davis (``The Fugitive``) think we needed
a new version of such an old chestnut? Probably because he's
playing a new Hollywood vanity game: showing off by remaking the
master, Hitchcock. With a remake of ``Psycho'' in the works, Davis
decided to tackle one ofHitchcock's lesser films.
</P>
<P>
   He handles the story with enough suspense. But if you've seen
the original in any of its many manifestations, I can't imagine why
you'd want to see it again.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Taylor (Douglas) is the wealthy bond trader, married to
the accomplished Emily (Paltrow).
</P>
<P>
   Painfully not in love with her older husband, Emily is having a
mad, passionate affair with a mad, passionate artist (Viggo
Mortensen).
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas knows something about the artist that Emily does
not, and it fits perfectly into his scheme to murder his wife.
</P>
<P>
   How does Steven plan to kill Emily? Why is his scheme perfect?
And how will everything go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't seen ``Dial M For Murder,''``'' I'm not going to
give away your only hope for excitement.
</P>
<P>
   If you have seen the original, Davis and his screenwriters come
up with a few twists on the basic idea, but not enough. All the key
elements remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   Davis doesn't drag out the proceedings, for which we can be
thankful. But he doesn't create sympathetic characters, either.
Emily, with whose plight we should identify, is really just a
younger version of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the movie's one big mystery: Why would Emily, who
is independently wealthy and an adviser to a United Nations
ambassador, have married in the first place a cold fish who is old
enough to be her killer's father?
</P>
<P>
   Looks like more Hollywood vanity at work here.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Douglas, he could have mailed in his role from
outtakes of ``The Game,'' ``Disclosure'' and ``Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Paltrow, I like her as much as the next guy. But not in
every other movie.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't it occur to anyone in Hollywood that having Paltrow star
in four movies in less than six months is at least three movies too
many?
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow can concurrently be seen (doing much better) in
``Sliding Doors.'' If ``Great Expectations'' and ``Hush'' hadn't
been such bad pictures, she might be on four screens at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Mortensen (``G.I. Jane``) is most notable for winning the
cleft-chin award, outclefting both Douglas and Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   If you have somehow missed seeing ``Dial M for Murder,'' you
should find ``A Perfect Murder'' an imperfect but sufficient
suspense film.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have seen the original in any form, watching the copy
is like having to research a compare-and-contrast term paper for a
college class you really don't like.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Perfect Murder'' is rated R for violence, sex and profanity.
2 stars. &QL;

`TALES' SEQUEL CONTINUES ORIGINAL SAGA  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The 1994 PBS miniseries ``Tales of the City ''drew
firefrom conservative activists for its frank depiction of sex (gay
and straight) and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub clearly spooked PBS _ at the time under fire from
budget-axing congressional critics _ which passed on the sequel,
</P>
<P>
   ``Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it personally, on a number of levels,'' said Maupin, to
a gathering of TV critics earlier this year. ``What maddened me
about PBS' betrayal of ``Tales of the City'' was the fact that they
weren't honest about it. Basically, they were put into a position
where they had a choice between pleasing their viewers or appeasing
their enemies, and they chose to appease their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were caught in a sort of crossfire of the cultural wars,
and rather than saying, `We can't do this because we've been
officially censored by the legislatures of Georgia and Oklahoma,
and because we got bomb threats in Chattanooga, and because we're
afraid that PBS won't exist next year if we stick up for this
program,' they made excuses about funding and how they didn't do
sequels.''

   Enter the pay cable network Showtime, which could be the ideal
outlet for the follow-up. Maupin, for one, believes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this as a joyous occasion,'' he said. ``I look at
this as something that's going to excite a lot of people who are
going to want to hear this story keep being told. I really have not
thought of it in the political way for some time now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a great story to tell here, and I'm going to
get a chance to tell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're doing it in a way that I've always wanted to do it,
which is to show that this is about love, this is about affection,
this is about people connecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Maupin's first ``Tales'' _ originally told in the mid-1970s as a
serial in the ``San Francisco Chronicle,'' later published in a
series of books _ knitted together the lives of an odd but likable
collection of San Francisco-dwelling folks.
</P>
<P>
   The follow-up continues their stories (with a few minor cast
changes) in the same dreamy style as the original. Though ``More
Tales'' departs for a few remote locations, San Francisco and its
live-and-let-live mood remains an important element in the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lean a lot on the gay stuff because it's my own personal
thing, but what I'm really proud of is the fact that the story has,
from the beginning, attempted to create a very large canvas that
includes everyone,'' Maupin said. ``That is the point of it. That
you get to see the ways in which their lives are parallel, and the
way they interconnect and the way they form a family in spite of
their enormous differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, that's a model that broadcast television is just
beginning to understand. That you can do this. That this is
possible. This doesn't offend anybody. This is about the way the
world works. This is the way our own lives work. We all know each
other. We're out there, functioning together in the world, and
there's no reason that you shouldn't be able to see it on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Postscript: ``Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the City''
officially premieres Sunday, but was stealth-scheduled by Showtime
in late night last week, likely so it could qualify for this
season's Emmy Awards. The Emmy window closed May 31. &QL;

THEATRICAL TWIST ENHANCES EFFECT OF `LILIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - ``Lilies'' is about a gay love triangle in
turn-of-the-century Canada. Yet it is not the subject matter that
will put off most viewers. Its subject is handled fairly tamely by
the standards of most current movies.
</P>
<P>
   But this English-language Canadian film plays more like it has
subtitles than most foreign films.
</P>
<P>
   It is a highly stylized film, slow moving and full of high
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   It begins in 1952, when a hardened convict asks a noted bishop
to come to the prison for confession. It isn't the convict's
confession we are to receive, but the priest's.
</P>
<P>
   The main portion of the story, set in 1912, tells of an
adolescent homosexual love triangle among the bishop, the convict
and another boy, who is killed.
</P>
<P>
   These flashbacks are given to us as a theatrical presentation by
a cast of convicts. They dress up, build scenery and establish a
difficult, convoluted story that eventually breaks out of the
prison into live-action flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The shifting between ``realistic'' and theatrical flashbacks is
a surprisingly cinematic effect and, once you get used to it, quite
effective. Especially when you see the same convicts, all male,
playing both men and women in the ``real'' world.
</P>
<P>
   There is no outlandish drag act here. These are very fine actors
playing female parts, much like must have happened in Shakespeare's
day. Indeed, although every actor in the film is excellent, perhaps
the most outstanding work is turned in by Brent Carver as The
Countess, mother of the boy who is killed. He-she is a figure of
tremendous pathos. Carver won a Tony award for his work in ``Kiss
of the Spider Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   When she hears her son has taken a job, she recoils: ``Working?
That most vile and infamous of occupations.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is the closest to humor this movie offers. Mostly, it
is slow moving people in pain, beautifully photographed.
</P>
<P>
   It can be very hard to sit through ``Lilies'' _ especially the
slower first half _ but it will be hard to forget, sticking in your
imagination the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The film is unrated and contains brief nudity and adult subject
matter. 3 stars &QL;

 ADEPTLY, FINANCIAL SERVICES LEADERS LOBBY FOR BANKING BILL  js) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In all the cheerleading about legislation to rewrite the
nation's banking laws, one of the loudest voices belongs to Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co., which, each week, takes out a back-page ad in the
Washington political journal The Hill, a must read for the Capitol
Hill crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In banner type, Merrill proclaims: ``The American People Support
Financial Services Reform'' and ``Pass HR 10 Financial Services
Reform.'' A few days after the House did just that, Merrill
followed with: ``Congratulations to the House on HR 10.''
</P>
<P>
   If back-page ads are part of the tea leaves of Washington,
Merrill's ads show some of the muscle coming into play as the bill
moves from the House to the Senate, where it will soon come before
the Senate Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   By passing House Resolution 10, a far-reaching measure that
would update banking law, the House achieved a remarkable victory.
For two decades, this legislation, which passed by just a single
vote in late May, has been a political hot potato in both chambers
and has never gained enough votes to pass _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   But with House approval and with the financial services industry
experiencing a series of high-profile mergers that challenge
existing laws _ most notably the proposed $70 billion union of
Travelers Group Inc. and Citicorp _ the focus is now on the Senate,
where there are signs of a shift in attitude. Though many say the
bill's chances of passage are still slim, a number of events have
come together that are now increasing its odds of gaining approval.
The bill, at its most basic, removes the last remaining barriers to
allowing banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge
into huge financial services companies.
</P>
<P>
   After being visited a few weeks ago by three of Wall Street's
top leaders, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, announced that he was scheduling committee hearings on
June 17, the first step toward floor consideration. Significantly,
D'Amato put the measure on the fast track and then followed it up
by having the group _ composed of Sanford Weill, chairman of
Travelers; David Komansky, Merrill's chief executive; and Philip
Purcell, chief executive of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter _ meet with
Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, who said he would set aside
time for floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of the three executives, dealing with the Senate
leaders was like pushing on an open door. According to those in the
meeting, the men did not even have to make their pitch. Before
opening their mouths, D'Amato told them what he would do: hold
hearings, issue a strong statement in support of the measure, and,
most important, try to broker a compromise between Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
over a regulatory battle that is the bill's main stumbling block.
The two are expected to testify at the D'Amato hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, D'Amato's announcement on the hearings was made
with Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Senate
Banking Committee, who has switched his longstanding opposition and
now supports the bill. The three executives were also directed by
D'Amato to meet with Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, another key
Senate Democrat, who pledged to work for the measure, but predicted
it would be ``tough.''
</P>
<P>
   For D'Amato, who prides himself on being ``Senator Pothole,''
the gesture was a way to deliver an election-year package to Wall
Street and the banking community, which has poured millions into
his campaign coffers over the years and which employs more than
60,000 in New York with a payroll of $9 billion _ making it one of
his state's biggest industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working really hard on this bill,'' said Jack Morris, a
spokesman for Citicorp, which has one of Washington's biggest
lobbying operations, with a budget of $4.4 million as of mid-1997,
the most recent numbers available. The Citicorp-Travelers union
would not necessarily be halted if this legislation does not pass.
But the two companies might have to restructure the deal within
five years if the law is not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a real window of opportunity,'' Morris added.
``We've been around this issue for a long time and we do think
there seems to be a desire to move ahead. The fact that hearings
have been scheduled for early June is very positive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, the feud between the Federal Reserve and Treasury
remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, as it left the House, would make the Federal
Reserve the main regulator by having the banking system set up in a
holding company structure with many new financial activities run
out of bank affiliates. Rubin prefers a structure in which the new
activities could also be run out of bank operating subsidiaries,
which have closer ties to the banking parent. Under this structure,
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a division of the
Treasury, would be the top regulator. Rubin said he would recommend
a presidential veto of the current measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are arguing that banking organizations ought to have an
option,'' Julie Williams, the acting comptroller, said. ``We are
not arguing they should be forced to do it one way or another, or
that they should be forced to do things so that only we have
jurisdiction. We think banking organizations ought to have the
choice of the most effective way to conduct their activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime observers say a compromise between the Federal
Reserve and Treasury is possible _ and necessary. ``I don't think
this is one of those issues that is like an on-off switch,'' said
Cory Strupp, a managing director and chief lobbyist at J.P. Morgan
&AMP; Co., which supports the bill. ``There certainly is room for
compromise. Any company in financial services likes to have as much
flexibility as possible. Regulatory diversity has served our
industry well. The key is having the Treasury and the Fed come to
some mutually agreeable solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Big banks like Banc One, BankAmerica , Nationsbank and U.S.
Bancorp support the bill, as do the insurance industry and Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the financial services industry backs the bill.
Small bankers, represented by the Independent Bankers Association
of America, oppose it. But Kenneth Guenther, the group's chief
lobbyist, said his group's opposition had softened since many
amendments were added on the House floor, primarily one to outlaw
any combination of banking and industrial businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our opposition is becoming a closer call,'' Guenther said,
adding that ``everything is in a state of flux.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest opposition comes from the American Bankers
Association. Edward Yingling, the group's chief lobbyist, said that
his group opposes having the Federal Reserve as the main regulator
and that the Senate calendar is too rushed to get a bill enacted
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this gets worked out this year,'' Yingling said.
``Trying to do so would be like threading the eye of the needle,
and there is just no time for it. I doubt you could pass one of the
most important bills in the business arena in decades with the
Senate calendar we're facing.''

IS REAL QUIET READY FOR GALLOP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ If you handicapped horses based on the analytical
bent of their trainers, you'd bet Elliott Walden's Victory Gallop
over Bob Baffert's Real Quiet in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is widely known as quick with a quip, but the one-liners
burst from a sometimes scattered mind. Those of us who transcribe
his quotes notice that he speaks almost entirely in sentence
fragments and asides.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert also seems to be carried away with his newfound
celebrity, stepping over the bounds of good taste in the name of
comedy. He referred to rival trainer Sonny Hine's ``Elmer Fudd
voice'' and said Walden looks like the guy in high school who
couldn't get a date.
</P>
<P>
   So what if Walden is a pasty 6-foot-4 and wears thick glasses?
Talk with him, and you realize the recent Churchill Downs training
champion is a very sharp 35-year-old. He emits optimism but not
rhetoric. A product of a prominent Kentucky horse-breeding family,
he found fascination not in bloodlines but in trying to pick
winners at the track. Therefore his prerace comments are
levelheaded and rational. If his colt Victory Gallop doesn't win
Saturday, he'll know the reason why.
</P>
<P>
   While Real Quiet is trying to be the first Triple Crown winner
since Affirmed in 1978, Victory Gallop is trying to avoid being the
only horse other than Alydar in the same year to finish second in
all three races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things can (be reversed),'' Walden said here this
week. ``This might be pie in the sky, but I still think we ought to
have won the (Kentucky) Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Forced to rally on the far outside, Victory Gallop nearly caught
Real Quiet in the slow, :26 3/5 final quarter mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He beat us soundly in the Preakness, but I feel like we should
be split going into the Belmont,'' said Walden, the cast on his
right ankle, dislocated in a pickup basketball game, resting on a
trunk in D. Wayne Lukas' tack room.
</P>
<P>
   Walden doesn't think, as some analysts do, that jockey Gary
Stevens erred by challenging the Preakness pacesetters too early.
He notes that before the Derby, Victory Gallop raced close to the
lead with success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Real Quiet ran a monster race, that he moved forward
off the Derby, and we didn't,'' he said. ``I think (Victory Gallop)
had such a big effort at the Derby, he leveled off at Pimlico. Real
Quiet ran the kind of race in the Preakness that we ran in the
Derby. So I hope it's his turn to level off.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden thinks Lukas-trained Grand Slam, who is 4 for 4 at
Belmont and 0 for 4 elsewhere, must be respected because of that
statistic.
</P>
<P>
   He also has more respect for Real Quiet than some of his
colleagues, who question the colt's Triple Crown credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if he does win, Real Quiet, then he's a deserving
Triple Crown winner,'' Walden said. ``Or, if we beat him, then it
means we should have won the Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop came out of the Preakness a worn-out horse. He
developed a severe rash. But both conditions are behind him now,
Walden said.
</P>
<P>
   If that's so _ and with Walden's earnest delivery it's hard not
to believe him _ then Prestonwood Farm's horse certainly is the
leading threat to spoil the Triple Crown bid of the deserving
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop should like the extreme, 1{-mile course. His
sire, Cryptoclearance, was the runner-up to Bet Twice in the 1987
Belmont. Of course, that could also mean Victory Gallop is bred to
finish second.
</P>
<P>
   At Hollywood Park: The gates and betting windows will open at 11
a.m. Saturday, the first Hollywood Park race will be at 1:20 p.m.
Two stakes will be on the card, the Cinema Handicap and the Melair.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Grade I Gamely Breeders' Cup Handicap for fillies
and mares, whose recent winners include Eclipse Award winners
Hollywood Wildcat (1994) and Possibly Perfect ('95).
</P>
<P>
   The undercard: The three other stakes on the Belmont Stakes
program will include some top horses and names familiar to Southern
Californians.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-furlong Riva Ridge sprint features the return of
Coronado's Quest, who was injured on the eve of challenging Real
Quiet in the Preakness. Orville N Wilbur's wasn't entered in the
race after he made like Coronado's Quest, acting up so badly on the
track that he couldn't complete a scheduled workout.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Handicap on turf has Chief Bearhart, winner of the
Breeders' Cup Turf last fall at Hollywood Park. Kent Desormeaux,
back in trainer Bobby Frankel's good graces, will ride Kirkwall.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-furlong True North has Kelly Kip and two California
veterans, Boundless Moment and Trafalger.
</P>
<P>
   The Just a Game, for fillies and mares on turf, finds Desormeaux
and Neil Drysdale teaming up with Dance Parade.

A DAY AFTER FATAL CRASH, SCORES OF TRAINS ARE PULLED FROM SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESCHEDE, Germany _ One day after Germany's worst rail crash in
more than 50 years, authorities pulled scores of express trains out
of service Thursday after the discovery of a broken wheel and track
damage possibly linked to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of 60 Inter City Express trains was a humiliating
step for the federal railroad service and deepened speculation that
the accident, in which at least 93 people are known to have died,
was caused by mechanical failure in a train once praised as the
safest in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every relevant part of these trains will be examined to
exclude all risks,'' said Martin Katz, a spokesman for German
Railways. The company has 104 high-speed Inter City Express trains,
Katz said, and has withdrawn trains from the first generation,
which was introduced in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have yet to say what caused the crash at 10.59 a.m.
Wednesday when Inter City Express 884, on its way to Hamburg, hit a
road overpass at 125 miles per hour, bringing tons of concrete
crashing down on it.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening officials reported a series of findings that
gave a first impression of the possible cause. Police said damage
to the tracks and debris of a train, not necessarily Inter City
884, had been found three and a half miles south of the overpass,
meaning that 884 might have begun to derail well before it hit the
bridge, its momentum carrying the cars forward until they struck
the overpass.
</P>
<P>
   That version was apparently reinforced by the account of a
survivor from the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a funny noise about two minutes before the crash,''
the survivor, Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener, said. ``People looked
frightened, and we looked at each other as if to say, `Should we
take it seriously?' But then the train went on quite normally
without braking. I was writing at a table. Then it started again,
and I held on tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Other survivors said they had heard a loud noise before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some kind of loud noise, then a bang,'' one
survivor, Susanne Kleinbrahms, told Reuters television. ``I flew
through the air and smashed into everything. That's all I know.''
</P>
<P>
   In a newspaper interview to be published Friday, Transport
Minister Matthias Wissmann discussed the possibility that a wheel
on the car directly behind the locomotive had broken and that
``this may have been of significance.'' It was unclear whether a
broken wheel caused the track damage or vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Wednesday that the locomotive had separated from
the rest of the cars, speeding alone and unscathed until an
automatic braking system halted it 2,000 yards beyond the overpass.
</P>
<P>
   The picture emerging suggests that the train partly derailed
when approaching the overpass and that its middle-section slammed
into the central supporting pillar of the bridge with an impact
that decoupled the lead locomotive.
</P>
<P>
   The head of German Railways, Johannes Ludewig, said Thursday
night that because there ``may have been a problem'' with the
chassis and rolling gear, the first-generation trains ``will go
into the workshop and will not leave the workshop until we have
found out if there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the second-generation trains, introduced in 1994, had
different rolling gear and would not be withdrawn. German Railways
had earlier imposed a 100-mph limit on the trains remaining in
service. The express trains routinely travel at 125 mph and are
capable of speeds of up to 175 mph, part of a network of express
trains in Europe at the core of a projected high-speed transit
system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials who are investigating the crash have declined to
comment on the theories about causes, saying they need first to
uncover the last cars from the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports from police and rail officials said two groups
of schoolchildren might have been among the dead. But as the rescue
effort unfolded Thursday officials said that they had found nothing
to substantiate those fears.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 hours after the wreck, rescue teams in orange
coveralls tried to enter the last of the 13 cars. Rescuers said
they expected to find bodies but no additional survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Huge cranes dug up concrete slabs that fell on the train. Power
drills worked to clear out the last flattened cars, and rescuers
lowered pallets on chains to retrieve bodies in gray blankets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hearing no sounds of life from the wreckage,'' said
Rolf Bartsch, a rescue worker in Eschede. ``Any hope for survivors
is fading.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash left Eschede and the nation shaken. ``This did not
happen just somewhere in the world,'' said Michael Rothfuchs, an
editor at the local newspaper, The Celler Zeitung. ``It happened in
Germany. It was inconceivable. And it happened on our doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in a state of mourning or bewilderment or denial,''
a pastor, Peter Wroblewski, said. ``They see this highly modern
technological flier. Then they see the wreckage. It's unreal. It's
like a movie.''

 &HT;    Veteran pilot fights FAA's retire at 60 rule
 &HT;    By Doug Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ LEARN TO FLY. The image of that
flight-school advertisement is forever fused with Frank Murphy's
childhood memory of roaring through the clouds in an old biplane
with his father at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy saw the sign each time he shuttled between New Jersey and
Alabama as a young engineer testing guidance systems at the NASA
design center in the 1960s. The sign, and the memory, tugged at him
until he finally walked into the Huntsville Flying Service and
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   A little less than three years later, on April Fool's Day 1969,
he quit his engineer's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided there was no point working if I could fly for a
living,'' he says. ``I don't think of flying as work. I think of
flying as art.''
</P>
<P>
   At 29, he got a late start at a lucky time. Six months after he
started ferrying cargo, his boss bought a fleet of surplus
piston-engine planes and started Span East Airlines. Murphy became
a commercial pilot.
</P>
<P>
   He's had a thrilling if occasionally bumpy ascent since.
Airlines have vanished around him, but Murphy's love of flying,
travel and adventure is stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like doing this,'' he says. ``I love doing this. There's
nothing else I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What hurts is the increasing sense that no one else really
cares.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 30, 1999
</P>
<P>
   This calendar page is the vision now fixed in Murphy's mind.
That day, his 60th birthday, he will become too feeble or addled or
simply incompetent to do what he loves.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Federal Aviation Administration rule book says,
regardless of what any doctor or inspector or Murphy himself
thinks. Murphy says he has no trouble passing his twice-yearly FAA
physicals and flight-simulator tests, and doesn't expect to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes no sense,'' Murphy says. ``How can I be perfectly
capable of flying on Oct. 29 but not the next day?''
</P>
<P>
   The more he talks about it, the more agitated and disbelieving
he becomes. How can it come down to this? A mere 16 months. At the
least, he ought to get credit for the last three months he's spent
waiting to fly again.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who has lived in Miami since 1970, flew for Air Florida
and then for Carnival Air Lines. He stayed when the lettering on
the planes changed to Pan Am, but his job ended when the airline
filed for bankruptcy in February. He's been told he'll be flying
for Pan Am again sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about flying again, but I know it won't be for
long,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's age limit has been a point of contention since it was
imposed in 1959. The agency says there is no certain way to
determine the age at which health and skills deteriorate
dangerously. So, the agency argues, it's safest to draw an early
line.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous pilots and pilot groups have challenged the rule with
studies showing that older pilots fly safely in other parts of the
world and can be tested as reliably as younger pilots.
</P>
<P>
   As for slowed reflexes, Murphy cautions against thinking in
terms of evasive maneuvers on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to avoid those sort of quick motions in a cockpit,''
Murphy says. ``In 30 years, you learn to avoid problems as well as
deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest and, to Murphy, most discouraging word came from the
U.S. Supreme Court last month. Two pilots, backed by a group called
the Professional Pilots Federation, sued to overturn the age limit
as illegal discrimination, but they lost and the Supreme Court
refused to consider their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt,'' Murphy says. ``I guess I believed you could count
on the courts to protect the rights of the minority even when the
executive and legislative branches won't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Line Pilots Association, the union representing 49,000
pilots, opposed the rule for decades but now supports it. (Requests
for the union's comment on the Supreme Court decision went
unanswered.)
</P>
<P>
   To Murphy and other older pilots, the reason for the union's
turn-around is clear: Younger pilots, a majority of the union's
members, have a financial incentive to push the older pilots out.
</P>
<P>
   Because of flying's rigid seniority system, the only way to move
into the highest-paying jobs is for someone up ahead to retire.
</P>
<P>
   And getting to those jobs is important, because one of the major
influences on retirement pay is a pilot's final salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many younger pilots want to clear the path for
themselves,'' Murphy says. ``They don't think they'll ever turn
60.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did he.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who says he has a little bit of Indiana Jones in him,
talks enthusiastically about the days when he and a pal flew
plantains from Ecuador in an old DC-7.
</P>
<P>
   But he's just as enthusiastic about more recent adventures,
including summers based in Egypt and Turkey under Pan Am contracts
with airlines in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he's been talking more often and more forcefully, trying
to persuade as many people as he can that the age limit should be
repealed. He even showed up on CNN, but he also will make his case
one listener at a time.
</P>
<P>
   He carries a briefcase full of magazine articles, studies and
charts to support his position. One of them underscores the
difficulty he has finding sympathy. It shows that pilots for top
carriers can earn $3 million to $9 million over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking you to cry for pilots,'' he says. ``But
remember: that figure is for 30 years. A lot of guys flying for
Eastern, Braniff and a lot of other airlines never got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of pilots who have been bounced from job to job or who
always worked for smaller airlines really do need to work. The
FAA's age limit doesn't make them eligible for early Social
Security retirement or disability benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who is single, is ready to retire financially but not
emotionally. So he'll find a way to keep flying past Oct. 30, 1999
_ in Central America or Europe or some other place that will show
confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to leave my country, but I'm going to be flying
something, somewhere,'' he says. ``Why would I want to retire? I
never really worked.''
</P>

 &HT;    U.S. envoy to Canada boosts Atlanta
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When Atlanta's own Gordon Giffin, now U.S. ambassador
to Canada, saw former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young Thursday at the
Commerce Club, the first thing he asked was, ``Are you still on the
board of Delta Air Lines?''
</P>
<P>
   After Young answered, ``yes,'' Giffin made an impassioned plea
for Delta to start flights from Atlanta to Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would such a flight help him get back and forth, but
more importantly, it would further establish Atlanta as an
important base of exchange between the United States and Canada,
particularly in high technology.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just Delta that Giffin is targeting. In his mind,
the opportunities of business and academic exchanges between
Atlanta and Canada are endless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta can be the platform of hemispheric trade between
Canada and Latin America,'' Giffin said. ``While I'm in Canada,
there's no better opportunity to make this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the message Giffin sounded in a private talk to the
influential Commerce Club board.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a message he wants to broadcast while he is
ambassador, a post he expects to hold for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he is pleased his friend and fellow Democrat, Gov.
Zell Miller, will be spending two days in Ottawa on a mission this
month, when Giffin will introduce him to Canada's high-tech
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomes people from Atlanta to come to Canada to find
opportunities to strengthen their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not have joint ventures between Georgia and Canadian
companies pointed toward Latin America?'' he asked. ``I'm
soliciting business. There's never been the same sort of
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Canada and the United States enjoy the biggest trading
relationship in history _ $370 billion a year, more than all the
European Community countries combined.
</P>
<P>
   Giffin said he sees many U.S. business leaders in Canada but not
many from the Southeast _ something he intends to change. He also
is trying to get President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore (both
Southerners) to go on separate trips to Canada in the next couple
of years.
</P>
<P>
   Giffin has that pull because he has been a longtime insider in
state and national Democratic circles. He chaired the Clinton-Gore
campaign in Georgia in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Town talk
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the success of the Woodruff Arts Center corporate
campaign topping $6 million came from a new segment _ workplace
giving.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign pitches are being made to employees or managers at
several major companies in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For example, BellSouth's workplace giving totaled $133,000.
BellSouth also gave a corporate gift of $225,000. Other companies
doing workplace campaigns include Equifax, SunTrust, National Data,
Georgia Power and SunTrust.
</P>
<P>
   But the top corporate donors continue to be top companies in
Atlanta. Coca-Cola gave $300,000; Georgia Power, $250,000; Cox
Enterprises and related interests, $142,000; NationsBank, $140,000;
Wachovia, $140,000; SunTrust, $125,000; Home Depot, $105,000; and
United Parcel Service, $100,000. New to the top level is Deloitte &AMP;
Touche at $105,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Levy, managing partner of King &AMP; Spalding, announced Tim
Reis has joined the firm as counsel in the intellectual property
and technology area.
</P>
<P>
   Reis formerly held in-house counsel positions at United Parcel
Service and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
   Reis will have responsibility for patent matters and electronic
commerce, Internet and computer security matters.
</P>
<P>
   NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal has teamed with Atlanta-based
Boys &AMP; Girls Club of America, giving $1 million to launch
technology centers in 100 Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs nationwide over the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The centers will cost more than $15 million, and O'Neal, a Boys
&AMP; Girls Club alum, has pledged to help raise the remaining $14
million.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Office of University Partnerships has announced
the retirement of Thomas K. Hamall, its director. Andrea Ashmore,
formerly of Spelman College, will take on duties as special
assistant to the president and director of university partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The program seeks to expand Georgia Tech's outreach in the
Atlanta community. Hamall headed the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce in
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation
International awarded the 1997-98 Volunteer of the Year honor to
David I. Roos Jr. Roos is president of Melvin S. Roos &AMP; Co. Inc.,
an Atlanta-based store fixture company. The Georgia Chapter raised
$1.5 million in special events this year to help find a cure for
diabetes.

PARK SERVICE PUSHES TO SAVE LOG CABINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Lincoln lived in one, and Gen. Ulysses S.
Grant directed the last campaigns of the Civil War from another.
</P>
<P>
   Log cabins are part of the American tradition, but now many of
them are crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the National Park Service announced a
public-private partnership to save more than 400 log structures on
parkland, beginning with the Gatekeeper's Cabin on the North Rim of
the Grand Canyon in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The one-story, Depression-era cabin is deteriorating, its logs
rotting after insect infestation and 67 years of temperatures
ranging from 20 degrees below zero to 95 above. The cabin, which
boasts a central stone fireplace and front and side porches, is
used as housing for members of the park's seasonal staff.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin's restoration, scheduled for this summer, is part of a
$1 million project targeting log cabins in more than 300 U.S. parks
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The project, in partnership with the Ohio-based owner of Log
Cabin brand syrup, is more about history than housing.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of log cabins were built during the Revolutionary War
as schools, churches, mills and barns. Log construction allowed
Western boomtowns to pop up almost overnight. Supporters of 1840
presidential candidate William Henry Harrison successfully used the
log cabin as a campaign symbol. The Civilian Conservation Corps
used log construction extensively during the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these cabins date back to the late 19th century and
are related to our nation's historic leaders and events, as well as
the evolution of our national park system,'' said Grand Canyon
Superintendent Rob Arnberger, who traveled to Washington for the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rotted logs, crumbling stone foundations and leaking roofs are
threatening the structural integrity of many log structures,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Rim cabin will be rebuilt with an eye on historical
accuracy. For example, a concrete porch will be removed and
replaced with one of wood, similar to the original. Workers will
use tools, material and techniques from a bygone era.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial aspect of the project reflects a budget reality:
National parks can't make it on government money alone. Log Cabin
syrup labels and advertising will provide details on how the public
can contribute.
</P>
<P>
   The project will be overseen by the National Park Foundation, a
partner of the National Park Service that raises private-sector
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Log cabins, although they are regarded as quintessentially
American, did not originate in the United States, according to
historians. The style was introduced by Finnish and Swedish
settlers in the 17th century.

 &HT;    One pilot in crash over Cobb had FAA violations
 &HT;    By Doug Payne
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The pilot of the single-engine plane that collided in
mid-air with an executive jet over Cobb County had four citations
for violations of Federal Aviation Administration regulations on
his record, and his license had been suspended twice, according to
FAA records.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Hartwig Duncan, last surrendered his license for 60 days
in 1994, according to documents obtained by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution through a request under the Freedom of
Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, 44, was an experienced pilot with more than 10,000 hours
of flying time and may have been conducting an aerial inspection of
electrical lines for Georgia Power when the mid-air tragedy
occurred April 4. Duncan and four persons in the jet died.
</P>
<P>
   He first came to the attention of FAA enforcers in 1982, when he
was cited for failing to lower his landing gear before making a
landing at an unspecified airport in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said her agency could not
comment on a specific pilot's record. But according to the FAA's
flight standards office, ``most pilots go through their entire
career without a violation,'' she said. But others in the general
aviation industry said the violations were no indicator of pilot
ability.
</P>
<P>
   The collision between Duncan's Cessna 172 Skyhawk and a Cessna
Citation jet killed Duncan and four attorneys with the Atlanta law
firm of Dow, Lohnes &AMP; Albertson. The jet was piloted by one of the
attorneys, Marion ``Chip'' Allen, 53.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys all represented Cox Enterprises, which owns The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The collision is still being investigated by the National
Transportation Safety Board, and will not be completed for at least
another three months, an agency spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Every aspect of the collision is being examined, including the
equipment on both planes. The engines have been examined and no
problems were found, saidPreston Hicks, the lead NTSB investigator
on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking at the pilots' flight records.
Allen, the pilot of the private jet, had no violations over his
1,500 hours of logged flight time.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, a Cumming resident, was licensed for single- and
multi-engine aircraft and had a commercial pilot's license as well
as certification as an airframe and powerplant mechanic. He had
flown aerial surveys for a number of years, FAA records show. It
was while flying an aerial inspection of AT&AMP;T power lines that he
ran afoul of the FAA on July 12, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   That day he took off from Greenville, S.C., in the same airplane
that five years later would be involved in the crash above Cobb
County.
</P>
<P>
   He soon radioed the tower at Charlotte International Airport
that his engine was ``running rough'' and that he needed priority
routing to the airport. The tower cleared his route and as soon as
Duncan landed FAA inspectors went out to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   They questioned his failure to land at a closer airport, but
more seriously they found he was flying without a current medical
certificate or pilot's license. They also found that his Skyhawk,
which had undergone some modifications, had never been recertified
as airworthy.
</P>
<P>
   They determined that the plane's condition violated FAA
regulations on several counts:
</P>
<P>
   It didn't have an identification plate affixed to the fuselage;
</P>
<P>
   The plane carried no current list of equipment on board;
</P>
<P>
   Gas tank openings were not properly marked;
</P>
<P>
   On the instrument panel, the compass was not clearly marked;
</P>
<P>
   And the plane wasn't equipped with an emergency locator
transmitter, a device that helps rescuers find the airplane in case
of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   For those violations, Duncan surrendered his license for 60 days
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigators looking into the April 4 collision have
already said that another required electronic device was not
working on Duncan's plane that day: he was flying without a
functioning transponder, which helps air traffic controllers
identify individual airplanes on their radar screens. All aircraft
flying within about 30 miles of Atlanta must have a working
transponder under FAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the device was broken or simply never
turned on. Had the device been in operation, ``there would have
been a lot better chance of (crash) avoidance,'' NTSB board member
George Black said after the collision.
</P>
<P>
   The company that Duncan flew for when he incurred the 1993
violation, Brentco Inc. of Canton, Ohio, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power spokesman John Sell acknowledged that the utility
company did have a contractual relationship with Duncan. However,
he said, ``it has not been determined whether he was flying for
us'' on the day of the collision. Noting that the accident is still
under investigation, he declined further comment on the accident or
Duncan's flying record with Georgia Power.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also suspended Duncan's license for 30 days in 1987 and
ordered it suspended it again for 45 days in 1990. However, the
1990 penalty was later waived. Records concerning those incidents
have been destroyed by the FAA, which routinely disposes of records
beyond a certain age, said Bergen, the FAA spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Also destroyed were records detailing a wheels-up landing Duncan
made in 1982. The violation is indicated in his certification file,
with the notation that he was ``counseled on use of a checklist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual to have that many violations, but it might be
tempered by his type of flying,'' said Dr. Vernon Grose, a former
member of the NTSB board and White House advisor on aviation
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In his line of work, Duncan was ``using an aerial position to
look down for problems in wiring. Flying the airplane may be a
secondary, rather than a primary consideration for him,'' Grose
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that type of flying, Grose noted, the pilot's attention is
focused on the ground and ``he isn't thinking particularly about
other air traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of an electronic beacon on board the aircraft showed he
was ``careless about certification of the airplane,'' Grose said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's former father-in-law, Jack Steiner of Gainesville, said
Duncan was well-respected as a pilot. He said the violations on
Duncan's record were minor incidents that occurred early in his
career and never put other people nor Duncan's job at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a professional flier. There was nothing wrong with his
flying capabilities,'' Steiner said. ``Everybody loved that guy.
Everybody respected him. His life was flying. As long as he was
flying he was happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Private aviation industry authorities said number of FAA
citations against Duncan could be explained by the long hours he
logged in the air _ much like a professional truck driver who
spends more hours on the road is more likely to be stopped by
police. FAA regulations limit commercial airline pilots to no more
than 1,000 hours of flight time a year.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Morningstar, director of media relations for the Aircraft
Owners and Pilots Association, a general aviation advocacy
organization, said that ``any infraction of regulations is serious.
As a group, pilots are very concerned about flying according to
regulations and flying safely.''
</P>
<P>
   But based on what is known of Duncan's record, he said,
``there's nothing there that I would say pointed to careless
operation that would have affected the accident.

HIGH COURT REBUFFS STARR'S EFFORTS FOR SPEEDY RULINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday put the brakes on
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's effort to quickly settle two
legal disputes delaying his investigation of an alleged
presidential affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The nine justices decided to let the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia have a crack at resolving whether
President Clinton's most trusted adviser and three Secret Service
employees must testify before a federal grand jury in the Monica
Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is assumed that the Court of Appeals will proceed
expeditiously to decide this case,'' the justices said in a
two-paragraph statement rejecting Starr's request for fast-track
rulings on attorney-client privilege and creation of a so-called
``protective privilege'' for the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court had agreed to take either case, it would
have been only the sixth time this century that an issue was
considered vital enough to abandon the normal appeals process. One
of those cases involved President Truman's seizure of steel mills
during the Korean War. Another led to the release of the Watergate
tapes, which prompted the 1974 resignation of President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Although no schedule has been set for filing briefs or hearing
arguments, the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals could set
both privilege cases for next month. However, any rulings could
then be appealed to the Supreme Court, which means the issues of
testimony from presidential aide Bruce Lindsey and the Secret
Service would not be resolved before late autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigators believe Lindsey, a Clinton confidante for
30 years who serves as deputy White House counsel, can provide key
information about what the president knew and did after learning of
secretly tape recorded conversations in which Lewinsky reportedly
told a friend about an 18-month affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to shield Lindsey from having to answer Starr's questions
before the grand jury, Clinton first cited executive privilege,
then invoked lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, after
reviewing sealed evidence, ruled last month that Starr's need for
Lindsey's testimony outweighs both executive and lawyer-client
privilege claims.
</P>
<P>
   The judge issued the same decision concerning Starr's efforts to
secure the cooperation of a Secret Service lawyer and two Secret
Service uniformed officers who were on duty at the times Lewinsky
allegedly met with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service director Lewis Merletti has said forcing Secret
Service personnel to testify will ``substantially undermine, if not
destroy,'' the trust presidents have in their protectors, making
presidents ``more vulnerable to assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after the Supreme Court decision Thursday,
Starr said his team of investigators and prosecutors ``will
continue to take every reasonable and practicable step to bring out
the relevant facts as promptly as possible, so this investigation
can be concluded in a thorough and expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision was cheered by the White House, which
had argued against Starr's attempt to shortcut the normal appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court acted appropriately today,'' said White
House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, who has agreed to expedited
hearings at the Court of Appeals. ``Contrary to Mr. Starr's claims,
the governmental attorney-client privilege is not a `new'
privilege,'' Ruff said. ``It is well established that
confidentiality is the cornerstone of all attorney-client
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Mike McCurry criticized Starr for
suddenly seeking to speed up this portion of his investigation of
the president. ``Today is day 1,400 of Ken Starr's tenure as
independent counsel at the rate of $30,000 a day of taxpayers'
money,'' McCurry said. ``If there's any delay, that's the delay
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr was appointed in 1994 to oversee an investigation of
Clinton's involvement in the failed Arkansas land deal called
Whitewater. The inquiry was expanded in January to include whether
the president lied under oath or urged others to cover-up his
relationship with Lewinsky, a former White House intern, or an
encounter with Democratic activist Kathleen Willey near the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lewinsky have testified under oath that they never
had sex. Clinton also has said he never asked anyone to lie. Their
accounts allegedly are contradicted by the tapes in which Lewinsky
reportedly described engaging in oral sex with the president and
how he later encouraged her to lie when called to testify in a
sexual harassment lawsuit against him.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse, Democratic fund-raiser Nathan Landow
appeared before the grand jury to answer questions about his
contacts with Willey, who accused Clinton of fondling her breasts
and placing her hand on his crotch during a private meeting in
November 1993. Clinton denied any improper behavior during his
encounter with Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Landow, a wealthy Maryland developer, discussed with Willey what
she should say in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit, which was
dismissed two months ago. Landow has denied encouraging Willey to
lie about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   As he emerged from the courthouse, Landow declined comment
except to say: ``I'm done.''
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying Thursday was Sydney Blumenthal, a former
journalist and senior presidential adviser who was making his third
appearance before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal appeared after the White House abandoned its claim
that executive privilege _ a president's right to receive
confidential advice from assistants _ should protect him from
having to answer prosecutor's questions.
</P>
<P>
   After Blumenthal's appearance, his attorneys announced that he
would have to return again and criticized the line of questioning
posed by Starr's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was two hours of questions of `Up there at the White House,
do you talk about the Starr investigation?''' said William
McDaniel, one of Blumenthal's lawyers. The questioning turned to
Blumenthal's conversations with the president and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton after about two hours of interrogation about
White House discussions of Starr and his deputies, McDaniel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation has become more about Starr than anything
else,'' McDaniel told reporters.

REPORTS OF U.S. PLAN TO RESTORE MIDEAST TALKS PUBLISHED IN ISRAEL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SERGE SCHMEMANN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Two Israeli newspapers published details Thursday of
what they said was a U.S. plan that would finally restore
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Neither U.S. nor Israeli officials would confirm the
authenticity of the reported plan, but they did say an agreement
could be reached in days.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, as reported by Haaretz and Maariv, retains the 13
percent withdrawal from the West Bank that the Palestinians and the
Clinton administration have insisted on as a minimum for a
resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
   But it pairs the phased withdrawals with specific obligations on
the Palestinians to undertake security measures that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded, including confiscation of illegal
weapons in Palestinian territories and concrete procedures for
dealing with incitement, suspected terrorists and arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The reported plan also includes separate ``understandings,'' one
of which is that Israel will build no new settlements and will not
allow ``significant'' expansion of existing settlements in the West
Bank. It is not clear whether such proposals have been presented by
the Americans in writing.
</P>
<P>
   The reports follow a flurry of diplomatic activities this week
by U.S., Palestinian and Israeli diplomats, including meetings in
London between Dennis Ross, the American Middle East mediator, and
two senior Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza, Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, made no specific
comment on the published plans, but said he hoped for movement by
mid-June. ``According to the American initiative, they promised
that the redeployment would be decided no later than the middle of
this month,'' he said. ``We hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Palestinians have agreed to a 13 percent withdrawal
by Israel, that encompasses only two of the three withdrawals
envisioned in the Oslo agreements. The scope of the third, which is
relegated in the proposal to ``a joint Palestinian-Israeli
committee,'' is reportedly still a matter of contention.
</P>
<P>
   Yet U.S. and Israeli officials seem optimistic that some break
is near in the 15-month deadlock, during which Washington has taken
an increasingly assertive role. In recent months the talks have
been essentially between the administration and Netanyahu, often
accompanied by ill-concealed irritation, threats and political
maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said Thursday that a decision to resume
negotiations could be reached ``very shortly.'' And David
Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's communications director, said, ``I feel we
do think that if everything goes according to expectations, there
should be a package deal within a few days.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Netanyahu declared earlier this week that he would present a
withdrawal plan by the middle of the month, and was confident it
would receive the necessary support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after so many setbacks over the past year, the possibility
of another one is strong. Netanyahu still has to contend with
Cabinet members who have vowed to block any deal that cedes more
than 9 percent of the West Bank, and Arafat could balk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little bit more optimistic, but I've had so many
disappointments that I will wait before giving any
congratulations,'' President Ezer Weizman said after meeting with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Though Netanyahu has strongly argued that a 13 percent pullback
would pose a serious threat to Israeli security, what evidently
made the latest proposal palatable was the extensive reciprocity _
a concept Netanyahu has repeatedly stressed _ between the Israeli
withdrawals and Palestinian actions against terror and anti-Israeli
incitement.
</P>
<P>
   As set out by David Makovsky, the diplomatic reporter for
Haaretz, the package proposes a three-stage plan over 12 weeks.
Talks on a final settlement, which under the Oslo accord are to be
completed by May 4, 1999, would begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first five weeks, Israel would transfer 2 percent of
West Bank territory still under its control to full or partial
Palestinian control. At the same time, the executive committee of
the Palestine Liberation Organization would endorse a letter from
Arafat to President Clinton confirming changes in the Palestinian
Charter.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has insisted that changes voted by the Palestine
National Council two years ago did not satisfy the requirement to
rid the charter of its calls for Israel's destruction, and the U.S.
proposal appeared to fall short of his demand that the council be
convened again.
</P>
<P>
   During this period the Palestinians would also take specific
steps against incitement, while a U.S.-Palestinian committee would
determine the whereabouts of Palestinians who have committed
terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth week Israel would withdraw from a further 5
percent, while the Palestinians would confiscate illegal arms. In
the 12th week Israel would withdraw from another 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``understandings,'' in addition to constraints on
settlements, Israel would agree not to demolish Palestinian houses.
The Palestinians, for their part, would agree not to question
Israel's credentials at the United Nations.

PETERSEN ACQUIRES INSIDE SPORTS MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Petersen Cos. has purchased the magazine Inside Sports and plans
to merge it with its 51-year-old Sport magazine, the company
announced Thursday. Petersen executives declined to disclose the
terms of this latest acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Sports, founded by Newsweek in 1979 and acquired by
Century Publishing Co. in 1982, and Sport, which Petersen recently
revamped, each have a circulation of about 750,000. Both will be
published under the name Sport, beginning with the August issue,
and Petersen said it planned to raise the rate base to 1 million in
January.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Inside Sports, Petersen recently acquired Slam,
which covers high school basketball and which Petersen says is the
No.-1-selling sports magazine on the newsstand, with a single-copy
circulation of 180,000.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen's acquisition comes at a time when competition has
intensified among sports magazines. ESPN magazine, which arrived on
newsstands in March and is aimed at readers under 30, plans to
raise its rate base _ the circulation guaranteed advertisers _ to
500,000 in August from 350,000.

<P>
   New York -- Evander Holyfield is not quite fighting the battle
of the bulge. But as he gets older, he gets heavier.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield weighed in at 218 1/2 pounds Thursday for Saturday's
heavyweight title fight against Henry Akinwande, the heaviest of
his career. Holyfield weighed 218 for the second Mike Tyson fight
and 214 for his last bout against Michael Moorer. Akinwande, who at
6-foot-7 is four inches taller than Holyfield, weighed in at 240
1/4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hallmark, Holyfield's fitness trainer, said the champion
weighed as high as 226 pounds 3 1/2 weeks ago. There was no
intention for Holyfield to add weight, Hallmark said, but ``Evander
is getting more rest now (between workouts). He's not doing as much
running around for interviews and such, so he's not quite as
drained.''

   Hallmark also said that ``athletes like Evander can fluctuate
five or 10 pounds and it's not that big of a deal. The weight can
change depending on whether he's eaten or how many fluids he's
taken in or whether he has been to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women outside Madison Square Garden, where the weigh-in
took place, screamed when Holyfield took off his shirt for the
weigh-in. Akinwande drew scattered boos.
</P>
<P>
   Martin bout on hold
</P>
<P>
   Women's lightweight boxing champion Christy Martin (34-1-2),
scheduled to appear on the pay-per-view portion of the card,
currently has no opponent. Martin's scheduled opponent, Maria
Nieves-Garcia (2-1), was scratched because she is pregnant. She
rejected Nieves-Garcia's proposed replacement, Melissa Salamone
(9-0), who had knocked out her last three opponents in the first
round and is the sister of WBA light heavyweight champion Lou Del
Valle.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves-Garcia's pregnancy the pregnancy showed up on the
standard blood and urine tests given to female boxters, matchmaker
Bobby Goodman said, and it showed that Nieves-Garcia was 21 weeks
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She kept saying, 'But I can't be pregnant,' `` Goodman said.
``So we retested her, and it came up positive again. Twenty-one
weeks. That's pretty pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been at least one other women's fight canceled because
of a pregnancy, last year in England, but this one is believed to
be the first in the U.S. Nieves-Garcia, already a single mother of
one, was to earn $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brown hurt, Mercer out
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta heavyweight Marcellus Brown, who was to face Ray Mercer
on the undercard, suffered a broken right hand in training and is
out. Mike Sedillo was named as a replacement for Brown, but an
announcement was made later in the day that Mercer had failed a
physical and the bout was off. No further explanation was given.
</P>
<P>
   Quote/unquote
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield trainer Don Turner, when told that Akinwande said he
lost to Lennox Lewis because Turner, his former trainer, didn't pay
enough attention to him in training camp: ``And I'm not going to
pay any attention to him now.''

 &HT;    Fighting on his terms
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are trying anything this week to draw attention
to the greatest heavyweight of this decade. Put him up on the
podium for a blur of satellite TV interviews. Fit him with a jockey
cap and pose him in front of photographers with Kent Desomeaux, who
rides Real Quiet here in the Belmont Stakes. Hold a weigh-in on
Seventh Avenue during a Manhattan traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters don't require these gimmicks to make money when Mike
Tyson is center stage. But things always have been different for
Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   His career is nearing closure, he owns two championship belts,
and he has earned money, power and respect _ without a prison
record. Yet as he prepares for Saturday's bout against Henry
Akinwande, Holyfield has heard criticism for being greedy in failed
negotiations for a showdown with Lennox Lewis and faces the
prospects of fighting Akinwande in a half-empty Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he is not getting caught up in the apparent lack
of interest. While he would prefer to meet Lewis, he believes this
fight is underappreciated. Further, the WBA mandated this title
defense, and he refuses to get stripped of his crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who I fight,'' he said. ``I'm in this for the
titles.''
</P>
<P>
   What he can't grasp is why Tyson remains such a magnet for the
public and why cable operators who handle pay-per-view telecasts
are, in his words, ``trying to give me a pay cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about hype now,'' Holyfield said. ``Like Tyson _ here's a
man who comes out of jail with the whole world watching. `Oh, he's
dangerous,' they say. People came to see if he would hurt the other
guy. People are into that. If you said, `We're gonna kill a chicken
and cut his head off,' people are gonna come out and watch them
kill the chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield wanted $20 million, the same as his previous paycheck
against Michael Moorer, to face Lewis, and he was widely blamed for
not accepting a reduced purse. Lewis received less criticism for
his demand of $10 million, even though the champion's standard
share is two-thirds against a challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I proclaim to be the best,'' Holyfield said. ``When
Tyson was the man, even though I felt I was the man, he had the
titles, and I was willing to take less. Now I have a situation
where I have a bigger name and I have two belts. Why do people want
to cut their budget when it comes down to me? They payTyson a lot
of money. Why won't they pay me?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many people think Lennox Lewis is that great anyway,''
Holyfield said. ``It ain't gonna shock the world when I whip him.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield still believes a Lewis bout will happen, and he vows
he won't retire until he holds all three belts. That is the reason
he says he is not taking Akinwande for granted, despite the fact he
is in the rare position of a big favorite. If he loses, he is
beltless in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Holyfield has struggled against lesser opponents _ Bert
Cooper, Bobby Czyz, Larry Holmes, Moorer in their first meeting.
Even Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer, was hesitant when asked if
the Akinwande fight would end quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on Evander's state of mind,'' he said. ``Evander,
sometimes, he overthinks. He can stop Henry or he can make it tough
on himself. I know the kinks in his armor.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield admitted he was reckless against Cooper and Czyz,
adding, ``I ignored the game plan because I thought I could just go
right at them. But I'm more mature now. I can focus better on what
I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That pertains to out-of-ring distractions, as well. Holyfield
has had his share of problems, and the most recent came six weeks
ago when his brother, James, 45, was sentenced to life in prison
for rape and child molestation, stemming from an incident in 1995.
Evander, the youngest of eight children, has visited James in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people my mother did all she could, raising us,''
Holyfield said. ``When my brother was growing up, my mother worked
from 10 to 10. She didn't have as much time with him, so he did
what he wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was a roughhouser. We didn't have a daddy (around).
If something happened to one of us at school, he'd come with a
baseball bat and attack the whole school. He was our protector.
They called my brother wild man.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about Tyson being in and out of jail. Well, James'
whole life was like that. He got caught up in a lot of things. He
used to sell drugs, but he told me, `If I ever catch you on drugs,
I'm going to kill you,' and he really meant it. It's like he cared
more about me than himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he did not go down the same path as his brother
because ``by'' the time I was growing up, my mom wasn't working,
and she had more time to spend with me. She raised me like I was a
piece of glass, like I was gonna break.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Holyfield is his own protector. Whether that is enough to
draw more than 8,000 people to the Garden on Saturday, he isn't
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't please everybody,'' Holyfield said. ``You live in a
fool's paradise if you think everybody cares about you. ... I would
love for the place to be packed. But if it was just him and myself
and a referee, I would be just as into it.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whatever drawing power he has, Holyfield said, ``I truly
believe people come out and say, `Well, Holy, he's a nice guy, but
I like to see him get whipped.' They like to see how I respond if I
get whipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be waiting a long time for that.''

TOP U.N. MEMBERS URGE INDIA AND PAKISTAN TO END ARMS RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The United States, Russia, China, Britain and France
called on India and Pakistan on Thursday to freeze their nuclear
weapons development and agree not to test nuclear missiles or arm
them with warheads.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, all nuclear powers themselves, offered to help India and
Pakistan reduce tensions over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to isolate these countries or make them outcasts
or pariahs,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after
meeting with the four other foreign ministers to discuss ways to
curb the region's nuclear arms race. ``We want to engage them in
constructive dialogue,'' she said, ``to show them that they have
earned nothing, zero, zilch by what they have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The five countries disagree about economic sanctions, and are
unwilling to offer anything that appears to be a payoff to India or
Pakistan, so they are left trying to get individual countries to
exert pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we are not big into inducements here is that we do
not want any other country to feel there is a benefit'' to testing,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   What effect Thursday's appeal would have was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no illusions that we will succeed overnight,''
Albright said. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States and
Russia do not have as much leverage as they once had in the region,
and the three other countries do not have much either.
</P>
<P>
   They will evaluate how well Thursday's strategy works, and
foreign ministers of the seven leading industrial democracies plus
Russia _ a group that includes all the nations here Thursday except
China _ will meet again in London on June 12 to discuss further
steps, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That will add to pressure already brought by Germany, Japan,
Canada and Italy to get India and Pakistan to sign the 1996 nuclear
test-ban treaty and an earlier agreement to keep nuclear weapons
from spreading. Germany and Japan both suspended aid to India after
it tested nuclear weapons last month.
</P>
<P>
   India has long opposed the test ban treaty, saying it will not
sign as long as the five nuclear powers keep their nuclear arms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting was headed by China, which India views as
almost as big an adversary as Pakistan, and Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan made little effort to disguise the Chinese view that India
bore the main responsibility for starting a new arms race in the
region, saying it had acted ``in defiance of world opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The five foreign ministers called on India and Pakistan to avoid
threatening moves by their conventional military forces, and said
they would encourage both to negotiate a solution on Kashmir. U.S.
officials said the United States would offer both countries
assistance in ``confidence-building'' technologies that would allow
them to monitor each other's activities in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which has imposed economic sanctions on both
countries as required under U.S. law, made no attempt here to get
other countries to follow suit. France and Russia were both
opposed, and French officials said their main aim here was a plan
to encourage both countries to sign and ratify the 1996
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isolating India and weakening Pakistan economically is not the
way,'' one French diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   France conducted underground nuclear tests in the South Pacific
in 1995. After a worldwide uproar, President Jacques Chirac ended
the testing and France signed the test ban treaty in 1996. China
also ended its own underground tests and signed at about the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think France could be in a position to become the
Western country with the greatest leverage over India and Pakistan.
In the French view, India's motivation in developing operational
nuclear weapons was as much fear and resentment of China as it was
India's longstanding enmity with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   China and India fought a border war in the Himalayas in 1962,
and Pakistan is widely believed to have obtained what it needed to
build its bomb from China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are struck by the centrality of the Chinese problem for
India,'' said a French official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Though India does not yet have the long-range missile technology
for parity with China, Defense Minister George Fernandes said in
New Delhi on Wednesday that plans were going ahead to develop a
missile with a range beyond 1,500 miles, well into Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton headed for China on June 25, some
officials feared that India would see the appeal by the charter
members of the nuclear club as a conspiracy against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``India is ready to stop testing and making fissionable
materials and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but only if
it is then treated by the other nuclear powers the same way as
China,'' a French official said. ``They say they have never
transferred any nuclear technology to anybody else, unlike China,
and yet they are being punished for developing nuclear weapons and
China isn't.''

BATTLE OVER TOBACCO BILL ERUPTS IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A fierce partisan fight broke out in the Senate on
Thursday on tobacco and income tax legislation that could swamp the
anti-smoking bill, one of the biggest and most contentious measures
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But by bringing matters to a head, the bickering could just as
easily mean that the Senate will now find a way to pass soon not
only the tobacco bill but also a large tax reduction for married
couples that Republicans are trying to attach to it.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, after weeks of talking but taking no action, the
Senate on Thursday night took a preliminary vote on an amendment
that would make the legislation tougher on cigarette makers. More
definitive votes on the tobacco and tax issues seem more likely to
be cast next week.
</P>
<P>
   But every spat and every snag in the Senate makes it more
improbable that a companion measure can get through the House of
Representatives, that all the differences can be worked out and
that an anti-smoking bill acceptable to the White House can be
enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. The outcome could be a steep increase in
the price of cigarettes, new regulation of tobacco products and a
tax cut worth hundreds of dollars a year to families of modest
means.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight, as it developed Thursday, was much more about
politics than substance.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by Republican efforts to shift the focus of the
debate from smoking, where Democrats are comfortable, to taxes,
where Republicans feel on solid ground, Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle moved to force an end to the debate and to bring the
measure to a vote early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to this: Do we get a tobacco bill or
not?'' Daschle declared. ``And we're getting a resounding `no' on
the other side of the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently taken by surprise, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
called the Daschle move counterproductive. ``The well has been
poisoned tremendously,'' he said. Accusing the Democrats of acting
in bad faith, he demanded: ``Do you want a bill or do you want an
issue?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would urge all Republicans to vote against ending the
debate, a procedure called cloture that would require 60 votes for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chief sponsor of the legislation,
has been trying all year to tiptoe along a narrow bipartisan line.
Clearly shaken by Thursday's developments, McCain said that what he
feared worst had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gotten very partisan,'' he said. ``A lot of things
are being said that aren't particularly helpful.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But buttonholed as he walked off the Senate floor, McCain said
that the Daschle move could have the positive effect of stopping
the talking and starting the voting. A few minutes later, he
returned to the floor to say that it made sense to resolve the
situation ``sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on cloture is expected Tuesday. Both sides agreed that
it would not get 60 votes then.
</P>
<P>
   But on contentious measures like this, the Senate often takes
several cloture votes over a period of days or weeks, and the
prevailing view Thursday night was that cloture would eventually be
approved and a tobacco and tax bill would be voted up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Nine weeks ago, by a bipartisan vote of 19-1, the Senate
Commerce Committee approved a bill that would raise the price of
cigarettes by at least $1.10 a pack, give the Food and Drug
Administration added powers to regulate tobacco products and impose
penalties on the cigarette manufacturers if teen-age smoking did
not fall to specified levels.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, before leaving for a 10-day recess for Memorial
Day, the Senate took some preliminary, inconclusive votes. Then,
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, an opponent of the tobacco legislation,
proposed to use much of the revenue raised by the bill to offset
what is called the marriage tax penalty _ the higher tax bill owed
by some couples when they must file joint tax returns instead of
filing as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Senate, unable to reach an agreement to vote on
anything, has done nothing but talk.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans are unenthusiastic about an anti-smoking bill
that they see as a futile big-government response to a public
health problem. But they do not want Democrats to get the political
credit in an election year for a bill pictured as a way to stop
children from getting hooked on cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Democrats by and large are opposed to cutting
taxes, but they do not want Republicans to get credit for a measure
portrayed as eliminating an unfair extra tax on married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle on Thursday offered a Democratic alternative to the
Gramm tax cut. He acknowledged that it stood little chance of
passing. But he wanted to give the Democrats a tax cut with their
name on it to vote for so that the Republicans would not get all
the political benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Lott tried to thwart that tactic by insisting that the Daschle
tax proposal could not be voted on immediately before or
immediately after the Gramm proposal, making it difficult for the
Democrats to pose them as alternative measures.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that if a tobacco bill is passed by the
Senate, a tax cut of some sort will be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   In its first vote in two weeks, the Senate on Thursday night
approved a Democratic amendment that would toughen the penalties on
tobacco companies if teen-age smoking did not fall enough to meet
the bill's annual goals.
</P>
<P>
   Approval came by a voice vote after the Senate voted, 66-29, not
to kill the amendment.

HEARST NEW MEDIA INVESTS IN TWO FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Refiling for those needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Hearst Corporation announced Thursday that it has
made an investment in E Ink Corp., a developer of electronic
displays based on an ``electronic ink'' that can be printed onto
paper and other flexible surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic ink, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Media Lab, could lead to the creation of electronic
books, newspapers and magazines, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic ink technology allows high-resolution text and images
to be displayed in color or black-and-white. A publication using
electronic ink essentially typesets itself, receiving the text and
images either over-the-air or through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Because the information is in electronic form, it can be
continuously updated and easily manipulated, according to the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, this novel technology could dramatically change
the way we publish and distribute our books, magazines and
newspapers,'' said Kenneth A. Bronfin, Hearst New Media &AMP;
Technology senior vice president and deputy group head. ``We look
forward to collaborating with E Ink as they develop this innovation
into products that consumers will want and need.''
</P>
<P>
   Other investors in E Ink include Motorola, Inc. and the
Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst also announced that it has invested in Exodus
Communications Inc., a leading provider of Internet services to
companies using the Internet as a critical part of their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which hosts HomeArts (http://homearts.com) and
other Hearst Web sites, recently placed No. 12 in the Los Angeles
Times 100, a listing of California companies ranked by largest
increase in one-year sales revenue.

U.N. RE-OPENS DISCUSSIONS WITH IRAQ ON WEAPONS AND SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Four months after Secretary General Kofi Annan
stepped in and took charge of a crisis with Iraq, the initiative in
dealing with the government of President Saddam Hussein moved back
this week to the Security Council and the commission charged with
destroying Iraq's prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Two days of technical briefings on the information that Iraq has
been withholding from arms inspectors ended on Thursday with
Richard Butler, the Special Commission's executive chairman,
preparing to go to Baghdad with a list of steps Iraq must take if
sanctions are to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's visit next week will put the onus on Baghdad to meet
the requirements or explain in better detail why it cannot. He will
report back to the council.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday afternoon, Butler said that if
Iraq answers the outstanding questions and meets demands for
material and information, the Security Council could move a long
way toward lifting the eight-year embargo during the next major
review of Iraqi compliance, in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some items on this list that could be done in a day
if we were given the document or the piece of information we
need,'' Butler said. ``I did not say this will be over by October.
But I could foresee a report that was very different from any
previous report.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats who attended the marathon Security Council briefings,
which focused on missing documents and Iraqi concealment policies,
said that the opinions of the two most entrenched sides _ the
United States and Britain on one side and Russia, France and China
on the other _ had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   But these diplomats also said that ``neutral'' countries in the
15-member council were impressed by the depth of information they
were offered and the apparent flexibility the inspectors had shown
in meeting council questions and acknowledging that there might
never be 100 percent compliance in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not always a black or white picture, but a picture
that has all shades,'' said Danilo Turk, the representative of
Slovenia, which holds a rotating council seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presentation was very interesting to the members of the
Security Council who usually don't have access to technical
information,'' he said, speaking of smaller nations. ``We of course
receive reports, which are more summary in character, and it's not
the same thing. Now we are able to learn a bit more about the
technical aspects.''

   Celso L.N. Amorim, Brazil's representative, who had pressed for
a technical briefing and a ``road map'' to help Iraqis understand
what they must do, described Butler's list as ``a good starting
point.'' But he said that ``the details will have to be filled in
with the cooperation of Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   British and U.S. officials hope that the possession of fuller
information will steer some wavering countries away from a movement
to end sanctions soon and will persuade them to be wary of Iraqi
claims to have met all the demands of the council.

<P>
   At his news conference on Thursday, Butler used the example of a
dispute over unaccounted for imported missile fuels that experts
say can be used only on Scud-type engines, which are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Iraqi authorities have attempted to leave council members
with the idea that these fuels aren't unique, that they could be
useful in other Iraqi missile engines, those that they are allowed
to have because the missile would fly less that 150 kilometers,''
Butler said. ``That is not true, and I think the council now
understands that it is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The document Butler will take to Baghdad next week for
discussion on June 13 and 14 with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
lists in only general terms the areas of biological, chemical and
missile programs that need to be addressed. It contains no new
revelations, and is sketchiest on the biological weapons file,
which arms inspectors say is their most difficult and worrisome
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have called it a road map,'' Butler said of the list he
will discuss with Aziz, ``so I've said I would also need to discuss
with him the driving instructions for that road map; that is, how
long it would take, what the stops along the way would be, what
would be the best ways for us to fulfill this list.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAKAYAMA, Japan _ In what colleagues hailed as a historic
landmark, 120 physicists from 23 research institutions in Japan and
the United States announced on Friday that they had found the
existence of mass in a notoriously elusive subatomic particle
called the neutrino.
</P>
<P>
   The neutrino, a particle that carries no electric charge, is so
light that it was assumed for many years to have no mass at all.
After Friday's announcement, cosmologists will have to take account
of the possibility that much of the mass of the universe is in the
form of neutrinos. The discovery will also compel scientists to
revise a highly successful theory of the composition of matter
known as the ``standard model.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the discovery had drawn some 300 physicists gathered
here to discuss neutrino research. Among other things, they said,
the finding of neutrino mass might affect theories about the
formation and evolution of galaxies and the ultimate fate of the
universe. If the neutrino has sufficient mass, their presence
throughout the universe might create enough gravity to slow down
the present expansion of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the newly detected but as yet unmeasured mass of the
neutrino must be too small to cause cosmological effects. But
whatever the case, there was general agreement here that the
discovery will have far-reaching consequences for the investigation
of the nature of matter.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the collaboration of scientists who discovered the
existence of neutrino mass using a huge underground detector called
super-kamiokande, Dr. Takaaki Kajita of the Institute for Cosmic
Ray Research of Tokyo University said that all explanations of the
data collected by the detector except the existence of neutrino
mass had been essentially ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Yoji Totsuka, director of the Kamioka Neutrino Observatory
and leader of the coalition where the underground detector is
located, 30 miles north of here in the Japanese Alps, acknowledged
that his group's announcement was ``very strong.'' He said that
``we have investigated all other possible causes of the effects we
have measured and only neutrino mass remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bahcall, a leading neutrino expert and astrophysical
theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.,
said in an interview that there had been many claims in recent
years for the discovery of neutrino mass by other groups. ``But
this one if by far the most convincing,'' he said. ``Besides the
strong evidence they have found, this team has a magnificent track
record of discoveries.''
</P>
<P>
   But because the elusive particles cannot be seen, the evidence
that they have mass is indirect. Neutrinos come in three types or
``flavors.`` The data gathered by the Super-Kamiokande team during
the two years the detector has operated indicate that at least one
of these three known ``flavors'' or types can ``oscillate'' into
one of the other flavors as it travels along at nearly the speed of
light. According to the theories of quantum mechanics, any particle
capable of transforming itself in this way must have mass.
</P>
<P>
   Study of the neutrino particle has been glacially slow since its
existence was hypothesized in 1931 by the Austrian physicist
Wolfgang Pauli as a way to explain the mysterious loss of energy in
certain nuclear reactions. The particle was finally discovered in
1956 by two physicists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr.
Frederick Reines (for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize) and the
late Dr. Clyde Cowan.
</P>
<P>
   But the knowledge of the particle since then has been acquired
painfully slowly, because neutrinos have no electric charge and
rarely interact with any kind of matter. A neutrino so rarely
collides with an atom of ordinary matter that a typical neutrino
can easily penetrate a one-light-year thickness of lead _ some six
trillion miles _ without hindrance.

WILL U.S. VIEWERS GET KICK FROM WORLD CUP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thirty seven billion people will watch some or all
of the 1998 World Cup tournament on television starting next week,
we're told.
</P>
<P>
   A decimal of a fraction of a milli-percent divided by pi of
those will be residents of the United States, we suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they change the name of this thing to the ``3rd Rock From
The Sun Cup,'' this wonderful cultural sporting event that almost
shuts down the economy in most countries for a month _ sorry, Nike
_ will continue to bounce off satellite dishes and right past the
summer reruns on U.S. distribution services.
</P>
<P>
   Sad but true? Well, probably. This event better suited for the
Discovery Channel instead of the Disney sports-media conglomerate _
more specifically, ABC and ESPN _ is something that should take
place the same year as our presidential elections. That way the
apathy could be measured simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Then why is ABC and ESPN committed to becoming the first U.S.
broadcaster to televise all 64 World Cup games liiiiiiive? Not
because it'll be a ratings success. Because it won't be,
particularly by Nielsen standards, whatever those have become.
</P>
<P>
   It's more cache than cash flow, which is sort of refreshing. And
sort of, but not really, why Fox and CBS (and ABC) thought it was
important to pay billions to the NFL _ the other big-deal sport
known as football _ to shows its games. And why NBC decided it
didn't want to commit what it called financial suicide just to have
those bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   For the kickball fans in the U.S., what could be better than all
64 matches as they're played in France, a nine-hour time difference
from our West Coast?
</P>
<P>
   A three-pronged attack by ABC (which among its 14 games will be
all the U.S. action starting with games June 15, 21 and 25 plus the
final rounds), ESPN (27 games) and ESPN2 (23 games, plus nightly
replays of the game of the day) account for most of the 230 hours
of programming. The circus starts with the Brazil-Scotland
round-robin game Wednesday (8 a.m., ESPN).
</P>
<P>
   Disney's hope is that the viewers support sponsors who've again
agreed not to cut into any live action with those American-pleasing
art forms known as commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not so much about ratings,'' admits David Downs,
ABC's senior VP for network operations and development who put the
U.S. TV deal together for his networks. ``We're not going to
slickly package it. But we can draw in viewers, especially a lot of
the people who learned to appreciate the game in '94 (when World
Cup was played in the U.S. for the first time), if only to
appreciate it for the drama of who advanced and who didn't. Those
people want to come back and we hope this tournament is equally
appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC averaged a 5.3 rating for its '94 World Cup coverage (11
games on the main network). Downs points out that's a better number
than what ABC got for its most recent 26-game college football
season and what NBC did for the recent NBA regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem justifying it,'' Downs continued.
``Certainly it's not going to compare to Olympic rating, but we've
justified it on financial ratings. We think what we're going to be
providing is unadulterated pure sports action. We're giving credit
to American sports fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the problem. This event causes some viewers to
think beyond their own personal space. Some are prepared, but a
bunker mentality might also come in handy if you listen to some
explain why this dreadfully dull game is so worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have more passion for this event than any other
activity on the planet, with the possible exception of war,'' said
Geoffrey Mason, the Cup's executive producer for ABC and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ley, who'll do play-by-play with Seamus Malin on color for
all the marquee games, said, ``We overstate the American
indifference to the sport. It's there to stay on the landscape....
I'd like to think Americans can think outside their own borders.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, they do. Note those gorditas flying out the
drive-through window at Taco Bell. And many Yoshinoyas are open 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where niche sports and narrowcast viewing are where
everything's going, futbol fans have never had it so good. Not even
Spanish-language Univision can handle every game live, since there
are two games played simultaneously twice a day between June 23-26.
</P>
<P>
   Yo quiero World Cup? You got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, this is two 45-minute halves of nonstop
soccer,'' said Downs, ``and you better not go to the bathroom or
you're going to miss something.''
</P>
<P>
   Betcha we don't miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES: Al Michaels' brush with equine greatness. The ABC
sportscaster, who'll host Saturday's coverage of the Belmont Stakes
(1:30 p.m.), found out recently from trainer Bob Baffert that a
horse he once co-owned had maternal bloodlines to Triple Crown
candidate Real Quiet. Michaels' horse, Barraq, was a first cousin
of Real Quiet, according to Baffert's research. Which means if
Michaels still owned the horse, he could make a bundle breeding it.
Alas, Barraq, a Gary Jones-trained allowance horse that won four
times but was wild and ``had horrible habits,'' according to
Michaels, was not only gelded but it went to the big track in the
sky outside a vet clinic at UC Davis. Said Michaels: ``We
considered pulling a Zachary Taylor and trying to exhume the horse
to take some DNA, but. ...'' &QL; 
_The quote from Shaquille O'Neal about Kobe Bryant in a profile
about the Lakers' superteen that's crammed into the 1998 Sports
Hall of Fame feature of Rolling Stone magazine (June 11 issue, page
103).
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES: Al Michaels' brush with graceless cameo work. On
the season return of the HBO drama series ``Arli$$'' (Sunday, 9:30
p.m.), Michaels makes a guest appearance _ again as the cousin of
sports agent Arliss Michaels (the irrepressible !racepay!Robert
Wuhl!off!) _ and partakes in spreading a rumor about a gay NFL
quarterback. Al Davis' people are going to love that.
</P>
<P>
   _Near the end of NBC's coverage of the NBA Finals opener between
Chicago and Utah, with the score 79-all in the final seconds of
regulation, !racepay!Bob Costas!off! says going into a commercial:
``Anyone got a problem with Game 1?'' Yeah, that you'd taint a nice
broadcast with what sounded like a really snotty remark.
</P>
<P>
   _NBC announced that analyst/comic relief !racepay!Bob
Uecker!off! won't be part of the network's postseason baseball
coverage because of pending back surgery. The real news is that NBC
still covers postseason baseball.

MARYLAND TROOPERS STOP DRIVERS BY RACE, SUIT SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ A civil rights group and 11 black motorists filed a
class-action lawsuit in federal court here Thursday charging that
the Maryland state police used race as a factor in stopping and
searching drivers along Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that in their effort to seize illegal drugs
and weapons, troopers tend to stop blacks and members of other
minority groups more often than whites, applying a ``race-based
profile'' that suggests that minorities are more likely to be
engaged in criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is most disturbing,'' said Gary D. Rodwell of
Philadelphia, one of several plaintiffs who spoke at a news
conference to tell of experiences with Maryland troopers who had
stopped them along I-95, only to find nothing illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now,'' Rodwell said, ``I continue to feel pretty
frightened on I-95, particularly after the sun goes down, and I
know I'm pretty much at the whim of people who are supposed to
protect and serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other plaintiffs, Rodwell, a 42-year-old executive, said he
had been detained for an unusually long time, in his case almost an
hour, while he was questioned and his car searched. One plaintiff,
James E. Alston Jr., 38, of Burtonsville, Md., said troopers with a
drug-sniffing dog had searched his luggage and left all his clothes
strewn on the side of the highway. Finding nothing illegal, he
said, they departed, and one told him to ``have a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland officials responded quickly to the accusation of racial
profiling, with a news conference of their own where they denied
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make this crystal clear,'' said Col. David B. Mitchell,
chief of the agency. ``The Maryland state police has not ever, does
not ever and will not ever condone the use of race-based profiling.
It's against the law, and it will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit and Mitchell's reply to it were reminiscent of the
furor created in New Jersey by state troopers' shooting of three
men _ two black, one Hispanic _ in a van that was stopped on the
New Jersey Turnpike on April 23. Like Mitchell, Col. Carl Williams,
the superintendent of the New Jersey state police, denied the
subsequent accusations of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The section of the turnpike where the New Jersey shooting
occurred is Interstate 95, a Maine-to-Florida superhighway that
links large cities like New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and
Jacksonville. I-95 is well known among law-enforcement agencies as
a major conduit for drug smugglers and gun runners, but plucking
the criminals from the huge volume of traffic can be a daunting
task. The police here said Thursday that 111 million drivers a year
travel along Maryland's stretch of the Interstate alone.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent years, the Maryland state police, among other
agencies, have intensified their enforcement efforts along the
highway. That led to litigation as early as 1993, when the American
Civil Liberties Union sued the state of Maryland on behalf of
Robert Wilkins, a lawyer who was stopped and searched the year
before because, he contended, he fit a racial profile.
</P>
<P>
   The state police denied the charge but agreed in a settlement to
maintain computer records on I-95 searches to track any patterns of
discrimination. Convinced by last year that little had changed, the
ACLU asked a federal court here to review the state police efforts.
Judge Catherine Blake found that discrimination against minority
motorists had not ended and ordered that the record-keeping
continue for another year.
</P>
<P>
   It was largely upon that determination that the civil liberties
union advertised for plaintiffs. Rodwell and 10 others agreed to
join the suit, along with the Maryland State Conference of branches
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, who seek unspecified damages and name Mitchell
and 22 other officers and troopers as defendants, maintain that
about 75 percent of speeders who were stopped along the state's
northern stretch of I-95 during a three-year period through last
December were white but that about 70 percent of all people stopped
by troopers there were black.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Keven L. Gray, commander of the barracks whose troopers
patrol the section of I-95 at issue, and himself a defendant in the
case, said he did not know where the civil liberties union's
lawyers got those numbers. The suit, however, says they came from
the computerized records that the state police were ordered to
maintain.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, at their own news conference the police produced
other statistics, which showed, they suggested, that justice had
been more evenly applied. Mitchell referred to charts showing that
over a 21-month period through March of this year, troopers under
Gray's command stopped more than twice as many white drivers
(32,727) as black (14,048).
</P>
<P>
   But more blacks than whites were searched, 187 to 166. As for
those arrested, 83 were black and 58 white.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the facts ``speak for themselves, but they do not
support the accusations'' of the plaintiffs.

NICHOLS SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE IN OKLAHOMA BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Ohio)  (th) 
 By JO THOMAS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Calling him ``an enemy of the Constitution,'' a federal
judge Thursday sentenced Terry Nichols to life in prison without
the possibility of parole for conspiring to bomb the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, the deadliest terrorist
attack ever on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   In passing sentence after hearing from relatives of some of the
168 people who died in the blast, Judge Richard P. Matsch, who
presided over the trials of Nichols and his co-conspirator, Timothy
McVeigh, for the first time expressed his view of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a murder case,'' Matsch said. ``It is a crime and
the victims have spoken eloquently here. But it is not a crime as
to them so much as it is a crime against the Constitution of the
United States. That's the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols was convicted last December of conspiring with McVeigh
to use a weapon of mass destruction in the April 19, 1995 bombing
in Oklahoma City, but acquitted of federal murder charges in the
deaths of eight federal agents who died.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in those
deaths and Thursday was given the maximum sentence of six years in
prison for each, to run concurrently with his life sentence. He was
also acquitted of actually committing the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors presented evidence the Nichols and McVeigh saw the
bombing as retribution for the government raid on the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, his face pale and still, said nothing as the judge
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, his lawyer, Michael Tigar, urged Matsch to ``stem the
cry for vengeance.'' But 12 relatives of bombing victims pleaded
tearfully that Nichols be given the maximum sentence for his role
in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence in this case shows that Terry Nichols
participated in a plot to undermine that government,'' Matsch said.
``He joined with those who think of the United States government as
some kind of occupying foreign power or some kind of oppressive
force that is taking away the freedom of the people of this
nation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Matsch read the preamble to the Constitution, setting out the
purposes of the nation's government, and asked, ``What was going on
in the Alfred Murrah building on April 19, 1995?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he named the agencies in the building, one by one, where
workers were trying, on the morning they were bombed, to do what
was called for in the Constitution _ establish justice, insure
domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense and promote
the general welfare. Meanwhile, some of their children played
nearby in the day care center in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the purpose of this conspiracy?'' Matsch asked. ``The
evidence shows to my satisfaction that the intention was to
disrupt, to disorganize, to intimidate the operations of these
agencies and United States Government. Apparently, the intention
was that the response would be fear and terror and intimidation,
and that these people would not be able to perform their work and
that the response throughout the nation would be hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting that all the events of `The Turner Diaries'
were planned,'' he continued, referring to the anti-semitic novel
that was a favorite with both McVeigh and Nichols. ``The only
interference is that there was an intention to change the course of
government through fear and intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work out that way,'' he added. ``There was no
anarchy. There was no reign of terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, as spectators and lawyers filed out of the
courthouse into a chilly spring rain, Larry Mackey, the lead
prosecutor, echoed the judge's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols were wrong about America. They
could launch a violent, ugly, horrifyingly horrible act against
innocent people,'' he said, but ``they have been defeated. The plot
failed. The success happened in this courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigar vowed to appeal, saying, ``There is a building across the
street. It is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. We
are prepared to be in this case all the way for the vindication of
Terry Nichols.''
</P>
<P>
   As Thursday's sentencing hearing began, bombing victims came to
the lectern, most of them weeping, to tell the judge of their
experiences and plead with him for a life sentence for Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Battreall told of her agony when her brother, Harley
Richard Cottingham, crushed under nine floors of concrete in the
offices of the Defense Investigative Services, was ``shipped as
freight to his home state in Nebraska and unloaded by a forklift''
from the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas trees were his hobby, she said. He planted 500
seedlings every year, and he hoped to raise them and play golf when
he retired. ``All these plans were blown up on April 19, 1995 by
selfish individuals who hated the government,'' she said. ``Even
hearing the name Oklahoma City sends chills down your spine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharilee Lyons, who works for the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, told the judge her desk fell seven floors on the
day of the bombing, but she survived because she had not come to
work that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live with a tremendous amount of guilt,'' she said. She has
moved to Cleveland to work ``but the grief follows me everywhere I
go. The past three years have been one continuous nightmare. Inside
I feel just as dead as the 168 people who were murdered. It's a
type of life sentence to lose so much, so many, so precious to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Jones, whose pregnant daughter Carrie Lenz died in the
offices of the Drug Enforcement Agency, said she doesn't know what
to say when people she meets ask if she has children. She has told
her granddaughter that Mrs. Lenz is in heaven, but ``one day she
told me she wished Carrie would stop being an angel so she could
see her.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Moser, who found her her husband Calvin Moser alive in
the wreckage, said she has not been able to sleep through the night
since the bombing. She was asked to help that day, she explained,
by taking blankets to the plaza at the foot of the shattered
building, and realized, to her shock, that they were to cover the
tiny bodies of dead infants.
</P>
<P>
   She touched one baby ``and whispered, `It's OK, baby. It's
OK,''' she said, but the baby was dead. Now, she continued, ``when
I see these mothers with empty arms, I wonder, was that your baby I
kissed on his way to heaven?''

SELF-REGULATION OF INTERNET COMPANIES IS POOR, SAYS FTC 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Civil liberties advocates and children's groups
urged the White House on Thursday to abandon its hands-off stance
to Internet privacy regulation after a Federal Trade Commission
report painted a dismal picture of the effectiveness of companies'
self-regulation, especially in regard to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the Clinton administration policy has been an
abysmal failure,'' said Jeff Chester of the Center for Media
Education, an electronic media public-interest group based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After the FTC report was released Thursday morning, the agency's
chairman, Robert Pitofsky, called its conclusions ``disappointing''
but declined to call self-regulation a failure. ``I still believe
that the best way to deal with this is self-regulation rather than
heavy-handed government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC, which surveyed 1,400 Web sites in March, found that a
year after the agency had warned businesses of the need to adopt
strong privacy guidelines to avoid government regulation, 92
percent of all Web sites collected personal information from users
and only 14 percent of those sites disclosed how that information
was used.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling to the FTC was the finding that 89 percent of the
children's sites surveyed collected personal information. Of those,
only 23 percent told children to seek parental permission, 7
percent said they would notify parents of their
information-gathering practices, and less than 10 percent provided
for parental control over the collection and use of the
information.
</P>
<P>
   At one Web site, the agency said, children were asked to give
their names, addresses, e-mail addresses, ages and whether they
ever received gifts of stocks, cash, savings bonds or certificates
of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites gave away candy for providing an e-mail address.
Others used games, surveys and popular animated characters to
persuade children to give their names, e-mail addresses and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   Also troubling, the report said, was the amount of data
collected by interactive public areas like chat rooms, which are
accessible to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``These activities enable children to communicate freely with
strangers, including adults,'' the report said. Investigation by
the FBI and Justice Department, it said, ``has revealed that online
services and bulletin boards are quickly becoming the most powerful
resources used by predators to identify and contact children.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that Congress pass legislation to require
that Web sites collecting personal information from children
younger than 12 notify parents and obtain consent to collect the
information. The FTC, Pitofsky said, will continue to evaluate the
broader issues of Internet privacy and make recommendations later
this year on whether protections are needed for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, an online advocacy group, called on the FTC to ask
Congress for authority to immediately adopt rules to protect
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punting this issue to Congress without taking this first step
may result in a political nightmare for the Internet community,
with controls on content and moves to a national identification
scheme for the Net,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, said the FTC report failed to address all of the critical
issues. ``We wanted to see them make a clear statement on the need
for protecting the anonymity of people on the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg, however, said he was not concerned about Congress
taking on the issue. ``Part of the problem is that the FTC has been
holding on to the ball and not letting people run with it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who really need to do something are the people in
the White House,'' Rotenberg said. He said Ira Magaziner, Clinton's
Internet adviser, had been ``traveling the world telling everyone
that self-regulation works. The message is clear: self-regulation
has not worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner was traveling on Thursday and could not immediately be
reached for comment. But Commerce Secretary William Daley was
critical of the progress made by industry to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said he and other officials had warned the industry that
it must move more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a critical mass of the companies to make
self-regulation work, and we haven't seen that yet,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is supposed to make a full report to the
White House in July on whether self-regulation is working. Business
groups insist it is and are pleading for more time to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   The Direct Marketing Association, for example, has endorsed
privacy policies similar to those recommended by the FTC and is
working to educate businesses of the need to follow the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The association said its own survey in May of the top 100
children's Web sites showed that 70 percent posted privacy polices,
compared with 38 percent in January.

HOUSE DEFEATS BID TO ALLOW PRAYER IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House turned back an attempt Thursday by social
conservatives to amend the Constitution so that prayer services and
other religious expression could be organized on school grounds and
other public places.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the effort to establish organized prayer in the
nation's schools and give tax breaks to religious groups failed to
win the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution. The
vote was 224-203.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure hailed its defeat as a victory for the
continued separation of church and state as established by the
nation's founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, opponents dismissed the
proposal authored by Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., as little more
than effort by the religious right to impose its views and beliefs
on the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional appeal to his colleagues, Edwards called the
amendment ``a horrible solution in search of a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would have prohibited infringement of the right to
pray in public places or make other expressions of religious
beliefs and traditions. Opponents argued that its language could
have also allowed for public funding of religious schools or other
religious activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Istook amendment, in the name of protecting religion,
would harm religion by getting the federal government more involved
in religious matters,'' said Edwards, adding that the measure
``would open school doors to government-sanctioned prayer'' and
allow the government to endorse religious messages and give
religious groups tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, he said ``America's public schools would look like
a big-city airport with every religious group, cult and sect
pushing their practices and beliefs on our children.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, who argued
that the amendment would allow the state to ``usurp'' his authority
as a parent to pass on his religious beliefs to his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is where this amendment is headed. And I am offended by
those who seek to impose their will on my children absent my
consent. Each of us is less free when government is given the power
to intrude on this right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, however, argued that the Istook amendment would
simply correct a long history of Supreme Court decisions that
placed unfair restrictions on the public expression of religious
views. They cited a number of recent decisions limiting the rights
of individuals and groups to organize prayer services and Bible
clubs in schools, or, in one case, to construct a nativity scene on
government property.
</P>
<P>
   ``With increasing hostility and insensitivity, our courts have
systematically stripped us of our First Amendment right to basic
and fundamental rights of religious expression,'' said Rep. Bob
Riley, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters, many of them Democrats, argued that the
Constitution provides more protection for pornographers and
politicians than it does for people who practice their religion.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the House marked the first time since 1971 that
lawmakers had taken a stand on the issue, which was brought to the
floor after House Republican leaders promised religious
conservatives in a meeting several weeks ago that they would
continue to push for passage of a school prayer amendment and other
conservative legislative items.
</P>
<P>
   The Istook amendment was pushed hard by the Christian Coalition
and other conservative religious groups. They organized a
letter-writing and telephone campaign in an attempt to persuade
members. They also attacked Edwards as a religious bigot and
threatened to campaign against any lawmaker who voted against the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In a flier sent to the Texan's constituents in Waco, the
Christian Coalition said ``Edwards' bigotry directed at Christians
and other people of faith is outrageous and must be stopped.'' The
flyer said that his ``attitudes have no place in Texas or anywhere
in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Edwards prompted Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C., one of
153 co-sponsors of the amendment, to withdraw his support and
denounce Istook and the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not Christian,'' Hefner told Istook during the debate,
calling Edwards ``one of the finest ... most moral and most devoted
family men'' in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hefner, a gospel singer and devoutly religious man, also took on
another co-sponsor of the legislation who told members before the
vote that if they failed to support the Istook amendment God would
send them to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared to support this amendment ... but I'll take my
chances,'' Hefner said.
</P>

SWISS BANKS SAID TO OFFER HOLOCAUST PAYMENT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Switzerland's three major commercial banks have
offered a settlement totaling more than $1 billion to end suits
brought by Holocaust victims and their survivors who contend that
the banks failed to return their assets after World War II,
according to people familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, made late last week, days before the New York State
Banking Department was scheduled to decide whether to approve the
merger of the New York branches of two of the banks, the Union Bank
of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corp., to form the world's third
largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Banking Board approved the merger Thursday, after declaring
that the Swiss institutions had undergone a ``sea change in their
attitude'' and had opened long-secret records that enabled bank
inspectors to trace accounts that had been dormant.
</P>
<P>
   The World Jewish Congress, a pivotal negotiator in the tense
talks between the banks and Holocaust survivors, offered no
objections Thursday, another sign that settlement negotiations are
making rapid progress.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between those two banks and the third, Credit
Suisse, as well as lawyers for more than 40,000 plaintiffs and
Jewish groups, will resume on Friday at the Four Seasons Hotel in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Thursday afternoon run by Stuart Eizenstat,
the undersecretary of state for economic affairs, all sides
appeared to be moving toward an agreement that could total $1.6
billion or more. During the call lawyers for the banks said the
chief executives of the major Swiss banks would be available, by
telephone, to participate in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems quite unlikely that a final deal will be struck for
several weeks. ``There is a lot of haggling remaining,'' said one
person at the talks, which are under rules of strict
confidentiality. ``And it's always possible that things could fall
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   In March the Swiss banks reversed their previous stance and
agreed to negotiate a global settlement for all the Holocaust
suits. Thursday it appeared that a settlement would include several
elements.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the class-action suit, which is meant to
include all surviving Holocaust victims and many of their heirs,
could receive more than $1 billion. Several hundred million dollars
_ up to $600 million by some accounts _would go to a fund intended
chiefly for indigent Holocaust survivors, including those who had
no deposits in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   And there would be a ``rough justice'' fund for settlements with
survivors and heirs who could show that their families had some
money in Swiss banks but could not produce exact records.
</P>
<P>
   The shape of the deal is under negotiation, however, and one
person close to the talks said, ``Getting the two sides to come to
an agreement may be easier than getting the claimants to agree with
each other or getting the Swiss to agree with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The banks have a clear incentive to settle. Their business in
the United States has been harmed by the threat of sanctions in New
York City and California.
</P>
<P>
   But the Swiss National Bank, Switzerland's central bank, has
refused to take part in settlement talks. A Swiss historical
commission and the State Department, which issued a final report
this week on Nazi gold issues, have determined that the Swiss
National Bank accepted the vast majority of the gold looted by the
Nazis, including gold taken from the homes and, sometimes, the
bodies of Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   The gold was smelted into bars to hide its origin and pay for
war materiel for the German military, the State Department report
said.
</P>
<P>
   This week lawyers representing the Holocaust victims said that
they planned to sue the Swiss National Bank this week. But Thursday
they decided to postpone that move, hoping to reach a settlement
with the private banks first. Such an agreement would add to the
pressure on the Swiss government to reach a parallel settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The merger approval from the New York Banking Department is a
victory for the banks, which agreed to make some extraordinary
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The acting superintendent of banks, Elizabeth McCaul, said in an
interview Thursday that the banks had allowed inspectors to review
records of the banks' activities in the United States during the
war, including records of accounts that could have belonged to
Holocaust victims. Some were found in storage upstate.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time American bank inspectors were also allowed to
review records in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The banks also put ``hundreds of people into the search'' for
long-dormant accounts, Ms. McCaul said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have trust in the bank management,'' she added. ``We
didn't have that before.''

AS ALBANIANS FLEE KOSOVO, ALBANIA CALLS FOR FOREIGN INTERVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ As thousands of ethnic Albanians fled Thursday into
Albania from strife in Serbia's Kosovo province, Albania's foreign
minister, Paskal Milo, warned that the region is on the brink of
``open war'' and urged international intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In Tirana, a spokesman for Prime Minister Fatos Nano said
Albania is relying on help from NATO. ``We appeal to NATO,'' Ben
Blushi said. ``We will appeal to them to at least protect our
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany urged NATO to decide swiftly whether to dispatch troops.
``It's important that NATO reach its decision very quickly,'' said
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who added that ``thousands, perhaps
tens of thousands'' of refugees were fleeing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees,
nearly 7,000 have arrived in northern Albania and thousands more
are said to be crossing the mountains to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a NATO military reconnaissance team arrived in the
Macedonia Thursday to assess whether NATO troops should be
dispatched to the Albanian and Macedonian borders. Last week, NATO
ruled out sending forces immediately but said it would consider
deployment as an option.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member team had not been expected to report their
findings until late June, according to NATO sources.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to a NATO diplomat in Brussels, ``This work may
be speeded up'' due to the rising tide of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO defense ministers, including Defense Secretary William S.
Cohen of the United States, will meet next week in Brussels to
discuss the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Western powers fear that the conflict will spread into Albania
and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovan refugees began pouring into Albania over the weekend
after the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, intensified his
crackdown against the Kosovo Liberation Army, an armed separatist
movement based there.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's
population, have campaigned peacefully in the past for autonomy
from Serbia. But these efforts have yielded little, and the
popularity of the KLA has grown as a result.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after the KLA attacked Serb policemen, Milosevic
responded with force. Attacks on villages suspected of harboring
KLA fighters left scores of ethnic Albanians dead.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the two sides broke down in the wake of Serbia's
most recent attacks last week on three areas believed to be
strongholds for KLA soldiers. An estimated 250 Kosovo Albanians
have died since February.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian media reported that the military operation was to end
today. But Serbian paramilitary forces were reportedly still
shelling the Decani-Djakovica region of Kosovo Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Western reporters, who got within five miles of Djakovica, saw
Serbian army convoys carrying heavy artillery. An offensive near
the town of Glodjane was reportedly stalled, according to Serbian
independent radio.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of refugees into in Albania, the poorest country in
Europe, poses serious problems for it. They are largely women and
children who arrive exhausted and often injured, according to High
Commission spokesman Maki Shinohara, speaking by telephone from
Geneva. And the mountaineous border area into which they are
pouring is Albania's poorest. It has few jobs, poor housing, and
little food or drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   In Tirana, government spokesman Blushi said Albania will soon
stagger under the refugee burden. ``We can't take care of more than
20,000,'' Blushi said. The Albanian Interior Ministry estimates the
number of refugees at 11,000, nearly twice the High Commission
count.
</P>
<P>
   In a possible hardening of its position, the Albanian Socialist
Party, headed by Prime Minister Nano, said in a statement Thursday
that it supports the ``resistance and determination'' of the Kosovo
Albanians in the face of Milosevic's ``mad dream'' to ``drive away
from their lands two million Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania had won international praise for its restraint in the
face of mounting violence in Kosovo, and it refused to intervene
over the future of the province.
</P>
<P>
   But Western diplomats Thursday dismissed the Socialist Party
statement, noting that Albania has neither the military firepower
nor the desire to become involved. Analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way the Albanians could take on the Yugoslav
forces,'' said Paul Beaver of Jane's Defense Weekly. ``The
Yugoslavs have better tanks, better communication, better
helicopters, better artillery.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ English can still be a riddle to 60-year-old
Rosario Gomez, even after three decades here in a house with red
and yellow roses in the front yard on Chicago Street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But her two adult children, both of whom were born in Los
Angeles and enrolled in bilingual education classes in grade
school, have good jobs, bright futures and are literate and fluent
in English and Spanish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That, Mrs. Gomez explained, is why her family voted no in
Tuesday's primary election here on Proposition 227, the nationally
watched initiative that will dismantle 30 years of bilingual
education in California. The measure easily passed with 61 percent
of the vote. But despite pre-election polls suggesting it would
also carry a majority of Latinos, fewer than 4-in-10 Latinos who
voted favored the proposition in the end, after an all-out blitz
against the measure by almost every elected Latino official in the
state. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, in more than two dozen interviews on the largely Latino
east side of Los Angeles, even some of the Latinos who voted no,
such as Mrs. Gomez's daughter, Elva Osorio, expressed deep concern
about the state of bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in school, bilingual education was much better than
it is now,'' Mrs. Osorio said. ``I voted no, but I knew it was
going to lose, because a lot of people are upset that their kids
don't know how to speak English and they're in the fifth grade.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting Latinos like the Gomez family to vote yes was a priority
for Ron Unz, a conservative Republican and the main sponsor and
financial backer of the measure, which will essentially eliminate
bilingual education in California if it survives court challenges.
His campaign spent a lot of time and energy wooing Latinos, hoping
to avoid the racially charged atmosphere that surrounded earlier
ballot initiative drives in California, on subjects like
affirmative action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite those efforts, words like ``racism,'' ``prejudice''
and ``discrimination'' often came up in interviews after Tuesday's
primary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is racism towards us,'' said Rito Mateos, a
32-year-old gardener, who voted no. ``This is a threat to the
community. It's not going to stop here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gomez said she knew of no one on her block who voted yes.
``I think it passed because a lot of American people are tired of
us,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No matter how they voted, the Latino parents, telephone
operators, construction workers, flight instructors and others
interviewed all agreed on one issue: for immigrant children,
whether they are from Mexico or Vietnam, the key to unlocking the
treasures of America is to learn English as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted no, but it was hard for me to make up my mind,'' said
Gloria Luna, 65, whose great-grandmother was ``born in this state
when it was Mexico.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Luna said she decided to vote against 227 because so many
educators opposed it, saying its provision to provide non-English
speaking public school children with only one year of intensive
language training before sending them into mainstream classes would
do more harm than good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so important for Hispanics to learn English,'' Mrs. Luna
said, ``but one year is much too fast.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Gomez and Mateos, Mrs. Luna said she suspected that
prejudice and not pedagogy was at the root of the campaign to
eliminate bilingual education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people who voted,'' Luna said, ``don't know
anything about education.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Feria, 44, agreed with Mrs. Luna, up to a point. Feria, a
flight instructor, was working in his family's wallet stand on
Olvera Street, the oldest street in Los Angeles, when he took time
out to talk about the initiative. He said anyone with the slightest
knowledge of education would have voted yes for 227 _ as he did. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe, the only way to learn English is to be
immersed in it,'' said Feria, who did not take part in bilingual
classes when he was in school. ``I wouldn't have a job as a flight
instructor if I didn't have the proper English skills.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Feria said the teachers and politicians who opposed 227 did so
because they were afraid they would lose their money and influence
if bilingual education is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a money grab,'' Feria said. ``We do our kids a
disfavor by putting them in bilingual education.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As she walked through Olvera Street near downtown, past the
wallet stands, sandal stalls and booths selling Day of the Dead
figures, Mirian Luis, 22, a paralegal's assistant, said she voted
no on 227 because her nieces and nephews are doing well in
bilingual education programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joke,'' she said of the proposition. ``I mean, how are
the kids going to learn?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, on Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, George Ramos was
hanging orange and yellow flyers, balloons and a Mexican flag
advertising his travel business. He voted yes on Proposition 226,
because, he said, ``This is America.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is supposed to speak English,'' Ramos said. ``If you
go to France, you don't ask for bilingual education. If you go to
China, you cannot request bilingual education. They will kick you
out of there.'' &QL;
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At El Mercado, a warehouse-like complex of shops and restaurants
not far from Chavez Avenue, Manuel Romero, a retired General Motors
worker, said he voted for 227 because there are not enough
qualified teachers to adequately staff bilingual education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the state department of education said it is 20,000
bilingual education teachers short of what it needs. The state said
there are 1.4 million public school pupils with limited English
skills in California. Thirty percent of those students are in
bilingual classes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had quality teachers,'' Romero said, ``it would be
OK.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerry and Diana Ontiveros voted no. They grew up in a largely
white neighborhood in Whittier and attended Catholic schools before
going to college and getting married. They did not take part in
bilingual programs. They were surrounded by English speakers
everywhere they went, which is not the case for many immigrant
children who often live in segregated and isolated neighborhoods. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been assimilated into the mainstream culture all of my
life,'' Ontiveros said. ``Others haven't had the opportunities I've
had, and that's why I support bilingual education.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Moreno, a 30-year-old teacher's assistant, eating lunch at
El Mercado, said he voted for the proposition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like maybe bilingual education is like a handicap or
something,'' he said. ``It gives the kids too much leeway not to
learn.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maria Tovar said she voted for 227, but by mistake. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tovar said she supports bilingual education and thought a
yes vote meant saving the program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When she came to the United States 25 years ago at the age of
14, Ms. Tovar said, she did not speak or understand English and
struggled in school to learn without a bilingual program. Several
of her classmates were not as determined, she said, and they
dropped out, never learning the language. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very tough,'' she said, ``trying to learn English
without bilingual education.''

CATALOGING MISERY: TWA CRASH VICTIMS' BELONGINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If it is possible to catalog heartbreak, then the
workers at the hangar in Calverton, N.Y., where the ruins of TWA
Flight 800 are stored, have done it. It takes the form of a blue
plastic three-ring binder, with 200 pages of color photos of
personal belongings, from cameras to underwear to hair dryers _
anything that 230 people could bring aboard a Boeing 747 for a long
trip abroad, and that a diver could then bring up from the bottom
of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly two years after the crash, cataloging misery is
evidently easier than reclaiming it. Copies of the catalog went out
to families of the victims months ago, but most of the items are
still, in the investigators' word, ``unaffiliated,'' stored in 200
cardboard barrels a few yards from the scaffolding that holds
together the shattered remains of the aircraft itself.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, in an experiment in sensitivity that is intended
to avoid the legal problems and ugly public disputes involving
families of previous crash victims, federal officials will begin a
new effort to identify the belongings and return what they can, and
to figure out what to do with the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all here,'' said Peter Goelz, the managing director of
the National Transportation Safety Board, holding a copy of the
catalog. ``But you have to have a strong constitution to go through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The belongings, about 2,000 items in all, encompass the detritus
of modern life _ the undistinguishable rows of men's underwear and
blue jeans _ as well as more individualized items that are more
personal. There is the family snapshot, two boys waving playfully,
one with his arm latched around the neck of the other. There is the
brown teddy bear, with beady yellow glass eyes, dressed in
blue-and-white striped t-shirt with matching cap, perhaps belonging
to a dead passenger, perhaps being carried as a gift to a child in
Paris, where the plane was bound from New York's Kennedy
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the items shown in the catalog have gone unclaimed,
with some relatives saying they did not want to reopen emotional
wounds and others saying it was difficult to make out the
belongings in the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Like some other family members, Ron Yee _ whose sister Judith
Yee and cousin Patricia Loo were on board _ had already received
some personal effects after the crash. He put some ``little bits
and pieces of this and that'' in the crypt where his sister's ashes
are interred, he said Thursday, and has some others in a sealed box
at his home in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   When the catalog reached him, he said, he realized there might
have been more of their belongings pictured inside, but ``it
crossed my mind that at this point, I really didn't want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB's new effort to deal with the items will begin Friday,
when, with the help of five volunteer relatives of the dead,
workers from the NTSB's family assistance team will begin the task
of sorting through the barrels to decide what is worth trying to
place _ a pair of plastic swim flippers, a ``Conair''-brand hair
dryer, with the anti-shock safety plug still attached, a T-shirt
that says ``Harley Davidson,'' and three small electronic devices
that look from the FBI's evidence photo to be tape players or
radios, each still in its original packaging, a clear plastic
bubble over a cardboard card.
</P>
<P>
   There are pairs of shoes, single shoes, floral print dresses and
toiletries kits. There are neckties that look, in the photos at
least, good enough to wear, and carry-on bags that look like they
have been through something horrible, like an explosion and fall
from 13,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Carven, whose sister Paula, and her 9-year-old son, Jay,
were on board, is one of the five relatives who will assist the
Safety Board. ``If you didn't get anything back, if you didn't get
any luggage but for a pair of pants or a torn T-shirt,'' Carven
said Thursday, ``I can see where it would be very important.''
</P>
<P>
   What the teams decide is not identifiable or not worth trying to
return to families will be set aside, with no decision yet on what
happens next. The material could be cremated and buried at a
memorial park, or could be boxed and stored indefinitely, like the
wreckage of planes themselves. ``It's very difficult to say `oh,
this is worthless and nobody'll want this and throw it away,' and
God forbid, it's somebody's last remnant that some family could
point to,'' said Carven, a lawyer in Bel Air, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Carven pointed to the importance for his family of the recovery
of jewelry that had belonged to his sister.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, he said, wears Paula's jewelry recovered from the
crash. ``My mother doesn't go a day without wearing most of it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A shorter list of items, maybe 200, will go into a new catalog
with clearer pictures, to be recirculated among the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   John Holst, of Smithtown, N.Y., whose son and daughter-in-law
were on the flight, said he was glad that the Safety Board was
making the effort. One part of that effort is taking better photos;
the ones in the first catalog were FBI evidence pictures, with some
items in plastic bags with the word, in block capitals,
``EVIDENCE.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has learned that the fate of crash-related objects has
the capacity to inflict pain on the relatives. In Pittsburgh, for
example, in January 1995, four months after a USAir 727
mysteriously rolled over and crashed, relatives of the dead got in
a screaming match with airline representatives in the lobby of the
Hilton Hotel, where the NTSB was holding a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it had about 70 pieces of jewelry and other
personal effects from the 132 passengers, and told the families
that these would be available for pick-up at the airport; some of
the relatives asked the airline to bring the items to the downtown
area so they could try to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   After the TWA Flight 800 crash, Congress passed the Aviation
Disaster Family Assistance Act, which gives the NTSB custody of
passengers' items and put it in charge of coordinating help to
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of victims in other crashes say they suspect that
before the law changed, airlines tried to destroy personal effects
rather than return them, to prevent families from entering them as
evidence in court cases.
</P>
<P>
   Because Flight 800 crashed at sea, and TWA argued that it was
not required to pay for the recovery of the wreckage and did not
want to, the federal government paid and legally has custody of the
items.
</P>
<P>
   And the NTSB is determined to consult with relatives every step
of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Abe, deputy director for family affairs at the NTSB, said
that when families identified belongings, they would be asked if
they wanted the items back as is, or cleaned, or if they wanted the
NTSB to destroy them. It is important, he said, for families to
have the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the NTSB cannot identify the items, he said, ``in many
cases, it's the effort that makes the difference to the families.''
</P>
<P>
   For Holst and his family, the emotional process has been one
they have dealt with step by step, and will continue to do if some
of his son's belongings are identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happens, we'll deal with it,'' he said. ``It's not
something I'll be looking forward to.''

 TAKAYAMA, JAPAN: without hindrance. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But once in a great while a neutrino does hit an atom and the
resulting blast of nuclear debris supplies clues about the neutrino
itself. The debris generally includes many particles that can race
through water, mineral oil or even ice, sending shock waves of blue
light through the liquid or ice. This light, called Cherenkov
radiation, can be detected by sensitive light sensors and measured.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few decades, scientists have learned that matter
is made up of three distinct flavors or types. This means that
there are three flavors of neutrinos _ the electron neutrino
associated with the electron; the muon neutrinos associated with
the muon particle, which is a kind of fat electron, and the tau
neutrino, associated with the tau particle, an even fatter relative
of the electron.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the muon and tau particles along with their
associated neutrinos has mystified physicists ever since their
discoveries. ``Who ordered that?`` the Nobel-winning physicist
Isidor Rabi is said to have remarked when the muon was found.
</P>
<P>
   The Super-Kamiokande detector was built two years ago as a joint
Japanese-American experiment. It is essentially a water tank the
size of a large cathedral installed in a deep zinc mine one mile
inside a mountain 30 miles north of here. When neutrinos slice
through the tank, one of them occasionally makes its presence known
by colliding with an atom, which sends blue light through the water
to an array of detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous volume of water in the detector increased the
likelihood of neutrino impacts to the point at which the discovery
of neutrino mass became possible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Super-Kamiokande collaboration is studying several neutrino
phenomenon simultaneously, but the one that led to Friday's
announcement was based on ``atmospheric'' neutrinos created when
highly energetic cosmic ray particles from deep space slam into the
Earth's upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists knew that different flavors of neutrino constantly
arrive from the upper atmosphere, and they have calculated on the
basis of well-established theory that the ratio between muon
nutrinos and other flavors must have a certain value. But over the
years detectors found only about half the muon neutrinos predicted
by theory.
</P>
<P>
   However, Super-Kamiokande not only has enormous sensitivity but
it can sort out neutrino tracks according to their energies and the
directions from which they came.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent shortage of muon neutrinos was explained by the
recent observations that led to Friday's announcement. The
physicists found that when neutrinos coming from the sky directly
over the Super Kamiokande detector _ a relatively short distance _
the proportion of muon neutrinos among them was higher than among
the neutrinos coming up from beneath the detector after having
passed through the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists reasoned that by traveling through the entire
Earth these neutrinos had had time to ``oscillate,'' probably many
times, between muon neutrinos and some other type, especially the
tau neutrino, and this accounts for the deficit seen in muon
neutrinos. (The tau neutrino has not yet been directly detected but
it must exist to make observations consistent.)
</P>
<P>
   A related but different problem has to do with neutrinos
produced by the fusion process in the sun. This multi-step process,
which merges the nuclei of hydrogen atoms to form helium nuclei and
energy, produces neutrinos. Astrophysicists believe they understand
the mechanism in complete detail.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that all the best detectors ever built find far
fewer neutrinos than should be present according to understanding
of the fusion reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Super-Kamiokande collaboration (and most other
physicists) believe the anomoly can be explained by the oscillation
of detectable solar nutrinos into types that cannot be detected by
existing instruments. But so far no one has proven this
explanation.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ With all the pomp and pomposity at Harvard's
362nd commencement Thursday, there came one oasis-like moment of
reassurance, both divine and earthly, for young souls queasy with
fear at the thought of exiting the yard and entering the world.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Senior Class Chapel, it was a peculiarly Harvard rite _
like much on this day of arcane black-and-crimson procession _ but
a low-key one, not mentioned in the official program. It was
attended only by seniors themselves, herded in double file just
before the commencement, but in numbers so strong that some had to
sit on the aisle floors of the university's nondenominational
Memorial Church.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual included no Latin, no big words, no complex thoughts
and no denial of the psychological truth that even for those who
fancy themselves the best and the brightest, graduation can be
streaked by stark terror.
</P>
<P>
   It is to address that anxiety that the Rev. Peter Gomes, the
Plummer professor of Christian morals, minister of the Memorial
Church and author of popular books on the Bible, has for years
ushered seniors through a special commencement sermon meant to
soothe them with humor and, believers or not, with unabashedly
religious solace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to be sent out of here for good, and most of you
aren't ready to go,'' Gomes, gowned in cherry red, told more than
1,000 seniors in genteelly ringing tones that called to mind a
cross between a Shakespearean actor and the sitcom character
Frasier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is about to bid you into the fellowship of
educated men and women, and you know,'' he paused and slowed,
``just _ how _ dumb _ you _ really _ are.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused again for the cheers of agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``And worse than that, the world _ and your parents in
particular _ are going to expect that you will now be among the
brightest and best,'' Gomes continued. ``But you know that you can
no longer fool all the people even some of the time. By noontime
today, you will be out of here. By tomorrow, you will be history.
By Saturday, you will be toast. That's a fact _ no exceptions, no
extensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Having stated the problem, the minister moved quickly to
alleviate it, promising students that their best years were yet to
come, and that God would be with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is God's gift to you,'' Gomes said. ``God will not
let you stumble or fall. God has not brought you this far to this
place to abandon you or leave you here alone and afraid. The God of
Israel never stumbles, never sleeps, never goes on sabbatical.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Thus, my beloved and bewildered young friends, do
not be afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomes concluded with a benediction: ``God grant you life until
your work is done, and work until your life is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hsiao-Yun Chu, a senior, said she appreciated the minister's
intent, but she did not relate to the Christian aspects of his
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was reassuring our anxiety, but the means he chose were not
the ones I would have chosen,'' Ms. Chu said. Still, she added,
``It was the message I came away with that counts: `Go ahead! Don't
stop here!'''

DELAY LEAVES STARR WITH DILEMMA IN CLINTON INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ga., Mass.)   (See also CLINTON-STARR)  
(lb) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court's refusal Thursday to intervene
quickly in the legal fight between Kenneth Starr and President
Clinton in the independent-counsel investigation means that Starr
now faces an unpalatable set of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Starr hinted for the first time that he is
considering making an impeachment referral to Congress, which would
then be forced to consider whether to exercise its authority to
remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr and his aides have said that they would follow Justice
Department guidelines that discourage seeking indictments as an
election nears. Now, with the Supreme Court's decision to put to an
appeals court the question of whether a top Clinton aide and
several Secret Service agents can be compelled to testify, Starr's
options for delivering an impeachment report may be dictated by the
looming political calendar.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Starr must decide whether to file a report in the next
few weeks that would be incomplete _ because it would not take
account of testimony he thinks could be crucial to his case _ or
wait until after Election Day, when his recommendation could have
far less political resonance for a new Congress and a president in
his final two years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if he decided to file a report now, Starr could
jeopardize any criminal prosecutions that his office might seek, by
prompting Congress to begin its own inquiry, and taking such steps
as offering immunity to certain witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the window for making an impeachment
referral, which Starr hinted he might do in his filing this week
seeking the Supreme Court's expedited review, will close by the end
of August.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have asked for a hearing in July by the appeals court
on the issue of whether Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House
counsel, and three Secret Service employees, can assert privileges
that would prevent their testimony or must answer before a federal
grand jury questions posed by investigators about the president and
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the court honored their request, the final decision,
assuming it went to the Supreme Court again after the appeals court
ruled, would not come before Election Day, because the High Court
will recess this month and not return until October.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, where the year has been dominated by anxieties
over impeachment proceedings, the court's ruling did little to
resolve the key uncertainty that has hung over the session: how the
president's legal problems will affect the battle for control of
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Some deplored the decision and the impetus it gave for more
delay. ``I think it's unfortunate,'' said Rep. Robert Livingston,
R-La. ``I think we need to accelerate this thing. Let's get the
truth out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many Republicans have been queasy about receiving
a report from Starr before the midterm election.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing how little Clinton's public standing had been harmed by
the allegations that he had a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
sought to cover it up, some have been fearful that an impeachment
inquiry could backfire on them at the polls, particularly if Starr
presented them with a weak case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If a report came to us that was ambiguous and it didn't have
enough substance for us to pursue, it would not be helpful,'' said
Rep. John Linder, the Georgian who heads the Republican House's
re-election committee. But he added that compelling evidence that
the president had committed a felony could sharply alter the mood
of the public.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Starr delays, the possibility of impeachment might still
sway some voters. But a delay could also leave Republicans on what
they view as more comfortable ground: a separate investigation into
whether Clinton's policy allowing U.S. commercial satellites to be
launched from Chinese rockets had compromised the United States'
national security.
</P>
<P>
   With this they believe the have found an issue that may resonate
with the public in a way that sexual allegations against the
president have not.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who have rallied around Clinton since the Lewinsky
case first broke, said they expected the court ruling to bolster
the current political mood of the country. Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., said the ruling ``reduces the momentum'' Starr had
appeared to be building.
</P>
<P>
   But privately some Democrats expressed concerns about reports
that Clinton might refuse to testify, because that might suggest he
did have something to hide.

   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in more than a quarter of a
century, the House on Thursday debated _ and rejected _ an attempt
by religious conservatives to amend the Constitution to allow
organized prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 224-203, falling 61 short of the two-thirds
necessary to pass a constitutional amendment. The vote doomed the
measure for now, but it had no future in the Senate anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Students may now pray, read the Bible and engage in religious
speech at school as long as they do so in a reasonable time, place
and manner, without disrupting other students.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to allowing organized prayer in school, the measure
would have allowed religious symbols on public property, such as a
creche at a courthouse. It also would have allowed use of tax money
for religious activities.
</P>
<P>
   The measure drew the active opposition of religious groups from
across the denominational spectrum, including Catholics, Jews,
Presbyterians, Seventh-Day Adventists and Muslims. They said the
measure was unnecessary, would coerce religious minorities into
conforming with the majority and would upend nearly 300 years of
religious freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amendment strips the individual of his or her rights to
pick his or her own prayer or to practice his or her own religion
without having to subject their beliefs to the manipulation and
interference of an arrogant majority,'' said Rep. Robert Scott,
D-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the defeat was a blow to the religious right, which
had intensified lobbying on behalf of the measure in recent days.
Still, its leaders claimed success in just getting the matter onto
the House floor and in winning a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked very hard,'' Randy Tate, executive director of the
Christian Coalition, said. ``We want a seat at the table, and some
would love to keep us out. We've always believed our influence
should be commensurate with our numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives argued that the amendment was needed to protect
students from overly sensitive school administrators and misguided
judges who twisted the idea of separation of church and state into
a hostility toward religious expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic liberties are being infringed because of judicial
wrongheadedness and, frankly, secularist bias,'' Rep. Henry Hyde,
R- Ill. and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said on the floor.
``Neutrality towards religion, not hostility, is the ideal we
seek.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also argued that the perceived hostility toward
religious expression coincided with an increase in violence, crime
and moral turpitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``As prayer has gone out of schools, guns, knives, drugs and
gangs have come in,'' said Rep. Ernest Istook Jr., the Oklahoma
Republican who sponsored the measure. ``It's time we put the
emphasis on what we believe, and almost every American believes in
God.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The amendment did not force anyone to pray, he said, but added,
those who did not want to should not have the power to censor those
who did.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the right to shut people up and censor them
just because you choose to be thin-skinned and intolerant when
someone else is trying to express their faith,'' he said in the
daylong debate.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and opponents argued that they were trying to protect
the guarantees of freedom of religion on which the nation was
founded.
</P>
<P>
   This only irked lawmakers like Rep. Amo Houghton of Corning,
N.Y., one of 28 Republicans who voted against the measure. A total
of 197 Republicans and 27 Democrats favored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides claim to be on the side of the righteous,''
Houghton said on the House floor. But he suggested that the
sponsors seemed to have conflicting motives. ``People are screaming
about getting the government off our backs, but they turn around
and have the government tell our children how to pray,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Murphy, director of the Washington office of the American
Civil Liberties Union, dismissed the measure as ``something to
galvanize the far-right constituencies because they are
anticipating a close election in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said that this lobbying campaign had hurt Republicans.
It exposed the degree to which the religious right was involved in
congressional politics, which in turn spurred scores of other
religious leaders into active opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national leadership has been involved on a level we've
never seen before,'' she said of the churches that joined a group
called the Coalition to Preserve Religious Liberty. ``More
denominations have been engaged in this battle, and they've decided
the Christian Coalition doesn't speak for them.''

THOUSANDS OF ETHNIC ALBANIANS FORCED TO FLEE YUGOSLAV FORCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PADESH, Albania _ President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has
unleashed the largest military operation in the Balkans since the
end of the war in Bosnia, driving thousands of ethnic Albanians
from the border area with Albania and reducing their villages to
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10,000 refugees have streamed through the mountain
passes and thousands more are reported to be hiding in forests on
the other side of the border, according to U.N. officials, refugees
and refugee organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to hang on, desperately hoping that the
world will intervene to save them,'' said Besim Aliaj, 36, as he
stood with some 30 people from his village who had been walking for
two days. ``We could not hold out any longer. There are thousands
more behind us. Once they realize there is no hope they will
follow. Everyone is being attacked from three sides. Only the
border area is safe. You flee or you die.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is trying to crush the separatist rebellion in the
Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
nine to one and have long resisted Serbian rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian military attack is aimed at stopping the flow of
fighters and smuggled weapons from Albania by driving ethnic
Albanians sympathetic to the rebellion out of villages on the
Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic apparently wants to set up a kind of ``sanitary
cordon'' to cement his control over Kosovo. Diplomats and military
officials fear that the escalating conflict could draw the region
into a wider war.
</P>
<P>
   A line of disheveled and forlorn mothers, fathers and children
stumbled Thursday down jagged limestone rocks towards an alpine
valley carpeted with tiny flowers. Many tugged wearily at bulging
nylon bags. Others clutched silent, wide-eyed children. Leading
them were grim-faced young men clutching AK-47 assault rifles,
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a rebel group fighting Serb
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the valley behind them lay their villages and hamlets, most
smoldering in ruins. Their silence was broken only by the distant
thud of heavy artillery and occasional retorts of automatic fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if the Serbs are pushing the refugees along,''
said Andrew Harper, the U.N. representative in Bajram Curri, 15
miles south of Padesh. ``They appear to be harassing them now to
move them to get out. We are preparing for a huge influx.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's decision to attack the rebels undermines the
American diplomatic effort to bring the two sides together. In May,
Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy, persuaded Milosevic to begin
direct talks with the Albanian leadership. As a result, he called
for sanctions on Belgrade to be suspended.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The about-face angered many European allies, since Washington
had pushed Europeans to adopt them.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been unable to seal off the mountainous and
desolate border. During the last few weeks he has watched weapons,
supplies and mercenaries _ many of them veterans of the Bosnian
conflict _ flood in to build up the Kosovo Liberation Army, Western
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel force is fighting for a separate state. It already
controls as much as 40 percent of the province and for the past
three months has been engaged in daily hit-and-run clashes with the
police and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Now thousands of villages lie empty, shattered by heavy shells
and in flames, according to refugees that arrived in this mountain
pass Thursday. They said that Serb soldiers are slaughtering
cattle, sheep and horses, and attacking families hiding in the
hills with helicopter and mortar fire.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one route left open to the refugees, the route out
of the country over the razor-back peaks of the Repe Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall hundreds of ethnic Albanians flee to the peaks,
wait for dawn amid the forbidding stone crevices, then make their
way down the precarious footholds to Albania, according to refugees
and refugee officials.
</P>
<P>
   At least a half dozen have died in the last stretches of the
trek, including two children, and dozens more are thought to have
died on the Kosovo side of the border, relief officials say. Many
of those who arrive have been been wounded by fragments of mortars
and artillery rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic closed off an area in central Kosovo in March. The
special police killed at least 80 people in villages where
guerrillas operated.
</P>
<P>
   Far from crippling the rebel movement the assault saw hundreds
or thousands of young men swell the rebel ranks and tons of weapons
and ammunition pour across the border on mule trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot make a distinction anymore between a member of the
Kosovo Liberation Army and those who struggle for independence in
Kosovo,'' said a young man in a black leather jacket, who plans to
return to Kosovo within a day to fight.
</P>
<P>
   All of the some two dozen men who crossed the border Thursday
and were interviewed said they intended to return to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Bajram Curri, that has seen its population of 8,000
swollen by the arrival of 4,500 refugees in the past three days,
was awash in clusters of secretive young men, several bearded and
wearing Islamic skull caps, who said they have come to join the
battle across the border. The town appears to be a staging area for
many who plan to join the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Halil Dukaj, 55, stood on a rutted dirt road leading down from
the mountains with his wife. His face was crisscrossed with lines
and covered by a gray stubble. Dark circles hung below his eyes and
he said he has not slept much in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the last to leave my village,'' he said. ``The shelling
became unbearable. We tried to find shelter in another village, but
we were attacked from three sides and all food was cut off. As soon
as my wife and my family are safe I will return to my village to
fight. There is not a man among us who does not feel as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Serbs came into our village they captured nine young
men,'' said Zejnie Gaxheri, 60, who arrived Thursday with three
small grandchildren and 10 family members. ``They slit the throats
of these boys. They mutilated the corpses and left their bodies for
us to see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fed up,'' she said, flicking her fingers forward from
under her chin in a gesture of contempt. ``We are all fed up. The
world tells us to be patient. We were patient and look what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration's senior official
responsible for the Balkans expressed deep concern Thursday about
the violence in Kosovo. Robert Gelbard, the special representative
of the president to the region, used especially harsh language in
criticizing the government of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   He told a Senate panel that the United States would not shrink
from imposing increasingly harsh sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton met with ethnic Albanian leaders
from Kosovo who said they received assurances that Washington would
not allow their homeland to suffer the fate of Bosnia. &QL;

Stars see hope of win in Detroit
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT _ They are due, certainly. Some would even say overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mildew,'' Stars center Mike Modano suggests with a smile.
``It's been a long time. It's been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it gets just a little tougher. To stay alive in these NHL
playoffs, Dallas must come up with a way to break through in its
own personal house of horrors _ Joe Louis Arena _ where a long run
of misery continued in Games 3 and 4 of these Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   An impossible task? Perhaps, but Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
insists he sees the light at the end of the tunnel as his team,
still down three games to two in the best-of-seven series,
approaches a 6:30 p.m. Game 6 faceoff at ``The Joe'' with nothing
less than a season on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right now there's a confidence that we can play with
Detroit in their building,'' Hitchcock said. ``We need to take it
to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``I like the law of averages.''
</P>
<P>
   That much, at least, is in Dallas' favor. Since moving to Texas
in 1993, the Stars are just 2-16-2 at Joe Louis, including an 0-5
record in the playoffs. And while Dallas kept things interesting in
two games in Detroit last weekend, losses of 5-3 and 3-2 only added
to the inventory of negative images.
</P>
<P>
   The key to changing the ending, Hitchcock believes, is to tinker
with the beginning just a bit. Dallas fell behind 4-0 and 2-0 in
the games in Detroit, hardly an ideal approach for a
defense-oriented team that is at its best when getting ahead
quickly and grinding out low-scoring victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get down early,'' he said. ``If we get out of that
first period tied or better, that's a significant change in
strategy for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has to be our goal _ tied or better after the first _ and
build from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' best chance to do so may be in the Detroit nets _ and
between the ears of Red Wings goalie Chris Osgood. After stopping
Dallas for more than 58 minutes Wednesday night, Osgood was beaten
by a Guy Carbonneau wrist shot with just one minute, 25 seconds
remaining to force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crowd could catch its breath, Osgood surrendered a
ridiculous 90-foot slap shot to Jamie Langenbrunner to settle the
issue just 46 seconds into OT.
</P>
<P>
   A fluke? Perhaps not. Langenbrunner's unlikely game-winner, in
fact, was the third long-distance goal Osgood has allowed in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Roenick beat him from just outside the blue line in the
opening series against Phoenix. St. Louis' Al MacInnis found the
net from just inside center ice in the conference semifinal. Toss
in Greg Adams' knuckler through the five-hole that accounted for
Dallas' winning goal in Game 2, and Osgood has endured some rocky
moments in the course of guiding the Wings within a game of their
third Stanley Cup finals appearance in four years.
</P>
<P>
   When Wednesday night's game was done, Osgood dressed hurriedly
and ducked out of the locker room, avoiding reporters. That left
teammates to express their support, some more enthusiastically than
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, they got a break,'' said Brent Gilchrist, the former
Star. ``But Chris played unbelievable just to keep us in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Larry Murphy echoed the theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it goes,'' he said. ``Now, it's just important
for us to get ready for Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be ready. So will Ozzie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars hope otherwise. With the series hanging in the balance
in the final period, they began to see something different from a
goalie who had denied them most of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players felt in the third period that all of a sudden
there were second-shot opportunities,'' Hitchcock said. ``We don't
know why. That's the first time in the series that has been
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As the game went on, you could see him second-guessing
himself,'' Modano said. ``But he's always come back and had strong
games, so I don't think we can count him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Red Wings aren't counting the Stars out after
watching the league's best regular-season team survive Wednesday
night's brush with playoff death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas obviously isn't giving up,'' Detroit captain Steve
Yzerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Not even at the thought of going back to ``The Joe,'' it seems.
Before heading to the airport Thursday afternoon, in fact,
Hitchcock actually seemed invigorated by the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In coaching, it's not the end result, it's the process,'' he
said. ``The process has been that we've gotten better and better as
this series has gone on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident that if we continue to improve we've got a
realistic chance of winning in that building.''
</P>
<P>
   With a bit more urgency in the air, the process resumes tonight.

TEXAS JURY CONVICTS FOURTH-GRADER IN SEXUAL ASSAULT OF GIRL, 3 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ An 11-year-old boy was convicted Thursday in the sexual
assault and beating of a 3-year-old girl, and could be incarcerated
for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster, barely 4-foot-5 and weighing less than 70 pounds,
was convicted on two counts of aggravated sexual assault and one
count of injury to a child.
</P>
<P>
   A juvenile court jury deliberated for nearly seven hours before
returning the verdicts, which sent the boy's mother rushing from
the courtroom in tears and angered family friends who had attended
the trial for the past four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a threat to the world,'' said Freda Brown, who sat
beside the boy's mother in the hallway as the disposition stage of
the trial, known in adult court as the punishment phase, got under
way. ``He's still a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other boys, 8- and 7-year-old brothers, admitted taking part
in the April 9 attack on the West Dallas girl beside a creek in the
neighborhood where the children lived. The younger boys could not
be prosecuted because of their ages.
</P>
<P>
   When he was questioned by police the day after the assault, the
11-year-old, who is a fourth-grade special education student,
confessed to hitting the girl with a shoe and a brick and
participating in the sexual assault. On the witness stand
Wednesday, he recanted that story and said he only hit the girl and
that the two brothers engaged in the sexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   The toddler, left bruised and bloodied in a muddy pool of water,
was found wandering naked up the creek's embankment by an uncle who
had been searching for her. She was treated and released from a
local hospital. Tests for evidence of a sexual assault came up
negative, but a doctor testified during the trial that that is not
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who said the boy calls her ``aunt'' although she is only
a family friend, said the police ``bribed'' a confession from him
because they could not prosecute the other two boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to get somebody so they got the 11-year-old,'' she
said. She said he admitted his guilt last April because detectives
fed him hamburgers and told him he could go home if he cooperated
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes before the verdict was reached, the jurors came
back into court to request that a portion of Detective Greg
Dugger's testimony relating to the boy's oral confession be read to
them. Dugger, who testified Tuesday, said the boy told him he had
molested her.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found him the boy guilty of those two sexual assault
counts _ punishable by a maximum of 40 years each _ but acquitted
him of a third, which alleged that he made genital-to-genital
contact with the 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   He also was convicted of hitting the girl and pushing her down
an embankment and into the creek. That offense, injury to a child,
carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is to return to court Friday to deliberate the boy's
sentence. It will have three sentencing options _ giving the boy
probation in his home, placing him in a treatment facility for six
months to a year, or sentencing him to serve time in a Texas Youth
Commission facility. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the disposition phase of the trial began Thursday afternoon,
the jury heard from a juvenile probation official, who has visited
with the boy every day since his arrest, and a psychologist who
examined him four times in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Juliana Moore, the probation officer, said the investigation
conducted by her department revealed that the boy suffers from a
series of behavioral problems, including aggressiveness. He has
twice been suspended from school for threatening and yelling at
teachers and fighting with other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen him exhibit any signs of remorse,'' Moore told
the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allison Krauth, testified that the boy told her candidly
that he was not sorry for what happened to the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even feel sorry for her because she followed us,'' she
quoted him as saying in reference to how the three boys and the
girl came to be at the creek together. Previous testimony indicated
that the girl was left alone in a van at her house, got out and
followed the boys to the creek.
</P>
<P>
   There, according to testimony from the two brothers, they
undressed her, all three sexually molested her, beat her with shoes
and a brick, and the 11-year-old pushed her down a concrete
embankment to the creek.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said her department is recommending TYC confinement for
the boy so he can receive sex offender and anger control
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs a highly structured environment with close
supervision and intensive treatment _ all encompassing therapy,''
she said.

CHINESE GOVERNMENT WARNS DISSIDENT AGAINST MAKING PUBLIC
STATEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-HONGKONG, CHINA-CONGRESS) 
(js) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Earlier this week, shortly after finishing years of
prison and probation, a former senior Chinese official openly
criticized the government, questioning its slow progress toward
democracy and condemning its decision in 1989 to send in soldiers
to quell student-led demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. He then
challenged the government _ which has professed its commitment to
the rule of law _ to respect his right to speak.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the ninth anniversary of the June 3-4 crackdown in
which hundreds of civilians were killed, the Chinese government
picked up that gauntlet and told Bao Tong, a former Central
Committee member who was imprisoned on charges of disclosing state
secrets _ revealing to student leaders in May 1989 that the
government planned to impose martial law in Beijing _ that such
freewheeling public statements would simply not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Less that 24 hours after interviews with Bao appeared in foreign
publications, he said that the authorities had informed him that he
could only grant interviews with the advance approval of ``the
government organizations concerned'' and ominously warned of
penalties if any rules were violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``By China's Constitution and law I should enjoy the right to
freedom of expression and speech and I'm very willing to talk about
my views in a frank way,'' said Bao, 65, in a telephone interview
moments after he had been informed of the restrictions. ``So it is
with regret that I inform you it is impossible to interview me
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bao's political views were no secret. In 1989, when he was
chief-of-staff to Zhao Ziyang, secretary general of the Communist
Party, both he and Zhao opposed the use of force against
demonstrators and indicated sympathy for their goals. Zhao, who was
ousted after the declaration of martial law, has been under a loose
form of house arrest ever since. Bao, the most senior Chinese
official jailed in 1989, spent seven years in prison, followed by
two years stripped of all political rights.
</P>
<P>
   On May 27, he said, officials from the Public Security Bureau
visited his house to tell him that his two-year probation was over
and his rights restored. And Bao started talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to chat with friends, that is my nature,'' said Bao .
``And since my political rights are now restored, the constitution
gives me the right to freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview Thursday morning, before officials warned
him, Bao said: ``The government has announced it will rule the
country according to law. So if I don't exercise my rights, it's
not good for the image of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bao's challenge comes at an awkward time for the government, as
it is busily preparing for President Clinton's arrival in China on
June 25 and has taken great pains to emphasize the country's slow
but steady progress towards rule of law and greater personal
freedom. And it comes not from a longtime dissident, but from a
longtime Party stalwart and former associate of the late leader
Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with just five years ago, the government allows the
publication of a much wider range of books and magazines, and
newspapers and television are allowed to deal with some previously
taboo topics, including police brutality and rethinking Mao's
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   But the confrontation with Bao, as well as the Security Bureau's
handling of some prominent dissidents in recent weeks, serve as
reminders that much remains the same. Close to two dozen democracy
advocates around the country have been been detained in recent
weeks as part of an apparent campaign to prevent discussion of the
1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, while others have received stern
warnings from security agents, according to a Hong Kong-based human
rights group, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with The Washington Post, published on Wednesday,
and the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, published on
Thursday, Bao discussed a wide range of topics. He described how he
turned up for a meeting on May 28, 1989, a week before the
massacre, and was instead driven directly to jail. And he called
the decision to send troops into Tiananmen Square a big
``mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, immediately after he had been warned by security
agents against granting interviews to foreign reporters without
permission, _ a procedure that is in the regulations but often
ignored by private citizens and journalists here _ Bao gave a
cryptic answer to a question that had been posed earlier: Is China
becoming more free?
</P>
<P>
   ``What has just happened now is the best answer to that
question,'' he responded.  &QL;

MOTOROLA SAYS IT WILL CUT 15,000 JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ariz.)  (lb) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc. announced late Thursday that it would
eliminate 15,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, and take a
$1.95 billion charge against second-quarter earnings, the direst
indicator yet of tough times in the semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola also warned Wall Street that it would report an
operating loss for the second quarter, its first such plunge into
the red since the semiconductor industry's slump of 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast quickly took its toll on the shares of Motorola,
which is based in Schaumburg, Ill. After rising 68.75 cents during
the day, to $51.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, the share price
fell as low as $49 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had already slashed their consensus earnings
projections to 20 cents a share from 43 cents after Motorola
announced in April that the quarter had begun poorly. But Motorola
said then that it expected to finish close to the 23-cents-a-share
profit it earned in the first quarter, so Thursday's projection of
a loss was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have downplayed Motorola's repeated earnings
disappointments because of the problems in their communications
businesses, but this clearly shows the semiconductor industry is
suffering from overcapacity exacerbated by the economic crisis in
Asia,'' said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call
Corp., a Boston-based firm that tracks corporate earnings estimates
of Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Motorola's bad news merely put an exclamation point on
what others in its industry had been reporting. National
Semiconductor warned investors early in the spring that Wall
Street's projections for its recently completed second quarter were
too high. (Those figures have not yet been reported.)
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Analog Devices, a chip maker, Applied Materials, a
leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and AMP
Inc., the world's leading supplier of connectors and other passive
components used on chips, issued similar warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Growney, Motorola's president and chief operating
officer, said Thursday in a written statement: ``It is clearly time
to accelerate the implementation of our renewal plan. We are
determined to return our financial results to acceptable levels as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Growney's statement meant things had gotten so bad that it was
time for Motorola's largest layoffs and writeoffs ever.
</P>
<P>
   The company has suffered a double whammy. Demand has slowed in
Asia for many of its cellular phones, pagers and other products,
most of which contain Motorola semiconductors. At the same time,
there is heightened competition from Asian manufacturers who are
desperate for sales and can cut prices without sacrificing profits,
because their currencies have been devalued.
</P>
<P>
   It has been difficult to offset those problems in the developed
world, in part because Motorola has fumbled the move from analog to
digital wireless phone technology and the once rapid growth of its
domestic paging business has slowed. Once the overwhelming leader
in cellular phones and systems to serve them, it has lost ground to
companies like Lucent Technologies, Nokia, L.M. Ericsson and
Qualcomm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The positive side of this is that Chris Galvin has been given
an opportunity to take drastic corrective steps, and it looks like
he's taking it,'' said Mark McKechnie, an analyst at Nationsbank
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, referring to Christopher
Galvin, the company's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola said that the job reductions, associated plant closings
in semiconductors and paging operations, and plans to sell poorly
performing businesses should eventually save $750 million annually.
The job reductions will take place over the next 12 months.
Motorola declined to comment on where the layoffs would be
concentrated. The domestic semiconductor operations are based
primarily in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin was unavailable for interviews before the company's
conference call with analysts, scheduled for Friday morning. In his
written comments, he emphasized that the company would continue to
invest in growth opportunities and singled out plans to introduce a
range of new digital phones in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the communications sector of the company had begun
to improve in April and that overall financial performance should
be better in the second half of the year, ``given stabilized
economic conditions in Asia.''

 FTC WARNS THAT INTERNET OFTEN MAKES SURFERS GIVE UP PRIVACY
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission warned yesterday that getting onto
the Internet can often mean giving up your right to privacy and
urged Congress to establish protections for children, who the
agency said were especially vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting 1,400 of the most popular Web sites, the agency
found that the great majority requested personal information from
visitors _ names, addresses, phone numbers, and sometimes even
Social Security numbers and medical information. But there are no
legal restrictions on how companies can use this data, and the FTC
said most companies don't even bother to tell consumers how their
personal information will be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of on-line businesses have yet to adopt even
the most fundamental fair information practice,'' the agency said
in a report issued in Washington yesterday. And many of the sites
that offer no privacy protection solicit personal information from
children.
</P>
<P>
   The study's results have led the FTC to abandon its previous
policy that self-regulation by Internet-based businesses would be
sufficient to protect the privacy rights of citizens. Instead, the
agency is calling for a new federal law to strictly limit the
ability of Internet businesses to collect personal information from
children. And the agency held open the possibility that it might
request additional privacy protections for adults as well.
</P>
<P>
   The report dismayed business groups, which fear new federal
regulations that would make doing business on the Internet more
difficult and costly. The Direct Marketing Association, which
represents many businesses with Internet sites, said that
self-regulation efforts are finally beginning to work, and stated
its opposition to Internet privacy laws covering adults or
children.
</P>
<P>
   The association's senior vice president, Connie Heatley, cited a
study from the association that found that 70 percent of the most
popular children's Web sites have written privacy policies. ``We
think that there has been progress made, that organizations have
clearly responded to the FTC's challenge,'' Heatley said.
</P>
<P>
   But US Representative Ed Markey said the study proves the need
for an Internet privacy bill of rights. The Massachusetts Democrat
said Internet companies have shown little interest in regulating
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been addressing the Direct Marketing Association on this
issue for the past four years,'' he said. ``This survey makes it
quite clear that a very high percentage of direct marketers have
not heard the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey said he introduced legislation last summer to protect the
privacy of Internet users, but the House had taken no action on the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the FTC, said that despite the
report's disappointing findings, he would not call the industry's
efforts at self-regulation a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is not meant to signal by us or perhaps by others
that there is no hope for industry self-regulation,
</P>
<P>
   he said. ``It's pretty clear that more incentives are necessary
to get industry to engage in what they thought they could
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC study was conducted in March. It found that:
</P>
<P>
   More than 85 percent of the sites surveyed requested personal
information from visitors. But only 14 percent told the visitors
how that information would be used.
</P>
<P>
   89 percent of the sites aimed at children asked for personal
information. Of these, only 54 percent provided any privacy
information to children and parents.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters of the sites didn't ask children to get
a parent's permission before providing data.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 10 percent gave parents the right to restrict the use
of information about their children.
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for legislation that would require Internet
sites aimed at children to get the permission of a parent before
seeking information from children. Parents would also be guaranteed
the right to limit the use of such information.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC didn't recommend new laws to govern the use of personal
information collected from adults, but the agency left open the
possibility. It promised a set of recommendations on this issue
later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center in Washington, said the results of the survey call into
question the Clinton administration's hands-off approach to the
Internet. ``My view is that the White House, and the FTC to some
extent, backed themselves into a corner by saying that they wanted
to take a broad-based self-regulating approach to the Internet,''
Rotenberg said. ``Things like privacy protection do require
government action.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rotenberg said the FTC report doesn't go far enough. He
noted that many Internet sites force users to provide information
about themselves if they want to make use of the site. Rotenberg
favors a law that would require Web sites to grant access to
visitors who wish to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, president of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an Internet civil liberties group, also had a problem
with the FTC report. Steinhardt said the legislation might prevent
minors from communicating over the Internet with organizations
offering advice on gay rights, birth control, and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that minors should be required to get their
parents' permission to visit Web sites that contain health or
reproductive information,'' said Steinhardt.

 TAKAYAMA, Japan: this explanation. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the neutrinos are now known to have some mass, most
physicists agree that the mass must be very small. The
Super-Kamiokande experiments suggest that the difference between
the masses of muon nutrinos and other types of neutrinos is only
about 0.07 electron volts. The electron volt is a measure of
particle mass, but this calculation does not yield a value of the
masses themselves, only the difference between those of muon
neutrinos and other types.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mass of the neutrino of any type must be small,
Totsuka said, it may be several electron-volts. If this is so, the
overall gravitational effect on the universe would perhaps be
significant. It has been estimated that at any given moment every
teaspoon's worth of volume of space throughout the universe
contains an average of 300 neutrinos, so their aggregate number is
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 68 years, a legion of distinguished physicists
have devoted their careers to the puzzling neutrino, which was
given its name by Enrico Fermi, the great Italian-American
physicist. Fermi quickly came to believe in the particle's
existence even though it was not proved in his lifetime and named
it ``neutrino,'' which means ``little neutral one'' in Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of dozens of neutrino experiments meet once
every two years to exchange ideas at conferences like the one under
way here. Present are representatives of teams that have installed
neutrino detectors on the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia, under
the Aegean Sea off the Greek coast, inside the Gran Sasso tunnel
under the Alps, under the ice covering the South Pole, and in many
other places.

MCI PROPOSAL STILL RAISES INTERNET ANTITRUST WORRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top European regulator reviewing Worldcom Inc.'s proposed
$37 billion acquisition of the MCI Communications Corp. said on
Thursday that MCI's proposed sale of part of its Internet business
may not be sufficient to allay his antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   MCI announced last week that it had agreed to sell its wholesale
Internet unit to Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC for $625 million in cash.
European regulators and the Justice Department had made clear to
MCI and Worldcom a concern that the combined company could unfairly
dominate the Internet and that the regulators would require the
companies to sell off some cyberspace assets.
</P>
<P>
   Foes of the deal, led by the GTE Corp., which lost in its
attempt to acquire MCI, have been pushing Worldcom to sell its
Uunet unit. Uunet is the leading Internet service company.
</P>
<P>
   But Worldcom has refused. Instead, MCI agreed to sell part of
its Internet unit to Cable &AMP; Wireless. MCI told Justice Department
officials about the Cable &AMP; Wireless deal more than a week before
it was publicly announced, in the hope of winning the department's
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   But the department refused to assure MCI that the Cable &AMP;
Wireless deal would be sufficient to remove its concerns.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Karel Van Miert, the European Union's competition
commissioner, also refused to give such an assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that what has been offered will be good enough,''
Van Miert said at a news conference in Washington. ``I even have
some doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Miert said he had notified each affected company of his
continued concerns and said the companies would each have a chance
to make additional suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   GTE hailed Van Miert's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Miert's comments today clearly indicate that MCI's recent
attempt to create the appearance of a divestiture through partial
sale of some minor Internet assets are not going to fool the EC,''
said Bob Bishop, a GTE spokesman, on Thursday.

   &QL;  BOEHNER MAY SUE SECOND-RANKING DEMOCRAT
</P>
<P>
   By Ronald F. Eckstein
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 4 -- Congressman John A. Boehner's lawsuit
against another member of Congress may expand to include the second
most powerful Democrat in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The West Chester Republican filed a civil lawsuit against Rep.
Jim McDermott in January of 1997, alleging the Washington Democrat
distributed an illegally recorded cellular phone call between
Boehner -- who is chairman of the House Republican Conference --
and other top Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also launched
its own criminal investigation to determine if McDermott broke any
laws.
</P>
<P>
   R. Ted Cruz, a lawyer for Boehner, said Thursday the DOJ
investigation may prove McDermott collaborated with House Minority
Whip David E. Bonior of Michigan before McDermott released a tape
of the call to three newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the fruits of a criminal investigation are very
helpful to a civil lawsuit,'' Cruz said. ``There is reason to
believe it will come out during the Justice Department's
investigation that there was communication between Congressman
McDermott and Congressman Bonior. If Bonior was involved, we would
be likely to add him as a defendant in our suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the Boehner camp agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could add other defendants to our lawsuit once more
information comes out during the criminal investigation,'' said
Marc S. Lampkin, general counsel to the House Republican
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Boehner is unhappy with the speed at which DOJ is pursuing
its probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that continued delay in the criminal
investigation will impede my attempt to seek civil redress against
other parties, including other members of the House, who are
responsible for the disclosure of my private cellular phone
conversation,'' Boehner wrote in a letter to Attorney General Janet
Reno Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner's lawyers also said DOJ's investigation is interfering
with their ability to conduct an aggressive civil investigation.
They argue that the statute of limitations will run out on their
case by January, and time is running short for them to conduct a
thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want there to be competing investigations,'' Lampkin
said. ``Witnesses may hold off in their dealings with us because
they could be offered immunity (by the DOJ).''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to see the (the DOJ) carry out their duty to
prosecute federal crimes. It is disturbing that they have been
dragging their feet on it,'' Cruz said. ``The purpose of this
letter is to ask the attorney general to enforce her duties.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott's lawyer, however, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that the criminal investigation has any bearing on
their case whatsoever. Nothing in the civil action has been delayed
by the Justice Department in any way,'' said Frank Cicero. ``They
are taking this as an opportunity to flog the attorney general and
Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Cicero added that he believes Boehner's suit will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filed a motion to dismiss on Monday which is based on
strong constitutional arguments,'' he said. ``The reason (the phone
call) was front-page newsworthy was because the speaker had made an
agreement to not try to spin the deal he got from the Ethics
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   During that fateful phone conversation, Boehner, House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey and other
Republican leaders were discussing damage control strategy for the
House Ethics Committee's investigation into Gingrich's political
use of charity organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a matter of important public interest, that is why it
came out,'' Cicero said. ``This was not some private conversation
between Boehner and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz challenged the validity of Cicero's argument. He said
McDermott's team is just trying to ``distract attention from the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if the cellular phone call is about the blue
prints for a nuclear submarine or your grandmother's recipe for
lemon meringue pie, the interception and distribution of the phone
call are against the law,'' he said.

RETAIL SALES UP 7 PERCENT IN MAY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ American retailers continued an impressive growth
spurt last month, one that bodes well for coming company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in retail stores open at least a year rose 7.1 percent in
May, according to the Goldman Sachs Retail Composite Index.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, which have not benefited much from the robust U.S.
economy in the last few years, were finally enjoying the results of
strong consumer spending. May's 7.1 percent increase in retail
sales followed on the heels of a very strong April, when sales rose
10.2 percent and one of the largest monthly gains in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   And many retail analysts think that the buying might not end
soon. ``The beat goes on,'' said Richard Baum, a retail analyst at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``The month was an extension of what has been
going on all year. We have still got the same story with the
leading indicators. Average hourly earnings are up a little over 3
percent. Housing turns are up 15 percent. The fact that you have
some paydown on consumer debt is producing personal expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers were able to sell a lot of their merchandise for full
price last month, which means that profit margins might be stronger
than expected when earnings are reported in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are raising our earnings estimates for a lot of
retailers,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Lehman Bros.
</P>
<P>
   From T-shirts to curtains to lawn mowers to patio furniture,
Americans continued their love affair with discount merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. rose 11 percent in May compared
with May 1997, and Kmart Corp. said its sales gained 6.9 percent
last month. Dollar General, which serves mostly lower-income
communities, said sales rose 14.4 percent, and Target, a discount
chain for middle-class shoppers, reported a 7.4 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength remains in discount and specialty apparel,'' Baum
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed a variety of clothing stores saw a healthy rise in sales
during May. The Gap said sales soared 24 percent, with huge gains
in all of its stores, including Old Navy and Banana Republic.
Talbots Inc. said sales jumped 13 percent. Even The Limited, which
has had several tough years, reported a sales gain of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores, which have trailed the rest of the industry
all year, came in behind other stores again. Sales at Federated
Department Stores Inc., for example, gained 1.8 percent and the
J.C. Penney Co. reported a mere four-tenths of a percent increase.
The Dayton Hudson Corp.'s same-store sales rose 6.1 percent,
largely because of its Target unit.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury department stores offered exceptions to the
lackluster department store sales. Sales at Neiman Marcus, a
Harcourt General unit, rose 9.6 percent, and Saks Holdings Inc.,
which operates Saks Fifth Avenue, said sales rose 3.7 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These stores may be benefiting from the first real hemline
change in several years as apparel makers have been churning out
skirts just below the knee and longer.
</P>
<P>
   Market prognosticators should take note: According to Wall
Street folklore, the market goes the way of hemlines. But perhaps
another hot seller this spring _ short pants like pedal pushers and
clam diggers _ will compensate.
</P>
<P>
   Sales among merchants of home furnishings and computers also
rose. Same-store sales at Pier 1 Imports Inc. rose 7.1 percent and
the Bombay Co. reported gains of 18 percent. Circuit City said
sales rose 12 percent and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. reported sales
increases of 5.4 percent citing higher sales of consumer
electronics, appliance and home-improvement products.

ETHIOPIA ACCEPTS PLAN TO END BATTLES WITH ERITREA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea _ As Ethiopian and Eritrean troops continued to
exchange artillery fire along their border, the Ethiopian prime
minister on Thursday accepted a peace plan proposed by the United
States and Rwanda that would end the escalating border war.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the Eritrean side.
</P>
<P>
   As a first step, the proposal calls for the unilateral
withdrawal of Eritrean forces from the disputed border town of
Badame, something the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi, has
demanded since the beginning of the crisis three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained unclear if the Eritrean president, Isaias
Afewerki, would accept the pullback. Earlier this week, he said his
troops would never withdraw from the town, which Eritrea considers
its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rice, the United States assistant secretary of State for
African affairs, met late Thursday night in this capital with
Afewerki in an effort to persuade him to sign onto the proposal
before more blood is shed. She called Ethiopia's acceptance of the
plan ``a necessary but not sufficient step'' towards peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half an agreement is less than 50 percent if you're talking
about war and peace,'' Ms. Rice said in an interview just before
meeting with the president. ``We hope that Eritrea will also accept
this package of recommendations in toto. Piecemeal acceptance of
one part or another is not the way forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The two countries have disagreed peacefully about the precise
demarcation of their borders ever since Eritrea became independent
in 1993. But on May 6, Eritrean troops clashed with Ethiopian
forces in Badame. Ethiopian officials had been administering the
town and Eritrean officers challenged their authority.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the conflict has intensified rapidly, with both
countries sending thousands of troops backed by tanks and heavy
artillery toward the border. The two armies have dug trenches less
than two miles apart in Badame, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several skirmishes in recent days, but on
Wednesday a full-scale artillery duel broke out near the border
town of Zala Ambessa.
</P>
<P>
   A team of diplomats and officials from the United States and
Rwanda released a proposal on Wednesday calling for the withdrawal
of Eritrean troops from Badame to the positions they held before
May 6. The two nations would begin talks to determine the border.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, both armies would pull back from the border regions to
create a demilitarized zone.

U.S. SUSPENDS MILITARY AID PROGRAM FOR BOSNIA
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States has suspended part of a military
aid program for Bosnia because the republic's Muslims and Croats
refuse to cooperate on even the most minor issues of joint
security, State Department officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The action to withhold some aid from a program known as Train
and Equip was taken to underscore Washington's belief that the
armed forces of the Bosnian federation should adopt a unified
identity, a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian military has declined to fly the new federation flag
over military installations and to use a common insignia on
uniforms. State Department officials say those steps are necessary
to establish the military's professionalism and trustworthiness
among the population.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the republic's Croats and
Muslims fought each other and Bosnian Serb forces. The Dayton peace
accords imposed a fragile armistice that diplomats hoped would be
sustained in part by joining the Croat and Muslim populations in
unified police and military forces. State Department officials said
the suspension would end once the Defense Ministry agreed to use
common insignia and to fly the flag.

COMMENTARY: YIDDISH PAPER TAKES SETBACK LIKE SURVIVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Samuel Norich, publisher of the Yiddish-language
version of The Forward, managed both a smile and the faintest wisp
of a sigh when asked how things were going. ``It's been more
interesting here than is absolutely necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a fact. It is enough of a challenge just to produce one
of the few remaining newspapers written in a language that itself
has to scramble to stay alive. The Forward, a century old and long
considered the most important general-circulation Yiddish newspaper
in New York, hardly needed to have life complicated by losing its
editor of many years, Mordechai Strigler.
</P>
<P>
   Strigler died last month at 76 after suffering a brain injury in
a fall. All of a sudden, the Yiddish-speaking and -reading world
was deprived of not only an editor but also one of its most
prolific writers of the postwar era. ``It's a terrible blow for
Yiddish culture altogether,'' said Boris Sandler, a Moldovan-born
Israeli citizen who was named the Yiddish Forward's new editor a
few days ago. ``Strigler was an institution all to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   And his death was a reminder _ at the weekly Forward and at
other Yiddish newspapers here like The Algemeiner Journal and Der
Yid, which appeal more to Hasidic readers _ of what a strain it is
to publish in a language that for years has constantly checked its
pulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I estimate there aren't more than a dozen people in the world
below the age of 55 whom we could hire as editor of the Yiddish
paper, and maybe not even that many,'' said Norich, 51, whose
official title is general manager of the Forward Association, which
also publishes separate weekly newspapers in English and Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty in sustaining a Yiddish paper in the tradition
of The Forvertz,'' he said, using the Yiddish pronunciation, ``is
not in finding readers or even advertising. The really hard part is
finding qualified writers and editors.'' He believes he has found
what he needs in Sandler, 48, who promises to lose no time in
building a stable of young Yiddish writers and spicing up the
graphics of a publication whose pages are determinedly gray.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, a turning point has come for this newspaper of
Labor Zionist origins, which decades ago did such a good job urging
its immigrant readers to assimilate in their new country and to
speak English that it nearly ran itself out of business.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, readers of Yiddish died. But any time someone
thought about writing an obituary for the language, too, the idea
proved premature. Yiddish instruction has bloomed at several dozen
U.S. colleges, and imperiled volumes of Yiddish writing are being
saved at the National Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Fishman, an expert on the language who teaches psychology
at Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
estimates that the United States has 250,000 to 300,000 Yiddish
speakers. That is a far cry from the millions in prewar America.
But it also suggests, as Norich put it, that ``no one should stand
with a stopwatch wondering when the last Yiddish speaker will fade
from the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is a high birth rate among Hasidic Jews, who speak
Yiddish daily and provide The Algemeiner Journal and Der Yid with
sales in the tens of thousands each week, while the Yiddish Forward
bumps along with a circulation of a mere 6,500.
</P>
<P>
   Just because a language can hang on, though, that does not mean
it is thriving. Yes, there are readers. But how about writers?
``There are no Yiddish novelists now, I can tell you that,'' said
David Roskies, who teaches Yiddish literature at the Jewish
Theological Seminary. ``A poem? Yes. A short story? Yes. But not
anything of novel length.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the talent reservoir is not deep for newspaper
editors, reporters or even proofreaders. ``I cannot say they are
standing in line,'' said Gershon Jacobson, who owns The Algemeiner
Journal. But at The Forward's offices in the Workmen's Circle
building on East 33rd Street, the managers are trying to live up to
the newspaper's name by looking ahead with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   This columnist was reminded of a 1972 interview he had with
Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Nobel laureate who wrote in Yiddish, his
stories often appearing in The Forward. Even then, the language's
future was in question. But Singer admonished, ``Resurrection with
us is not a miracle but a habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Who was he, Norich said, to disagree with ``the master''?

JOSEPH C. HARSCH, 93, JOURNALIST WHO WITNESSED HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: R.I., Mass., Vt., Ohio)  (ja) 
 By ERIC PACE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph C. Harsch, a dashing newspaper, radio and
television journalist and author who had a knack for being on hand
when history was made, died Wednesday at his home in Jamestown,
R.I. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Harsch, an Ohio-born Christian Scientist, logged much mileage
during his journalistic career. He worked for the Christian Science
Monitor from 1929 to 1988. For half those years, he worked
concurrently for network radio and television: for CBS from 1943-49
and later for NBC and then ABC.
</P>
<P>
   He was a correspondent in Washington in the Depression-racked
1930s and then covered World War II initially from bases in Fascist
Rome and then Hitler's Berlin from 1939 to 1941. After the war he
was a columnist for The Monitor and its chief editorial writer.
</P>
<P>
   His writing could be vivid. A month after the devastating
Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, he was on board the U.S.
carrier Enterprise as it departed from Hawaii, and he encountered a
promising naval officer, William F. Halsey Jr., who later became a
five-star admiral of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were tears in his eyes _ whether from the wind whipping
in over the lip of the deck or from depth of feeling was the
unanswered question,'' Harsch wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Late in his life, he won praise for a volume of memoirs he
wrote, ``At the Hinge of History: A Reporter's Story'' (1993,
University of Georgia Press).
</P>
<P>
   As The Monitor said Thursday, ``He seemed to be everywhere, or
at least everywhere something important was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in Washington when the Depression confronted President
Herbert Hoover, and he was still there when President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's New Deal began grappling with it. He moved on to London
and was there in September, 1939, when Britain's Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain declared war against Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   After that Harsch moved on to wartime Berlin, and later to
Hawaii, on his way to the Soviet Union. So he and his wife, Anne,
happened to be in Hawaii in December, 1941, when the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor, bringing the United States into World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   As he told the story, when he awoke in his hotel room to noise
of the attack, he woke his wife, saying, ``Listen to this, dear.
You have often asked me what an air raid sounds like. This is a
good imitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he was in Australia with Gen. Douglas MacArthur when the
general, having commanded the unsuccessful defense of the
Philippines against the Japanese, made his prophetic pledge, ``I
shall return.''
</P>
<P>
   Harsch went on to be with Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in France,
and in ``At the Hinge of History'' he recalled the part he played
in the capture of Hitler's architect, Albert Speer, in a bathroom
in a German castle: Harsch did some translating for a British
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Harsch sent reports from Nazi concentration camps in 1945, after
they were overrun by the advancing Allied forces. And early in the
Cold War, in 1947 and 1948, he roved behind what Winston Churchill
had named the Iron Curtain. Presciently, Harsch concluded that it
would not be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   His many writings include the books ``Pattern of Conquest''
(1941), in which he analyzed the threat posed by Nazism before the
United States entered the war, and ``The Curtain Isn't Iron''
(1950), about the Cold War and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   He was made a Commander of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth
II, and he won two Overseas Press Club Awards and other honors.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Toledo, Ohio, he received one bachelor's degree in 1927
from Williams College and another in 1929 from Cambridge
University.
</P>
<P>
   He married Anne Elizabeth Wood in 1932. She died last year.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Edna Raemer _ his
longtime editorial assistant _ whom he married late last month;
three sons, William of Saunderstown, R.I., Jonathan of Jamestown
and Paul of Pownal, Vt.; 12 grandchildren; one great-grandchild;
and a sister, Katherine Jamieson of Toledo, Ohio.

EXPECT CHILITO TO BE IN MOTION

<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The last horse entered in the Belmont Stakes,
Chilito, might be first out of the starting gate Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect he'll be on the lead,'' trainer Graham Motion said
from his barn at Laurel Race Course in Maryland, where the Flamingo
Stakes winner is based. ``That's what he likes to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Motion attributed Chilito's poor efforts in the Kentucky Derby
(11th, 27{ lengths behind Real Quiet) and the Jersey Derby (fifth)
to the fact ``he didn't get his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilito's four victories in 10 starts all came in front-running
style. He was a surprise entry Thursday morning and is 30-1 on the
Belmont morning line.
</P>
<P>
   Also likely to show early speed in the 1{-mile race are Grand
Slam, who's 6-1, and Basic Trainee, the 99-1 long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Chilito is scheduled to be vanned to New York today.
</P>
<P>
   Accuweather, or not: In the ever-changing forecast, clear skies,
a breeze and a high temperature of 72 are expected here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested development: When Real Quiet arrived from Kentucky on
Wednesday, owner Mike Pegram and Los Alamitos executive Brad
McKinzie rode in one of the cars escorting the colt's van from the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   McKinzie: ``I told him, `Mike, I always thought you and I might
wind up in the back seat of a police car in New York City, but not
with our hands in front of us.' ''

JUSTICES REJECT STARR'S PLEA FOR QUICK RULING ON PRIVILEGE CLAIMS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court rejected independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr's request Thursday to quickly resolve questions
over whether Secret Service agents and a senior White House aide
can be forced to testify before a grand jury _ leaving the legal
disputes between Starr and President Clinton dangling until the
autumn or early winter.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-paragraph notice, the justices effectively ordered a
White House appeal of two unfavorable lower court rulings to
proceed through a traditional appellate process that probably will
take months to complete. Though the decision was predicted, it was
immediately deemed a significant setback for Starr, who has been
trying to expedite his investigation of the Monica S. Lewinsky case
and was relying on the Supreme Court for help.
</P>
<P>
   After a string of legal defeats over the last month, White House
aides and lawyers hailed the decision as a victory for the
president and the legal rights they said he was trying to protect.
Those aides took strong exception to the notion that Clinton was
trying to stall Starr's investigation with lengthy appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is pleased,'' said White House press secretary
Michael McCurry. He added later: ``There is no delay. I mean, today
is what? Day 1,400 of Ken Starr's tenure as an independent counsel
at the rate of $30,000 a day of taxpayers' money? Now if there's
any delay, that's the delay right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, citing a ``serious criminal investigation'' and raising
the image of former President Richard Nixon, had asked the court to
take the unusual step of circumventing the traditional appellate
process so he could gather the information he said he needed to
bring his investigation to a close. Analysts said the court had
taken such action only a few times in the nation's history and it
would have been extraordinary for the court to take it again.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief order, the court wrote, ``The petition for a writ
of certiorari before judgment is denied without prejudice. It is
assumed the Court of Appeals will proceed expeditiously to decide
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office, which has tacitly accused the White House of
delaying the investigation with claims of executive privilege,
attorney-client privilege, and special privileges for Secret
Service agents, again called for cooperation and an expedited
conclusion to its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the Supreme Court's determination today, we will
proceed to litigate these issues as quickly as the Court of
Appeals' schedule will permit,'' Starr said in a written statement.
``This office will continue to take every reasonable and
practicable step to bring out the relevant facts as promptly as
possible, so this investigation can be concluded in a thorough and
expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly: ``We believe that the
American people's need for facts in this criminal investigation
justifies extraordinary requests for relief.''
</P>
<P>
   In decisions spread over the last several weeks, US District
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson rejected White House claims that two
Clinton advisers, deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey and communications
aide Sidney Blumenthal, were protected from testifying before the
grand jury because of executive privilege and attorney-client
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also rejected the administration's argument that three
Secret Service agents assigned to the presidential detail should
not be forced to testify before the grand jury on any activity they
might have witnessed or conversations they might have overheard.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Monday dropped its claim of executive
privilege and appealed the attorney-client privilege decision as it
affected Lindsey. The Justice Department also appealed the Secret
Service ruling. Because of Thursday's Supreme Court order, those
appeals will now be heard by a three-judge panel of the US Court of
Appeals in Washington, possibly by later this month. That panel is
not likely to issue a decision until late summer or early autumn,
and either side would then have the right to appeal the decision
before a larger panel of judges. Finally, the losing side could
appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the White House did this just to delay, but it
was not in their interest to have this go right to the Supreme
Court,'' said Fred Lawrence, an associate dean at the Boston
University Law School. ``Anything that deprives your adversary of
something he wants gives you some greater opportunity to negotiate
an arrangement, whether you are talking about making witnesses
available from the White House or paying back rent in a landlord
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Blumenthal appeared before the grand jury Thursday
since the White House decided not to appeal the judge's order that
his conversations with Clinton were not protected by executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's lawyers, visibly angry, said from the courthouse
steps that prosecutors questioned their client for 2 1/2 hours
before the grand jury about White House conversations concerning
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus today was what do you discuss at the White House
when you discuss us,'' said William McDaniel, one of Blumenthal's
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal followed Democratic Party fund-raiser and activist
Nate Landow, who spent about an hour before the grand jury,
presumably answering questions about whether he tried to influence
the testimony of former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey.
Willey has accused Clinton of groping and kissing her in a study
adjacent to the Oval Office as she asked him for a job _ an
accusation Clinton has flatly denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done,'' Landow told reporters as he quickly left the
courthouse. Blumenthal's lawyers said he was expected back before
the grand jury at an undetermined date.
</P>
<P>
   For prosecutors, though, it is Lindsey, Clinton's closest
confidant in the White House, whom they regard as their potentially
most valuable witness as they investigate whether the president may
have lied under oath about his relationship with Lewinsky or tried
to obstruct justice and suborn perjury in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey has told prosecutors he has been privy to no wrongdoing
at the White House. But he has declined to answer prosecutors'
questions in 14 different areas of the Lewinsky case, citing
attorney-client privilege as the reason for his silence.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has also argued that if Secret Service agents
are allowed to testify, future presidents and others who receive
government protection may try to distance themselves from their
assigned details and put themselves inadvertently in harm's way.

PERENNIAL BATTLE IN FOURTH ESTATE  
 CHOOSING PAPER OVER CELLULOID  
 WHEN ALL IS DONE, MAKE A MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are some entertainment reporters out there who
won't sleep so well Friday night. In an essay in the July issue of
Premiere magazine, which will be hand-delivered to a select few
media movers and shakers Friday, the famously pugnacious Miramax
co-chairman HARVEY WEINSTEIN rails against the use of anonymous
quoted sources. Especially _ surprise _ in articles about him.
</P>
<P>
   But in his quest to admonish reporters like Dana Harris and Ross
Johnson of The Hollywood Reporter _ who wrote a piece last year
titled ``How Healthy Is the Patient?'' about allegations of
financial problems foisted on Miramax by ``The English Patient'' _
Weinstein uncovered the never-ending enmity between reporters and
editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporters would tell me, `Oh, this editor has that agenda,'
and editors would tell me, `Oh that reporter has this agenda,'''
said Weinstein, who interviewed several reporters and editors for
his story. ``You'd go in talking to editors and you'd commiserate
with them, and then you'd talk to reporters who would blame it on
the editors. The reporters would always say, `We'd rather be fair,
we'd rather be smart, but our editors tell us make it sexy, make it
hot.'''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing Paper Over Celluloid
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect any screenplays from DAVID FOSTER WALLACE, the
author of the 1,079-page best seller ``Infinite Jest.'' Although he
joined the writers Susan Minot, Dale Peck, David O. Russell and
Todd Solondz in a forum on ``The Seductions of Celluloid,''
convened by Harper's magazine Tuesday night, Foster said he did not
find the medium even remotely seductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard enough time writing fiction,'' Wallace said at a
postpanel party at the Coffee Shop. ``The idea of working on
something, and then having 12 or 14 other people who are answering
to other guys change it, just kind of makes me cringe. No amount of
money would make me be able to take it. I think my ego is too
fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   When All Is Done, Make a Movie
</P>
<P>
   What is left to do when your life has already been so cinematic:
Your grandfather was a renowned diplomat, your grandmother was one
of Washington's grand hostesses, your parents disappeared in a
plane over the Bermuda Triangle and you have wandered Africa
studying tigers with the Smithsonian Institution?
</P>
<P>
   LAVINIA CURRIER decided, of course, to make a movie _ about a
man's relationship with a wild leopard, filmed in the Jordanian
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Opening June 12 in Los Angeles and New York, the movie,
``Passion in the Desert'' (Fine Line Features), is the first
feature-length film to be directed by Ms. Currier, 41, whose social
pedigree is extravagant even by Hollywood standards.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandfather, DAVID BRUCE, was the U.S. envoy to France,
Germany, Britain, China and NATO before his death in 1977. Her
grandmother was known for her A-list Georgetown parties and,
shortly before her death in 1995, wrote a book about Napoleon and
Josephine. Her uncle is JOHN WARNER, the senator from Virginia, who
was once married to ELIZABETH TAYLOR.
</P>
<P>
   Her family connections came in handy: Ms. Currier often called
her grandmother for help with technical details in making the
movie, based on a Balzac story about a Napoleonic officer. ``I
said: `How did they salute? And would this guy have had any
education?'''
</P>
<P>
   But her grandmother did not prepare her for the reaction of her
Jordanian crew to a woman. ``They called me Lavinia,'' she said.
``They couldn't figure out what kind of creature would be wearing
trousers and bossing men around, I guess.''

REAL QUIET DRAWS NO. 8 POST POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirteen horses were entered Thursday in the 130th
running of the Belmont Stakes Saturday, with Real Quiet drawing the
No. 8 post position and favored at 6-5 to become the 12th winner of
the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   A fair, cool day with a dry, fast track was predicted for
Belmont Park when Real Quiet tries to accomplish something that his
stablemate Silver Charm failed to do last year: sweep the punishing
series of Triple Crown races that are contested over five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet won the Kentucky Derby at a mile and one-quarter on
May 2, beating Victory Gallop by a half-length, and the Preakness
at a mile and three-sixteenths on May 16, this time beating Victory
Gallop by two and a quarter lengths. Now he will try to outrun his
contemporaries in the Belmont at a mile and a half, a distance that
none of the horses has raced.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet's chief threats figure to be one old rival and one
new one. The old rival, Victory Gallop, ran second in both the
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness and was duly installed as second
choice in the field at 7-2. The new rival, Grand Slam, who won the
Peter Pan Stakes only 12 days ago, was made the third choice at
6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, the only trainer to win the Derby and Preakness in
consecutive years, smiled through all the tumult surrounding his
colt's rise to the top of the 3-year-old class, and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``People came here last year to see history, and it was a
letdown. If it's not meant to be this year, we'll come back next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this game a long time, through the ups and downs,
and you go through months where things aren't great, and I think
maybe I should've been a doctor or a lawyer. But when you're
rolling, you just enjoy it. This horse is much fresher at this
point than Silver Charm was last year. He's ready to run a big
race.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kent Desormeaux, the jockey on Real Quiet, who attended
Thursday's draw ceremony, echoed the party line, saying, ``If I can
get him comfortable, he'll run them into the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The field of challengers grew by one when Chilito, who ran 11th
in the Kentucky Derby, was named before the entry deadline Thursday
morning. The draw was conducted under traditional rules, with
starting positions chosen by lot, and unlike this year's Kentucky
Derby and Preakness, in which the trainers picked from the
available positions in the gate. Chilito drew the No. 4 post and
was expected to supply some early speed. But racing people tended
to mark him as ``cheap speed,'' and the Belmont Park oddsmaker
judged his chances at 30-1.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also, as expected, D. Wayne Lukas decided to enter Grand Slam,
who won the Belmont Futurity and the Champagne Stakes last fall
before suffering a deep cut on his left hind leg in the Breeders'
Cup Juvenile in November. He has come back slowly this year, but
when he won the Peter Pan Stakes two weeks ago, the victory gave
him a winning streak of four races at Belmont Park. He is expected
to run close to the pacesetters in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam, with Jerry Bailey riding, will have to work to
challenge for the early lead. He drew the No. 13 slot on the
outside of the gate. Lukas has another horse in the race, Yarrow
Brae, winner of the Illinois Derby, who drew No. 12, was listed at
20-1. They will not run as an entry because they have different
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Grand Slam is 4-for-4 on this race track is
something you'd better put in your handicapping,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   David Cross, the trainer of Classic Cat, who ran third in the
Preakness, saw speed in the Belmont now as well as stamina, saying:
``Chilito and Grand Slam both put an emphasis on speed, and that
may help closers like mine. But you'd better be running at the
three-eighths pole, or you won't get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop won the Rebel and the Arkansas Derby before
finishing second to Real Quiet in both the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness. The colt, who drew the No. 11 slot, spent a week or so
contending with a skin condition on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get caught up trying to change history,'' said his
trainer, Elliott Walden. ``He came out of the Preakness a little
banged up. He was tired, and he didn't eat very well for a couple
of nights. Then he developed the skin rash that was partly due to
stress. He's righted himself in the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say we're better until we prove it. But I believe it's
a lot closer than a 2-0 match right now.''

NICHOLS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As his victims sobbed with relief and his son simply
sobbed, Terry L. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison Thursday
for his role in the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, 43, showed no emotion when he heard the sentence,
adopting the same blank stare he wore throughout the trial. Only an
hour earlier, a man whose brother was killed in the blast reminded
US District Court Judge Richard P. Matsch that Nichols had not shed
a single tear in court, and urged the judge to give Nichols the
stiffest penalty allowed under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him sit in prison for the rest of his life thinking about
what he did,'' said Rudy Guzman, who quit his job to attend the
trial nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pleas of a dozen victims, sometimes choked out
through tears, other times offered in the sad detachment of
survival, Matsch said the sentence was not meant to slake any
thirst for vengeance. Instead, he said that the severity of the
terrorist attack, the deadliest ever committed on US soil,
warranted the forfeiture of Nichols's freedom forever. The federal
sentence carries no possibility of release.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, along with his friend and former Army buddy Timothy J.
McVeigh, intended to ``change the course of government ... through
fear and intimidation,'' Matsch said. ``But you know it didn't work
out that way. Quite to the contrary. ... A community became even
more united and perhaps a country as well.''
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh, 29, was convicted of all 11 federal counts and
sentenced to death by lethal injection last June. But uncertain of
Nichols's exact role in the bombing, a second jury acquitted
Nichols of the more serious charge of first-degree murder and found
him guilty of conspiring to manufacture the bomb, though not of the
bombing itself.
</P>
<P>
   That verdict was a clear rejection of the prosecution's
contention that Nichols and McVeigh were full partners despite
Nichols's absence from Oklahoma City on the day of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that have been laid at Mr. Nichols's door don't
entirely belong to him,'' said lead defense attorney Michael E.
Tigar, who plans to file a motion for a new trial based on recent
news reports that some jurors felt pressured during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Matsch had indicated he might take Nichols's
cooperation into account if he helped prosecutors answer
outstanding questions about the bombing. But Nichols still faces a
murder trial in Oklahoma City, and in a soft voice he declined to
address the court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the defense team had already presented everything it knew
about the bombing, which killed 168 men, women and children and
injured hundreds more, Tigar went on to blame prosecutors and
federal agencies for a shoddy investigation that led to a largely
circumstantial case against his client. He added that Michael
Fortier, a friend of Nichols and McVeigh who also knew about the
deadly plot, was sentenced recently to just 12 years on unrelated
charges after his starring role as a witness at both men's trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that has been said here of Terry Nichols could be
said of'' Fortier, Tigar said, in arguing for a lighter sentence.
``His 12-year sentence ... stands as some kind of benchmark.''
</P>
<P>
   But Matsch rejected defense pleas for leniency and imposed the
maximum sentence at prosecutors' urging. Beyond the economic ruin,
estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars, beyond the emotional
and physical scars, the ``seriousness of the crime alone dictates a
sentence of life,'' said Larry A. Mackey , who led the prosecution
team.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols also received a concurrent sentence of 48 years, six
years for each of the eight federal law enforcement agents he
helped kill. During Nichols trial, prosecutors argued that he
helped bomb the building in retaliation for the siege at the Branch
Davidian complex near Waco, Texas, which claimed 75 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that he was not making a political statement, Martin
Cash, one of Nichols's victims, said regardless of motive, there
was no justification for the slaughter. Cash, his left eye
literally torn from its socket, his teeth lost to jaw trauma, asked
Matsch to impose a sentence ``59 seconds longer than the sentence''
Nichols ``imposed'' on the people of Oklahoma City: eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Cash was among a dozen victims and their relatives who poured
out their stories of broken bodies and busted hearts Thursday, each
one intent on ensuring that Nichols received life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Moser, a dental assistant whose husband lost much of
his hearing, recalled running toward the building and helping carry
out babies. They were not crying, they were not breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still hear them crying in my nightmares,'' Moser said.
``It has been thre years since the bombing, but in my nightmare it
is now. ....Our grief is ever present. It is our life sentence.''

ANTITOBACCO MEASURE STALLED IN SENATE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A fragile coalition struggling to steer a massive
antitobacco bill through the Senate suffered a serious setback
Thursday as a storm of partisan rancor and election-year
brinksmanship stalled the measure's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a showdown over using proceeds from the $516 billion
tobacco proposal to reduce taxes for married couples, the bill's
chief Democratic supporters accused Republican leaders of playing
parliamentary games to try to kill the antitobacco measure and
filed a motion to end debate on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   As Republican leaders unleashed a counterattack, the antitobacco
bill's prime sponsor, Senator John McCain of Arizona, expressed
dismay and appeared close to conceding defeat. A vote on the motion
to end the debate is scheduled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in the wisdom of the Senate this is not a good piece of
legislation and we should drop it,'' said McCain, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate ended briefly last night, as the Senate voted
66-29 not to kill an amendment that would increase the maximum
annual penalties tobacco companies would pay for failing to meet
targets to reduce youth smoking. The amendment by Senator Richard
Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, would increase the maximum penalty
from about $4 billion to $7 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, McCain's top Democratic ally in the
antitobacco coalition, reflected the growing acrimony in the debate
as he abandoned the spirit of compromise he has tried to foster
since the Senate began considering the measure two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry accused GOP leaders of hypocrisy for asserting they want
to curb youth smoking but permitting a small number of Republican
conservatives to tie up the bill for several days in what critics
described as a ``defacto filibuster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a lot of them support the dealth penalty,'' Kerry said
of the bill's foes. ``In effect, this is a back-door death penalty
for children who will be sucked into smoking and ultimately will
die because of the disease they get as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate majority leader Trent Lott, whose parliamentary moves
were the prime target of Democratic scorn, issued a dismal
assessment of the antitobacco bill's prospects. ``The well has been
poisoned tremendously by what has been going on here,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy joined the verbal assault on the
Republican leaders, but he predicted the Senate will soon bow to
public pressure and pass the antitobacco bill.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying Thursday's skirmish was a move by Senator Phil Gramm,
a Texas Republican, to use about $52 billion in revenues from a
proposed $1.10-a-pack increase in cigarette prices to eliminate the
``penalty'' that many married couples pay in federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, about 42 percent
of married couples filing jointly in 1996 paid an average of $1,400
more in taxes than they would have if they were not married.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders, wary of voting against the idea in an
election year, wrote an alternative to Gramm's bill that would use
about $28 billion of the proposed cigarette tax increase to reduce
the marriage tax penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan bickering intensified when Lott refused to schedule
consecutive votes on the competing measures. Democrats feared they
would face public disfavor for voting against Gramm's bill without
being able to vote on their alternative on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute nearly overshadowed anger among many public health
groups that cigarette money would not be used for antitobacco
programs. A public health coalition, Effective National Action on
Tobacco Control, issued a statement saying, ``If Congress wants to
reduce the marriage tax, it should do so in separate legislation,
not by gutting this effort to combat the use of tobacco by
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet former surgeon general C. Everett Koop said he would
reluctantly support the initiative. ``If it takes a tax cut to move
this bill forward, even though I don't like it, so be it,'' he
said.

EDITORIAL: A TEST FOR CHARLTON HESTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, June 5:
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association opens its annual convention
Friday in Philadelphia in a nation where parents worry about
bullets in the schoolyard and about the easy access that disturbed
children have to loaded guns. But it is impossible to discern a
glimmer of civic or parental concern in the NRA's official program
for the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks after the latest deadly school rampage, in
Springfield, Ore., the NRA has an agenda planned that leaves plenty
of time for members to view the latest in weaponry and to hear
speakers spout familiar rhetoric about the right to bear arms.
Notably missing, however, is time set aside for a discussion of the
issue of gun violence and children, or to reconsider the
organization's reflexive opposition to common-sense measures that
would limit the access of criminals and children to bullets and
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that parents in the NRA would be concerned that
their dues finance a Washington lobby for greater danger in public
spaces. Confronted with the rash of deadly school massacres, and
statistics indicating an alarming number of youngsters toting guns
to school, the organization responds with its old rant that any
criminal misuse of weapons is inimical to its devotion to shooting
sports.
</P>
<P>
   What that conveniently ignores, of course, is the group's
influential role over the years at the state and national level in
blocking reasonable legislation that would restrict guns to hunters
and target-shooters and control the circumstances under which they
can be carried and used.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates in Congress want to strengthen the laws
limiting access to handguns for children, and put criminal
penalties on adults who do not lock away their firearms. The NRA's
Washington leadership refuses to recognize that such steps pose no
real threat to hunters and target-shooters. Instead the leaders
feed a kind of gun-owner paranoia that prevents the nation from
controlling a major public health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   James Brady, the former White House press secretary who was shot
and permanently injured in the assassination attempt on President
Ronald Reagan, and his organization, Handgun Control Inc., wrote to
Charlton Heston this week asking for his support for laws to
protect children. Heston has yet to respond. But the actor, who is
considered a shoo-in to be elected the next NRA president, has
disappointed those who hoped when he became an NRA vice president a
year ago that he would be a force for common sense in an
organization that uses propaganda to prevent its members from
thinking about the safety interests of their families.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Heston, whose long career has made him an icon of
respectability, needs to decide if he wants to end his career as
front man for a lobby whose civic irresponsibility is comparable
only to that of the cigarette companies.

WIESEL GIVES STUDENTS A PERSONAL VIEW OF THE HOLOCAUST'S HORRORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SUSAN SACHS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elie Wiesel has berated presidents, debated
philosophers, chided popes and harangued dictators. The
world-traveled Holocaust writer and Nobel laureate rarely falters.
But then, rarely has his audience been as direct as the
eighth-graders of Public School 111 in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you ever regret being Jewish?'' Lorraine Lopez, 13,
asked Wiesel at the conclusion of his 45-minute talk in the
school's library Thursday that touched on the terrors of Auschwitz,
the fragility of memory and the evil of indifference in the face of
bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesel flinched, and his eyebrows, winged in a permanent
expression of amazement, rose ever so slightly. ``Never,'' he
finally responded. Then he paid them a compliment that made several
of the assembled students, most of them black or Hispanic, exchange
shy smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from you today more than you realize,'' Wiesel said
solemnly. He seemed a bit surprised himself. ``I feel good talking
to you,'' he told the teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   For the 65 students who perched on battered chairs or sprawled
on bright blue beanbags, Wiesel's appearance at their school at
56th Street and 10th Avenue capped a semester of special Holocaust
studies.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their social studies and language arts classes, they
read stories for the first time about the genocide of the Jews of
Europe. They saw films of concentration camps that shocked them.
</P>
<P>
   They wrestled with hatred in their midst when someone scrawled a
swastika on the wall of a boys' bathroom in April, shortly after
the visit of another Holocaust survivor who told of how she found
her family alive after the war.
</P>
<P>
   But they knew, from reading Wiesel's memoir, ``Night,'' that his
personal journey through hell did not have a happy ending and that
he was left orphaned and alone.
</P>
<P>
   So when their guest, significantly smaller and more frail than
many of the strapping teen-agers, began to speak in his soft,
accented voice, the room grew silent. One girl tiptoed to the
window and turned off the air-conditioner. The students stared
raptly.
</P>
<P>
   As he began, Wiesel confessed to some trepidation about even
coming to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rarely speak to children your age,'' he told them. ``I speak
to university students, who are already mature. And I'm not sure I
like this, because the story you want to hear is a story filled
with pain, and something in me resists. Why should I give you pain?
You are entitled to joy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of education, he said, he came. But be warned,
he told them: ``When you enter the mind and the memory of a person
such as myself, there you will see nothing but darkness, with a few
sparks here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not spare them.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesel was 15 when he was taken to Auschwitz from his home in
Romania. In the camp, he saw his father die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever lose hope?'' asked Michael Thompson, 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question you ask me, I never ask it myself,'' Wiesel
responded. Now 69, with a busy schedule of lectures and political
activism, he is more accustomed to speaking about the Bible,
mysticism and literary philosophy than to making intimate
admissions in public. ``This is too personal,'' he said, ``but I
owe you that _ to answer your question.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened, Sita Kaba, a lanky 13-year-old, unfolded himself
from his chair, glanced around and asked, ``How did you feel when
your family died in the Holocaust?''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Wiesel said nothing. He cleared his throat. He
looked at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was numb,'' he said. ``Remember, I was living in a place
where death was the norm and life was abnormal. The real pain came
later, when I was free.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is the second year that the school has included the special
course on the Holocaust, which is based on materials developed by
the Simon Wiesenthal Center to promote tolerance. At P.S. 111, it
is one of several academic and cultural programs financed by The
New York Times Company Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers said they saw Holocaust studies as a particularly
useful tool, especially at a time of strained relations between
Jews and blacks in New York. Students learned not only history, but
also how easily bigotry can grow in the vacuum of apathy, said
Ellen Gallin Procida, the course's teacher.
</P>
<P>
   That lesson became all too real when some of the boys in the
class found the swastika in a bathroom. Enraged, upset and
energized by a youthful zeal for righting wrongs, they volunteered
to speak to other classes about the pain caused by intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took it very personally as a slap against humanity,'' Ms.
Procida said. ``They became sensitive to these issues through this
study.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Procida said black parents have been supportive, even though
many may consider the experience of slavery a holocaust of their
own and one little appreciated by whites.
</P>
<P>
   A student in Ms. Procida's class, Bobby Potts, 13, who is black,
said he really did not distinguish between the two tragedies.
``Each one is as bad as the other,'' he said. ``Maybe you can say
that more people were killed in the Holocaust, but they're pretty
much equal because lives were lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, another black student drew a slightly different
lesson. Ms. Procida said he told her that ``the Holocaust was worse
than slavery because it means we didn't learn anything from
slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiesel made a similar point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always dissatisfied,'' he told the students, when asked
whether he had achieved all that he had hoped to. ``I have the
strange feeling that I have not really begun and that I'm not doing
enough, because if my peers and I had really told the story as it
should have been told, many things would be different in the world
today.'' &QL;

NEUTRINOS HAVE MASS AFTER ALL, SCIENTISTS FIND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neutrinos come about as close to nothingness as something can
be; they make even the tiny electron, the lightest part of an atom,
seem like a heavyweight. Yet a new discovery being announced Friday
in Japan by an international team of physicists shows that these
minuscule, nearly-weightless wisps of matter may actually dominate
the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are the tiniest units of matter in existence, the
new discovery, proving that neutrinos do have some mass, indicates
that they may have played a key role in the formation of galaxies
and stars, and may also be crucial to determining the universe's
ultimate fate.
</P>
<P>
   The finding is the culmination of one of the most hard-fought
quests in modern physics, but it raises as many questions as it
answers. ``It's very exciting,'' said Leon Lederman, a Nobel
laureate in physics and director of the Fermi National Laboratory
in Batavia, Ill. ``It also exacerbates and emphasizes our total
confusion'' as to why matter has mass at all, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lederman suggested that the discovery was of a class that could
well lead to a Nobel Prize, but only if one or two scientists could
be singled out for credit from among the large group that made the
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have debated for decades over whether neutrinos, the
most abundant of all sub-atomic particles, have some tiny amount of
mass. Some thought that, like the photons that carry beams of light
or radio waves, they might have none at all. Friday, after years of
effort in a huge underground water-filled cavern built to study the
elusive particles, an international team of physicists will report
that the answer has been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irrefutable evidence'' that the tiny particles really do
have mass, said Boston University physicist Larry Sulak, a member
of the discovery team, in describing the several lines of evidence
produced by experiments at the huge Super-Kamiokande detector. In a
telephone interview from Japan, Sulak said that while earlier
experiments had produced inconclusive evidence for neutrino mass,
with the new experiments ``all the unknowns that we were concerned
about have been laid to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 scientists from 23 institutions participated in the
research that led to Friday's announcement, being made at a
conference called ``Neutrino '98'' in Takayama, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrinos are among the oddest discoveries of modern physics.
They are similar to electrons, the tiny particles that make up the
outer shells of atoms. But unlike electrons, they have no
electrical charge at all. As a result they have virtually no
interaction with other forms of matter. The particles are so tiny
and elusive that they could hurtle through a quadrillion-mile
thickness of solid lead without ever bumping into anything.
</P>
<P>
   When physicist Wolfgang Pauli first came up with the concept in
1929 to explain a discrepancy in measurements of radioactive decay,
he was embarrassed. ``I have done something very bad Friday,'' he
told a friend, ``in proposing a particle that cannot be detected;
it is something no theorist should ever do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pauli was proved right about his theory, but wrong about the
possibility of detection, when neutrinos were first proved to exist
in 1956 at an atomic reactor in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of whether neutrinos had mass remained much
more difficult to pin down. Several experiments over the last 20
years have shown some signs that they did, but fell short of
providing compelling evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The new experiments, while they establish that neutrinos have
mass, do not provide a way of actually measuring it. Instead, what
they measured was the difference between the masses of two
different types, or ``flavors,'' of neutrinos. It turns out, the
new experiments show, that some neutrinos ``oscillate'' between the
two different flavors, and the oscillation provides a way of
measuring the difference in mass.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings suggest that neutrinos may have been crucial in
causing matter to form ``clumps'' soon after the Big Bang that
created the universe. These clumps became galaxies, which then
spawned the billions of stars that permeate space.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrinos may also make up a significant part of the ``missing
mass'' that astronomers say must exist in space in order to explain
the behavior of galaxies. But it would not be enough mass to cause
the universe to stop expanding and collapse upon itself, as many
physicists believe it must.

SPORTS COLUMN: SELES IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also TEN-FRENCHOPEN)  
 (JT)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The two of them first met nearly a decade before.
Nine-year-old Martina Hingis was escorted by her mother to a tennis
match in Zurich, Switzerland, where 16-year-old Monica Seles was
playing. Hingis was enough of a prodigy herself to have her
photograph taken with the older prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   Seles moved on quickly, winning the French Open the next year,
1990. Back home in Switzerland, Hingis watched on television as
Seles grunted and squinted, banged balls with two hands, forehand
and backhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was almost unbeatable,'' Hingis recalled Thursday. ``I saw
her win the French Open. She was becoming No. 1 in the world. I was
just a little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Named for Martina Navratilova, the political symbol, not the
tennis player, Hingis does not have role models. It is hard to
think of her as ever being at an impressionable age, but maybe in
her own secure way she was a trifle awed by the two-handed marvel
she saw on the tube so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   That grunting, squinting apparition reappeared Thursday for
Martina Hingis on the clay courts of Roland Garros. Bellowing her
two-tone personal mantra like a samurai backhander _
``Aiiii-yeeee!'' _ Monica Seles materialized on the other side of
the net from Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis had beaten Seles all five times they had met, but
Thursday it was like Gordie Howe coming back to slap Wayne Gretzky
silly, like Bill Russell climbing back onto the court to stuff the
Chicago Bulls. This was the prototypical blast from the past, balls
rocketing into corners as if shot by smart bazookas, the way Seles
used to hit them. Hingis was the one person in the world who had to
cope with a mightily revitalized Monica Seles Thursday, and she
soon became undone.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 6-3, 6-2, and that included a concession by Seles
of a let call while Hingis was serving. Hingis promptly won the
sixth game of the second set, but the sporting gesture did not hurt
Seles _ and even if it had, Seles said, ``What's true is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of truth, it is a fact that Monica Seles lost part of
her youth to a cretin who stabbed her while she was on the court,
and who later got off with modest time served. Barely three weeks
ago, Monica Seles lost her father to cancer, after nursing him, and
making the medical and family decisions for her mother and father.
Seles has had two brutal interruptions in her career, but she said
she never stopped to think that this perpetually smiling young
woman had usurped a chunk of her potential career.
</P>
<P>
   Back when Hingis was watching on Swiss television, Seles had
become the youngest woman (or man, for that matter) to be ranked
first in world tennis, 17 years 3 months 9 days. Hingis now holds
that record, 16 years 6 months 1 day. Thursday, Hingis seemed like
a frustrated juvenile on the same court with this determined older
woman wearing a black outfit that was either a symbol of respect
for her father or a fashion concession to her mature figure, now
being pounded into shape by Grand Slam-level tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Venus Williams had graciously expressed respect for
Hingis after Tuesday's drubbing, Hingis had nothing but admiration
for Seles Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably getting a little bit tired,'' Hingis said.
``Then she just let me run, and she didn't make any mistakes. I
didn't get the chance to get back into the match. She was the
better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Hingis surprised that Seles could pull back a match like
this, seemingly a rerun of those matches Hingis had seen back in
1990? ``Well, I guess she surprised everybody. I mean she's been
around for a while and then all of a sudden she was gone for almost
four years, and here she is, back, in better shape, probably better
than ever, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a fair competitor, Seles did remember how to defuse an
opponent's protest. On Tuesday, Hingis had requested the chair
umpire to inspect four calls in the clay particles, and Hingis had
won three of those inspections. (``That's her conduct,'' Williams

EDITORIAL: TIME TO TALK IN SOUTH ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, June 5:
</P>
<P>
   Now that India and Pakistan have at least temporarily halted
their nuclear tests and toned down their rhetoric, there is an
opening for diplomacy aimed at freezing further weapons
development.
</P>
<P>
   A modest step was taken Thursday in Geneva, where Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and the foreign ministers of Russia,
China, Britain and France urged India and Pakistan to refrain from
further testing and open negotiations with each other. The meeting
also called on the two countries to sign the international treaties
banning the testing and spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But achieving these worthy goals will not be easy, and a newly
nuclear South Asia still crackles with danger. India and Pakistan
are both working to miniaturize their nuclear bombs to fit on
missiles; their troops trade fire across a tense border, and they
cannot even agree on a format for discussing their conflicting
claims to Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan must be coaxed into signing the international
nuclear treaties. In return they should be given access to the
safety technology that established nuclear powers use to prevent
accidental detonations and theft. Encouragingly, Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has proposed a testing moratorium and
offers to negotiate an agreement with Pakistan promising that
neither country will be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into
combat. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also seems interested
in negotiating new guidelines for military restraint.
</P>
<P>
   But New Delhi says it will sign the global nuclear arms treaties
only if it is legally recognized as a nuclear weapons country. That
would legitimize India's plans to proceed further toward arming
itself with nuclear weapons. India also conditions its signature on
the established nuclear powers' committing themselves to
eliminating their own nuclear arsenals. That is a desirable goal,
but has little chance of achievement in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The five nuclear powers Thursday rightly rejected amending the
treaties to expand the ranks of nuclear armed countries. But there
may be artful language that can satisfy Indian and Pakistani pride
while preserving the integrity of the accords. Congress should give
President Clinton authority to lift sanctions against India or
Pakistan if either signs the treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has special ties to this region, as does China. Beijing
helped Pakistan develop its bomb, but now wants to show it can act
responsibly against the spread of nuclear weapons. They should act
in concert with Washington to help edge South Asia back from the
nuclear brink. &QL;

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   FTC Seeks Online Privacy Law for Children  
   
 By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Web surfers _ especially children _ have little privacy protection
on the Internet, and Congress should step in to shield minors, the
Federal Trade Commission said in a scathing report issued
yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The findings, part of an exhaustive three-year investigation,
are based on a poll of 1,400 Web sites. Of those monitored, 85
percent collected personal information from surfers, but only 14
percent informed customers how they use it. The five-member
commission said children were more likely than adults to volunteer
information on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed with the Internet industry's attempts to
self-regulate its basic fair information practices,'' FTC
commissioner Mozelle Thompson said in an interview. ``In most
cases, data was collected silently and then dispersed over the
World Wide Web almost instantly. This isn't like losing a credit
card in a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report confirms the worst fears of privacy advocates,
who claim the Internet is overrun with sites that ask users to fill
out electronic questionnaires with their names, home and e-mail
addresses, phone numbers and credit-card numbers and then peddle
this information to marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's findings:
</P>
<P>
   _More than 90 percent of the commercial Web sites polled collect
personal data, but only 2 percent have a comprehensive policy on
how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   _Nine out of 10 sites aimed at children seek personal
information about visitors, yet only 23 percent advise kids to get
parental permission.
</P>
<P>
   _Of the 100 most popular Web sites, 97 percent glean personal
data. However, 71 percent of those sites have policies about what
to do with information they gather.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is urging Congress to draft a bill that would require
Web sites to get parental consent before collecting information
from those under 13.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also may propose new regulations in the coming
months regarding broader issues of privacy on the Internet, FTC
Chairman Robert Pitofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every AOL, IBM or other online service that has a
legitimate privacy policy, there are thousands who don't,'' the
FTC's Thompson said. ``I find that extremely troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is a searing indictment of the administration's
year-old policy urging Web sites to ensure privacy by disclosing
how personal data would be used and disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It underscores the Clinton administration's failed policy of
letting Internet companies police privacy themselves,'' said Jeff
Chester, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Media
Education in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Schwartz, policy analyst at the civil liberties group Center
for Democracy and Technology in Washington, D.C., said the sheer
size and scope of the Internet make it necessary for the FTC and
Congress to ``set some baseline standards to separate the bad
actors from the good actors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute attempt to stave off legislation, industry
leaders are scrambling to form self-regulating bodies that would
address privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a dozen trade groups _ led by the Business Software
Alliance and Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association _
adopted privacy standards to give individuals the choice to ``opt
out'' of data collection.
</P>
<P>
   Former FTC Commissioner Christine Varney and AOL chief executive
Steve Case also are in the process of shepherding organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the FTC report, industry leaders contend that online
shopping is a relatively safe proposition. The leading
electronic-commerce sites have detailed privacy policies against
circulating consumers' personal data without permission, the report
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are five to seven times more likely to have your privacy
invaded offline. There are few instances of identity theft,'' said
Susan Scott, executive director of the nonprofit group TRUSTe in
Palo Alto. The company has a privacy-notification seal that is used
by 135 e-commerce sites, including Disney, America Online and
Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to foster trust in order to create consumer
confidence,'' Scott said.

JORDAN NEEDS RELIEF IF BULLS ARE TO DEFEND TITLE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Michael Jordan came rising out of the paint
like a sputtering prop plane. There was a cough and a hiss and a
gurgle as Jordan flew in for a dunk that ended as he cracked the
ball against the rim like a new roll of pennies.
</P>
<P>
   There was not enough air in Jordan, not enough swoosh in his
swoop. He was spent as regulation spilled into overtime of Game 1
in the National Basketball Association finals Wednesday. You could
see it when his mind lapsed for a 24-second violation, and when his
concentration slipped on a clutch free throw.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, you could see it in the final score. The Jazz won,
88-85, in a game that would normally be tucked away by some great
Jordanesque moment. Instead, the Bulls trudged away from perhaps
their best chance at stealing the home-court advantage from the
Jazz by leaving a trail of evidence that points toward a decline.
</P>
<P>
   It's like noticing your parents are old for the first time.
There was something disconcerting in seeing how Jordan has finally
begun to show signs of mortality at 35. He is not immune to fatigue
anymore. It was true in his grueling seven-game conference final
against Indiana. And it was true on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls are to survive in this series, which continues with
Game 2 on Friday at the Delta Center, Jordan needs some relief,
whether he wants it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get Michael out of the game in the third quarter,
but he bargained his way back on the floor,'' Coach Phil Jackson
said Thursday before his team practiced. ``Against my better
judgment, I did not dissuade him. When I saw Jeff Hornacek reverse
him, I got him right out of the game. It's pretty obvious we're
going to have to provide a little more support. At least we carried
the action and the momentum, but defensively we couldn't make the
stops down the stretch because we were fatigued. Guys had their
hands on their knees.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, John Stockton was April fresh. The Jazz's
36-year-old, bowl-cut point guard was the one with the spring in
his high tops as he cut through the Bulls in overtime. But Stockton
was not acting on immortal energy, he was fresh because the Jazz
had the depth on their bench to rest him for 18 minutes in
regulation. All Coach Jerry Sloan had to do was insert Howard
Eisley, the kind of quick point guard that disrupts the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did not have that luxury. The Bulls' bench scored just
eight points in Game 1, while Scottie Pippen and Jordan combined
for 54 of the Bulls' 85 points. After a while, it seemed the
burden, and the Jazz's double teams, left Jordan too ragged to come
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let him fool you,'' said Bryon Russell, who is often
assigned to guard Jordan. ``Maybe it's due to fatigue that he
missed some shots down the stretch. You can't look at the fact that
he's missed such and such a shot in the last three playoff games,
or whatever. He'll be there because this is when it counts.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is not just about a missed dunk in Game 1 of the finals,
but about Jordan shooting a weary 37 percent in the fourth quarters
of his last six playoff games. This is about the fatigue-induced
spill he took as he drove on Derrick McKey for a winning shot in
Game 6 against the Pacers, and about the three fourth-quarter
turnovers he had in Game 4 in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been easy for Jordan and the Bulls lately. This was
only magnified in Game 1 against the Jazz. There were
uncharacteristic turnovers from Pippen _ three in the first half _
and there was strained communication on the court. In one timeout,
Jordan yelled to get Pippen on the same page late in the fourth
quarter. It didn't matter that Pippen's 3-pointer went in to tie
the game, Jordan wanted him to make sure his partner saw the
mismatch he had on the gimpy Hornacek in the post.
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan is accustomed to berating a teammate for their
imperfections, he has displayed a few flaws as well. He is not the
same spry star who can carry his team no matter what; not without a
breather.
</P>
<P>
   That youthful glow is gone. You could see it in his tired eyes
Thursday. But there was also a sense that as frustrated as the
Bulls are to find themselves down by 1-0 in the four of seven games
series _ after a game they lost even though Karl Malone shot
9-of-25 _ they are not ready to walk off into the sunset and call
it a day on their dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an inner strength and confidence,'' Jordan said. ``One
game does not deteriorate that. Sure, it's a pressure situation.
But you don't fight that with frustration and anger. I think you
have to do it with a whole different frame of mind. Smiling, when
you really may be frustrated inside, can help relieve the tension.
I think it's that Zen Buddhism kind of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game does not dictate how this series is going to end. If
you want to write us off, go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Having to prove the opposite probably serves as needed fuel for
Jordan.

SCHOOL DISTRICT WANTS ID BADGES FOR STUDENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN MAESHIRO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With schoolyard shootings nationwide raising
fears about campus safety, Antelope Valley Union High School
District officials are considering requiring students and staff
members to wear photo identification badges.
</P>
<P>
   The badges, which could have bar codes that would provide
information on students when scanned in school computer systems,
would make it easier to identify people who don't belong on campus,
said officials for the rural Los Angeles County school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``(With) what we see happening around the country, the
unfortunate situations with students being shot, security has
become a big issue,'' board member Brett Nelson said. ``We have to
do whatever we can do to protect students. We need to provide a
safe environment for our students, within reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The district board discussed the concept at a meeting Wednesday
and will revisit it at a future meeting along with the idea of
requiring school uniforms, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Trustee Kevin Carney said the board will probably vote on
whether to require name badges as a pilot program at one or more
schools at the next meeting. The policy, if approved, would take
effect next school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea,'' Carney said. ``Some people might
argue wearing one is an unnecessary burden on kids. You look at the
aerospace or airline industries or any form of employment where
there are security problems, it's almost standard that people wear
ID. We are all required to carry a driver's license.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the name-tag idea came up after he and fellow
trustees learned about it at a school boards conference in New
Orleans. Officials from one school district at the conference said
they paid for the badges through a corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   The tags would make it easier to identify outsiders who don't
belong on campus, Nelson said. One teacher at the meeting said tags
would assist in identifying students involved in fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had fights that occurred that are mostly gang-related,
where people who weren't supposed to be on campus came on to get at
students from a rival gang,'' Nelson said. ``With the amount of
kids we have on campus, (with badges) it would be easy for a
teacher or a security person to identify a student by name.''
</P>
<P>
   At Littlerock High School, in the high-desert community of
Littlerock, east of Los Angeles, most staff members are already
wearing name badges, said Principal Marcia Crooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school gets bigger all the time, and we have turnover. It
helps getting to know each other, and it helps students get to know
new people on campus,'' she said. ``When a community member comes
to visit, they have to wear a visitor's pass. This way there's no
way of confusing existing staff members with anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said there may be some difficulties with name badges,
such as how to enforce wearing them or make sure students are
wearing the correct ones.
</P>
<P>
   Littlerock High students are supposed to carry identification
cards, and Crooks thinks it might be better to first work on
enforcing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me personally, we need to be able to adequately enforce
the student ID card first,'' she said. ``If we can't get them to
carry that, how are we going to get them to wear a name tag?''
</P>
<P>
   As far as enforcement, the district needs to weigh how much
effort it will take to enforce the wearing of ID badges vs. the
benefits from such a policy, Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that we need to work out with teachers,'' he
said. ``Teachers will be the ones who are going to enforce it.''

`MORE TALES OF THE CITY' 
</HEADLINE>
 TALES _ 825 _ SFCHRON   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If PBS' ``Tales of the City'' caused a stir in
Georgia, Tennessee and Oklahoma, then ``More Tales of the City''
would bring Florida, Alabama, Utah and several counties in Indiana
into the ruckus, guaranteed. Sputtering and fuming, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Armistead Maupin's ``Tales of the City'' sequel, which
cheerfully revels in everything that gives so much of America the
screaming willies about San Francisco, is involuntarily bypassing
PBS and running instead on the Showtime pay-cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   PBS backed out of the sequel four years ago. So ``Armistead
Maupin's More Tales of the City'' will be televisied Sunday and
Monday (June 7 and 8) on Showtime in 21/2-hour chunks each night.
</P>
<P>
   Olympia Dukakis, Laura Linney, William Campbell, Barbara Garrick
and Thomas Gibson are back, perhaps miraculously, from the original
cast. And ``More Tales'' has the same magic mushroom effervescence
of the first miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``more'' applies strongly, though. ``More Tales''
carries a potent TVMA (mature audiences) rating. ``More Tales'' has
more bare buns _ practically all male _ than a corner Burger King,
and a dollop of male frontal nudity. There's an occasional bare
breast, female style. The language is rawer than in the original
``Tales,'' and the characters stoke a toke at practically every
opportunity. We are, after all, reliving the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the comic outrageousness of Maupin's story. Gender
bending? It's more like a pretzel, with the revelation that the
luminous landlord of 28 Barbary Lane, Anna Madrigal (Dukakis), is a
parent. A father.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mary Ann Singleton (Linney) and Michael Tolliver (now
played by Paul Hopkins) are posing as husband and wife on a Mexican
cruise, while each is in search of a stud muffin. Mona Ramsey (the
pouty Nina Siemaszko replaces Chloe Webb in the role) heads for
Nevada in an angel dust haze and soon finds herself answering
phones in a Winnemucca bordello.
</P>
<P>
   The viperous Beauchamp Day (Gibson, who's now the co-star of
``Dharma &AMP; Greg'') is back, scheming to end the pregnancy of his
wife DeDe (Garrick). What'll happen when word gets around that he's
not the father?
</P>
<P>
   And DeDe's socialite mother, Frannie Halcyon (Diana Leblanc) is
courted by a matrons' club that promises to reward her with a
``piece of the pleasure pie.'' Again, the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on. One of the main story lines involves Mary Ann's
shipboard lover, Burke Andrew (Colin Ferguson), who became an
amnesiac while investigating a bizarre mystery that leads
eventually to Grace Cathedral on Nob Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Swoozie Kurtz is cast in the sequel as Mona's worrywart mother,
Whip Hubley moves into the role of Barbary Lane tenant Brian
Hawkins, and there are cameo performances by Ed Asner, Paul Bartel
and, from ``Frasier,'' Dan Butler. Maupin himself puts in an
appearance in the final hour, in full regalia as an Episcopal
priest.
</P>
<P>
   But the surest scene stealer is a thin, elderly Canadian
actress, Jackie Burroughs, as Mother Mucca, the fidgety,
foul-mouthed bordello proprietor. She's all elbows and angles and
hissed profanities. It's a role that the late Ruth Gordon could
have inhabited happily, though no more entertainingly.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Pierre Gang and adapted from Maupin's book by
Nicholas Wright, ``More Tales'' breezes by with a sort of air of
benign perversity. But Maupin drops the fanciful tone a few times
to speak, through his characters, from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, that's the case when the sweet-natured Michael
Tolliver, hospitalized with the paralytic Guillain-Barre syndrome,
dictates a letter to his homophobic parents in Florida, telling
them he's gay and proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   His emergence from the closet coincides with Anita Bryant's
campaign against an anti-discrimination ordinance in Miami. Maupin
has said that he himself ``was brought roaring out of the closet''
by Bryant. Here, certainly, Maupin and ``More Tales'' are reaching
for the heart, &LR;  and not the funny bone.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the miniseries percolates in exactly the same style
as ``Tales of the City.'' Together, the two _ Showtime televised
``Tales of the City'' earlier this week, in preparation for the
sequel _ comprise a viewing experience that feels apart from other
television.
</P>
<P>
   They're deliberately outrageous, in visual detail and story
overlay, and yet Maupin never seems to be trying to poke a sharp
stick in anyone's eye. If anything, he's planed and sanded the
edges. Neither ``Tales'' production seeks to offend, really; on the
contrary, their merrier purpose is to broaden the viewer's sense of
inclusiveness. Fast and far.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbary Lane exteriors are in fact interior shots, and of
course it shows. The lighting is iffy throughout ``More Tales of
the City, &LR; '' and not the production's strong suit. But even here,
the sometimes eerie lighting inadvertently contributes to the
mystique of the Russian Hill address created by Maupin. Barbary
Lane is in and of the city, but also a safe enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's what Maupin and the ``More Tales'' creative crew
are telling us about San Francisco, too. The city can certainly be
eerie in its own right. And while it's in and of America, San
Francisco is a safe enclosure where each day the ridiculous bumps
into the miraculous. &QL;

WHAT'S IN A STADIUM NAME? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED PENHALE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It doesn't rhyme or sound very snazzy, but Seattle
Mariners officials said Thursday that calling their new ballpark
Safeco Field feels right.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based Safeco insurance company will pay the Mariners
$1.8 million a year for 20 years, adjusted annually for inflation,
to hang its corporate name on the $417 million baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question it's a good fit,'' Mariners President
Chuck Armstrong said Thursday. ``Safeco has a very positive
image.''
</P>
<P>
   An insurance-industry fixture in the Northwest for 75 years,
Safeco has a growing national presence. Signing with the Mariners
for the stadium naming rights will enhance the company's
recognition coast to coast, Safeco Corp. Chairman Roger Eigsti
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will be great exposure for us,'' Eigsti said.
</P>
<P>
   With superstars like Ken Griffey Jr., the Mariners are a team
that's popular nationwide _ a team that can draw national TV
audiences who will see and hear the Safeco name, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said the Mariners talked to more than two dozen
companies which either expressed an interest in buying the naming
rights or were approached by the ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco was favored because the Mariners wanted a company that
was home-grown but with a national reputation, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think this is a great combination of two companies who
believe in community,'' Eigsti said at a news conference Thursday
near the ballpark construction site south of the Kingdome. ``It's a
real natural.''
</P>
<P>
   As word spread that the baseball stadium will be named Safeco
Field, radio disc jockeys were wondering out loud if umpires at
Safeco Field will have to call base runners ``Safeco'' instead of
``safe,'' or whether the team might become one of the insurance
company's liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong mused that there probably is no end to the baseball
metaphors Safeco could employ in its advertising and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mariners, said Tom Gibbs, chairman of the state
agency overseeing construction of the new, mostly publicly funded
ballpark, there is an association with a solid company that values
communities and families.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco is a fast-growing Fortune 500 company with 1997 revenues
of more than $4.7 billion. The company's assets exceed $30 billion.
It has 11,300 employees and 8,000 independent agencies representing
a diversified mix of insurance and financial products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This quite a day for me and for (Mariners) ownership,'' said
Mariners CEO John Ellis, as a big banner that said Safeco Field was
unfurled by a construction worker high atop a support structure for
the 45,600-seat stadium's retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the impact of inflation, Eigsti said the cost of the
naming-rights contract will be ``in excess of $40 million'' over 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's competitive with most of the (stadium)
naming-rights deals around the country,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners would not identify other finalists in the running
for the naming rights, but the ballclub approached its top
advertising sponsors such as The Boeing Co., Microsoft Corp., Eagle
Hardware &AMP; Garden, Starbucks Coffee Co., Airborne Express, Texaco
and Seafirst Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was approached but passed on the opportunity, company
spokeswoman Sherry Nebel said. Starbucks, widely regarded as a hot
contender, also was approached, but spokesman Chris Gimbl would not
say if the coffee company actively sought the naming rights.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Isaki, Mariners vice president for development, said that
when team officials settled on Safeco's offer, the corporate name
that connotes safety and security ``had a good feel to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners won the right to sell the naming rights in
negotiations over terms of its ballpark lease. The money the
Mariners will make over two decades from selling the naming rights
is roughly equivalent to the Mariners' $45 million obligation
toward stadium construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the sale of naming rights has been viewed as the
money the team would use to pay its share of stadium construction,
but Isaki noted that the team must put up its full $45 million
contribution by the end of construction.
</P>
<P>
   The money for naming rights will be part of the ballclub's
long-term revenue stream, along with funds from the sale of luxury
suites, tickets, concessions and stadium advertising, Isaki said.
</P>
<P>
   Under state legislation that created the financing package for
the new ballpark, scheduled to open in July 1999, the state Public
Facilities District must consult with the Legislature on the
stadium name before the PFD may approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, the PFD chairman, said top leaders of the state House and
Senate have no qualms about the naming rights going to Safeco. The
PFD will vote to formalize the deal June 15.

EDITORIAL: SALUTING THE DINGELL-MALONEY SWITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., N.Y., Mich.)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, June 5:
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frustrating roadblocks to campaign finance
reform has been the inability of congressional supporters to unite
behind a single coherent strategy. Thursday, Democratic legislators
eliminated a roadblock to reform by announcing that they would not
vote for a toothless commission that could have displaced serious
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal establishing a commission to study campaign finance
reform had been offered by Reps. Carolyn Maloney of New York and
John Dingell of Michigan, who said they were looking for a backup
in case more substantial reform bills failed.
</P>
<P>
   Their intentions may have been good. But the sponsors
inadvertently played into a devious strategy of House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. To protect his special-interest money, he decreed that
the House would vote on a dozen competing campaign finance
proposals this month, and that only the one with the most votes
would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   That meant the impotent commission could kill the real reform
package _ the Shays-Meehan bill, which would ban unlimited ``soft
money'' donations to parties and curb fund-raising for candidate
ads placed by independent groups. Shays-Meehan has survived
numerous attempts to inter it, and Republican leaders, under the
lash of public opinion, had promised to bring it up for a vote. But
they have not stopped plotting to kill it by using the commission
to attract a greater number of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maloney and Dingell were way too slow and stubborn about
recognizing that they were being used by Gingrich. But they finally
announced Thursday that they and other Democrats would simply vote
``present'' when the commission bill comes up on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan,
D-Mass., said they would support an amendment to their measure that
would provide for a commission to study further changes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dingell and Ms. Maloney started off in the wrong
direction tactically, we wholeheartedly salute them for reaching
the correct decision in time to make a difference. Giving up one's
own legislative handiwork to further a larger cause is a big
sacrifice for any member of Congress. But in doing so, both
legislators showed they could emerge as champions of reform.

TV SPORTS: TRAUTWIG GIVES LESSON IN HOW TO INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Conducting a decent post-game interview isn't that
difficult, if you watch the game, show the curiosity to prepare
questions that can produce illuminating answers and think
reasonably well on your feet.
</P>
<P>
   As a model of a top-notch interview, consider Al Trautwig's talk
on the MSG Network with Orlando Hernandez on Wednesday night after
El Duque's seven-inning stint in place of the dog-bit David Cone
led the New York Yankees to a 7-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Directing his questions through the catcher-interpreter Jorge
Posada, Trautwig asked about El Duque's emotions. Then, after
Posada discussed Hernandez's stuff from the bullpen onward,
Trautwig asked: ``In the seventh inning, it looked like he reached
back and put something extra on it. Does he remember that?''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's reply was one of a mature pitcher, as he discussed
using his fastball to keep hitters off balance and throwing curves
for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   With the next question _ ``Can he talk about the experience of
being accepted by the team, because it seemed like an easy
process?'' _ Hernandez's stony demeanor cracked slightly. Through
Posada, Hernandez said he realized ``the kind of quality people''
who are on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Trautwig then tossed in a question seemingly designed to elicit
animation from Hernandez: ``How old were you when you first dreamed
of coming and playing with the Yankees?'' His reply _ that his
Yankee dreams began at age 8, his family loved the Yankees and he
played in a Yankee T-shirt _ was accompanied by a broadening smile
and hand gestures. He began to make eye contact with Trautwig.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he wasn't nervous?'' was Trautwig's final question, which
drew out more emotion. Hernandez described how he felt
``responsible for the Hispanic community,'' how he felt an
obligation to fill Cone's shoes, and how thankful he was to the
Yankees, the Cuban people and his agent, Joe Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   He rubbed his moistened eyes several times. Now, as Trautwig
tried to sign off, Hernandez interrupted to dedicate the game to
the two daughters he left behind when he fled Cuba on a makeshift
sailboat. If Trautwig felt an urge to ask Hernandez about his
wrenching decision to leave his daughters in Cuba, or about the
guilt he feels, he left it for another, less celebratory, time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to Rolando Arrojo,'' Trautwig said Thursday in an
interview, referring to the Tampa Bay pitcher who also defected
from Cuba, ``and he put his kids on a boat like the one El Duque
took from Cuba. I asked Joe Cubas how El Duque felt about that, and
he said his life is not complete without his kids. Cubas said he
speaks to his kids every day.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Trautwig said he wished he had an hour Wednesday
night to ask Hernandez everything possible about his harrowing
flight from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge fan of when the human element enters the story,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, NBC's Ahmad Rashad isn't so curious. He proved
later Wednesday that he is the anti-Trautwig. With Utah's John
Stockton after the Jazz's 88-85 victory over Chicago in Game 1 of
the NBA finals, Rashad's interview consisted of presenting three
banal generalities _ like ``Visiting teams try to steal one but you
wouldn't let it happen'' _ but no questions.
</P>
<P>
   He never asked Stockton about the seven points he scored in
overtime, the floater he sank with 9.3 seconds left or whether he
was surprised that Steve Kerr was guarding him. You would think
Rashad's producers would feed him pertinent questions to avoid this
continuing embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   MIND READER? One peril of being an analyst whose self-described
role is to try to articulate players' thoughts is that your mind
reading will fail.
</P>
<P>
   Before Scottie Pippen's 3-pointer tied Game 1, NBC's Isiah
Thomas noted that Michael Jordan was screaming for the ball. But
once the ball went in, Thomas presumed that Jordan forgave Pippen,
and mind-read thusly: ``He says, `Scottie, it's your turn.'
Scottie's saying, `I'm with you, Michael.'''
</P>
<P>
   But as Jordan and Pippen gathered at a subsequent timeout,
Jordan openly castigated Pippen, wrecking Thomas' cameo as Kreskin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-oh, time for an interpretive U-turn!'' Thomas must have
thought. (See, it's easy to mind read!)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas now presumed what they were saying: ``He's hollering at
Scottie Pippen, `Get it to me, get it to me.' He said, `Look,
Scottie, I'm feeling it. Get it to me.' But Scottie's saying, `I
feel it, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is what was being said. But it's best to stick to the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   A NOSY CAMERA: For Saturday's Evander Holyfield-Henry Akinwande
pay-per-view bout, Showtime Event Television will use a camera that
will move along a track mounted 25 to 35 feet above the Madison
Square Garden ring. It will be used to follow the fighters in their
ring walks, to peer at them in their corners between rounds, and
for replays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can pan, tilt or zoom to any part of the arena,'' said Jay
Larkin, SET's executive producer, about the German technology.
``We're only limited by the amount of track we have.''
</P>
<P>
   AIRWAVES: Game 1 of the National Basketball Association
championship series produced an 18.0 rating, the highest for an
opener of the finals. ... Terrific report by CNN/SI's Bill Nack on
Wednesday on horse racing's Triple Crown, which could be won by
Real Quiet on Saturday afternoon at the Belmont Stakes. Few write
as elegantly as Nack about horse racing, whose storytelling skills
translate well to television.

CIA HEAD REFUSES TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE ON SOME ASPECTS OF CHINA
INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the Justice Department's request, the director
of central intelligence refused on Thursday to share information
that is ``central'' to a Senate investigation into whether American
security was hurt by allowing China to launch satellites for a
company that contributed heavily to Democrats, the inquiry's
chairman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who heads the intelligence
committee, said the refusal by the nation's top intelligence
official, George Tenet, to testify about certain technical
information was ``disturbing.'' Shelby said he would confront
Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday when she and Louis Freeh,
director of the FBI, are scheduled to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Justice Department officials said that Tenet was told not
to talk to senators about certain information because the
disclosure could hamper a federal criminal inquiry into whether
Loral Space and Communications of New Yorkand another satellite
maker, Hughes Electronics, a Los Angeles-based division of the
General Motors Corp., illegally gave China space expertise that
allowed Beijing to more accurately aim its nuclear missiles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Shelby warned the Clinton administration to honor its
promise to cooperate with his committee's investigation and not
hide behind the Justice Department inquiry. ``I don't know if
they're stonewalling,'' Shelby told reporters. ``This is central to
our investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate officials said the information Tenet refused to discuss
relates to a Pentagon report, and possibly a similar report by
another intelligence arm of the government, that concluded that
American national security was harmed by the information passed on
to China.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said that the information Tenet refused to discuss ``was
known to intelligence agencies before the criminal inquiry began,''
and therefore should be provided to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said Tenet was obligated by law to disclose the
information to the panel. Indeed, Tenet told senators he had bee
prepared to answer all questions until the Justice Department's
warned him against it, and that the director felt he was ``in a
box,'' Shelby said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel played down the wrangling. ``There's a
lot of partisan energy behind this,'' Sen. Robert Kerrey of
Nebraska, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in an
interview. ``The Justice Department has legitimate reasons based on
previous leaks to ask for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's three-hour closed hearing with Tenet marked the
opening round of months of hearings by several House and Senate
committees into whether China learned secret information from
American satellites that Beijing then used to aim its nuclear
missiles more accurately.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also delving into accusations that the Chinese
government illegally funneled money to the Democrats during
President Clinton's re-election campaign.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senators and their aides said Tenet discussed both of these
broad topics, but they declined to give details.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shelby's committee is leading the investigation in the Senate.
The House plans to create a select committee to handle its separate
inquiry.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loral's chairman and chief executive, Bernard Schwartz, was the
largest personal contributor to the Democratic National Committee
last year. Schwartz has denied he sought any favors in exchange for
his contributions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While there are many strands to the various congressional
inquiries, federal and congressional investigators are focusing on
the events following the explosion on Feb. 15, 1996, of a Chinese
rocket carrying a $200 million Loral satellites seconds after
liftoff.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion, China asked the two American companies to
conduct an independent review of the accident. The team was led by
Loral, but included experts from Hughes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the American experts overstepped
the boundaries of what they could tell the Chinese during the
review. The State Department asked the Pentagon's Defense
Technology Security Administration to investigate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May 1997, the Pentagon agency report, based on
intelligence and rocket experts, found that American security had
been harmed. Two weeks later, the United States Customs Service
began an investigation that became the basis for the government's
criminal inquiry.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday, on the ninth anniversary of the massacre in
Tiananmen Square, Capitol Hill was awash in hearings, floor
speeches and rallies that condemned the Chinese government's human
rights record and Clinton's visit to China later this month.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a resolution, 305-116, urging Clinton to
avoid visiting Tiananmen Square during his upcoming visit. A group
of lawmakers met with Chinese dissidents, including Wei Jengsheng.
Protesters held a candlelight vigil outside the Chinese embassy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the president really need to stand in blood-stained
Tiananmen Square?'' Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who heads the
House International Committee, said on the House floor.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two House committees, International Relations and Government
Reform and Oversight, heard testimony on accusations about the sale
of human organs from executed prisoners in China to foreigners.  &QL;

ETHERTON SETTLES DOWN AND TROJANS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
OMAHA, Neb. _ On Thursday, Seth Etherton, USC's All-American
right-hander, encountered only a brief relapse of the whiplash
malady that beset him the first time he faced homer-happy Louisiana
State in the College World Series.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time, LSU hit just two home runs, tantamount to a slump
after bashing a record eight off the Trojans in the first round,
six of them off of Etherton.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Trojans were able to hold off LSU for a 5-4 victory at
Rosenblatt Stadium and earn a third shot at the two-time defending
champion Tigers this afternoon. The winner today qualifies for
Saturday's championship game against unbeaten Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Bertman, the veteran LSU skipper coaching his 1,000th game,
had an inkling early on that Thursday's game would be different
from the 12-10, 10-homer slugfest with the Trojans in the opening
round last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up and looked out at the window at the hotel flags
blowing opposite from the other day,'' Bertman said, ``We're very
dependent on the home run, and Mother Nature didn't treat us as
well as we'd have liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Etherton, who this time around had considerably more
snap to his breaking pitches and was able to handcuff the powerful
Tigers on a half dozen hits over eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   It got a little dicey in the ninth, when LSU scored once off of
ace reliever Jack Krawczyk and had the tying run on base. But
Krawczyk got Danny Higgins to fly to center for the final out and
record his 22nd save of the season and 48th of his career, both
NCAA records.
</P>
<P>
   ``What record?'' deadpanned Krawczyk, who's allowed four runs on
eight hits over 5 2/3 innings in three CWS appearances, relying
mostly on his deceptive changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today I struck out a guy on a fastball,'' he said,
sounding surprised. ``That was good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' win snapped LSU's 10-game win streak in the CWS, a
mark the Tigers now share with USC.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers still had their homers. Jack Dalton hit one in the
first inning, giving every batter in the lineup at least one in
just three CWS games, and Cedrick Harris, who bats ninth, hit one
in the top of the seventh to break a 2-2 tie, the 16th overall in
the CWS by LSU.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans regained the lead with two runs in the bottom of the
seventh on successive singles by Seth Davidson, Wes Rachels and
Greg Hanoian, a sacrifice bunt by Robb Gorr and a botched
double-play ball by first baseman Eddy Furniss.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Davidson's one-out run-scoring triple in the eighth
that produced what developed as the decisive run.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Lane opened the inning with a single off left-handed
reliever Chris Demouy, and Rod Perry Jr. bunted him to second.
Davidson sent a liner into the gap in right-center, scoring Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it had been a frustrating day for the Trojans
(47-17), who are seeking their-record 12th College World Series
crown. Twice they had runners thrown out at the plate to end
innings, the first time in the third inning, when Higgins, the left
fielder, cut down Hanoian trying to score from second on a single
by Eric Munson, and then in the fourth, when right fielder Wes
Davis threw out Brad Ticehurst trying to score a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Morgan Ensberg and Munson hit homers for the Trojans,
who aren't exactly powerless; they've hit a USC-record 106 homers
this season, nine at the CWS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any rules against hitting three-run homers,''
USC coach Mike Gillespie said. ``We'd like to hit some, too, like
they do. But, in our case, we still have to do the little things if
we're going to win.''

SHUTTLE FLIES TO OHIO, BUT `EL DUQUE' STAYS IN BRON 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez was supposed to be a one-day
wonder. Promote him for one night on a big stage, then send him
back to Class AAA for more seasoning. But he pitched beautifully
Wednesday and impressed George Steinbrenner, the team's principal
owner, and now Hernandez may be here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out seven in seven innings and beat Tampa Bay,
7-1, and rather than hop the shuttle to Columbus on Thursday, he
remained with the team, as Steinbrenner met with other officials in
Manager Joe Torre's office.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, who flew in from Tampa, Fla., Thursday, would not
immediately speak with reporters, other than to briefly compliment
Hernandez. But he apparently rendered a vote to keep El Duque, as
Hernandez is known; Torre _ who said unequivocally Wednesday that
Hernandez would return to Class AAA immediately after his start _
acknowledged that plans have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, who has pitched well as a starter for the
Yankees, will probably be shifted to the bullpen, with Hernandez
taking his spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the shift in the club's intentions, Torre said:
``The fact is, I don't have the ultimate decision to make. When you
have an organization and an owner who knows what he wants to do,
that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Hernandez could be easily justified on the grounds that
he has demonstrated he is one of the organization's 11 best
pitchers. A scout who watched Hernandez pitch Wednesday said that
if Sandy Koufax, the Hall of Fame pitcher, had a fastball that
deserved an 8 on a scale of 1 to 8, then Hernandez deserved an 8
for his control.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez seemed to be able to throw his breaking pitches for
strikes just about any time he wanted, Tim Raines said, ``and you
just don't see that very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza's presence in the bullpen would strengthen the team's
middle relief. Willie Banks struggled before being dropped from the
team last week _ Thursday, he was traded to Arizona _ and Jeff
Nelson and Darren Holmes have been erratic.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza has pitched effectively out of the bullpen in the past,
and, being a sinker-ball pitcher, he has the ability to get ground
balls and double plays.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Keeping Hernandez would provide financial benefits as well.
Steinbrenner has complained about the lack of attendance at Yankee
Stadium, and Hernandez would draw attention and fans to the Yankees
on the nights that he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a poor team on Wednesday, the Yankees drew 27,291 _
about 8,000 more than they drew Monday, 5,000 more than Tuesday's
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the organization who preferred to send Hernandez
back to Class AAA and keep Mendoza in the rotation _ judging by
Torre's pronouncement Wednesday, this was the course of action
favored by most _ could offer compelling logic, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza has arguably been one of the Yankees' three most
effective starters in the last six weeks, along with David Wells
and Hideki Irabu, compiling a 3-1 record and a 4.18 earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza has pitched five or more innings in seven of his last
eight starts, with a 3.48 ERA as a starter since April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza is in his third year with the team, which, for many,
would give him extra consideration.
</P>
<P>
   With Hernandez in Class AAA, the Yankees would be better suited
to address an injury to one of their starting pitchers; if Mendoza
shifts to the bullpen now, and another pitcher is hurt in a month,
then Mendoza would have to go through the sometimes lengthy process
of re-adapting to the physical regimen required for a starting
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of Mendoza's confidence: would he be
hurt by losing his job when he has pitched well? Torre said:
``We're not dealing with pieces of paper. There are people who
would have to be talked to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said: ``I'd rather be a starter, but the bullpen is OK.
The important thing is to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If others in the organization want to change Steinbrenner's
mind, they'll have a few days to do so. Mendoza pitches Saturday,
against Florida, and the earliest Hernandez might be needed to
start again would be Tuesday, in Montreal, if the cut on David
Cone's right hand hasn't healed sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   If Cone can pitch, then Hernandez may not be scheduled to start
for another week to 10 days. ``We'll keep him around here,'' Torre
said, ``and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez longed to pitch in the United States since his
childhood. He was out of organized baseball for a year and a half,
after being banned by officials in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He spent half a day on a leaky boat, fleeing Cuba, and three
more days hoping and praying for someone to pluck him and his wife
and six others from an island. Nearly three months passed before he
was able to sign his first contract.
</P>
<P>
   He's waiting again for his fate to be decided _ but in this
case, it seems that good things are in store for him. &QL;

ORAN K. HENDERSON, COURT MARTIALED IN MY LAI CIVILIAN KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ga., Ind.)  (js) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Col. Oran K. Henderson, the highest-ranking officer to be tried
as a consequence of the killings of Vietnamese civilians in My Lai
in 1968, died Tuesday at the Lebanon Veterans hospital in Lebanon,
Pa. He was 77 and had pancreatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, a career officer, was acquitted in a court martial in
1971, leaving Lt. William Calley Jr., a platoon leader, as the only
soldier to be found guilty and punished for the massacre in My Lai.
The belated disclosure of apparent war crimes in the hamlet and the
subsequent accusations of a cover-up tarnished the Army's
reputation and broadened criticisms of U.S. involvement in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's death came less than a month after that of Ronald
Ridenhour, a 52-year-old New Orleans journalist who as a young
helicopter gunner serving in Vietnam had heard what had happened at
My Lai and brought the atrocity to public attention through letters
to politicians, which he felt safe enough to send only after
leaving the military.
</P>
<P>
   Those letters eventually led to newspaper exposes and official
inquiries that confirmed the killings at My Lai, which took place
as the 105 men of Company C attacked the hamlet of 700 people,
believing it was a Viet Cong base. According to Seymour Hersh,
whose reporting on My Lai was awarded a 1970 Pulitzer Prize, no
Viet Cong were encountered. At least 350 civilians were killed,
among them women and children, at My Lai alone, and there were
other killings by B company at nearby hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   That day, March 16, was Henderson's first as the commanding
officer of the newly formed 11th Infantry Brigade, which included
Company C. When the assault was mounted, he was watching from a
command helicopter circling over My Lai.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the news accounts made My Lai as recognizable a name
as Saigon did the Army conduct an official investigation. After
three-and-a-half months of taking evidence, Lt. Gen. William Peers,
who headed the panel, declared on March 18, 1970, ``Our inquiry
clearly established that a tragedy of major proportions occurred
there on that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the Army was to charge 25 officers and enlisted men
with having taken part in the massacre in some way or of having
covered it up. Of this total, 19 men had charges against them
dropped without facing trials. Of the six who came before courts
martial, only Calley was convicted. He received a life sentence at
hard labor, which was soon reduced to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But as Calley was increasingly perceived _ even by his critics _
as the single scapegoat for My Lai, he was paroled by Howard
Callaway, secretary of the Army in the Nixon administration, after
serving less than four years. He is now a jeweler in Columbus, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was the highest ranking officer of those who went
before court martial, and his case at the end of 1971 was the last
one to be heard. He had been charged with willful dereliction of
duty for not having carried out an adequate investigation. His
trial at Fort Meade, Md., lasted 62 days, thus tying the Calley
case as the longest court martial in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution argued that with the information available to
him and with complaints that were made at the time by helicopter
pilots, it was inconceivable that Henderson could report as he did
to his division commander that ``only 20 civilians'' had been
inadvertently killed by artillery fire. The prosecution contended
that Henderson had covered up the killings because he feared that
he would lose his new position as brigade commander and thought
that any report of a mass killing would end his chances for
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argued that Henderson had tried to find out what had
happened at My Lai, but was prevented by officers who kept lying to
him, insisting that only 20 civilians had been killed. Until his
first day commanding the 11th Brigade, the colonel had compiled an
enviable military record.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Indianapolis on Aug. 25, 1920, he spent much of his
adulthood in combat. He served and was wounded in three wars _
World War II, Korea and Vietnam. He was awarded four Purple Hearts
for combat wounds, and five Silver Stars and five Bronze Stars for
valor.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 18, 1971, after 106 witnesses had been heard, Henderson
stood at attention and heard the president of the jury declare that
he had been found not guilty. He saluted and said the verdict
``reaffirms the confidence any Army man can have in the military
system.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to active duty, becoming commandant of the
Indiantown Gap Military Reservation in Pennsylvania. When he
retired in 1974, he told The Associated Press that his departure
was mandatory since he had been colonel for five years without
promotion. He said that while his retirement was not necessarily
related to My Lai, he did feel responsible for the incident because
the troops involved were under his command.
</P>
<P>
   As a civilian, he became Pennsylvania's director of civil
defense, organizing relocation and recovery efforts in the wake of
devastating floods in 1977. At that time, as he once again found
himself in the news, he observed: ``Occasionally people will come
up to me and say, `I remember your first name, Oran, from
someplace.' We usually get around to the fact that I had had a
little bit of publicity a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who made his home in Carlisle, Pa., is survived by
three children: Kenneth R. of Guilford, Ind., Ann H. Kline of
Lebanon, Pa., and Nancy V. Schultz of Monroe, N.Y.; five
grandchildren; a brother, Wayne of Indianapolis; and two sisters,
Glenita Bastin of Noblesville, Ind., and Virginia Betts of
Indianapolis.

WATCH OUT FOR LIMIT OUT
</HEADLINE>

By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ As the search intensifies for a Belmont Stakes
horse that might derail Real Quiet's bid for the Triple Crown, eyes
are increasingly cast toward lightly raced Limit Out.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. The speedy Limit Out is trained by
69-year-old legend H. Allen Jerkens, who wears the scalps of many
famous horses on his belt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 and 1963, Jerkens sent out Beau Purple to upset Kelso
three times in less than a year. The only races Secretariat lost
after his Triple Crown sweep in 1973 were to Onion and Prove Out,
both trained by Jerkens. His list of victims is so long, in fact,
he was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1975 at age 45, the
youngest trainer at that time to be so honored.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the painfully shy but temperamental Jerkens is known around
the Belmont Park backstretch as ``The Giant Killer,'' a nickname he
deserves but didn't seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I can do about it,'' he said. ``I'm stuck with it. But
I didn't come up with it, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   A contrast to today's BMW-driving and cellular phone-toting
horsemen, Jerkens is a throwback to a time when trainers dedicated
their lives to their horses. He is still at the barn religiously at
5 a.m. seven days a week, rides a pony to accompany all his horses
to the track for gallops and obsesses about every detail of daily
care and race preparation.
</P>
<P>
   As Jerkens prepares Limit Out for Saturday's race, he is relying
on all his experience.
</P>
<P>
   Limit Out has won four of five lifetime starts and has run seven
furlongs in 1 minute, 20 2/5 seconds. However, he has never raced
beyond a mile, and the Belmont distance is a 1 1/2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if it were his horse, the conservative Jerkens would
be seeking a more logical spot than the Belmont. But Limit Out is
owned by Jerry Shields, a New York Racing Association trustee who
has asked Jerkens to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get roped into these things,'' Jerkens said with
a chuckle. ``I'm changing the way I've been training him, trying to
teach him to run longer distances, to breathe differently.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Who knows?'' &QL; 
REAL QUIET DRAWS NO. 8 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday morning, Real Quiet drew post position No. 8 in a
13-horse Belmont field. The lineup was swelled by the surprise
entry of front-runner Chilito, owned by banking and media magnate
Joseph Albritton, who has homes in Washington, D.C., and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bob Baffert seemed unconcerned about Real Quiet's
slightly disadvantageous draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have a horse training great than have a great post
position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet got his first feel of the Belmont Park surface
yesterday in a casual jog around the track. &QL; 
WEATHER FACTOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All week, rain has been in the forecast for tomorrow's race. But
yesterday the weather handicappers did an about-face and are
calling for partly sunny skies, temperatures around 70 and only a
slight chance of showers.
</P>
<P>
   That could be important to Real Quiet's chances: The only time
he raced over a wet track, he was beaten badly.

   Likely swan song &QL; 
sounding off-key
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ As the ugly events in Game 1 of these NBA Finals
continue to be as digestible for the Bulls as the soles on a pair
of worn-out Nikes, we receive this unpleasant news flash for
parents all across the land:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan has taken to playing the piano.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that in addition to shelling out money that was
intended for the mortgage payment and the light bill to keep Junior
shod in the latest, stylin' pair of overpriced high-tops, now any
self-respecting mom and dad also will feel pressured into adding a
baby grand to the living-room furniture. Maybe a Steinway with a
Swoosh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the piano last night,'' Jordan said. ``I played at
it. Don't confuse the issue. I'm just pushing the keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a piano here in my hotel room. I'm taking lessons
from Ahmad.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would be the ubiquitous Ahmad Rashad, NBC's
news hound and barnacle who has hitched a ride on the hull of the
S.S. Jordan. For a guy whose annual NBA salary is $33 million and
whose impact on the global economy has been estimated by Fortune
magazine at $10 billion, you would think Jordan would fly in
somebody such as Van Cliburn if he wanted to take piano lessons.
Instead, he's learning The Battle Hymn of the Republic from a
microphone-toter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike and I sit there and bang the keys together,'' Rashad
says.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls remain confident
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of keeping down breakfast, let's not explore
this subject further, except to wonder if any future musical jaunt
will have Jordan interested in Jazz. Namely, how to play it tonight
in Game 2 of the NBA Finals at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the opener found the Bulls wearing smiles so
broad, you would have thought they had accompanied Dennis Rodman on
one of his side trips to Las Vegas and hit the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really talked to my team yet to measure anything
about their level of emotion,'' said coach Phil Jackson. ``But I've
looked at the game tapes and discussed it with my staff, and I feel
fine. It's a beautiful day here in Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   In one breath Scottie Pippen said the Bulls were frustrated
after their 88-85 overtime loss, and in the next the smile was back
in place and he said the pressure was still on the Jazz to defend
its home court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still feel that we're in control of the series,'' Pippen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said the Bulls have an inner strength that allows them to
get through the tough times, of which this situation would seem to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   That frustration seemed evident. After Pippen hit a big 3-point
shot in the fourth quarter, Jordan shouted in Pippen's face on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that I was screaming at Scottie Pippen,'' Jordan said.
``I don't have a reason to scream at Scottie Pippen. He and I are
on the same wavelength. I think, due to the loudness of the arena,
I'm pretty sure I was yelling to get a point across.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of barking and frustration from the Bulls in
Game 1. Perhaps with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Champs in strange situation
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since losing the Finals opener to the Lakers
in 1991 _ a series they won in five games to start their dynasty _
the Bulls trail in the Finals. What's more, there were many signs
there are cracks in their championship foundation, on the floor and
in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   His Airness scored 33 points but had to put up 29 shots to do
it. Jordan played 46 minutes of the overtime game. He seemed weary
and spent at the end. On one play, he could not seem to dunk the
ball. With just more than a minute left in the overtime, he had a
mental lapse, which resulted in a 24-second violation.
</P>
<P>
   His Weirdness, Rodman, played the game with tape wrapped around
his right thumb because of torn ligaments. His hair dyed with a
green camouflage pattern, Rodman looks like the product of mating
between a Martian and a Hereford.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson snapped at Rodman for a couple of ill-timed shots and a
defensive lapse that allowed Karl Malone to roar down the lane for
an uncontested dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan sniped at Luc Longley for trying to dribble through
traffic to the hoop in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game Utah tried to give away, kicking back a 75-68
lead in the last four minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The champion Bulls won that kind of game. The old Bulls seized
the day.
</P>
<P>
   This time they played a different tune, one that maybe Jordan
will have to learn from Ahmad in the next piano lesson. It's an old
Neil Sedaka number: Breaking Up Is Hard To Do.

DOZENS OF FIREMEN IN DRUNKEN BRAWL AT RESTAURANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A celebration of heroism by New York City
firefighters degenerated into a bacchanalian brawl at a cafe in
Bryant Park on Wednesday night as firemen harassed patrons,
urinated publicly, exposed themselves, ran through a women's rest
room and got into bloody fights with each other and anyone who
tried to intervene, outraged city officials acknowledged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most serious breach of conduct by members of the
city's uniformed services since 1995, when dozens of New York
police officers went on a drunken rampage at several hotels in
Washington, groping women, spraying fire extinguishers, running
about half-nude and sliding down beer-soaked bannisters.
</P>
<P>
   It also appeared to be one of the most embarrassing episodes in
the history of the Fire Department. Although none of the offenders
had been publicly identified Thursday night, Fire Commissioner
Thomas Von Essen and other officials vowed a full investigation and
vigorous prosecution of any law-breakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has acted criminally or in a manner that brings
discredit to the department will be severely punished,'' said Von
Essen, who noted that investigators had already interviewed 18
civilian witnesses and would ``go into firehouses'' to press the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   After joining hundreds of firefighters and their families at
``Medal Day'' ceremonies at City Hall with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and other officials to honor acts of bravery by comrades, about 40
firefighters gathered at the Bryant Park Grill's awning-draped
outdoor cafe behind the New York Public Library in the late
afternoon Wednesday, and witnesses said the party soon grew ugly.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe's manager, bartenders and others told of hours of heavy
drinking by firefighters, who were off-duty but still clad in their
navy-blue, brass-button dress uniforms. And they told of a party
that regressed from fraternity-like rowdyism that sent furniture
flying and patrons running, into a carousing mob that engaged in
lewd behavior and sporadic but bloody fist-fights.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe was closed two hours early at 9:30 p.m., but the
manager was afraid to tell the firefighters they had to leave.
Police were finally called at 10:30 p.m. and rounded up dozens of
men at the scene. They were taken to the Midtown South Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   But the only person who was arrested immediately was the cafe
bouncer, who, according to his manager, mistook an officer for one
of the brawlers and hurled him over a planter onto a patio. ``It's
so unfair,'' the manager, Donna Simms, said Thursday. ``A fireman
in uniform hits someone who is not in uniform and our security is
arrested for that?''
</P>
<P>
   The debauchery and violence came at the end of one of the
proudest days of the year for city firefighters. Hundreds and their
families gathered before a stage set up on the steps of City Hall
in the late morning to honor acts of bravery last year. Bagpipes
played. The banners of engine and ladder companies that boasted
medal winners were unfurled.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, in an address, called firefighters ``greater heroes
than the Yankees.'' Medals went to firefighters like Stan Sussina,
who was lowered by rope out of a 29th story window to rescue two
women from a burning apartment below; like Ali Pasha, who ran six
stories up into a burning building to save a trapped man.
</P>
<P>
   For most of those who attended, it was a day of humbling pride;
but for a few it was something more hubristic. It was unclear when
the drinking began. But by early evening, those who gathered at
Bryant Park Grill had begun to behave badly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simms, the manager, said the firefighters tried to set up a
makeshift band _ drums, a keyboard, a microphone. When she asked
them to stop, they told her they had permission from the Parks
Department. After she still refused, the firefighters began walking
through the restaurant's kitchen, drinking beer and puffing cigars,
and several wandered into the women's restroom.
</P>
<P>
   As the night progressed, they became rowdier, Ms. Simms said.
``They were urinating in the park, planters were turned over, and a
few chairs,'' she said. ``It was like a mob, like a big frat party.
They were an embarrassment. But we were afraid to tell them they
had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It got worse, Juan Dorta, a bartender, recalled. Flower pots
were broken. Beer glasses were smashed. ``They were out of their
minds,'' he said. ``First they were joking around with each other,
then they started to fight with each other, and whoever tried to
break it up _ bartenders, bouncers, whoever _ they just kept
throwing punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Another bartender who gave her name only as Naomi said, ``They
were punching each other and drawing blood.''
</P>
<P>
   A police investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said, ``Some exposed themselves, walked about partially nude,
urinated in public, entered nonpublic areas of the restaurant,
smoked cigars in nonsmoking areas, entered the ladies' restroom and
generally carried on in an unprofessional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Kemp, 31, a 6-foot, 4-inch, 250-pound law-school student
working at the cafe as a bouncer, saw a uniformed man beating up a
civilian and attempted to break it up, Ms. Simms said. As he did
so, Officers Lawrence J. McDonnell and Michael McLean, of the
Midtown South Precinct, arrived.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell tried to break up the fight, but Kemp, who mistook him
for one of the brawlers, according to Ms. Simms, flipped the
officer over a planter onto the patio. The officer was taken to
Bellevue Hospital, where he was treated for chest, back, neck and
shoulder pains and released.
</P>
<P>
   Police reinforcements, meantime, rounded up about 25 other men
at the scene. They, along with Kemp, were taken to the Midtown
South Precinct. Police said witnesses were unable to identify any
of the men in custody as brawlers. Their names were taken and all
were released, except Kemp, who was charged with assault, resisting
arrest and obstructing governmental administration.
</P>
<P>
   Released on his own recognizance after an arraignment Thursday
night, Kemp said: ``I don't think I was treated fairly. I was
trying to defend myself. I was trying to protect myself from the
firemen.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, David Kapnor, a Legal Aid attorney, said his client
would hire a private attorney and noted that Kemp would cooperate
in any investigation. ``I think there's plenty to investigate,''
Kapnor said. ``Something doesn't look very good here.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talk about denial. Even as more and more corporate
managers warned that their second-quarter results were looking
grim, investors piled into the stock market. And they piled most
heavily into those companies most vulnerable to near-term earnings
disappointments _ the technology group.
</P>
<P>
   When business is looking materially different from what Wall
Street analysts have been expecting _ either up or down _ corporate
managers like to warn investors that their expectations may be a
bit off.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter of this year, more of these so-called
pre-announcements are not only coming in early, they are coming in
ugly.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, according to Chuck Hill of First Call, which
tracks company earnings, 139 companies had publicly given an
overview of their second-quarter results. Considering that we still
have four weeks to go before second quarter results actually start
trickling in, we are running well ahead of where we were last year
at this time. That's the early part.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the ugly. Of those companies pre-announcing, 58 percent
have warned that their earnings will be lower than analysts are
estimating. After Thursday's close, for example, Motorola said it
was taking a $1.95 billion charge against second-quarter earnings
and would report an operating loss.
</P>
<P>
   That 58 percent number should raise an eyebrow, according to
Hill. He said the split between negative and positive guidance on
earnings was usually 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   Neither fact from First Call bodes well for the overall market.
But the data is particularly ominous for technology stocks.
Managements of these companies are the bulk of those issuing
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Double denial. These are just the stocks that rallied on heavy
buying Thursday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's High Technology Composite
index rose 2.2 percent Thursday as investors grabbed anything they
could in stocks of semiconductor makers, networking companies,
personal computer companies and other hardware manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   What gives? Even as grim news continues to come from technology
concerns, investors seem to think that all the bad news for the
industry is already reflected in these companies' stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last few days, earnings warnings or other gloomy
talk have come from technology companies as varied as Motorola;
Komag Inc., a disk-drive manufacturer, and Integrated Device
Technology, an integrated circuits maker. This on the heels of
worries from industry giants like Analog Devices, which makes
integrated circuits; Applied Materials, a manufacturer of
semiconductor wafers, and AMP Inc., the world leader in connectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not just some little guys with problems,'' Hill
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors find these stocks much easier to buy now
than they were a few months ago when they were much higher. Even
after Thursday's rally, the S&AMP;P High Technology Composite was still
8 percent below its high on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   But what investors seem not to focus on is that even those
technology stocks that have fallen fairly dramatically are nowhere
near their lows. Dell Computer, up $4.25 Thursday, to $84.50, is
down 14 percent from its May high. But it's still more than double
its $38.25 price just six months ago. Sure IBM, up $2.18, to
$116.06, is down 7.5 percent from its May 14 high, but it's up 21
percent since March. The S&AMP;P High Technology Composite is 23
percent higher than it was in December.
</P>
<P>
   These stocks might indeed be cheap if one could be certain that
any bad news about their industry or their businesses was already
reflected in their prices. But given how glacially analysts respond
to bad news, this is highly unlikely.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Everybody knows that Wall Street analysts accentuate the
positive. And they are not disappointing us now. Earnings at
technology companies, these perennial optimists believe, will
rebound nicely in the third and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Consensus expectations for third-quarter earnings on First
Call's composite of technology companies are an increase of 21
percent. The herd thinks fourth-quarter earnings will rise 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only trouble with buying this argument is that analysts'
opinions, not completely reliable in good times, are exceedingly
untrustworthy in bad times. Wall Street analysts appear to be
constitutionally unable to help investors face anything but the
cheeriest music.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just opinion. A research paper on momentum investing
strategies found that analysts are slow to revise their
expectations for a company in the face of bad news _ just when you
need them most.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting piece of research on analysts' reactions to
bad news comes from two associate professors of accounting at the
Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University
in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Co-authors Julia Grant and Robert Bricker found that ``when
earnings surprises were negative, analysts were proportionately
more positive in the text of their reports than one would expect,''
according to Ms. Grant. In other words, when analysts are faced
with the harsh reality of reporting a negative number for a
company, they work overtime to counter the unpleasantness. No
wonder investors get confused.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line? If you follow the advice of Wall Street analysts on
your investments, don't think for a moment you'll get the whole
truth from them when times are tough.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hulbert, editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest, which
assesses the performance of investment newsletters, said: ``Bad
news rarely comes out in full. Instead it comes out in dribs and
drabs. There's a very good likelihood that the first downward
earnings revision from an analyst will be followed by another and
another and another.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it Wall Street's version of Chinese water torture.

   ELMONT, N.Y. _ A Chicago Tribune editor turned up his nose this
week when he wrote about Real Quiet's Triple Crown bid at
Saturday's Belmont Stakes. He claimed Real Quiet joining the ranks
of Secretariat, Seattle Slew and Citation was ``akin to the
Clampetts moving in across the street at your Beverly Hills digs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just doesn't fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer John Veitch _ who, in 1978, guided Alydar to three
straight runner-up finishes to Affirmed, the last Triple Crown
champ _ noted the other day that Real Quiet won this year's
Kentucky Derby and Preakness against fields depleted of injured
contenders Grand Slam, Lil's Lad, Event of the Year, Halory Hunter
and Coronado's Quest. The way Veitch sees it, if Real Quiet wins
Saturday, the question remains:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whom did he beat?''
</P>
<P>
   And D. Wayne Lukas _ thoroughbred racing's preeminent trainer in
recent times until being eclipsed the past two years by Bob
Baffert, the affable trainer of Real Quiet _ could only look in the
direction of his rival last month and sniff:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people need to be more professional.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does Baffert answer the snipers and snobs? Actually, he
let his 4-year-old daughter Savannah handle it on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Real Quiet had drawn the eighth post position for
Saturday's 130th running of the Belmont Stakes, the shy little girl
dressed in a yellow tam and smock crawled into her daddy's arms.
Baffert grinned: ``What are we gonna say to the folks from Visa on
Saturday?''
</P>
<P>
   Savannah looked down a moment, then whispered ``I know . . .
We're gonna say, `Five million dollars!' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Real Quiet wins the mile-and-a-half Belmont and becomes our
new Pegasus, he will have won one of the most elusive titles in all
of sports. And that will mean the richest payday in thoroughbred
racing history. Along with the $600,000 winner's share from the
Belmont comes a $5 million bonus from Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Getting one of their credit cards might be easy, but they know
that winning the three Triple Crown races in just five weeks is an
almost impossible task. Thirteen horses have run to the lip of
history _ winning the Derby and Preakness _ only to lose the
Belmont, a grueling, 12-furlong race that all but blocks the
passage to immortality. Most American bred and trained horses are
not built for this throwback test of stamina over speed.
</P>
<P>
   In racing history, only 11 horses have won the Triple Crown.
They make up a fabled fraternity to which Real Quiet, critics say,
doesn't rate admission. They see him _ this colt whose deformed
knees were once held together by screws and pins, this ugly
duckling who Baffert bought for a flea market price tag of $17,000,
this also-ran who had won just twice before the Derby _ as a knock
kneed, narrow-chested castoff standing at a back-door entrance to
fame
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason the Belmont field grew to 13 horses Thursday.
A couple of trainers see Real Quiet as a pretender, ready to be
silenced for good.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this dismissal may be aimed at Baffert. Never mind he's
the only trainer ever to contend for the Triple Crown two years in
a row. Last year, his big gray colt, Silver Charm, was headed for
Triple Crown triumph when he was caught deep in the Belmont stretch
by Touch Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Some backsiders remember that a little over six years ago,
Baffert was still part of the minor-league quarter horse circuit.
With such limited seasoning, he's taken thoroughbred racing by
storm. He doesn't just produce, he does it with style. He's fun _
the guy who two years in a row put the silver Preakness bowl on his
head, the guy who once wore a pumpkin on his head in the Winners
Circle after a Halloween victory, the guy who Thursday told the
post-draw crowd, ``Now I just got to keep him alive two more
days.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought more laughter and embrace, but in some quarters,
that also brings petty backlash. Baffert knows:
</P>
<P>
   ``Look how they're knocking President Clinton. He's like us, a
regular guy. But the high echelon knocks him because he's not like
them. They think they set the standard and if you do well, they
want to tear you down. The thing is, we (owner Mike Pegram and
Baffert) grew up at the same time as him. We grew up in the hippie
generation and it's coming out now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is Clinton's doing a great job. Look at the way our
economy is. To me he's one of the greatest presidents since I've
been alive. And Real Quiet? I've had great horses and he is a great
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said his bay colt has grown into greatness: ``He's
changed mentally. He never used to stop and stand, he was always
wiggling. Then he got to Kentucky and turned tough. He learned to
stop and stare. We had him in the stable next to Silver Charm and
he must have told him how to act. He's just a big awkward kid whose
finally getting it down. He's finally learned to dunk the
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Preakness he was tired and then he dug down and won on
blood and guts. We can't help that other horses fell by the
wayside. That's what the Triple Crown is all about. It's survival
of the fittest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been able to do this because he has character. And today
again he looked good in his workout. He's full of himself right now
and I see him coming up big Saturday. I can't see him losing unless
we get some bad luck. And I believe in karma. I think the Triple
Crown gods will look down on us. If not, well, we've had fun. But
if he does win, it will be awesome. And then there'd be just one
more thing . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at his daughter, who this time did not flinch when she
whispered:
</P>
<P>
   ``Five million dollars.''

BRAWLEY LAWYER SAID TO HAVE NOT QUESTIONED DEFENDANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Though Alton Maddox Jr. publicly accused a
young prosecutor of raping and kidnapping Tawana Brawley late in
1987, when Maddox had his suspect, Steven Pagones, in court 10
years ago ready to testify under oath, he never asked a single
question.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Hayes, the lawyer who was representing Pagones at the
time, testified Thursday in the Tawana Brawley defamation case that
his client had been subpoenaed by Maddox _ Ms. Brawley's adviser _
for a hearing in June 1988, only to wait in the courthouse hallway
while Maddox told the presiding judge to cut proceedings short
because reporters had to meet deadlines and he had to return to New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   But Maddox said that the judge presiding over that hearing _ a
contempt-of-court charge for Ms. Brawley's mother _ had barred
several people whom he wanted to call, including Gov. Mario Cuomo
and Attorney General Robert Abrams, and had also prevented him from
putting Pagones on the stand. ``I would have loved to ask Pagones a
question.'' Maddox said. ``I thought that he should have his day in
court, but other forces did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones is now suing Maddox and two other advisers to Ms.
Brawley _ C. Vernon Mason and the Rev. Al Sharpton _ for naming him
as one of a group of men who they said attacked the teen-ager over
four days in 1987. A grand jury found no evidence that Ms. Brawley
had been assaulted, and it specifically exonerated Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox's failure to confront Pagones at that time goes to the
crux of the defamation case, said Pagones' current lawyer, William
Stanton. He is trying to prove that the Brawley advisers made
reckless, malicious accusations and purposefully avoided learning
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was in court, ready to testify, and Maddox didn't call
him,'' Stanton said Thursday. ``That, to me, is reckless at least
and probably malicious. They totally ignored that, and wanted to go
ahead with their lies.''

EXTENSION FOR BROSIUS SOUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees have opened preliminary
negotiations on a contract extension for Scott Brosius, the third
baseman who could become a free agent after this season. The
discussions were acknowledged by Yankees general manager Brian
Cashman and Brosius' agent, Tony Attanasio.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, 31, is making $2.5 million this season, and if he
continues to play well _ he is batting .337, with 35 runs batted in
_ he could command great attention as a free agent. But Brosius has
stated he loves playing in New York and would be very happy to work
out an extension before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, too, are talking to the agent for outfielder Chad
Curtis about an extension.

   Only tough to survive `Group of Death'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
``D'' stands for death.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner were powerhouse teams Paraguay, Spain, Nigeria and
Bulgaria drawn together into Group D for the upcoming World Cup
than all the world began talking about the luscious possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   This should be a brutal first-round World Cup show.
Entertaining, but brutal.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: If the World Cup is the Super Bowl times 10, as
some say, then this is the Black and Blue Division unchained.
</P>
<P>
   It has been called the ``Group of Death'' for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   All four Group D teams have legitimate World Cup hopes. All four
are playing well going into the tournament. All four have more
World Cup credentials than the majority of nations in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But two teams will go home early. ``D'' stands for
disappointment, too.
</P>
<P>
   Spain was a Cup quarterfinalist just four years ago and boasts
one of the greatest players in the world in Raul Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay had one of the strongest World Cup qualifying runs of
any nation and is a super-talented team formed in the mold of
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is the defending Olympic champion with two more years of
experience under its belt, and the Super Eagles have victories over
such powers as Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria is returning virtually intact a team that made an
inspiring World Cup semifinals run four years ago and features the
creative goal-scoring of Hristo Stoichkov, whose six goals in 1994
were more than any other player in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It promises to be perhaps the most dramatic and entertaining
soccer of the entire first stage, with every match potentially
pivotal and every point huge.
</P>
<P>
   Luck _ a shot bounced off the crossbar or a seeing-eye
deflection into the net _ might be as important as anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to make predictions,'' said Bora Milutinovic,
the former United States and Mexican national team coach now
leading Nigeria. ``Every match will be the same, very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most pivotal match figures to be the opener in the
group between Spain and Nigeria on June 13 in Nantes. The winner of
the match could go a long way, if not all the way.
</P>
<P>
   If it is Nigeria, look out. In fact, it was nearly 20 years ago
when the great Brazilian superstar, Pel, predicted that an African
nation would win the World Cup championship by the end of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this is the final Cup of the century and a victory over
the talented Spaniards could be just the jolt that carries the deep
and talented Nigerians all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic admits that this is by far the best team he has
coached.
</P>
<P>
   It is a team extremely deep at every position, athletic and for
years now has been honing its skills in the tough European
professional leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Victor Ikpeda has twice been named African Footballer
of the Year, while no less than seven other Nigerian players are
regulars for their professional teams.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, on the other hand, has much more Cup experience than any
nation in the group, although it hasn't always been good
experience. It is a team that traditionally has fallen short of
expectations and broken a lot of hearts.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a dominant player on the roster _ Raul _ like
few in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Already, his professional team, Real Madrid, or ``Raul'' Madrid
as the Spanish press calls it, has turned down a nearly $46 million
offer for Raul's contract.
</P>
<P>
   This could be Spain's year. And Raul, 21, seems capable of
putting on a one-man show similar to those of Argentina's Diego
Maradona or Pel in past World Cup tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The only questions for the other deadly dangerous teams in this
group are minor ones.
</P>
<P>
   Can Bulgaria ride Stoichkov's greatness to another memorable Cup
run?
</P>
<P>
   And can Paraguay keep up the great streak of play that it has
been on?
</P>
<P>
   Stoichkov, 34, is coming off a marvelous season in Europe. He
doesn't seem to be slowing a bit. The Bulgarians also should
benefit from a counterattacking style contrary to every other
team's in the group.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay, which loves to attack, has faltered against teams such
as Bulgaria in the past. Its style tends to leave gaping holes in
the defense.
</P>
<P>
   But for nearly two years now, during which the Paraguayans have
lost only two full international matches, few teams have managed to
keep up with this up-and-coming team.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which team survives this group, it should be a thrill
to watch. And after surviving the Group of Death, ``D'' also could
stand for World Cup destiny for the eventual winner here.

GIANTS' BACK OPTIMISTIC IN CANCER FIGHT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Giants running back LeShon Johnson
smiled when he referred to his wife of six weeks as ``a computer
geek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She can get on the Internet and find out anything,'' Johnson
said Thursday of Nalani, whom he married April 27. ``She can fly in
and out of all those web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 10 days, Nalani has been doing research on a
totally unexpected subject. It is non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the type
of cancer that has stricken her husband. It will be treated with
six months of chemotherapy beginning next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been finding out all she can and then filling me in,''
LeShon said Thursday at Giants Stadium. ``I get little reports on
what she's learned all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   This, too, brought a smile to Johnson's face. ``I'm very lucky
to have her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Staring down between the cowboy boots on his feet, he added:
``We're going to beat this thing and get on with life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the day Johnson met with reporters and teammates,
preparing for the next, unexpected stage in his life: the one after
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He has been examined and tested. ``I've been poked so much I
feel like a human pin cushion,'' he said. He has had long,
emotional telephone conversations with his mother, father and
brothers back home in Oklahoma. And he has come to face a new
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you had to be old to get cancer,'' said Johnson,
signed by the Giants just three months ago as a free agent.``I
thought I was a healthy, 27-year-old football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, standing on a makeshift podium next to the Giants
practice field, Johnson listened as the Giants' trainer, Ronnie
Barnes, read off a new set of statistics for this football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``LeShon has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, B cell,'' Barnes said.
``CAT scans have isolated the tumor above his waist. It is 8
millimeters in size. The doctors tell me they are very encouraged
and optimistic that the lymphoma is localized and treatable. He
will start his chemotherapy treatments next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will be treated by Dr. David J. Wolf, an oncologist at
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center who also treated former
Giants lineman Karl Nelson in the late 1980s. Nelson, like hockey
star Mario Lemieux, had Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is generally
considered easier to treat than non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   But as Dr. Marc Lippman, the director of the Vince Lombardi
Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University, said in a
telephone interview from Washington, there are about 15 different
types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10-year survival rates for these lymphomas can range from
10 percent to 90 percent,'' Lippman said. ``It all depends exactly
what subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma he has.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, although questioned on the subject, were not
specific about Johnson's lymphoma type.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is some lymphomas are completely curable and most can
be put into remission,'' Lippman said. ``If he goes into remission,
he can play again, and most likely he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippman added that it was a good sign that Johnson had no
symptoms before the tumor was detected by a routine chest X-ray
last month. It was also a good sign that Johnson's doctors are
saying the lymphoma was detected at an early stage. Asked if
Johnson could play while undergoing chemotherapy, Lippman said:
``Some people go through chemo with only a few setbacks, and some
people get kind of beat up. Let's just say he certainly wouldn't be
on top of his game.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the podium Thursday, beneath a brilliant sun, Johnson nodded
at the Giants' practice field. ``It's my goal to be back out there
before my six months of treatments are over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He then encouraged ``young people'' to get checkups. And he
thanked the Giants for making him feel so at home and welcomed in
just three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was speechless when they told me,'' Johnson said. ``I was
scared and nervous. But I know I have a lot of people praying for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, he plans to go home to Haskell, Okla., where his
father runs a horse ranch and where LeShon learned to ride rodeo
bulls at the age 8. ``I need a little time at home,'' he said
Thursday, standing by the door of the Giants' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   LeShon and Nalani Johnson and their 5-month-old son will return
Tuesday. They are looking for an apartment in New Jersey, not too
far from Giants Stadium so LeShon can attend practices. The
chemotherapy will be administered in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I wanted it,'' he said. ``I'm staying here.''

   INDONESIA IN DEBT PACT WITH FOREIGN BANKERS
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia and a group of foreign bankers agreed on a framework
for rescheduling nearly $80 billion in corporate and bank debt that
has become one of the biggest barriers to restarting the nation's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement offers hope that Indonesia's weakened currency can

industries will flourish again.

   STOCKS CLIMB ON ECONOMIC NEWS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rebounded as investors were soothed by reports that the
economy remains resilient. The Dow Jones industrial average rose
66.76 points, to 8,870.56; the Nasdaq composite, 1.59 percent, to
1,769.95, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, 1.1 percent,
to 1,094.83.
</P>
<P>
   BOND PRICES ARE JOLTED
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, Treasury prices dropped sharply, with the
yield on the 30-year bond rising to 5.82 percent from 5.78. The
market weakened on signs of a strong economy and the Bank of
England's surprise move to raise its benchmark lending rate by
one-quarter point, to 7.5 percent. That raised yields on British
debt securities, making them more competitive.

STERN TALKS LOCKOUT, QUESTIONS PATRIOTISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ David Stern stopped short of calling them
unpatriotic, but he did question the wisdom of players who are
considering boycotting this summer's World Championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the individual players decide to trash their country,
that's going to be their decision,'' Stern said Thursday during his
annual address.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by the league's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, Stern
spent much of the news conference at the Delta Center detailing the
growing labor strife between the players and the owners. The league
is expected to lock out the players July 1 if the two sides cannot
agree on a revised collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the union's president, has been advising members
of the U.S. team not play. And Michael Jordan supported that stance
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a heartbeat,'' Jordan said. ``I would be in favor of not
playing in the World Championship games. If you're going to try to
handcuff one side, we have to retaliate.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik warned that such a boycott could influence U.S. chances
for automatically qualifying for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia. Granik, who is also the president of USA Basketball,
said if the United States did not win the gold medal in Athens it
would have to qualify by playing in a qualifying tournament
possibly during the 1999-2000 NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wearing the USA Basketball hat, I have concern,'' Granik said.
``We have not gotten any notice or anything from players that
they're not going to play, but people obviously have read the
reports that it's being discussed. It will certainly damage USA
Basketball in its international relations and its standing in the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the players association executive director, said
the union was investigating whether the United States could receive
a bye because it won the gold medal at the Atlanta Games in 1996
and has never failed to qualify for an Olympics. He said he was
mindful of the players possibly being portrayed as unpatriotic if
they boycotted the games.
</P>
<P>
   Among the league's stars, the team includes Grant Hill and Gary
Payton. The possibility of sending college players has been
discussed, but no formal decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always worried about our public image,'' Hunter said.
``I am definitely worried about that. Depending upon what the
circumstances are, though, David Stern is in the catbird's seat. We
hope we can reach an agreement with the NBA to head off the
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Because players signed contracts with USA Basketball, Stern is
mostly wringing his hands when it comes to the league's
involvement. But Hunter added, ``We could argue we think USA
Basketball is the alter ego of the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The boycott talk is merely the latest salvo fired in the labor
battle between the two sides. The players canceled a meeting with
the owners in New York on Monday, claiming their proposals were
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   The key issue over which both sides will haggle this summer
involves the league's desire to implement a hard salary cap that
would put a ceiling on how much teams can spend each season. Such a
proposal would most likely do away with the Larry Bird exception, a
rule by which teams can pay their own free agents any amount of
money to retain their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a hard cap,'' Dikembe Mutombo, an executive
committee member, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution over the
weekend. ``They want to get rid of the Bird exception. They want to
tax teams who spend more. We can't live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners exercised their right to re-open the existing deal in
April after a revenue split amounted to the players receiving more
than 57 percent of basketball-related income. Once the threshold
topped 51.8 percent, the owners were allowed to exercise their
option.
</P>
<P>
   While the union does not want a ceiling on player salaries, the
league is afraid the enormous contracts of a few have severely
hampered its economic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really very simple,'' Granik said. ``Under our current
system too much money is being paid out in salaries. And we need a
new system that will bring salary growth in line with revenue
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked where the two sides are in negotiations with only 27 days
left to make a deal before business is interrupted, Hunter said:
``I think it'll come to a head when it's apparent there is going to
be a lockout. It's incumbent on the NBA to come up with a process
or a system that we feel is beneficial to us. We're farther apart
now than when we started.'' &QL;

NYC ASKS COURT FOR IMMEDIATE ENFORCEMENT OF PORN RESTRICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Acting with a speed uncharacteristic of a
governmental body, lawyers for the city filed papers with a federal
appeals court Thursday asking that New York be allowed to
immediately enforce three-year-old zoning laws intended to weed out
and isolate sex businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that free
speech issues raised by sex shop owners fighting the zoning laws
had been fully reviewed since the laws were passed in 1995. The
court said no further review was necessary and that the zoning laws
``may be enforced forthwith.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, lawyers for the sex shop owners said that
they would invoke federal rules allowing them to delay enforcement
for 21 days, while they searched for mistakes or technicalities
overlooked by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before the appeals court closed Thursday lawyers
for the city filed papers asking that the court disallow the 21-day
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the utter lack of merit of plaintiffs' case and the
public interest in enforcement of this important regulatory zoning
scheme,'' wrote Chief Assistant Corporation Counsel Leonard
Koerner, ``the city urgently requests that this court vacate the
stay of enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Koerner did not return telephone calls to his office Thursday
night, but City Councilman Walter McCaffrey, who sponsored the
zoning law, said the motion was a move to end any further
foot-dragging by sex shop owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone on too long,'' McCaffrey said. ``Sixteen different
judges have ruled in favor of the zoning change. Every day they are
open is another day they can pay for their high-priced lawyers to
stall the inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, an lawyer representing 105 sex-shop
owners, called the move dictatorial and said that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani had no regard for due process of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that to allow these establishments to continue to
operate for another 21 days will bring about the collapse of the
city is preposterous,'' Fahringer said.

FIGHTER SCRATCHED FROM BOUT: SHE'S PREGNANT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maria Nieves-Garcia got a surprise during her
pre-fight medical examination for her bout at Madison Square Garden
Saturday: She found out she was pregnant. Thursday, when a third
test confirmed what Nieves-Garcia could not believe, she was
scratched from the bout.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old from Mexico City who has a son, Nieves-Garcia was
scheduled to fight Christy Martin on the undercard of the Evander
Holyfield-Henry Akinwande heavyweight championship bout.
</P>
<P>
   A standard prefight medical examination conducted by the New
York State Athletic Commission on Tuesday showed that the fighter
was pregnant. Nieves-Garcia was given the results on Wednesday,
told boxing officials that she did not believe she could be
pregnant and was given a second test. It also came back positive.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves-Garcia again swore to boxing officials that she was not
pregnant, so she was given a third, more sophisticated blood test
on Thursday morning. The test was positive again and determined
that she was 21 weeks along in her pregnancy, so she was removed
from the card.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that I've come across that, to have a
fighter who was pregnant,'' said Bobby Goodman, the matchmaker for
Don King Productions, the promoter of Saturday night's card.
``That's pretty pregnant,'' Goodman said. ``I can't believe she
didn't know. I called her manager, and he said he wouldn't have
sent her up here if he had known she was pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieves-Garcia is the Women's International Boxing Federation
lightweight champion and has a record of 2-1. She was going to be
paid $15,000 for the match against Martin (34-1-2), which was to be
among those on the Showtime Event Television pay-per-view
broadcast. Nieves-Garcia could not be reached by telephone at her
hotel in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   There were negotiations to sign Melissa Salamone (9-0), a
two-time women's lightweight Golden Gloves from Queens, N.Y., as a
replacement for Nieves-Garcia. But Martin turned down Salamone as
an opponent because she was unfamiliar with Salamone's style and
did not want to fight a hometown boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Salamone is the sister of Louis Del Valle, the World Boxing
Association light heavyweight champion who will meet Dario Matteoni
on the undercard. Goodman was still looking for another opponent
for Martin as of Thursday evening.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A crowd of about 250 showed up for the Holyfield and Akinwande
weigh-in in the lobby outside Madison Square Garden Thursday. After
Holyfield weighed in at 218{ pounds, a cheer went up. After
Akinwande weighed in at 240\ pounds, there was a smattering of
boos.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most that Holyfield has weighed for a bout. He
weighed 218 pounds for his last fight against Tyson. Three and a
half weeks ago, Holyfield weighed 226 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight Ray Mercer was scratched from the card for medical
reasons, said Tony Russo, the executive director of the athletic
commission. Russo would not reveal why Mercer failed the physical.
Marc Roberts, Mercer's manager, said he did not know what the
medical problem was, but was told by the commission's doctors that
it was not life threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Marcellus Brown was Mercer's original opponent, but he broke his
hand in training and was replaced by Mike Sedillo.

   Publicis Acquires Evans Group
</P>
<P>
   Publicis SA in Paris continued its U.S. acquisition streak on
Thursday by buying Evans Group, an agency with billings estimated
at $350 million, and merging Evans with Publicis/Bloom, one of two
Publicis American shops. Financial terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our acquisitions in the U.S. will continue,'' Maurice Levy,
chairman and chief executive at Publicis, said. The deal comes a
month after Publicis acquired Hal Riney &AMP; Partners in San
Francisco, which is being renamed Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney while
remaining a separate agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agency formed by merging Evans and Publicis/Bloom, to be
called Publicis, will have more than 600 employees and billings
estimated at $700 million from clients like BMW, Hewlett-Packard
and Nestle. Robert Bloom, 64, chairman and chief executive at
Publicis/Bloom in New York, will head the combined Publicis with
those titles.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Johnson, 57, chairman and chief executive of Evans, who is
based in Salt Lake City, will become chairman and chief executive
of Publicis-Dialog, a new unit of Publicis that will offer
integrated marketing communications services.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas offices of Evans and Publicis/Bloom will be combined,
with Steve Price, 46, and Seth Werner, 43, co-chairmen and chief
executives there, in those same titles at Publicis. The
Publicis/Bloom New York office becomes the New York office of
Publicis. The Evans offices in Boise, Idaho; Indianapolis; Salt
Lake City and Seattle become offices of Publicis. The Evans office
in San Francisco becomes an office of Publicis-Dialog.

   DMB&AMP; B Sues For Its Expenses  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications unit of
MacManus Group in New York filed suit on Thursday against the
computer company Gateway Inc., contending that Gateway still owes
the agency at least $9 million for expenses related to work
performed before DMB&AMP; B was dismissed. In the suit, filed in
Federal District Court in New York, DMB&AMP; B contended that Gateway
breached its contract with the agency ``by not paying us,'' said
Bill Haney, a spokesman for MacManus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret it has come to this,'' he added. ``It's their right
to terminate us, but it's also our right to receive the
compensation they owe us.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Peacock, a spokeswoman for Gateway in North Sioux City,
S.D., said that the company did not comment on pending legal
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway dismissed DMB&AMP; B in late March after the agency had
handled its worldwide account for only a year, with billings
estimated at $50 million to $70 million. The account, which had
been one of the 10 largest at DMB&AMP; B, was shifted last month to
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, part of the

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   IPO by Cleveland Indians Not Exactly a Hit With Investors  
   
 By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Cleveland Indians Baseball Co. went public yesterday, and the
team's initial offering wasn't exactly a home run for shareholders.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In fact, it wasn't even a broken-bat single. After the first day
of trading on Nasdaq, shares of the Tribe's common stock closed at
$14.75, down 25 cents from the initial offering price of $15.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's American League champions sold about four million
shares of common stock, but gave up virtually no control. Another
600,000 shares were set aside for the deal's lead investment
banker, McDonald &AMP; Co. of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The shares popped up above the $15 mark at one point but spent
most of the day bouncing between $14 and $15 like a bobbled
pop-fly.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if you're an investor thinking that a winning baseball
franchise can fetch the Ruthian returns of a Silicon Valley IPO,
you may want to stay in the stands on this one.
</P>
<P>
   The real winner in this deal is Indians owner Richard Jacobs
and &UR;  &LR; his original investors &UR; . &LR;  By offering a slice of the team to
loyal fans, Jacobs raised $60 million without having to do as much
as lift a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet for the owner, he has ceded hardly any voting control
to the public shareholders. The shares sold yesterday carry only
one vote per share.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Jacobs and his investment group retain all of the 2.3
million Class B shares, which carry 10,000 votes each. That gives
insiders almost 99 percent control, according to Securities and
Exchange Commission filings.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder why the Indians opted to tap the public market
for some extra cash, says Jeffrey Logsdon, research director of
Cruttenden Roth, an Irvine securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of the (baseball) business have changed so
dramatically that the need to access capital has become critical,''
says Logsdon, who tracks entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   In order to cover skyrocketing player salaries, teams
increasingly need bigger stadiums with tonier luxury boxes.
Certainly, with about $60 million in public money, Jacobs ought to
be able to score a couple of free-agent hurlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' offering has captured the attention of other sports
teams. Although the San Francisco Giants have no plans to go
public, the team's owners are keeping an eye on the Tribe IPO, says
Larry Baer, the team's executive vice president and chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As teams are looking to raise capital, this is certainly one
form of doing it,'' Baer says.
</P>
<P>
   And with the stock market in the late innings of an
extraordinary bull run, it's only logical that sports businesses
would want a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very high and sports franchises, like everybody
else, want to capitalize on it,'' says Andrew Zimbalist, an
economics professor at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., and
author of ``Baseball and Billions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs ``can take millions out of the team without giving the
shareholders much of anything,'' Zimbalist says.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians managed to double their profits to about $22 million
in 1997 _ but $9.3 million came from one-time league expansion
fees. Most of the time, baseball teams don't see much growth in
earnings. You can only fill so many seats and sell so many hot
dogs, and broadcasting revenues also have ceilings based on
media-market size.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Indians near the top of their game, there seems to
be little room for improvement on the field or in the stock market.
But that doesn't seem to dissuade loyal fans from buying stock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, several other sports franchises have issued stock to
the public over the years, including the Boston Celtics basketball
team and the Green Bay Packers football team.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers' stock is essentially worthless because it can't be
traded on an open market. But fans all over the country, and
especially in Dairyland, will plunk down hard cash for the
certificates to assure that their team can raise money when it
needs to.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' stock, which rolled out in 1986 on the Big Board at
$18.50 a share, has been about as successful as the team's record
during the post-Larry Bird era. It now trades around $20.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a November 1996 offering by the Florida
Panthers National Hockey League team has produced more positive
results. It's trading at $19 a share, almost double the $10
offering price. But it was engineered by empire-builder Wayne
Huizenga, the team's owner, who is no stranger to public stock
offerings. Also, unlike the Indians' deal, which is a pure baseball
play, Florida Panthers Holdings is loaded with other businesses and
assets, including real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with the exception of the Panthers, it is unconditional
devotion to a favorite team that drives the sale of its common
stock, says Jeff Borden, a Chicago journalist and life-long Tribe
fan.
</P>
<P>
   Borden says he bought two shares of Indians stock yesterday,
expecting to frame the certificate and hang it on his wall. ``It's
clearly not a real investment for me,'' Borden explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly bullish on how the stock will perform,
but I'm bullish on the team's prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   His analysis on the team's performance could be right down the
pipe. The Indians sit atop the American League Central Division and
have gone to the World Series two out of the last three years.  &QL;

   NBA strife threatening World Championship squad
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich's role as coach of
the U.S. entry into next month's World Championship of Basketball
could be jeopardized if NBA players elect not to participate in the
biennial tournament because of the league's labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 players chosen to compete have signed contracts with USA
Basketball, but NBA commissioner David Stern on Thursday said if
those players decide not to honor those deals, USA Basketball would
be left with no choice but to field a team of college or
Continental Basketball Association players.
</P>
<P>
   A change in the makeup of the team could mean a change in the
coaching staff, too, although USA Basketball president and NBA
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said it's possible Tomjanovich
would remain as coach regardless of possible roster shakeups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy Tomjanovich and Del Harris (the Los Angeles Lakers'
coach, who will assist Tomjanovich) have contracts to coach the
team,'' Granik said. ``But USA Basketball is not going to have a
problem with them (perhaps not coaching).
</P>

   ``They both profess they'll do whatever makes the most sense for
USA Basketball. If it makes sense for Rudy to remain a coach no
matter what, I'm sure he would. If it makes sense to replace him
because we had different players, I know Rudy would understand
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. roster includes Detroit's Grant Hill, Seattle's Gary
Payton and Vin Baker, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and Tom Gugliotta,
San Antonio's Tim Duncan, Miami's Tim Hardaway, New York's Allan
Houston, Charlotte's Glen Rice, Sacramento's Chris Webber,
Milwaukee's Terrell Brandon and Atlanta's Christian Laettner.
</P>
<P>
   But they are being pressured by key members of the NBA Players
Association to boycott the World Championship in Athens, Greece,
from July 26 through Aug. 9. Training camp for the U.S. team opens
July 8 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   NBA owners voted 27-2 on March 23 to exercise an option to
reopen the collective-bargaining agreement and are expected to lock
out the players before July 1. NBA insiders expect a long
negotiating process this summer before labor peace is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Some players view the World Championship as one of the few
leverage chips players possess.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a heartbeat, I support it (a boycott),'' Michael Jordan
said. ``I would be in favor of not playing in the World
Championship games. If you're going to try to handcuff one side, we
have to retaliate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' Charles Barkley agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm caught between a rock and a hard spot because I think Rudy
deserves to coach that team,'' Barkley said. ``But that's about the
only leverage we as players have. It would be embarrassing for the
NBA (if the players revolted).''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich is in Chicago for the NBA's pre-draft camp and
preferred not to comment about the situation regarding the World
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   But an NBA source said the matter involves more than just the
U.S. team changing for the tournament. The source said USA
Basketball is weighing its options and will send letters to the
players in about 10 days to ask them of their intentions. If the
NBA players do not participate, USA Basketball will scramble to
find an alternate team.
</P>
<P>
   ``USA Basketball has a commitment to FIBA (Federation
Internationale de Basketball Association) to field a team,'' Granik
said. ``At some point, USA Basketball will have to make a decision.
Now, there's a team USA Basketball is putting together this summer
to play in the Goodwill Games. That's a possibility. There are CBA
players. So there are other options. But I think those options are
not likely to be competitive in the modern world of international
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing people don't realize is that if we don't win the
gold medal in Greece, then we don't qualify automatically for the
2000 Olympics. This event very much is directly related to the
Olympics. And if we don't qualify, we will have to qualify in the
Americas zone, which could take place in the 1999-2000 NBA season.
So there's a real possibility that we won't qualify to play in the
Olympics in 2000 if we don't send the right team to Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   One insider said the qualifying tournament for the 2000 Olympics
probably will be in March of that year, meaning NBA players would
be unable to participate because the season would be going on.
Without NBA players, the U.S. likely would not qualify for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, meanwhile, issued a strong declaration to the members of
the U.S. team that, should they decide not to honor their contracts
with USA Basketball, it would hurt them more than it would hurt the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the NBA's perspective, the players will do whatever they
want to do,'' Stern said. ``What we have is a system between the
NBA and FIBA where we agree that we will require our teams to give
permission to let players participate in global events. In
particular, it was also a request from USA Basketball that we
release our players to go represent the United States of America.
And we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step, as far as we're concerned, is a contract
between our players and USA Basketball, which is a separate
organization from the NBA. We've tried very hard to work with FIBA
and USA Basketball. And if the individual players, having made that
commitment, decide to trash their country, that's going to be their
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. roster for the World Championship must be submitted
this month to FIBA, Granik said. And so far, there are no changes,
in spite of pleas from NBA players union chief Patrick Ewing that
the players boycott the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not gotten any notice from players that they are not
going to play, but people obviously have read the reports that this
is being discussed,'' Granik said. ``It certainly will damage USA
Basketball and its international relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said, there's not a lot that USA Basketball can do,
except that hope the players will understand that this has all
these different ramifications that have nothing to do with the
NBA.'' &QL;

<P>
   Both geographically and culturally, California has always seemed
on the extreme edge of the United States. This is where the crazy
fashions start, from oat bran to surfing shorts to New Age
crystal-gazing.
</P>
<P>
   It is where a black mayor can appear in Chinese robes on a
catwalk, and his rival can be photographed naked in the shower; it
is where anything goes, morally, spiritually or gastronomically,
except the lighting up of a cigarette in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that many Americans have often dreamed of seeing
California, like some extravagant growth, painlessly removed from
the body politic.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-money, anti-special treatment But California has shown
surprising thoughtfulness of late, and never more so than in June
2nd's primary election.
</P>
<P>
   There, a millionaire candidate, Al Checchi, who had spent around
$40 million on his campaign (a record, even for America) was
soundly beaten in the Democratic primary for the governorship; and
another millionaire, Darrell Issa, was beaten in the Republican
primary for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Voters had more sense than to be swayed by these men's money,
which was a poor cover for the fact that they had no political
experience and the vaguest ideological convictions. Instead, they
opted for candidates whose careers commended them.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a flawless choice: Gray Davis, the relatively
impoverished victor over Checchi, now owes a lot of money to the
special interests who helped him. But the result adds a hopeful
note to the endless debate about the proper role of money in
American elections.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi's appearance on the scene was not, as some feared,
pernicious: he challenged the establishment at his own expense,
which was a good thing, but then found his millions did not sway
the voters, which was just as encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi's ads swamped the airwaves but did not work, suggesting
there may be a natural limit to the usefulness of spending money on
commercials (the tactic which most inflates the cost of political
campaigning in America).
</P>
<P>
   Above all, California has shown that voters can usually be
trusted: in all the agonizing over campaign-finance reform, perhaps
the only vital rule is that they should know where a candidate's
money comes from.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Californians voted to end the state's program
of bilingual education, by which non-English-speaking children are
taught in their own language for several years.
</P>
<P>
   This costly program, the largest of its kind in the country, had
patently failed to reduce the dropout rate of Latino high-school
children.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it still had the backing of the education
establishment and many politicians; and again, it says much for the
common sense of California's voters that they chose to scrap it,
opting instead to give children a year of ``sheltered immersion''
in English.
</P>
<P>
   Latino parents supported the proposal almost as heartily as
Anglos, and for a simple reason: in America, despite the currency
of Spanish, English is the language of advancement.
</P>
<P>
   There was another, equally sensible, reason for this vote. In
recent years, California has turned against any kind of
preferential treatment for minorities. In 1996, it became the first
state to bar racial preferences in state hiring and contracting and
in admissions to state universities, a bold move that deserved more
imitators on the national scene.
</P>
<P>
   The bilingual vote is an extension of this policy. California's
voters now believe that after many years of trying to assist blacks
and Latinos by applying admissions quotas or easier standards, the
proper approach is to spend more money on education at earlier
stages and across the board.
</P>
<P>
   With a booming economy and a $4 billion budget surplus, there is
money at last for improving the state's lagging schools; and, with
it, the confidence to defy entrenched bodies, such as the teachers'
unions, that stand in the way of color-blind reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything went smoothly on election day. Californians
turned down a proposal that union members should give their
approval before their dues are spent for political purposes: a
victory for labor that will have national implications.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout, at less than 40 percent, showed that relentless
campaigning-by-television has dulled the taste for taking part in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   There was still far too much money around, even if it proved
ineffectual. And promised for November's ballot are propositions to
ban fluoride in water, to forbid the ``recreational display'' of
dolphins, and to stop drunk-drivers losing the use of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, this is California; too much good sense all at once may
be hazardous to your health. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: IS REAL QUIET THE REAL DEAL?  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The jockey burst into the room, minutes after his
horse, the Triple Crown aspirant, had drawn post position No. 8.
Someone at this moment handed Kent Desormeaux a cellular telephone.
His wife, Sonia, was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got here,'' he told her. ``I just got back from the
Holyfield thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant the photo opportunity in Manhattan, where the
heavyweight champion was preparing for his title bout Saturday
night against Henry Akinwande. One of Desormeaux's attendants was
holding a pair of red boxing gloves, as the jockey spoke at the
pace of what has become a frenzied Triple Crown season, saying
admiringly of Evander Holyfield: ``He was the consummate
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Holyfield faces a plow horse of a challenger at
Madison Square Garden, Desormeaux will attempt to ride Real Quiet
to racing's 12th Triple Crown in the 130th running of the Belmont
Stakes. Since no one this year heralded the horse as the second
coming of Secretariat and the field of distinguished contenders has
worn down to a whisper, Real Quiet's place in history has,
prematurely, become a clubhouse argument waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Can the name of a horse that won two of his first 12 races be
mentioned in the same breath as decorated Triple Crown winners such
as Affirmed? A clue, a potential affirmative, can be found in the
man visited Thursday by Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Go back a few years. Who rated Holyfield as much more than
rugged, earnest and about as easy to hit as a heavy bag? How many
recommended that he retire before absorbing the blow that would
slur more than his speech? Two overhyped fights later against a
fading ex-con, Holyfield has negotiated, like Donald Trump, his way
into boxing lore, as its unflinching Real Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Dignity. Durability. Longevity. Joe Frazier had strengths
similar to those that have served Holyfield so well, but they
weren't nearly enough to measure up to Muhammad Ali. Holyfield is
not held accountable for those who were unable to persevere and
challenge him now, like Riddick Bowe, or for those who simply do
not exist. Nor should he be. He can only compete against the
competitors and conditions that confront him.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Real Quiet's fault that Favored Trick, Event of the
Year and Coronado's Quest, among others, have not held up for
various reasons to what trainer Elliott Walden called ``the rigors
of the Triple Crown season.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden, who trains Victory Gallop, hobbled on crutches out of
his barn early Thursday to praise the horse that has won two of
three. Walden broke his right foot playing pickup basketball last
week with Julie Krone's husband at Monmouth Park. He has seven
screws and a plate in his foot. Mishaps happen, to horses and their
trainers. Walden is working, anyway. Victory Gallop was second
(barely) in the Kentucky Derby, second (distantly) in the
Preakness. There is one more chance to deny Real Quiet his prize.
If Bob Baffert's horse wins again, then Walden said there should be
no denying Real Quiet his rightful Triple Crown fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says he's just 2-of-12 but there are only two or
three 2-year-old races that give you a barometer of what's in store
for the future, of who's going to shine at three,'' Walden said.
``Real Quiet won the Futurity at 2, and now he's won the Derby and
the Preakness. A lot of it hinges on what he does Saturday, but I
don't know what more you could ask.''
</P>
<P>
   With people, we tend to chalk this process up as delayed
development: athletes who mature, like wine. Come to think of it,
Michael Jordan was hardly in such rarified air as a college player
at North Carolina. Scottie Pippen, John Stockton and Karl Malone
were fleeting thoughts in Dick Vitale's brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Why now? Why, why now?' `` Desormeaux said.
``That's because he was running in sprints, which he wasn't in tune
with. This is a horse who wants to gallop you into the ground. And
if he wins, I don't care who's out there, he's a great champion
because this is not only about ability. You have to maintain the
desire and you have to maintain the limbs. These other horses can't
do that. That ought to tell you how difficult this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, of course, great things are achieved by athletes who
are just very good. David Wells pitched a perfect game. Roger Maris
hit 61 home runs. He isn't in the Hall of Fame but it is his
162-game pace that has been the standard now for 37 years. Bottom
line: that's about as real as any deal gets.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, perhaps the most incompetent nationalist in
modern history, continues to hack away at what is left of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31 voters in tiny Montenegro, which, with Serbia, is all
that is left of the Yugoslav federation, strongly backed their
reformist president, who no longer recognizes the authority of
Yugoslavia's government. The next step may be a referendum on
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Milosevic is stepping up his war on separatists in
Kosovo, Serbia's Albanian-speaking province. Over 200 people have
been killed this year, perhaps 40 this week. Refugees are streaming
out of Kosovo. Young Albanians eager to join up with the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army are streaming in.
</P>
<P>
   This is harrowingly familiar. Seven years ago Milosevic's
attempt to enlarge Serbia's share of Yugoslavia _ which then
included Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia _ cost at least
100,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar, too, is the dilemma faced by western leaders: should
they watch the bloodshed, as they did for too long in Bosnia, or
risk compatriots' lives and their own political careers by getting
involved in somebody else's war, as America did in Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   Muscular diplomacy, they had hoped, would save them. The Contact
Group _ America, Russia and the four big West European countries _
punished Milosevic's aggression in Kosovo with sanctions. Even as
he continued to pound the Albanians, he agreed to talk to their
leader; sanctions were eased. But the West now admits it will have
to do more.
</P>
<P>
   Its biggest worry is that the war will spread to Kosovo's two
neighbors, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists use both countries (and Montenegro) as havens
and as conduits for arms. Milosevic's forces might well be tempted
to chase them across borders, setting off a wider war.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has the extra worry that Kosovo's strife will inflame
relations between its own Albanian-speaking population and the
country's dominant Slavs.

   Last week foreign ministers from NATO's 16 members decided to
upgrade a military exercise in Macedonia and launch one in Albania.
The goal is sensible: to warn off Serbia and bolster the stability
of two governments that have so far steered clear of Kosovo's war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even these modest reassurances pull NATO into dangerous
territory. Two countries that serve as bases for attacks on
Yugoslavia, albeit not deliberately, now have an implicit security
guarantee. To protect them, NATO may have to go beyond the
hand-holding measures it has planned so far.
</P>
<P>
   The main option is some form of ``preventive deployment'' of
troops. This may be necessary, but NATO must be explicit _ in
public _ about what it is trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot send troops merely to ``monitor'' borders; if invaders
swept past them, NATO would become a laughingstock. Nor should NATO
seal borders against arms smuggling and infiltration. If it did, it
would rightly be accused of holding down the Albanians while
Milosevic's men pummelled them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, lastly, should NATO police Albania's chaotic northeast,
where an outlaw mini-state run by adherents of the ex-president,
Sali Berisha, terrorizes the locals and succors Kosovo's
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO operation should have one mission: to deter organized
aggression and, if necessary, repel it by force.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's strategists suggest 23,000 troops would be needed along
the 140-kilometer (90-mile) border between Kosovo and Albania. That
is too many, especially if the force is not to be expected to
intercept arms and guerrillas. NATO needs only enough troops to
back up its deterrent role: it can watch borders from the air and
send extra troops in case of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this were to succeed, NATO would have other worries.
Albanians are not angels. While Serb police mop up separatist
settlements, the Kosovo Liberation Army has driven some Kosovo
Serbs out of their villages; in a province that is nine-tenths
Albanian, the guerrillas look the likelier ethnic cleansers.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO guards the borders behind which they hide, the Serbs
will accuse it of sheltering terrorists. Western governments, which
have used that term to describe Kosovo's guerrillas, will be forced
to agree. That would be bad. But inaction would be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever NATO does, things can always get nastier in the
Balkans. If Serbia's crackdown became wholesale slaughter, it would
have to consider direct intervention in Kosovo. And the West would
face some more hard choices if Montenegro opted for independence
and Milosevic chose to send in his army.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's next Balkan operation may not be its last. &QL;

<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, perhaps the most incompetent nationalist in
modern history, continues to hack away at what is left of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31 voters in tiny Montenegro, which, with Serbia, is all
that is left of the Yugoslav federation, strongly backed their
reformist president, who no longer recognizes the authority of
Yugoslavia's government. The next step may be a referendum on
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Milosevic is stepping up his war on separatists in
Kosovo, Serbia's Albanian-speaking province. Over 200 people have
been killed this year, perhaps 40 this week. Refugees are streaming
out of Kosovo. Young Albanians eager to join up with the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army are streaming in.
</P>
<P>
   This is harrowingly familiar. Seven years ago Milosevic's
attempt to enlarge Serbia's share of Yugoslavia _ which then
included Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia _ cost at least
100,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar, too, is the dilemma faced by western leaders: should
they watch the bloodshed, as they did for too long in Bosnia, or
risk compatriots' lives and their own political careers by getting
involved in somebody else's war, as America did in Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   Muscular diplomacy, they had hoped, would save them. The Contact
Group _ America, Russia and the four big West European countries _
punished Milosevic's aggression in Kosovo with sanctions. Even as
he continued to pound the Albanians, he agreed to talk to their
leader; sanctions were eased. But the West now admits it will have
to do more.
</P>
<P>
   Its biggest worry is that the war will spread to Kosovo's two
neighbors, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists use both countries (and Montenegro) as havens
and as conduits for arms. Milosevic's forces might well be tempted
to chase them across borders, setting off a wider war.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has the extra worry that Kosovo's strife will inflame
relations between its own Albanian-speaking population and the
country's dominant Slavs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week foreign ministers from NATO's 16 members decided to
upgrade a military exercise in Macedonia and launch one in Albania.

FOES SMILE IN A BOOK BY THE MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cabbies, street vendors and jaywalkers. These may not
sound like a few of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's favorite things, but
they all wear big grins in a new picture book written and published
for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The cover of ``What Will You Be?'' says it is ``A story by:
Mayor Rudy Giuliani'' but he is also the star, appearing in nine
photographs and drawings in the book. The book follows his
real-life yellow Labrador, Goalie, as he romps through a buffet of
career choices, encouraging youngsters to aim high and study hard,
even if the curriculum is ``The Joy of Napping.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was driven a dozen blocks from City Hall to Public
School 1 in Chinatown on Thursday for a ``publishing party'' that
consisted of him reading the book to 40 schoolchildren and eight
television cameras. When Giuliani asked what the dog was dreaming
about in one picture, several pupils blurted out, ``Being mayor!''
Giuliani joshed, ``Some people believe that would be an
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew the mayor could rap? But here is how he starts his
tale:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a boy I liked to dream big,
</P>
<P>
   But who would have thought being mayor would be my gig.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which the mayor dedicates to his mother, Helen
Giuliani, was written and illustrated by Kristin Doney, 31, a
children's-book illustrator who lives in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of picture books will find the mayor's collaboration
with Ms. Downey _ packed with busy, sprawling images in ink and
watercolor _ to be a case of ``Where's Waldo?'' meets Richard
Scarry. While a rainbow of children frolics at a blackboard that
lists job choices from astronaut to yoga instructor, Goalie is
shown thinking, ``I need a snack ... and a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor asked the children about their own aspirations and
shook Tiffany Wong's hand when she said she wanted to be ``a DA.''
Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, then quizzed her about what
a district attorney does, eliciting silence.
</P>
<P>
   The back of the book features a biography of the mayor. ``At
first,'' it reads, ``he wanted to play baseball for the New York
Yankees. Later he wanted to become a doctor, a priest or a
helicopter pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was published by New York City Public/Private
Initiatives Inc., a private group headed by Tamra Roberts Lhota,
the wife of the mayor's budget director, Joseph Lhota. The book was
made possible in part by a $25,000 grant from Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
The mayor's office said copies would be donated to all elementary
school libraries and all branches of the New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said 10,000 copies were in print, but he expected at
least twice as many to be distributed ultimately.

STUDENTS ARRESTED FOR THREATS AT SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four teen-age boys who are accused of sending lewd
notes threatening violence against certain teachers and students at
a Brooklyn high school earlier this week have been arrested, school
and police officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The four boys, all juniors at Canarsie High School, were charged
with aggravated harassment, a misdemeanor, and issued desk
appearance tickets. Three of the boys, arrested late Wednesday
night, were identified as Weygand Gardner, Jesse Prendess and
Lonnie McNeill, all 17. A fourth boy, Adrian Mair, 16, was arrested
Thursday. The police are looking for two other suspects, who are
also students at the school.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, at a high school on the Upper East Side, a
student was arrested Wednesday after he was accused of threatening
to start a shootout, the police said. The student, who had been
chastised for wandering the halls at the Richard E. Greene High
School, was identified as Lamont Shannon, 16. The police said he
told administrators that he would bring a .45-caliber handgun to
school Friday and ``shoot everyone.'' The boy was charged with
aggravated harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Canarsie High was closed Thursday in observation of
Brooklyn-Queens Day. When classes resume Friday, the boys accused
of making the threats will likely be suspended for a maximum of 30
days, a Board of Education spokesman, J.D. LaRock, said.
</P>
<P>
   The notes, which appeared to be e-mail printouts, were delivered
to three teachers beginning last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   LaRock declined to provide details of the notes, except to
describe them as containing ``crude, juvenile, cruel references to
students and staff.'' What distinguished the notes from the vulgar
expressions not uncommon among teen-age boys were what school
officials saw as chilling threats, comparing Canarsie High School
to the federal building that was bombed in Oklahoma City in 1995,
suggestions of a ``hit list'' and a pledge to blow up the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that sets off warning bells are the references to
violence,'' LaRock said.
</P>
<P>
   School safety officers and the police interviewed those named in
the notes and scoured the school building, which was already
equipped with metal detectors, for weapons. Two of the three notes
were sent from America Online accounts; LaRock said it was not
clear whether the third was e-mail or just a note written on a
computer. None appeared to have been generated on a school
computer, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Education has always been a local issue in America.
Now an increasing number of parents are choosing to make it even
more local: they are doing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans teaching their own children has more
than tripled since the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Home-schooling groups put the number of students learning at
home at 1.23 million, or slightly more than all the public-school
students in New Jersey. Such numbers are notoriously imprecise,
since some of the most populous states, such as Texas and Illinois,
collect no meaningful data on home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts reckon that the number of families teaching their
children at home has exploded over the past decade and is growing
by at least 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Twenty years ago home schooling was a hippie habit, the
natural complement to free love and natural healing. But the flower
children soon had strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, home schooling was embraced by Christian
fundamentalists as a means of providing family-based religious and
moral education.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there has been a boom in secular home schoolers who
are dissatisfied with public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Department of Education has for years sent a crude
survey to home schoolers asking them why they withdrew from the
regular system. Two years ago, for the first time, dissatisfaction
with the public schools was a more common answer than religious
preference.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mary Anne Pitman, an educational anthropologist at
the University of Cincinnati, one fast-growing group of home
schoolers is black professionals, worried by the lack of safe,
effective public schools for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, home schooling was illegal in many states and
strongly discouraged in most others. Students were hunted down as
truants; parents were arrested and sometimes even jailed.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states now allow it, though the degree of regulation
varies enormously.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, home schoolers must register, check in regularly,
and take part in standardized exams to make sure the children are
not falling behind. In Illinois, they are virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have become downright accommodating. Washington and
Iowa require the public schools to enroll children on a part-time
basis if they ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   In California, children can enroll in an independent study
program through a public school and then do their studying at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the busiest opponents of all this are school
administrators, particularly superintendents. They can be expected
to have a belief in public schools, of course, but not all their
concerns are so well-intentioned.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, schools are financed according to the number of
pupils attending. ``Superintendents see every kid who doesn't come
in as a potential $6,000 loss,'' says Michael Farris, the president
of the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA).
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' unions are not fond of home schooling, either. The
National Education Association handbook declares that ``home
schooling programs cannot provide the student with a comprehensive
education experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the legal climate has changed, in large part, because home
schoolers have developed into a potent political and legal force.
Their association with the Christian right has earned them strong
Republican backing.
</P>
<P>
   They are also very good at bare-knuckle, grass-roots politics.
The HSLDA has a staff of 50, including seven lawyers, who lobby on
Capitol Hill but also pick fights at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   When a Michigan couple was arrested in 1985 for teaching their
child at home without a teacher's license, the HSLDA fought the
case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court, where the law
requiring home-schooling parents to be licensed teachers was struck
down as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Farris boasts that he can generate 100 telephone calls to every
congressional office within a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, public opinion on home schooling has shifted.
When the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll on public attitudes towards
education first asked about home schooling in 1985, 73 percent of
those surveyed said it was a bad thing, compared with 16 percent
who approved.
</P>
<P>
   When the same question was asked in 1997, the objectors had
fallen to 57 percent and the supporters had more than doubled, to
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable stories about home schooling are starting to creep
into mainstream magazines. Amazon.com, the biggest Internet
bookseller, now lists over 200 books on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to the children? The HSLDA claims that, on
average, home-schooled students outperform their public-school
peers by more than 30 percentage points in all subjects, and that
the longer a child is schooled at home the larger the test gap
grows.
</P>
<P>
   The figures may be tilted, and home-schooled students, whose
parents are an exacting bunch, would probably do well in public
schools too. Still, home schooling is not creating a generation of
dullards.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has seen fit to accept a handful of these children over
the past two decades. ``Some of these kids are absolutely terrific.
They've done interesting things,'' says David Illingworth, the
senior admissions officer.
</P>
<P>
   Illingworth has challenged the movement to find a better name,
since many of its most successful students have taken some courses
in public schools and even in community colleges. The picture of a
mother working with her children around the kitchen table does not
do justice to the idea, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a harder question: is it possible to develop
socially without ever going to school?
</P>
<P>
   Home schoolers argue that their children are exposed to children
and adults of varying ages rather than becoming ``peer-dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris decided to begin educating his six-year-old daughter at
home when he realized that she cared more about the approval of
other six-year-olds than she did about her own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real life,'' he says, ``does not consist of age-segregated
herds.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Illingworth says the sociability of home-schooled
applicants varies as much as it does among ordinary ones. The
exceptions come from religious families who have deliberately
withdrawn their children from a world they consider tainted.
</P>
<P>
   One shadow lies over home schooling. Joe Nathan, a senior fellow
at the Hubert Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota,
has spent much time interviewing parents who teach at home.
</P>
<P>
   Most want to give their children a better education; but a tiny
minority are dangerously racist, angry or alienated. ``There are
some real haters,'' says Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he considers home schooling to be a good thing for
bringing change to the public schools; many home schoolers have
already been drawn back into the system by charter schools and
other such experiments. But there is a worrying group lurking in
the home-schooling shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most home-schooling parents choose to teach their
children at home at great cost to themselves because they reckon
the public schools are missing the mark; and, in many cases, they
are right.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of defections may finally send a wake-up call to the
whole public system. Rather than merely talking of change, it is
time to bring some about. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ Education has always been a local issue in America.
Now an increasing number of parents are choosing to make it even
more local: they are doing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans teaching their own children has more
than tripled since the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Home-schooling groups put the number of students learning at
home at 1.23 million, or slightly more than all the public-school
students in New Jersey. Such numbers are notoriously imprecise,
since some of the most populous states, such as Texas and Illinois,
collect no meaningful data on home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts reckon that the number of families teaching their
children at home has exploded over the past decade and is growing
by at least 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Twenty years ago home schooling was a hippie habit, the
natural complement to free love and natural healing. But the flower
children soon had strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, home schooling was embraced by Christian
fundamentalists as a means of providing family-based religious and
moral education.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there has been a boom in secular home schoolers who
are dissatisfied with public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Department of Education has for years sent a crude
survey to home schoolers asking them why they withdrew from the
regular system. Two years ago, for the first time, dissatisfaction
with the public schools was a more common answer than religious
preference.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mary Anne Pitman, an educational anthropologist at
the University of Cincinnati, one fast-growing group of home
schoolers is black professionals, worried by the lack of safe,
effective public schools for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, home schooling was illegal in many states and
strongly discouraged in most others. Students were hunted down as
truants; parents were arrested and sometimes even jailed.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states now allow it, though the degree of regulation
varies enormously.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, home schoolers must register, check in regularly,
and take part in standardized exams to make sure the children are
not falling behind. In Illinois, they are virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have become downright accommodating. Washington and
Iowa require the public schools to enroll children on a part-time
basis if they ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   In California, children can enroll in an independent study
program through a public school and then do their studying at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the busiest opponents of all this are school
administrators, particularly superintendents. They can be expected
to have a belief in public schools, of course, but not all their
concerns are so well-intentioned.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, schools are financed according to the number of
pupils attending. ``Superintendents see every kid who doesn't come
in as a potential $6,000 loss,'' says Michael Farris, the president
of the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA).
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' unions are not fond of home schooling, either. The
National Education Association handbook declares that ``home
schooling programs cannot provide the student with a comprehensive
education experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the legal climate has changed, in large part, because home
schoolers have developed into a potent political and legal force.
Their association with the Christian right has earned them strong
Republican backing.
</P>
<P>
   They are also very good at bare-knuckle, grass-roots politics.
The HSLDA has a staff of 50, including seven lawyers, who lobby on
Capitol Hill but also pick fights at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   When a Michigan couple was arrested in 1985 for teaching their
child at home without a teacher's license, the HSLDA fought the
case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court, where the law
requiring home-schooling parents to be licensed teachers was struck
down as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Farris boasts that he can generate 100 telephone calls to every
congressional office within a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, public opinion on home schooling has shifted.
When the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll on public attitudes towards
education first asked about home schooling in 1985, 73 percent of
those surveyed said it was a bad thing, compared with 16 percent
who approved.
</P>
<P>
   When the same question was asked in 1997, the objectors had
fallen to 57 percent and the supporters had more than doubled, to
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable stories about home schooling are starting to creep
into mainstream magazines. Amazon.com, the biggest Internet
bookseller, now lists over 200 books on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to the children? The HSLDA claims that, on
average, home-schooled students outperform their public-school
peers by more than 30 percentage points in all subjects, and that
the longer a child is schooled at home the larger the test gap
grows.
</P>
<P>
   The figures may be tilted, and home-schooled students, whose
parents are an exacting bunch, would probably do well in public
schools too. Still, home schooling is not creating a generation of
dullards.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has seen fit to accept a handful of these children over
the past two decades. ``Some of these kids are absolutely terrific.
They've done interesting things,'' says David Illingworth, the
senior admissions officer.
</P>
<P>
   Illingworth has challenged the movement to find a better name,
since many of its most successful students have taken some courses
in public schools and even in community colleges. The picture of a
mother working with her children around the kitchen table does not
do justice to the idea, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a harder question: is it possible to develop
socially without ever going to school?
</P>
<P>
   Home schoolers argue that their children are exposed to children
and adults of varying ages rather than becoming ``peer-dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris decided to begin educating his six-year-old daughter at
home when he realized that she cared more about the approval of
other six-year-olds than she did about her own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real life,'' he says, ``does not consist of age-segregated
herds.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Illingworth says the sociability of home-schooled
applicants varies as much as it does among ordinary ones. The
exceptions come from religious families who have deliberately
withdrawn their children from a world they consider tainted.
</P>
<P>
   One shadow lies over home schooling. Joe Nathan, a senior fellow
at the Hubert Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota,
has spent much time interviewing parents who teach at home.
</P>
<P>
   Most want to give their children a better education; but a tiny
minority are dangerously racist, angry or alienated. ``There are
some real haters,'' says Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he considers home schooling to be a good thing for
bringing change to the public schools; many home schoolers have
already been drawn back into the system by charter schools and
other such experiments. But there is a worrying group lurking in
the home-schooling shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most home-schooling parents choose to teach their
children at home at great cost to themselves because they reckon
the public schools are missing the mark; and, in many cases, they
are right.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of defections may finally send a wake-up call to the
whole public system. Rather than merely talking of change, it is
time to bring some about. &QL;

<P>
   TAKAYAMA, Japan _ In what colleagues hailed as a historic
landmark, 120 physicists from 23 research institutions in Japan and
the United States announced on Friday that they had found the
existence of mass in a notoriously elusive subatomic particle
called the neutrino.
</P>
<P>
   The neutrino, a particle that carries no electric charge, is so
light that it was assumed for many years to have no mass at all.
After Friday's announcement, cosmologists will have to confront the
possibility that much of the mass of the universe is in the form of
neutrinos. The discovery will also compel scientists to revise a
highly successful theory of the composition of matter known as the
Standard Model.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the discovery had drawn some 300 physicists here to
discuss neutrino research. Among other things, they said, the
finding of neutrino mass might affect theories about the formation
and evolution of galaxies and the ultimate fate of the universe. If
neutrinos have sufficient mass, their presence throughout the
universe would increase the overall mass of the universe, possibly
slowing its present expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the newly detected but as yet unmeasured mass of the
neutrino must be too small to cause cosmological effects. But
whatever the case, there was general agreement here that the
discovery will have far-reaching consequences for the investigation
of the nature of matter.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the collaboration of scientists who discovered the
existence of neutrino mass using a huge underground detector called
Super-Kamiokande, Dr. Takaaki Kajita of the Institute for Cosmic
Ray Research of Tokyo University said that all explanations for the
data collected by the detector except the existence of neutrino
mass had been essentially ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Yoji Totsuka, leader of the coalition and director of the
Kamioka Neutrino Observatory where the underground detector is
situated, 30 miles north of here in the Japan Alps, acknowledged
that his group's announcement was ``very strong,'' but said, ``We
have investigated all other possible causes of the effects we have
measured and only neutrino mass remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bahcall, a leading neutrino expert and astrophysical
theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.,
said in an interview that there had been many claims in recent
years of the discovery of neutrino mass by other groups. ``But this
one is by far the most convincing,'' he said. ``Besides the strong
evidence they have found, this team has a magnificent track record
of discoveries.''
</P>
<P>
   But because the elusive particles cannot be seen, the evidence
that they have mass is indirect.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Standard Model of matter, neutrinos come in three
types or ``flavors.'' The data gathered by the Super-Kamiokande
team during the two years the detector has operated indicate that
at least one of these three ``flavors'' can ``oscillate'' into one
of the other flavors as it travels along at nearly the speed of
light. According to the theories of quantum mechanics, any particle
capable of transforming itself in this way must have mass.
</P>
<P>
   Study of the neutrino particle has been glacially slow since its
existence was hypothesized in 1931 by the Austrian physicist
Wolfgang Pauli as a way to explain the mysterious loss of energy in
certain nuclear reactions. The particle was finally discovered in
1956 by two physicists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr.
Frederick Reines (who was awarded a Nobel Prize for the discovery)
and the late Dr. Clyde Cowan.
</P>
<P>
   But understanding of the particle since then has been acquired
painfully slowly, because neutrinos have no electric charge and
rarely interact with any kind of matter. A neutrino so rarely
collides with an atom of ordinary matter that a typical neutrino
can easily penetrate a one-light-year thickness of lead _ some six
trillion miles _ without hindrance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the writer John Updike put it in a poem he wrote in 1960:
</P>
<P>
   ``Neutrinos, they are very small.
</P>
<P>
   They have no charge and have no mass
</P>
<P>
   And do not interact at all.
</P>
<P>
   The earth is just a silly ball
</P>
<P>
   To them, through which they simply pass
</P>
<P>
   Like dust maids down a drafty hall.''
</P>
<P>
   But once in a great while, a neutrino does hit an atom and the
resulting blast of nuclear debris supplies clues about the neutrino
itself. The debris generally includes many particles that can race
through water, mineral oil or even ice, sending out shock waves of
blue light. This light, called Cherenkov radiation, can be detected
by sensitive light sensors and measured.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few decades, scientists have learned that matter
is made up of three distinct flavors or types. This means that
there are three flavors of neutrinos _ the electron neutrino
associated with the electron, the muon neutrinos, associated with
the muon particle, which is a kind of fat electron, and the tau
neutrino, associated with the tau particle, an even fatter relative
of the electron.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the muon and tau particles and their associated
neutrinos in the universe has mystified physicists. ``Who ordered
that?'' the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Isidor Rabi is said to
have remarked when the muon was found.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Super-Kamiokande detector was built two years ago as a joint
Japanese-American experiment. It is essentially a water tank the
size of a large cathedral installed in a deep zinc mine one mile
inside a mountain 30 miles north of here. When neutrinos slice
through the tank, one of them occasionally makes its presence known
by colliding with an atom, which sends blue light through the water
to an array of detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous volume of water in the detector increased the
likelihood of neutrino impacts to the point at which the discovery
of neutrino mass became possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Super-Kamiokande collaboration is studying several neutrino
phenomenon simultaneously, but the one that led to Friday's
announcement was based on ``atmospheric'' neutrinos created when
highly energetic cosmic ray particles from deep space slam into the
Earth's upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists knew that different flavors of neutrinos constantly
arrive from the upper atmosphere and they have calculated that the
ratio between muon nutrinos and other flavors must have a certain
value. But over the years detectors found only about half the muon
neutrino predicted by theory.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent shortage of muon neutrinos was explained by the
recent observations that led to Friday's announcement. The
physicists found that when neutrinos come from the sky directly
over the Super Kamiokande detector _ a relatively short distance _
the proportion of muon neutrinos among them was higher than among
the neutrinos coming up from beneath the detector after having
passed through the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists reasoned that by traveling through the entire
Earth these neutrinos had had time to oscillate, probably many
times, between muon neutrinos and some other type, especially the
tau neutrino, and this accounts for the deficit seen in muon
neutrinos. (The tau neutrino has not yet been directly detected but
it must exist to make observations consistent.)
</P>
<P>
   A related problem has to do with neutrinos produced by the
fusion process in the sun. This process, which merges the nuclei of
hydrogen atoms to form helium nuclei and energy, produces
neutrinos. Astrophysicists believe they understand the mechanism in
complete detail.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that all the best detectors ever built find far
fewer neutrinos than should be present according to understanding
of the fusion reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the anomaly can be explained by the
oscillation of detectable solar nutrinos into types that cannot be
detected by existing instruments. But no one has proven this
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigation of the neutrino have not been limited to the
Super-Kamiokande collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the collaboration's University of Hawaii Group,
for example, Dr. John Learned, has also worked on an underwater
detection system in the Pacific Ocean off the Hawaiian coast (which
ran out of money before completion) and a project at the South Pole
where a neutrino detector had been buried under thousands of feet
of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach to penetrating the neutrino secrets involves
the use of particle accelerators capable of producing intense beams
of neutrinos. In two experiments currently being prepared, one in
Japan and the other at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in
Illinois, beams of neutrinos will be directed through the Earth
toward detectors several hundred miles away. The goal will be to
observe changes the neutrinos undergo in transit, both in numbers
and types. Physicists expect the experiment to confirm the
existence of neutrino oscillations like those seen in the
Super-Kamiokande detector.
</P>
<P>
   Although the neutrinos are now known to have some mass, most
physicists agree that the mass must be very small. The
Super-Kamiokande experiments suggest that the difference between
the masses of muon nutrinos and other types of neutrinos is only
about 0.07 electron volts (a measure of particle mass). This does
not yield a value of the masses themselves, only of the difference
between those of muon neutrinos and other types.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mass of the neutrino of any flavor must be small,
Totsuka said, it may be several electron-volts, and if so, the
overall gravitational effect on the universe would perhaps be
significant. It has been estimated that at any given moment, every
teaspoon worth of volume of space throughout the universe contains
an average of 300 neutrinos, so their aggregate number is
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 68 years, a legion of distinguished physicists
has devoted inquiries and careers to the puzzling neutrino, which
was given its name by the great Italian-American scientist Enrico
Fermi. Fermi quickly came to believe in the particle's existence,
even though it was not proved in his lifetime, and named it
``neutrino,'' which means ``little neutral one'' in Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of dozens of neutrino experiments meet once
every two years to exchange ideas at conferences like the one under
way here. Present are representatives of teams that have installed
neutrino detectors on the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia, under
the Aegean Sea off the Greek coast, inside the Gran Sasso tunnel
under the Alps, under the ice covering the South Pole, and in many
other places.

KENNETH STARR'S OBSESSION WITH A FIVE-LETTER WORD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr is out to get the truth about Bill Clinton. He
wants the truth about a 20-year-old land deal called Whitewater. He
wants the truth about a 24-year-old lady called Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   To get that truth, Starr has done most things short of cracking
kneecaps. He has hidden a microphone on an accomplice. He has
subpoenaed bookshop records to see what Lewinsky might be reading.
He has allowed a witness who refused to talk to be kept in jail for
nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous place in Washington these days is between
this prosecutor and potential evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This week was pretty good for Starr-gazers. The prosecutor
declared that Clinton was under ``serious criminal investigation.''
His spokesman said that Clinton himself might soon receive a
subpoena, requiring that he testify under oath about his cordial
friendship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky herself, as if rattled, abruptly changed her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, having won a legal battle over the right to require
Sidney Blumenthal, a presidential aide, to testify, filed a brief
with the Supreme Court, urging that he be let loose on various
other members of the White House staff, including Secret
Servicemen, who have never yet had to divulge the content of
private presidential conversations. No matter: the truth must out.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the headlines. But, on June 1, Starr also gave a
speech to a bar association in North Carolina, in which he expanded
on his passion for the truth at some length.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this speech, it was often said that the prosecutor's
moral sense was unusually developed: he had grown up as the son of
a conservative minister in small-town Texas; he had never smoked or
drunk or cursed.
</P>
<P>
   It was also said that his lifestyle exuded disciplined devotion:
his teenage hobby was shoe-polishing and his summer job was selling
Bibles; and, though he is busy these days, he likes to rise early
and jog to a creek near his house, where he pauses to sing a hymn
and pray.
</P>
<P>
   But this week's oration has made Starr's moralism seem
increasingly bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Starr began his speech darkly, brooding on a ``disease'' that
``threatens our safety, our democracy, and the very foundations of
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease, he explained, is that lawyers no longer take their
responsibility to the truth seriously. It used to be that lawyers
were like Atticus Finch, the hero of Harper Lee's novel, ``To Kill
a Mockingbird'': people who searched out the truth to counter an
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says Starr, lawyers are like ``Bruiser'' in John Grisham's
book, ``The Rainmaker'': people who will do anything for their
clients.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, Starr says, that even though 25 out of 42
presidents have been lawyers, the profession is held in contempt
these days. One of the candidates in the Washington, D.C., mayoral
primary is campaigning on the fact that he is not a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Having softened his audience, Starr then developed his main
point. ``Truth is intended to be the primary goal of our judicial
system,'' he declared; if witnesses must swear to tell ``the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,'' then surely lawyers
should tell the same.
</P>
<P>
   In support of this contention, Starr cited Nix v Whiteside, a
1986 Supreme Court ruling that a defense lawyer should not assist a
client in committing perjury. Starr concludes that ``lawyers have a
duty not to use their skills to impede the search for truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The unwavering pursuit of truth should indeed animate
prosecuting lawyers like himself; but if you run Starr's general
argument by Geoffrey Hazard, a law professor at the University of
Pennsylvania who is America's leading legal ethicist, you get an
interesting reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr's claim is not only ludicrous; it is pernicious,''
comes the response.
</P>
<P>
   Even though no lawyer should be party to perjury, defense
counsels have a duty to impede the search for truth in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   They may advise their clients to invoke the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment, which means they can refuse to testify. They may argue
that incriminating evidence is inadmissible on technical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they know their client to be guilty, defense lawyers are
supposed to pick holes in the prosecution's arguments, and to get
their clients off.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer's first duty is to the client, not to the truth,
because the alternative is terrible. If lawyers refuse to defend
clients whom they suspect to be guilty, then some defendants will
appear in court without a lawyer. If suspects know that lawyers may
desert them, they will not be able to confide in them and so
prepare a good defense.
</P>
<P>
   The right to a fair trial cannot exist without defense lawyers
devoted to the business of defending. It is for judges and juries _
and prosecutors _ to worry about truth.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr himself was defending tobacco companies some years
ago, and signing briefs arguing that nicotine might not be
addictive, he seemed to understand that the quest for truth must be
balanced against the rights of defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is hunting Clintons, Starr has grown obsessed by
this five-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year he even cited the First Amendment's
free-speech clause as he tried to squash hostile press stories:
``The First Amendment is interested in the truth,'' he said. But
the whole point of the First Amendment is to prevent people like
Starr from pursuing the truth to the point of trampling liberties.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to Starr, hunting the Clintons is a soul-destroying
business. The president has used every legal trick available to
slow the prosecutor's progress. He has invoked executive privilege
to shield his staff from subpoenas; he has invoked attorney-client
privilege when that failed.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, the president has assured voters that scandal
investigations will not distract him from the task of government;
but this week (not for the first time) his lawyers claimed the
opposite, in order to persuade a court to keep the investigators at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   All these frustrations are taking their toll on the prosecutor.
In the end, it is to be hoped, Starr may indeed get to the truth;
if the truth does not get to him first. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr is out to get the truth about Bill Clinton. He
wants the truth about a 20-year-old land deal called Whitewater. He
wants the truth about a 24-year-old lady called Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   To get that truth, Starr has done most things short of cracking
kneecaps. He has hidden a microphone on an accomplice. He has
subpoenaed bookshop records to see what Lewinsky might be reading.
He has allowed a witness who refused to talk to be kept in jail for
nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous place in Washington these days is between
this prosecutor and potential evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This week was pretty good for Starr-gazers. The prosecutor
declared that Clinton was under ``serious criminal investigation.''
His spokesman said that Clinton himself might soon receive a
subpoena, requiring that he testify under oath about his cordial
friendship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky herself, as if rattled, abruptly changed her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, having won a legal battle over the right to require
Sidney Blumenthal, a presidential aide, to testify, filed a brief
with the Supreme Court, urging that he be let loose on various
other members of the White House staff, including Secret
Servicemen, who have never yet had to divulge the content of
private presidential conversations. No matter: the truth must out.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the headlines. But, on June 1, Starr also gave a
speech to a bar association in North Carolina, in which he expanded
on his passion for the truth at some length.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this speech, it was often said that the prosecutor's
moral sense was unusually developed: he had grown up as the son of
a conservative minister in small-town Texas; he had never smoked or
drunk or cursed.
</P>
<P>
   It was also said that his lifestyle exuded disciplined devotion:
his teenage hobby was shoe-polishing and his summer job was selling
Bibles; and, though he is busy these days, he likes to rise early
and jog to a creek near his house, where he pauses to sing a hymn
and pray.
</P>
<P>
   But this week's oration has made Starr's moralism seem
increasingly bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Starr began his speech darkly, brooding on a ``disease'' that
``threatens our safety, our democracy, and the very foundations of
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease, he explained, is that lawyers no longer take their
responsibility to the truth seriously. It used to be that lawyers
were like Atticus Finch, the hero of Harper Lee's novel, ``To Kill
a Mockingbird'': people who searched out the truth to counter an
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says Starr, lawyers are like ``Bruiser'' in John Grisham's
book, ``The Rainmaker'': people who will do anything for their
clients.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, Starr says, that even though 25 out of 42
presidents have been lawyers, the profession is held in contempt
these days. One of the candidates in the Washington, D.C., mayoral
primary is campaigning on the fact that he is not a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Having softened his audience, Starr then developed his main
point. ``Truth is intended to be the primary goal of our judicial
system,'' he declared; if witnesses must swear to tell ``the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,'' then surely lawyers
should tell the same.
</P>
<P>
   In support of this contention, Starr cited Nix v Whiteside, a
1986 Supreme Court ruling that a defense lawyer should not assist a
client in committing perjury. Starr concludes that ``lawyers have a
duty not to use their skills to impede the search for truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The unwavering pursuit of truth should indeed animate
prosecuting lawyers like himself; but if you run Starr's general
argument by Geoffrey Hazard, a law professor at the University of
Pennsylvania who is America's leading legal ethicist, you get an
interesting reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr's claim is not only ludicrous; it is pernicious,''
comes the response.
</P>
<P>
   Even though no lawyer should be party to perjury, defense
counsels have a duty to impede the search for truth in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   They may advise their clients to invoke the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment, which means they can refuse to testify. They may argue
that incriminating evidence is inadmissible on technical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they know their client to be guilty, defense lawyers are
supposed to pick holes in the prosecution's arguments, and to get
their clients off.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer's first duty is to the client, not to the truth,
because the alternative is terrible. If lawyers refuse to defend
clients whom they suspect to be guilty, then some defendants will
appear in court without a lawyer. If suspects know that lawyers may
desert them, they will not be able to confide in them and so
prepare a good defense.
</P>
<P>
   The right to a fair trial cannot exist without defense lawyers
devoted to the business of defending. It is for judges and juries _
and prosecutors _ to worry about truth.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr himself was defending tobacco companies some years
ago, and signing briefs arguing that nicotine might not be
addictive, he seemed to understand that the quest for truth must be
balanced against the rights of defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is hunting Clintons, Starr has grown obsessed by
this five-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year he even cited the First Amendment's
free-speech clause as he tried to squash hostile press stories:
``The First Amendment is interested in the truth,'' he said. But
the whole point of the First Amendment is to prevent people like
Starr from pursuing the truth to the point of trampling liberties.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to Starr, hunting the Clintons is a soul-destroying
business. The president has used every legal trick available to
slow the prosecutor's progress. He has invoked executive privilege
to shield his staff from subpoenas; he has invoked attorney-client
privilege when that failed.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, the president has assured voters that scandal
investigations will not distract him from the task of government;
but this week (not for the first time) his lawyers claimed the
opposite, in order to persuade a court to keep the investigators at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   All these frustrations are taking their toll on the prosecutor.
In the end, it is to be hoped, Starr may indeed get to the truth;
if the truth does not get to him first. &QL;

WILLIAM ABRAHAMS, 79, EDITOR OF SHORT STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Calif., Mass.) (ja) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Abrahams, a Harvard-bred poet who tried his
hand at novels before finding a lasting literary niche as a
distinguished book editor credited with almost single-handedly
preserving the short story as a viable genre, died Tuesday at his
home in Hillsborough, Calif. He was 79 and had presided over the
annual O. Henry short story awards for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   His companion, historian Peter Stansky, said the cause was
congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   For Abrahams, a Boston-born lawyer's son who found his world in
words, the literary life was a quest, first to find the true turn
of his own talent and later to seek out, celebrate, nurture and
hone the talent of others.
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of his success that he had not only maintained
his own imprint since the 1970s, first with Holt, Rinehart and
Winston, and since 1984 with Dutton, but that he had managed to
work with authors like Joyce Carol Oates, Pauline Kael, Lillian
Hellman, John Knowles, Shirley Hazzard and Jessica Mitford from a
West Coast base far from the Boston-New York publishing axis.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he found his way into editing in 1963, when a friend
got him a part-time job reading manuscripts for Atlantic Monthly
Press, Abrahams had learned a thing or two about the publishing
process.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his early poems had appeared in literary magazines and
been included in anthologies, and he had published four
well-received novels.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none were bell ringers. And while it is tempting to
wonder would have happened if Abrahams had done his World War II
Army duty as, say, an infantryman in the Pacific rather than as a
military policeman in Miami, his debut war novel, ``Interval in
Carolina,'' an ironic story about a stateside soldier who seeks
easy pleasure and finds ill-fated love, won rare praise for a first
novel and showed the fine eye for nuance, language and structure
that would make him a editor cherished by some of the finest
writers of his day.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1945 review in The New York Times, Orville Prescott,
describing Abrahams as ``an esthete of sorts,'' and ``a sensitive
intellectual,'' said the ``mature'' and ``expert'' book ``marks the
debut of a promising young writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Abrahams, whose later novels included ``By the
Beautiful Sea,'' (1947) and ``Imperial Waltz,'' (1954), found he
could make more of a splash as an editor, especially when he was
tapped to compile the nation's most prestigious collection of short
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen on the basis of his work for Atlantic, Abrahams, who
began as an assistant to the previous editor, Richard Poirier,
became the sole editor of the O. Henry Awards in 1965. Until his
retirement in 1996, he was a powerful and often lonely champion of
the oft-derided genre.
</P>
<P>
   Sure the short story had declined since the glory days of The
Saturday Evening Post and other defunct magazines, but Abrahams
found enough worthy work in literary journals and other little
magazines to make the annual O. Henry collections a recognized
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Although his imprimatur provided the first national recognition
for scores of writers who went on to distinguished literary
careers, Abrahams did not shirk the famous. A pushover for funny
stories, he once awarded first prize to Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   By 1968 Abrahams was so well established that when Stansky, who
had been a young graduate student at Harvard when the two met, was
named associate professor of history at Stanford, Abrahams had no
trouble moving his base to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Monthly Press cheerfully made him West Coast
editor, something of a misnomer for a man whose authors lived all
over the country. As Abrahams once explained, he could work
anywhere that had a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahams' life with Stansky also led him back to writing, in yet
another format. Together they wrote four nonfiction books,
including an acclaimed two-volume biography of George Orwell, ``The
Unknown Orwell,'' (1972) and ``Orwell: The Transformation'' (1980).
Their most recent book, ``London's Burning: Life, Death and Art in
the Second World War,'' was published in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahams, whose wit and charm, not to mention his legendary
editing skills, inspired devoted loyalty in his authors, would
probably not have been allowed to retire if he wanted to, but he
had showed no sighs of abandoning his lifelong quest for literary
quality.
</P>
<P>
   One of his projects, Diane Johnson's novel ``Le Divorce,'' was a
finalist for last year's National Book Award, and Abrahams, who had
been working on Ms. Oates' latest novel, ``My Heart Laid Bare,''
had high hopes for ``The Mistress,'' a forthcoming novel by his
latest discovery, Philippe Tapon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Stansky, he is survived by a sister, Fay Swartz
of Gloucester, Mass.

EDITORIAL: WILL THE FED FOLLOW LONDON'S LEAD? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 5:
</P>
<P>
   The economies of the United States and Britain have moved in
surprisingly similar ways in recent years, whether by coincidence
or because both freed their economies in the 1980s. Now Britain's
central bank has stunned observers by raising interest rates,
posing the question whether the Federal Reserve will be the next to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England boosted its base lending rate on Thursday by
a quarter of a percentage point, to 7.5 percent. It said it had
acted because of concerns that wages were rising too rapidly and
consumer spending was so brisk that a revival of inflation was a
serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all British economists who monitor the Bank of England _
19-of-20, according to a poll by Bloomberg News _ had expected the
central bank to leave rates unchanged. That was largely because of
signs that Britain's economy is slowing, particularly in exports.
Both stock and bond prices fell in London after the bank's move was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious differences between the United States and
Britain, but current economic arguments in both countries are
surprisingly similar. There are inflationary pressures in the U.S.
labor market, about which more will be known on Friday when the
employment figures for May are released, and consumer spending has
been very strong. But inflation does not look like much of a threat
when commodity prices are falling and there is fear that Asian
weakness could slow the economy here. So the Fed has not taken any
action.
</P>
<P>
   At the March meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, some
Fed officials voiced fears that raising rates ``could produce an
outsize and undesirable response in financial markets.'' But if
Britain's stock market remains buoyant after the Bank of England's
move, that might strengthen the hand of those who want the Fed to
take a similar step.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MASON, TEXAS _ The motto of Grace Christian School _ ``Fight the
good fight of faith'' _ could be that of many an English private
school. The difference is that Grace means it.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of thousands of recently established fundamentalist
Christian schools across America, with a mission to major in Jesus
Christ and minor in everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is housed in a small white clapboard schoolhouse beside a
dried-up creek in Mason, a pretty ranching town of 2,100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside, and it is immediately clear that this is a
different kind of school, with humble resources. Desks line the
main room. Teenagers sit next to small children. The atmosphere is
attentive. There are no classrooms as such, just a single teacher
and two teaching assistants walking up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has 35 children, aged 6 to 18. Its largest-ever graduating
class was three; but in recent years its graduates have gone on to
West Point and Texas A&AMP;M University, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentalist schools are growing fast. In Fort Worth, Texas,
enrollment in them has grown by 30 percent since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of these schools do not report to the local
educational authorities, exact numbers are difficult to come by;
but Christian Schools International, one of several umbrella
organizations, claims about 3,200 member schools in the United
States, with 600,000 pupils.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason for their growth is frustration at the removal
of God from the public schools. But some parents have in general
lost confidence in the state's ability to educate their children,
and others question the government's right to dictate educational
standards.
</P>
<P>
   When is a Christian school a fundamentalist school? There are no
hard-and-fast rules; but an unequivocal belief in creationism is
probably the most reliable indicator.
</P>
<P>
   So is a sense of ministering to the whole child. ``We believe
that every human has three parts: spirit, body and soul, and that
we should minister to all three parts,'' says John Burges, the
principal and only full-time teacher at Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Parents often quote Deuteronomy chapter six, verse seven _ ``And
thou shalt teach (God's Commandments] diligently unto thy
children'' _ as the source of their preference for such schooling.
How, they ask, can one diligently teach scripture in a secular
school system?
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum itself is overtly Christian. Almost every subject
on the Accelerated Christian Curriculum, which Grace uses, has a
Christian slant.
</P>
<P>
   Parents pay around $125 per child each year for books and course
materials. Some of these courses, such as grammar, are laudable for
their basic approach.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more worrying. The history curriculum carries the
notion of America's ``manifest destiny'' far beyond Monroe's
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Spain was defeated in North America because it was Catholic.
George Washington was preserved by a miracle during the
French-Indian war. All Muslims are ``descendants of Isaac's
half-brother Ishmael,''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, ``Americanism'' is the divine template for the world.
</P>
<P>
   Larger fundamentalist schools charge fees and grant
scholarships, but smaller ones have a different approach. Grace is
typical. Its shoestring budget allows it to educate each child for
roughly $1,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, parents sit down with the school to discuss how
much they can afford to pay, ranging from $50 to $200 a month for
each child. Teachers' pay is paltry. Burges draws a salary only
when all the bills have been paid; in a good year he takes home
$12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford a laboratory, Grace uses the great outdoors as
its classroom. In deer season the whole school goes hunting (PE),
butchers a deer (Biology), then cooks it (Home Economics) into
venison burgers for school lunch. And everyone says grace first. &QL;

Lukas hopes to `catch a break' at Belmont
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ELMONT, N.Y. _ Unlike most racetracks, Belmont Park is truly a
park, with benches, ponds, trees and shrubs. Outside the barn where
D. Wayne Lukas tends his horses, oak trees stand like giant green
umbrellas. Symbolic, perhaps, of the way Lukas has overshadowed his
competition the past decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   There's no mistaking who's in charge here. A sign proclaims,
``D. Wayne Lukas Racing Stables.'' And on the wall of the main
Lukas barn are six signs that acknowledge one of the most amazing
feats in racing history: Lukas winning six straight Triple Crown
races _ the 1994 Preakness and Belmont Stakes, the '95 Kentucky
Derby, Preakness and Belmont and the '96 Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas clearly likes his name. It is prominently displayed not
only across his barn but on his belt, on his yellow jacket and even
on his black cap. Not that he needs people to notice him. He has
led the nation's trainers in earnings for 14 of the last 15 years,
and he ranks fourth all-time with 10 victories in Triple Crown
events.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been ineffective lately. His best 3-year-old, Cape
Town, ran fifth in the Kentucky Derby and ninth in the Preakness,
when he fractured a foot. He was retired, though not before
delivering a parting shot, kicking Lukas in the head and drawing
blood outside the Preakness barn.
</P>
<P>
   The Lukas bad luck continued Thursday, when he drew the
farthest-out post positions for Yarrow Brae and Grand Slam in
Saturday's 130th Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, Lukas sounded confident. Of Grand Slam, he said,
``The fact that he's 4-for-4 on this track is something you'd
better put in your handicapping.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added: ``If you want to get out of town with coffee
money, you should make a little show ticket on Yarrow Brae.''
</P>
<P>
   Most trainers care little about post position in the Belmont,
since it's 1{ miles, the longest of the Triple Crown events. Lukas
didn't even show up for the draw, saying, ``It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But some horsemen approached Grand Slam's owners expressing
condolences about the unlucky 13 post and commenting how everything
is going Bob Baffert's way. Baffert is the trainer of Real Quiet,
who is trying for the first Triple Crown sweep since Affirmed 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet was listed as the 6-5 favorite in the official
morning line, and Baffert was pleased with his No. 8 post,
especially since the 7-2 second favorite, Victory Gallop, pulled
No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   More than the post draw, Baffert was encouraged by a weather
report that promised sunny skies for Saturday after earlier
forecasts indicated rain was possible.
</P>
<P>
   In his only trip on an off track, Real Quiet ran eighth, while
Grand Slam, Yellow Brae and the Houston-connected Victory Gallop
all have run well in mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Triple Crown gods are looking down at us,''
Baffert said. ``I didn't want rain. My horse is training awesome.
We're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lukas was saying, ``Real Quiet is the one to beat,
but he's no cinch, because that is an elusive crown.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 horses in a century have won the Triple Crown, and 13
have failed after taking the first two legs.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam, the third favorite in the Belmont field, was given
6-1 odds to stop Real Quiet. In the Experimental Free Handicap,
Grand Slam was ranked second to Favorite Trick among 2-year-olds in
1997. He beat Lil's Lad and Halory Hunter in the 1-mile Champagne
Stakes last October. But the next month, he underwent surgery for
an injury to his left hind leg.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was criticized for rushing the healing process with Grand
Slam, who ran sixth in the San Pedro Handicap in March. The
62-year-old trainer drew flak for entering the colt in the
Lexington Stakes in April.
</P>
<P>
   But third place in that race indicated a comeback was
progressing. That notion was confirmed by a two-length win in the
Peter Pan Stakes two weeks ago at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   As for Yarrow Brae, who will start in the 12th hole at Belmont,
Lukas had hoped the Illinois Derby winner would have a monopoly on
early speed and steal a win. But that hope was diminished by the
unexpected entry Thursday of the front-running Flamingo Stakes
winner Chilito.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas said Yarrow Brae ``has the combination of great tactical
speed and the ability to stay. The Belmont catches this type of
horse that's improving this time of year. Maybe we can catch a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't catch any breaks Thursday. That's the way his Triple
Crown season is going. But he expects to be back, stronger than
ever, next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of great 2-year-olds,'' Lukas said. ``We're
loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a big barn, and there's still room for more signs.

<P>
   MASON, TEXAS _ The motto of Grace Christian School _ ``Fight the
good fight of faith'' _ could be that of many an English private
school. The difference is that Grace means it.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of thousands of recently established fundamentalist
Christian schools across America, with a mission to major in Jesus
Christ and minor in everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is housed in a small white clapboard schoolhouse beside a
dried-up creek in Mason, a pretty ranching town of 2,100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside, and it is immediately clear that this is a
different kind of school, with humble resources. Desks line the
main room. Teenagers sit next to small children. The atmosphere is
attentive. There are no classrooms as such, just a single teacher
and two teaching assistants walking up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has 35 children, aged 6 to 18. Its largest-ever graduating
class was three; but in recent years its graduates have gone on to
West Point and Texas A&AMP;M University, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentalist schools are growing fast. In Fort Worth, Texas,
enrollment in them has grown by 30 percent since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of these schools do not report to the local
educational authorities, exact numbers are difficult to come by;
but Christian Schools International, one of several umbrella
organizations, claims about 3,200 member schools in the United
States, with 600,000 pupils.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason for their growth is frustration at the removal
of God from the public schools. But some parents have in general
lost confidence in the state's ability to educate their children,
and others question the government's right to dictate educational
standards.
</P>
<P>
   When is a Christian school a fundamentalist school? There are no
hard-and-fast rules; but an unequivocal belief in creationism is
probably the most reliable indicator.
</P>
<P>
   So is a sense of ministering to the whole child. ``We believe
that every human has three parts: spirit, body and soul, and that
we should minister to all three parts,'' says John Burges, the
principal and only full-time teacher at Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Parents often quote Deuteronomy chapter six, verse seven _ ``And
thou shalt teach (God's Commandments] diligently unto thy
children'' _ as the source of their preference for such schooling.
How, they ask, can one diligently teach scripture in a secular
school system?
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum itself is overtly Christian. Almost every subject
on the Accelerated Christian Curriculum, which Grace uses, has a
Christian slant.
</P>
<P>
   Parents pay around $125 per child each year for books and course
materials. Some of these courses, such as grammar, are laudable for
their basic approach.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more worrying. The history curriculum carries the
notion of America's ``manifest destiny'' far beyond Monroe's
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Spain was defeated in North America because it was Catholic.
George Washington was preserved by a miracle during the
French-Indian war. All Muslims are ``descendants of Isaac's
half-brother Ishmael,''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, ``Americanism'' is the divine template for the world.
</P>
<P>
   Larger fundamentalist schools charge fees and grant
scholarships, but smaller ones have a different approach. Grace is
typical. Its shoestring budget allows it to educate each child for
roughly $1,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, parents sit down with the school to discuss how
much they can afford to pay, ranging from $50 to $200 a month for
each child. Teachers' pay is paltry. Burges draws a salary only
when all the bills have been paid; in a good year he takes home
$12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford a laboratory, Grace uses the great outdoors as
its classroom. In deer season the whole school goes hunting (PE),
butchers a deer (Biology), then cooks it (Home Economics) into
venison burgers for school lunch. And everyone says grace first. &QL;

MALLALIEU WOOLFOLK, 92, LAWYER AND ADVISER TO BLACK OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Miss., Mo., Minn., Ala.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Mallalieu S. Woolfolk, a lawyer who gave legal
and political assistance to prominent black elected officials,
including David Dinkins, Percy Sutton and Charles Rangel, died May
30 at Beth Israel Hospital in Passaic, N.J. He was 92 and lived in
Teaneck, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Woolfolk, whose doctorate was in law, specialized in corporate
law. In recent years, although partly retired, he advised Sutton,
the chairman emeritus of Inner City Broadcasting Corp., which owns
the Manhattan-based radio station WLIB-AM, Queens Inner City Unity
Cable and other radio stations and ventures. Earlier, Woolfolk
provided financial and legal assistance during the founding of
Inner City Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton has described Woolfolk, who was known as Mal, as ``my
friend, my super lawyer and my grammarian, who reminds me of why I
use the words that I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolfolk was also associate counsel of the Bill of Rights
Committee at the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1967
and legal secretary to Oliver Sutton, a New York state Supreme
Court judge and a brother of Percy Sutton's.
</P>
<P>
   Woolfolk was long active in the political life of Harlem and New
York City. He assisted in Percy Sutton's successful campaigns for
the state Assembly and for Manhattan borough president. He also
helped Oliver Sutton become elected a Civil Court judge and then a
state Supreme Court justice. And he was active in the campaigns of
congressman Rangel, former Mayor Dinkins and former state Sen.
Basil Paterson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Woolfolk was director of training at the Upper
Manhattan Small Business Development Center, which has become the
Workshop in Business Opportunities Inc., a nonprofit organization
that teaches New Yorkers how to become entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he served in the Army Air Forces as a member
of the all-black corps of pilots known as the Tuskegee Airmen. He
became a captain and saw combat in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Woolfolk was born and raised in Holly Springs, Miss. His early
education was in segregated schools. He received a bachelor's
degree in 1938 from Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Mo., and
a master's degree in psychology in 1940 from the University of
Minnesota. He then taught at Alabama State College before joining
the Army Air Forces in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   He received his law degree in 1951 from De Paul University in
Chicago. In the next two decades he was an energetic civil-rights
advocate and became a figure in Harlem's political life.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Dr. Muriel Petioni ended in divorce after 28
years.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Jacqueline Rhinehart
Woolfolk, and a son, Charles Mal Woolfolk of Manhattan.

CO-OP MAKES COMEBACK, 10 YEARS AFTER FIRST SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sales are expected to restart next month at Turtle
Bay Towers, putting the 337-unit co-op at 310 East 46th St. back in
the market for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The plan _ reached by the co-op board and Rockrose Development
Corp., the sponsor _ is to improve the 26-story structure and sell
the 245 unsold apartments, many with terraces and greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are expected to range from $135,000 to $400,000 for the
studio lofts and one- and two-bedroom apartments, with 550 to 1,600
square feet. Those prices, on average, are about 5 percent to 10
percent higher than what the units sold for in 1988, when they
originally went on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Market-rate mortgages will also be available to buyers through
American Home Mortgage, overcoming a financing difficulty often
faced by purchasers in buildings where fewer than 51 percent of the
units have been sold. About 95 units are expected to come on the
market this year, starting with as many as 18 next month.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding-cake-style structure, between First and Second
avenues, was converted in 1988 from a rental that Rockrose had
reshaped 13 years earlier from a 1929 office and a light-industrial
loft building that had been damaged by a natural-gas explosion in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Only 28 percent of the apartments were sold before the recession
hit and the market soured, as did the relationship between the
co-op board and Rockrose, whose headquarters are in the building's
ground-level commercial space.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawsuits between the sponsor and the board further
splintered their relationship. Meanwhile, the unsold apartments
were rented out.
</P>
<P>
   There are 68 apartments that are leased to rent-stabilized
tenants, who are allowed to remain in their units at regulated
rents. An additional 177 apartments that are also owned by Rockrose
are rented to tenants who replaced residents who had been living in
the building when it became a co-op.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants in these apartments are not protected by rent
regulations, and the market rents that they pay had given Rockrose
little incentive to sell their units because the rents exceeded the
monthly maintenance charges.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Rockrose and the co-op board, encouraged by
Manhattan's strong sales market, set their sights on the same goal:
selling the unsold units. After seven months of negotiations, they
devised a refinancing and buildingwide renovation program to make
the building more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The building's $25 million mortgage was refinanced at a lower
interest rate in April after Rockrose, which held the mortgage,
agreed to waive all but $500,000 of an $11 million prepayment
penalty. The new $30 million loan is at a fixed interest rate of
6.63 percent for 20 years instead of the original 10.53 percent,
said Andrew Singer, chairman of Singer &AMP; Bassuk Organization, which
arranged the financing for the co-op. The lender was PruExpress, a
subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, which is based
in Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``This loan indicates that lenders are willing to finance
underlying mortgages in less than substantially sold co-ops _ which
they had avoided because of the troubles of sponsors in the late
'80s _ if the buildings are otherwise financially sound,'' Singer
said. ``As a result, lenders of loans to co-op buyers are following
suit.''
</P>
<P>
   For Turtle Bay Towers, the new loan will enable the co-op board
to make repairs and reduce monthly maintenance fees by 10 percent.
The projected monthly fees will range from $800 to $2,200 on most
apartments, though they will be as high as $2,700 on a few units.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This deal took a dead-end situation in terms of refinancing
the underlying mortgage and turned it into a positive,'' said Naomi
Gardner, a lawyer for the co-op. She said the co-op also borrowed
about $3 million to make repairs to the building's facade as well
as to unit owners' terraces and greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Reckhow, president of the co-op board, is optimistic about
the changes. ``This is the most significant step taken to improve
the building's situation,'' said Reckhow, who has owned his
apartment for 10 years but has rented it out since 1992. ``Now I
feel better about the prospects of obtaining a satisfactory sales
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockrose, among other things, also will pay its share of the
building's improvements and sell the units a few at a time to
people who want to live in the building rather than in a bulk sale
to investors.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the co-op extended Rockrose's lease on the
commercial space, hired the company to manage the building and
agreed to the improvement program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with managing the building, we get $25 million from the
payment of the mortgage,'' said Kevin Singleton, vice president and
general manager at Rockrose. ``Now we can maximize our investment
by selling units at retail prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockrose filed an amendment to its offering plan earlier this
week with the New York state attorney general's office. If it is
accepted, which is expected within 30 days, sales will begin.
Tenants buying apartments, which feature 10- to 12-foot-high
ceilings and open floor plans, will be given priority, but not a
discount from the asking prices. The units are to sell at an
average price of about $250 for each square foot of space.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a one-bedroom unit with 850 square feet on the
seventh floor is expected to cost $188,000. In the area, from East
43rd to East 46th streets and from First to Lexington Avenues, the
average sale price of a one-bedroom co-op, typically with 843
square feet, is $182,000, according to Corcoran Group, a brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said the units would be renovated at a cost of $10,000
to $12,000 as they became available. Ten are now vacant, and when
leases expire they will generally not be renewed.

IN A SHOW OF UNITY, REPUBLICANS SUPPORT PATAKI FOR RE-ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ State Republican leaders coalesced behind the
re-election campaign of Gov. George Pataki on Thursday, offering a
display of unity highlighted by an effusive public tribute by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani to two of his most famous rivals: Pataki and Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's conciliatory remarks _ the closest he has come to
apologizing for fiercely opposing Pataki's campaign for governor in
1994 _ were contained in what had been expected to be a routine
five-minute welcome to 406 Republican delegates assembling in
Manhattan for the Republican State Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Giuliani nearly overshadowed the renomination of Pataki
for another four-year term. The mayor spoke for 29 minutes in what
was a clear effort to redeem himself with state Republican leaders
whose support could be critical to his future as a state or
national candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who in 1994 warned that ``ethics will be trashed'' if
the ``D'Amato-Pataki crew ever get control,'' on Thursday described
D'Amato as ``the most effective senator'' in the history of New
York, and said that Pataki had ``more than earned my great
admiration and respect and friendship.'' Many of the delegates sat
in slack-jawed silence as Giuliani spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks came as the Republican Party effortlessly _
and, at times listlessly _ voted unanimously to designate Pataki as
its candidate for re-election. The party also nominated Mary
Donohue, a New York state Supreme Court justice, for lieutenant
governor, and Dennis Vacco for a second term as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The convention was in almost every sense different from the
convention of four years ago, when D'Amato's forces battled to the
last minute to prevent Pataki, then a little-known state senator
from Peekskill, from facing a primary for the nomination to
challenge Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   William Powers, the state Republican Party chairman, read from a
script on the lectern, leading the state committee through the
motions of ratifying a slate that was selected long before any
state committee members checked in at the Sheraton New York Hotel
and Towers in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   After closing the nominations for governor _ there was not a
sound in the room as the chairman inquired if anyone else had any
additional names to offer. Powers looked up from his notes and,
with a small smile, declared: `We're getting there. It's a little
easier than it was four years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his wife, Libby, followed the vote from a small room
with a window overlooking the ballroom where the delegates were
meeting. As soon as the roll call was completed, the governor
strode on stage to chants of ``George'' and ``Four More Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki then offered the outlines of what is shaping up, at least
in contrast to four years ago, as an unadventurous re-election
strategy. He described his accomplishments of the past four years,
in particular cutting taxes, pushing for environmental protections
and restoring the death penalty. But he offered little insight into
what he might do if re-elected, other than pushing for more tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every single instance, we have done what we said we would
do,'' Pataki declared. ``We have turned crisis into comeback. And
what a comeback it is. New York is once again a better place to
live, work and raise a family.''
</P>
<P>
   By design, the day was supposed to be devoid of drama, so that
all attention was directed at Pataki. But Giuliani, who has long
had a competitive relationship with the governor and who is likely
to compete further on the national stage, turned the dynamic with
his speech, which included a lengthy recital of his own
accomplishments as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's welcoming speech was a minute longer than Pataki's
acceptance speech. Asked how long Giuliani's speech was supposed to
be, Zenia Mucha, the governor's communications director, held up
five fingers, and glanced with exasperation at the stage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Now, I didn't get the relationship off to the best possible
start,'' Giuliani said. ``But he did. And that is to his great
credit. This is a man who understands that public service is about
improving the lives of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had even warmer praise for D'Amato, with whom he has
been feuding, off and on, for the better part of a decade. ``There
hasn't been in the history of New York state a more effective
senator than Al D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who as a habit has always avoided public clashes with
Giuliani and was clearly concerned that the mayor's appearance
could overshadow him, offered a measured response to Giuliani's
speech. ``I'm just very grateful that he did come here and say such
positive things about our relationship and how we did things for
the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bruno, the majority leader of the Senate, who was
particularly critical of Giuliani in 1994, suggested that Giuliani
had come to his Republican senses and said it would surely help him
if he runs for governor or U. S. senator, as some aides say he
might. ``Someone asked if I would support him for other offices,
and I absolutely would, based on his record of accomplishment,
based on his demonstrating he can learn to be a team player and be
cooperative,'' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks bought a measure of disorder to a convention
clearly intended to be orderly. Reporters were relegated to a
separate part of the room and kept away from delegates.
Pataki/Donohue placards were neatly placed on every chair as the
delegates entered the room Thursday morning. A news release that
was issued before the gavel was dropped announced that Pataki had
been unanimously chosen. The schedule even announced when the red,
white and blue balloons hanging over the room would be dropped (at
4 p.m. Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, as is his practice, sought to glide above the politics
swirling around him, instead laying out themes of his campaign in
his speech. The Democratic candidate will be chosen in a primary
this September.
</P>
<P>
   The governor painted a dark picture of New York under Democratic
control, and asserted that Republican policies had turned things
around. He recalled being a member of the Assembly, pushing for tax
cuts, reductions in the welfare rolls and the elimination of some
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed as if we and a handful of others were lonely voices
in the wilderness, struggling to be heard against the clamoring
made by the forces of tax-and-spend big government,'' he said.
``Those forces ran the government with an iron hand back then, and
they refused to change. Well those days are back where they belong
_ those days are long gone.''

NEW JUDGE ARRIVES AT JUSTICE IN HIS OWN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ja) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As they stood together on the thick carpet of City
Hall for the swearing-in ceremony a few days ago _ the father a
legendary retired justice, the son just about to ascend to the
bench _ it seemed to be a storybook moment of generational passage.
The son recalled the moment 30 years before when his father took
the oath, and even talked explicitly about the path of his father's
footsteps. The father beamed.
</P>
<P>
   But modern storybooks are rarely so pat, and it is clear that
the footsteps of Gregory Carro, a newly minted judge of the New
York City Criminal Court, will be his own, not be those of his
well-known father.
</P>
<P>
   When John Carro was named a Criminal Court judge in 1968 by
Mayor John Lindsay, he was one of only two or three Puerto Rican
judges in the city and the first from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke no English when his family first came to New York in
1937 and acutely felt the responsibility of being a ``first'' _
using his bench to rail against biases he found within the Police
Department, helping to found the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and
Education Fund and various Hispanic societies of municipal
employees, exhorting Hispanic students to study law and claim for
themselves the reins of power.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed telling off a district attorney as much as telling a
riotous story in chambers. His battles with Mario Merola, the
former Bronx district attorney, were so protracted that the court
administration felt it better to transfer him to Manhattan, where
he eventually rose to become the state's highest-ranking Puerto
Rican judge, serving 16 years in the appellate division. And when
two New York senators nominated him to become a federal judge in
1988, the Reagan and Bush administrations sat on his nomination for
three years, telling him they were not interested in activist
judges. He finally withdrew his name angrily in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Carro, by contrast, has entered the judiciary in an era of
lower volume and more relaxed expectations. There are now about 40
Hispanic judges in the city _ not enough for his father, but enough
to ease some of the role-model pressure from his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   He is reserved and careful where his father was outspoken and
colorful, and his views on maintaining an ethnic balance on the
courts are more in tune with the man who appointed him to the
$103,800-a-year job, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my father, it was important for him as a minority to
represent the community,'' Carro said on Wednesday, borrowing
another judge's desk between judicial training sessions. ``He
always said that good government is representative government, and
I agree with that, and I'm glad to add to the diversity of the
courts. Myself, however, having said that, I really think it
doesn't matter who's sitting on the bench. As long as the justice
is true and fair, the public will pick up on that and have
confidence in the courts.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Greg Carro, who is 38, said he did not even realize his father
was an outspoken liberal when he was growing up. By then, the Carro
family had moved from the Bronx to a more spacious home in Yonkers,
later moving again to the far suburbs of Rockland County, and the
judge did not bring his politics or his cases home to the kitchen
table.
</P>
<P>
   The seven children in the family had the kind of comfortable
middle-class existence John Carro never knew as a child, and there
was never any question but that they would enter the kinds of
professions their father had aspired to. (Of the seven, four are
lawyers and one is a doctor.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar pattern of assimilation, but the pathway is
rarely as thoroughly paved by one generation for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it a lot,'' said Juan Figueroa, president of the
Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``The Latinos coming
out in this generation tend to balance their commitment to issues
with their professional goals. There's nothing really wrong with
that _ after all, it was John Carro's fights that provided his son
with those opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   As pleased as he is by his son's ascension, John Carro, 70,
nonetheless acknowledges, even a bit ruefully, how things have
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never afraid to speak out, and correct injustices, and
do what I thought was right,'' he said. ``But Greg is more
Americanized _ the kids never had that whole involvement in the
Latino community. I have so much respect for him. But it's a whole
different world.'' He added, laughing, ``Maybe he hung around with
those Republicans too long in Yonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, a former defense lawyer, Greg Carro came to
the law through the enforcement side. He has been a prosecutor
since graduating from Rutgers Law School in 1985, first for the
city's special narcotics prosecutor and most recently for the
Manhattan district attorney's office, and he has made a specialty
of successfully prosecuting drug gangs. After 13 years on the job,
he submitted his name as a candidate for a judgeship, seeing it as
a logical progression from his work as a prosecutor and his
father's ideals of public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never pushed me to be a judge, but I could see the joy he
took in going to work every day,'' said Greg Carro, who lives in
Manhattan with his wife, Mary Elizabeth Carro, and their two
children, Marissa and Mackenzie. ``I guess maybe some of that
rubbed off.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one page of the storybook that applies, however: the
son will be getting his father's robe.

A DIFFICULT LESSON IN FUND RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENBURGH, N.Y. _ At 10 a.m., Paul Feiner, the normally
irrepressible town supervisor, was mumbling his way through an
embarrassing telephone sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, hello?'' he said, as if it were a question and he were
sorry to ask. ``My name is Paul Feiner? I'm running for Congress on
the Democratic ticket? We spoke a few weeks ago and you said you
might be willing to contribute to my campaign? You said you were
going to talk to your husband?''
</P>
<P>
   Feiner continued until, finally, he was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   For six hours a day, nearly every day since he decided in
January to run for the 20th Congressional District seat, Feiner has
been on the telephone trying to raise the $600,000 that his
advisers say he needs to unseat the Republican incumbent, Rep.
Benjamin Gilman.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a seasoned local politician, Feiner said he was
surprised to discover that running in a national race was almost
entirely about fund raising. Campaigning in a townwide election, he
said, requires more legwork and more handshaking than it does
money.
</P>
<P>
   Feiner, 42, became involved in politics as a campaign volunteer
at 13 (after a rabbi persuaded him, during his bar mitzvah, not to
become a rabbi). He was a Westchester County legislator for eight
years before being elected Greenburgh town supervisor in 1991.
Greenburgh includes villages along the Hudson River from
Hastings-on-Hudson to Tarrytown, as well as Ardsley, Elmsford and
Hartsdale.
</P>
<P>
   If running a national race has been an education, Feiner has
been a difficult student. He is so contemptuous of the money end of
politics that his fund-raising manager and campaign consultant quit
in May, frustrated because he would not follow their advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm already behind schedule,'' he said. ``They tell me I'm
supposed to raise $20,000 a week to even be taken seriously.'' To
earn the backing of the Democratic National Committee, he was told,
you have to be ``first tier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm second tier,'' Feiner said.
</P>
<P>
   He made lists, as he was advised to do, of everyone who did
business in the Town of Greenburgh _ developers, real estate
agents, merchants, corporate directors _ and called them to solicit
support. He listened to the professionals' tactics and then ignored
their suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not supposed to ask for money, you're supposed to tell
them how much you need,'' Feiner said. ``You're supposed to say,
`Can I have $1,000?' and then be quiet. `The first person who
speaks after that loses,' that's what they tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his fumbling, most people who knew Feiner gave
something. Some wanted something back. The most egregious case
involved a lawyer he met at a fund-raiser who offered cash and an
introduction to important people in Rockland and Orange counties,
where Feiner is little known and his opponent, Gilman, is very
popular.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer made it clear he wanted to be given town legal work
in exchange for his support. When Feiner balked, the man withdrew
the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame him,'' Feiner said, and he refused to disclose
the lawyer's name. ``I blame the system.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, hundreds of people in the 20th Congressional District,
which stretches to Rockland, Orange and Sullivan counties, have
contributed a total of $135,000 to Feiner's campaign. It is far
more than the $70,000 he raised for any of his local races, but not
enough to buy the television and radio ads and pay for the mailings
to reach people in the sprawling district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to run for office, be able to contrast my vision
with my opponent,'' Feiner said. ``Get my message out and let the
voters decide.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The opposing campaign agrees. Gilman, 75, is chairman of the
influential International Relations Committee and is seeking his
14th term in Congress. He plans to raise about $600,000, said Sandi
Thoby, controller for Citizens for Gilman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will run on his own record of accomplishment, but he has to
get that out there,'' Ms. Thoby said. ``Everything costs money.''
</P>
<P>
   If Feiner does not raise enough money to win, he can still hope
to run well and position himself for the future, said Lee
Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of a challenger to unseat an incumbent depends on
a major scandal or a major infusion of cash,'' Miringoff said.
``This is shaping up to be a `don't rock the boat' election year at
the moment for the Democrats. They will probably target a few races
to pour money into. They would have to see some weakness from
Gilman. I don't know if it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Feiner, who is married to a lawyer, Sherrie Brown, got his start
as a political noodge. An avid bicyclist, he badgered the
Westchester County Legislature to create bike lanes along the Bronx
River Parkway until it finally gave in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just stay out of my office for six months,'' Feiner
recalls a county legislator, John DeRario, saying in 1973, ``we'll
build the damn bike lanes.'' The following year, he got the county
to close the Bronx River Parkway for bicyclists on summer Sundays,
a program that continues today.
</P>
<P>
   His problem-solving booth has brought him a lot of attention.
Every week for more than a decade, he has set up a card table, a
folding chair and a ``problem solver'' sign at a local supermarket
and offered help to people in need of anything from a bus schedule
to a double lung transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Feiner once tried to establish a town matchmaking service for
lonely suburban singles, though the plan was later simplified to
town-sponsored singles events, like dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's really the whole purpose of being involved in
government,'' he said, with a touch of the rabbi he never became
showing through. ``I really get a big thrill out of helping improve
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He addresses criticism by trying to include everyone in
government. First, Feiner established the call-in town meeting, in
which people can stay home, watch the meeting on cable television
and phone in a comment. Now he has a deputy-supervisor program, and
he makes political foes his deputies on special issues to bring
them into the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be amazed how people change when they are involved,'' he
said.

Bulls' confidence belies dilemma
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ The way the Chicago Bulls continue to talk the big
talk, they surely must be the most dominant team ever to fall
behind 1-0 in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they have lost their last four road games and,
apparently, the snap and mystique that have made them one of the
NBA's dynasties, the Bulls say their will to win is stronger than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the facts do nothing to support their case that this is the
same Bulls team that confidently and routinely wins tight games and
resists those muscle-tightening situations because they are who
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Utah Jazz, who will go for a 2-0 lead tonight at the
Delta Center, notices the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the Bulls I remember seeing,'' Bryon Russell said
Thursday. ``That's a different team than it was last year. We have
to take advantage of mismatches we see out there just like they're
used to taking advantage of the mismatches that are usually
presented to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell ended up being one of those mismatches whenever he lined
up against Toni Kukoc. Russell had 15 points and eight rebounds in
Game 1; Kukoc had nine points and three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Bulls exude a ``What, us worry?'' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have an inner strength and inner confidence for
ourselves and what we can accomplish,'' Michael Jordan said. ``And
one game does not deteriorate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's a pressure situation, the ultimate, the apex of a
season. I believe even if we lose (tonight), which I'm not thinking
that way, we still have a great opportunity to go home and win in
our building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave a good effort in Game 1. Now, we have to give a better
effort. It's a whole different frame of mind. I think that's that
Zen Buddhism kind of stuff. We're practicing that.''
</P>
<P>
   That no doubt makes Phil Jackson happy. What would make the
Zen-spouting coach happier is if the Bulls would prove again
tonight in Game 2 they haven't slipped a notch or two when it comes
to being clutch performers.
</P>
<P>
   After one game of the Finals, it's far too early to write off
the Bulls. But Jackson said Thursday that his team was showing its
age, mainly because the Bulls were tired at the end of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   He cited two plays _ Jordan's inability to elevate and
subsequent shot-clock violation with 1:19 left in overtime and
Steve Kerr's hack of John Stockton when a still-fresh-looking
Stockton drove for a layup. The three-point play put Utah ahead by
five points in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were very fatigued,'' Jackson said. ``It's
pretty obvious we're going to have to provide a little more support
(from the bench). I thought two days of rest might get them back up
to speed. Then, we played a good offensive second half and carried
the action and the momentum, but defensively we couldn't make the
stops down the stretch simply because we were fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job of resting guys who mean something to them
down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz was vastly superior to the Bulls in the overtime.
Whether or not it was the fatigue taking its toll on Chicago, which
was playing its sixth game in 12 days and facing the Jazz, which
was coming off 10 days of rest, the Bulls did not look like
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And still, they feel good about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our confidence is still there,'' Scottie Pippen said. ``We
still feel like we're in control of this series and they still have
to defend their home court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we still have an opportunity to get a game here.
As poorly as we played, that was anybody's game (Wednesday). Karl
(Malone) didn't have a great game, and we felt that if we were ever
going to steal a game out here, last night should have been that
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still feel very good. Our confidence is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   What might help the Bulls is diversity. Jordan and Pippen
combined for 48 of the Bulls' 82 shots and for 54 of their 85
points.
</P>
<P>
   Shandon Anderson, a member of Utah's productive bench, which
outscored Chicago's reserves 22-8, said he believes such numbers
don't work in the Bulls' favor. Anderson said he believes the Bulls
might be too reliant on Jordan. When the Bulls give the basketball
to Jordan, it's almost as if they rest and watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that just leaves the other guys standing out on the
perimeter, just watching,'' Anderson said. ``You have those guys
out there, guys who can score, just watching, so it's going to be
hard for them. If he (Jordan) goes for 40 or 50 points and the
other guys just stand out there and do nothing, then that's good
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end, Jordan and Pippen were fatigued and had
trouble making plays. They were a combined 1-for-4 from the field
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concern when you can't execute down the stretch,''
Jordan said. ``And I think that is an area of improvement we need
to focus on.''

THE GHOUL POOL: MORBID, TASTELESS AND POPULAR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The all-media wake for Frank Sinatra and the countdown that
preceded it took me back to April 1984, when I first dipped my toe
into the ghoul pool.
</P>
<P>
   As a novice floor clerk in the cacophonous options trading pit
of the American Stock Exchange, I was still learning hand signals
when one of the traders tore off his Walkman earphones and yelled:
``I'm losing my shirt! What a long shot!''
</P>
<P>
   Shirts were being lost several times a day, so I didn't give his
outburst a second thought. But his next line stopped me cold: ``How
can Marvin Gaye be dead! I mean, what about Helen Hayes? She's
83!''
</P>
<P>
   Being all of 18, three weeks off the Greyhound from upstate New
York, with six summers on a farm constituting my entire work
experience, I looked to someone else, a specialist in Motorola
options, who explained, ``For almost 10 years Dave's been betting
on the actress to take a dirt nap and then out of left field Gaye
gets himself shot to death by his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meaning?'' I asked, still confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meaning that at 42, Gaye was half Hayes' age and so the payoff
is going to be really big.''
</P>
<P>
   You've heard about the office football pool, and the baseball
Rotisserie league. But incredibly tasteless as it seems, countless
workplaces are also offering the dead pool, a funereal game of
wagering on when celebrities will meet their demise.
</P>
<P>
   Neatly pairing two of America's prime obsessions _ fame and
death _ the game is another variation on your typical water-cooler
sport. Only instead of betting on scores, players toss pennies
against death's door.
</P>
<P>
   To beat the odds, poolers scour the tabloids and gossip columns
for hints about their candidates' continued viability. The aged or
the terminally ill don't score the ghoulish competitor many points,
but who could have foreseen the recent untimely exits of Sonny
Bono, Chris Farley or John Denver?
</P>
<P>
   As appalling as betting on the prospect of death may be,
wagering in the twilight zone is apparently appealing to a growing
number of Americans _ if the rise in the number of Web sites
dedicated to the subject is any gauge.
</P>
<P>
   Dead-pool playbooks vary, but the most common version requires
contestants to compile a mortfolio of 10 celebrities they expect to
die and then submit it with an entrance fee by the beginning of
each year. Come Dec. 31, the most prescient player wins. Deaths _
and celebrity _ are typically confirmed by an Associated Press
obituary. Without that, you're nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In some games, only one player can hold rights to a given
celebrity; others require a payoff upon each celebrity's passing,
rather than a once-a-year accounting. In many pools, the payoff is
far greater for choices with lower odds of mortality, which is what
so troubled trader Dave about Marvin Gaye.
</P>
<P>
   Death pooling has been around since the 19th century. Guy de
Maupassant, in his 1885 novel ``Bel-Ami,'' wrote of a Parisian
parlor game in which players drew up lists of doomed academicians
and their possible successors.
</P>
<P>
   In America, the pools can be traced to Damon Runyon's New York
City of the 1920s and 1930s. As recently as 1988, Clint Eastwood's
last Dirty Harry movie not only featured such a game, but also took
its name from it: ``The Dead Pool.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps not until it got to Wall Street _ where betting is
like breathing _ did the ghoul pool find a permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death pools have been around as long as the exchanges,
because during market lulls traders sit around for hours looking at
one another in utter boredom,'' said Tony DeMartino, a former Amex
employee who started on Wall Street in 1950 and now works as a
celebrity photographer. ``They do stuff like this to stay awake.''

</P>
<P>
   In large law firms, ghoul lagoons are often gurgling in the back
of some paralegal's cubicle. A mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer at
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz in New York City says his name would
be the next to surface in his firm's pool if such unjudicial
shenanigans were publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he readily acknowledged being a better lawyer than
prognosticator. ``I can't win the stupid thing,'' he whispered into
the phone, ``You'd think that Abe Vigoda'' _ who played Det. Phil
Fish on ``Barney Miller'' in the 1970s _ ``would have died by now;
he looks terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Vigoda, doing fine at 77, was recently in the TV miniseries,
``Witness to the Mob.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as laptop computer technology has enabled day trading and
desktop publishing to flourish outside the office, so the Web
browser has brought ghoul pools to life for the average investor.
</P>
<P>
   It is now possible to play such diverse _ and painfully tacky _
venues as the Lee Atwater Invitational Dead Pool, Not Your Mother's
Dead Pool, Dewey's Death Pool, Chalk Outlines and Dead Club, to
name but a handful.
</P>
<P>
   The Atwater Invitational, named after the take-no-prisoners GOP
campaign strategist who died in 1991 at age 40 of brain cancer
(http://stiffs.com), was started that year by Zachariah Love, a
venue-booker in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Love moved the game to the Web in 1996, where it now has almost
600 players paying an $11 entrance fee for a shot at the $1,500
annual prize.
</P>
<P>
   Love reports that Frank Sinatra, at the time of his death at the
age of 82, was on 447 players' lists. And though that pool is
closed for 1998 _ sign-up for the 1999 pool is Dec. 1 _ a
secondary, or ``Lee Jr.,'' pool can be entered monthly for $5 to
compete for a $300 award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it's not like we're killing people,'' Love said. ``The
site has to do with the twisted way people relate to fame and the
way they deify celebrities. Remember how the world went insane over
Princess Di?'' (Not surprisingly, at 36, she seemed to be on no
one's list when she took that fatal midnight ride last August in
Paris.)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for himself, but perhaps for many other candidates to
appear on pool lists, Milton Berle, who is 90, said last week that
``these pools are all well and good _ as long as I'm not a part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most successful player in the Atwater pool, winning more
than $500 for each of the last two years, is Julie Horowitz,
development coordinator for the Los Angeles Commission on Assault
Against Women. Her secret: ``I take notes all year long in the back
of my date book and then use it to create the list of 10 names at
the end of year. It's a game of research.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horowitz, 34, described the game as ``totally addictive''
even though ``some people I work with are horrified by it and think
I'm really sick.'' Though colleagues may not actually play the
game, she said, ``they sort of get obsessed by it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Internet versions has grown to the point where some
pools are specializing in picking death days for one celebrity.
Several months ago, Michael Moore, a student at California State
University at Long Beach and the operator of Tregoire's 1998 Dead
Pool (www.flash.net/mmoore72/deadpool.htm) spun off a Sinatra-only
site. Lucas Trerice, 20, a student at University of Washington, won
by taking the midpoint of guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Who else plays these games? ``Mostly people with a good sense of
humor,'' said Melody Rutherford, founder of the Celebrity Death

   Ms. Rutherford's celebrity ghoul pool _ as well an offshoot she
dedicates to politicians and musicians _ is open year-round and
charges no entrance fee, nor does it offer any monetary awards.
``Just your name on the winner's page and bad karma,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To indicate how quickly attitudes have shifted on the subject of
death _ or of good taste _ when Ms. Rutherford first asked Yahoo,
the Web indexer, to list her site three years ago, executives said
the content wasn't appropriate. Today, Yahoo lists 18 ghoul pools,
including Ms. Rutherford's, which gets more than 1,000 hits a week.
</P>
<P>
   To those who suggest that Ms. Rutherford is running a tasteless
game, she has a ready response: ``Do you carry life insurance?
Because you're betting money on your own death.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Dave, my disgruntled Amex floor trader, the first
lady of the American stage was in no hurry to accommodate him.
Helen Hayes took her final bow nine years later, with dignity, at
age 92.

CONVERTING TO A ROTH IRA? FIRST, CHECK THE CALCULATOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost everywhere you turn, the financial services industry is
offering free software to analyze whether you should convert your
traditional Individual Retirement Account to a new Roth IRA, which
allows tax-free withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   But the same set of facts can generate wildly different
conclusions depending on whose software is used.
</P>
<P>
   Say you have $100,000 in your IRA and expect to stay in the 28
percent tax bracket, that you anticipate 8 percent annual pretax
growth and that you will take all your money in a lump sum 20 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   The analyzer disk distributed by T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore
mutual fund company, calculates that after you have paid taxes up
front to convert to a Roth, you will have $466,096 to spend in
2018. That is a hefty 12.4 percent more than the $414,649 after
taxes at withdrawal if you stick with a traditional IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But plug the same facts into the Roth analyzer from Merrill
Lynch and it calculates that you will have far less, no matter what
you do: $390,843 if you convert to a Roth and $335,589 if you do
not.
</P>
<P>
   The calculator of Strong Funds, the mutual fund company based in
Menomonee Falls, Wis., generates the same figure as T. Rowe Price
if you convert _ and the same as Merrill Lynch if you don't.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can convert: To qualify, you must have less than
$100,000 of adjusted gross income (the last number on the front
page of your Form 1040 tax return).
</P>
<P>
   If you convert this year, Congress has a special deal _ the
taxes due at conversion must be paid in four annual installments,
which amounts to a slight discount on the tax bill. People who
convert in future years must pay the taxes all at once.
</P>
<P>
   The multitude of Roth analyzers, even when they use the same
methodology, often generate slightly different figures because of
subtle differences in their programs, like whether earnings are
compounded annually or daily, and whether the taxes are assumed to
be paid on Jan. 1 or April 15.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic rule, which many analyzers ignore or present in
lengthy legalistic boilerplate, is this:
</P>
<P>
   If you expect your tax rate to be higher when you retire than it
is now, switch to a Roth. But if you expect your tax rate to fall,
the decision gets complicated, depending on how much your tax rate
drops and how many years will pass before you retire.
</P>
<P>
   The T. Rowe Price, Merrill Lynch and Strong calculators come up
with different figures because each treats taxes differently _
especially the upfront payments to be made when converting a
traditional IRA to the Roth version.
</P>
<P>
   You must pay income taxes on your traditional IRA when you
withdraw the money, either years from now in retirement or
immediately if you convert to a Roth.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies assume that if you convert today, you will
move your entire IRA balance to a Roth and pay the taxes from some
other source. But they track that side fund for tax payments in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price assumes that if you convert, you will take the
money from taxable savings, and that if you do not convert, that
the taxable savings account will continue to grow in tandem with
your IRA and at the same rate as the IRA, minus taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch counts only the ``opportunity cost'' of spending
your savings to pay the taxes for a conversion. In calculating what
happens when you stick with a traditional IRA, it ignores the
savings account you did not have to tap for conversion taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our methodology is to take doing nothing as your base line,''
Jim McCarthy, vice president for Merrill Lynch's IRA products,
said. So the Merrill calculator included only the lost opportunity
if savings in the side account are spent today to pay taxes, not
the value of the side account if you keep it and let it grow. He
characterized this as a conservative approach.
</P>
<P>
   Strong Funds just ignores the taxable savings account in its
analysis, though it does refer to it in its fine print without
calculating the financial impact.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Vielehr, Strong's vice president for electronic
distribution, said that was done to avoid raising other complex
issues like capital gains taxes that may be due if the taxes are
paid from the proceeds of selling appreciated securities.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Goodfellow, a retirement specialist at Watson Wyatt
Worldwide, a compensation consultancy, said T. Rowe Price's
technique was the best because it compared apples with apples for
both strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a balanced, comprehensive, picture of your
decision either way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mintz, a semi-retired Dallas insurance agent and consumer
advocate who for 30 years has pressed banks, insurers and the
Internal Revenue Service to make fuller disclosures about how they
do their calculations, said that using any technique but the one
adopted by T. Rowe Price made it impossible to compare on an annual
basis whether you would benefit more from sticking with your
traditional IRA or converting to a Roth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually you may be better off if you convert, but in every
case you are worse off on the day you convert because taxes that
you could have deferred are paid,'' Mintz said. ``You need to know
when the Roth is better and, in some cases, it will take 25 years
or more before you are better off if you convert.''

   (italics) Because everybody seems to know what Friday means, the
problem with Casual Friday is clearly the word ``casual.'' Some
people interpret the dictionary definition _ informal _ to mean
going without a necktie or jacket. To others, it means torn jeans,
tiny tennis skirts, flip-flops or T-shirts that say ``I'm Low on
Estrogen'' or ``Got a Gun.'' Maybe things will get better when the
lexicographers roll up their sleeves and provide a better
definition. (end italics) &QL;

   When the fire alarm went off during a lunchtime workout last
month at the YMCA at Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street, it was
everybody out of the basement pool.
</P>
<P>
   Dripping, barefoot swimmers congregated in the lobby, where they
found a minimal supply of small towels. Fifteen minutes later, with
the firefighters still checking each floor, a young executive
dressed only in his swimsuit said: ``I must call the office and
explain my delay. I can't go back like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfa P. Goldberg of Manhattan remembers the voice that replied:
``Why not? Isn't it called Casual Friday?'' &QL;

<P>
   As a programmer for Prodigy in the early 1990s, Paul R. Loring
of Pleasantville, N.Y., was accustomed to wearing casual clothing
in the office while the rest of the staff was wearing suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeans and T-shirts were the norm in our department,'' he
writes. ``However, some of us were down to T-shirts, shorts and
sandals on the nicer days. So we were all surprised when the
companywide e-mail went out declaring Casual Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   `` `How much more casual can we get?' we asked ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the next day, a group of us arrived at work in our
bathrobes.'' &QL;

   Holly M. Horning, the president of Image Design Group of
Alexandria, Va., which teaches individuals and companies how to use
image as a tool, works daily with the problem of office dress. In
the course of her work, she has come across:
</P>
<P>
   _ A senior executive who runs several miles to work in his
two-piece jogging suit and then strips to his T-shirt and running
shorts and begins work without bothering to shower.
</P>
<P>
   _ A senior partner in a law firm who wore a polo shirt and jeans
while greeting prospective clients in a major case. Judging him by
his clothing, they assumed he was an associate and went elsewhere,
offended because they thought the firm had assigned their case to
an inexperienced lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   _ A woman who sent productivity plummeting by arriving for her
job in the shortest of Lycra miniskirts and a strapless, stretchy
bandeau top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' writes Ms. Horning, companies wait until they
have serious problems before calling an image consultant. ``In a
poll we do with all our corporate participants, over 90 percent of
employees are baffled by what to wear,'' she said. ``They are
confused by the term `casual.''' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   When it comes to interpretations of casual, George A. Dietrick,
a Garden City, N.Y., physician-executive, stands at the
conservative end of the spectrum. He recalls that a few years ago,
when Dress-Down Friday was instituted in the corporate office where
he worked, ``the policy change generated intense discussions at the
water coolers and copy machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CFO and I, the medical director, had multiple discussions
on just what we would wear, since both our personal styles were the
preferred and, in fact, expected collars and ties (not jackets)
around the office at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did it mean anyway? Who would wear what? How would the
senior executives influence and enforce the new dress code?''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, the doctor and his associate believed that
Casual Friday would spin out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most of the men responded by wearing khakis and polo
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us realized that the speculation around the office
was that our interpretation of Casual Friday would be `Light
Starch.''' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget Casual Friday. Some people are casual all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene B. Isaacs, a New York City business consultant and
executive coach, remembers a 26-year-old client who took the
interpretation to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   At their first meeting, Ms. Isaacs recalled, the client wore
high-heeled sandals and was encased in a floral polyester jumpsuit,
worn without a bra; her fingernails and toenails were painted
black, which matched the roots of her dyed blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost 30 percent of our business in the last four months,
and I don't know why,'' said the client, who was being groomed to
take over her family's auto parts business.
</P>
<P>
   Her work consisted of making calls on garage managers. ``It
wasn't her catalogue they were assessing,'' Ms. Isaacs recalls.
``She became infuriated with their blatant passes, lost her cool
and alienated the men, who couldn't understand why she was taking
umbrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Isaacs recommended a modest investment: a blazer, a tailored
straight skirt, closed-toe pumps and consultation with a colorist.
``The mechanics no longer viewed her as the item of the day,'' Ms.
Isaacs writes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter Giuliano, the chairman and founder of Executive
Communications Group, a consulting firm in Englewood, N.J., recalls
an instructor who led a program in media training for a client in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the program dealt with how to dress for a tough
on-camera interview, and how to handle the questions. Because the
participants were field technicians at a chemical plant, the
instructor disregarded their casual attire at the session _ work
boots, overalls and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the workers, however, had soot on his face and wore a red
bandanna around his neck, so the instructor gently told him to wash
for his final on-camera interview the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The client did as told, turning up clean and shiny. He would
have made a perfect spokesman for the company, except for one
detail.
</P>
<P>
   Because this was the company's official casual day, he left his
dentures at home.

YANKEE OWNER WARNS COUNCIL SPEAKER ON REFERENDUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Opening a new front in the battle over the future of
Yankee Stadium, George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner,
all but threatened Thursday night to leave New York City unless
Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker, abandoned his push for a
referendum on whether city money should be used to help build a new
ball park.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner's comments came only hours after City Council
leaders, in a rare act of defiance of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
unveiled their own plan for the city's next budget. For the last
several days, the mayor and the City Council have been deadlocked
over the budget because of Giuliani's refusal to consider any
changes proposed by the council unless Vallone abandoned his call
for a public vote on the stadium issue.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Steinbrenner accused Vallone of using the
referendum to bolster his campaign for governor, and added:
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics has driven more teams from New York City than any of
us care to remember, most recently the football Giants and Jets to
New Jersey. I do not want to move the Yankees from New York, but I
must warn: He is bringing us dangerously close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees owner's words were the strongest he has used so far
on the subject of the team's future home, and they came a month
after Steinbrenner stated that he would refrain from discussing the
team's future until the end of the season because, he said, the
issue had become too emotional and politicized.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said she was unaware
of Steinbrenner's five-paragraph statement, which echoed many of
the criticisms of Vallone that Giuliani and his aides had voiced
hours earlier. But aides to the council speaker accused the mayor
of pressing Steinbrenner to issue the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has argued that the voters should have a say in whether
to use hundreds of millions of dollars in public money for sports
stadiums. Giuliani has contended that such a vote would galvanize
opposition to the idea of building a new stadium on the West Side
of Manhattan and push the Yankees owner to look for a new stadium
site in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Steinbrenner said in his statement that Vallone
was using the Yankees as ``a political baseball in what certainly
seems like a move he thinks will aid him in his race for
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Vallone,'' he said, ``is attempting to block the city from
even considering Manhattan's West Side as a potential site for a
new Yankee Stadium even though an in-depth study commissioned by
the city, the state and the Yankees suggested it was the most
viable option.''
</P>
<P>
   The war of words came at the close of a day in which Vallone and
the mayor wrangled aggressively over the budget and its tangled
connection with the stadium issue.
</P>
<P>
   With the negotiations stalled over the budget, the council
offered its own proposal that is expected to be approved Friday.
That plan, at $34.08 billion, was actually $49 million less than
the budget proposed by the mayor a few weeks ago, and contained a
few hundred million dollars in changes that, especially in a year
of a $2 billion record surplus, could be expected to be ironed out
easily through the usual give-and-take of budget talks.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the two sides spent the day warring and accusing
each other of fiscal recklessness and political duplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a politician,'' Giuliani said. ``I understand what's going
on. This budget is not about governing the city for the next year.
It's about Peter Vallone running for governor. That's what the
budget is about: Peter Vallone trying to make a statement in his
campaign for governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Presenting details of his plan to reporters, Vallone shot back,
``This will be a historic event.'' And referring to the stadium
question, he said: ``This will be the first time a mayor took an
issue and made it an overriding issue more important than the
budget. The politics of it are from that side of the hall, not this
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, after Steinbrenner released his statement,
Vallone said: ``The debate over Yankee Stadium is a good debate and
everyone should have a say in it. But it's appalling that
Steinbrenner would insert himself into the city budget process on
behalf of Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   The council has never adopted its own budget since acquiring the
power to do so under the City Charter revision of 1989. And if, as
expected, the overwhelmingly Democratic council approves the
Vallone budget, the action is likely to trigger a series of legal
battles with the mayor, possibly beginning with a veto within the
next five days.
</P>
<P>
   A vote for a separate budget would abruptly end a long period of
fiscal harmony between the city's two most powerful politicians,
whose annual budget negotiations have been complicated this year by
Vallone's gubernatorial ambitions and Giuliani's desire to secure a
new home for the Yankees.

</P>
<P>
   Both men were able to iron out painful cuts during the recession
a few years ago; this year, New York's current financial boom has
given them ample room to propose costly, and competing, projects.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Giuliani and Vallone predicted a compromise that would
accommodate their personal goals. But budget talks collapsed on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor _ who wants to use $600 million over the next few
years to help pay for new ball parks, including a possible Yankee
stadium on Manhattan's West Side _ demanded that the speaker drop
his push for a referendum that would ask voters whether taxpayers'
money should be used for ball parks. Vallone, one of several
Democrats hoping to oppose Gov. George Pataki in November, refused
to even discuss the topic.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the council speaker pushed for steep cuts in
the city's personal income tax, a proposal intended to give him a
strong selling point on the stump and to pre-empt any criticism
that he has supported tax increases in the past. In an apparent
reversal, the Republican mayor opposed these tax cuts, arguing that
the city could not afford them.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, which would cost the city about $201 million in
revenues in the next budget and more than $500 million a year after
that, could also jeopardize Giuliani's plan to use at least $600
million from a commercial rent tax to help pay for new stadiums,
especially if Wall Street's torrent into the city coffers turns
into a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Council leaders included the tax cuts in the spending plan that
they released Thursday. That plan also seeks to retire $165 million
in debt; it restores cuts by the mayor and finances some new
programs, including recycling, library services, after-school
programs and day-care services.
</P>
<P>
   In the spending plan, the council said it could finance its
goals by cutting $112 million from various city agencies, and by
recalculating savings the city would get from reduced welfare
rolls, lower interest rates paid on its long-term debt, and other
areas. Joseph Lhota, the mayor's budget director, described these
assumptions as risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the actual budget document that they have
cobbled together, you should be asking yourselves how much spending
increases are really there, how much illusory spending decreases
are really there that will have to be painful in future years, how
much they've increased the out-year gaps to fund a feel-good
election-year budget,'' said Randy Mastro, deputy mayor for
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Mastro declined to say whether Giuliani would veto items from
the plan or veto it entirely, which he would have to do by
Wednesday. Although the council could then override his veto, the
mayor has said that he would impound city funds to spend on
programs _ which would likely move the fight from the City Charter
to the courts. The city's new fiscal year begins on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   As the city government prepared to deal for the first time with
a nonconsensus budget, some officials bemoaned that the breakdown
would ultimately hurt taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Leffler, a councilman from Queens, said: ``Passing our
own budget is a prescription for ineffectiveness. The mayor will
hold back spending in many areas, and that will deprive people of
what they want. This is not in the interest of the public.''

c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of a foreign small-cap
value stock?
</P>
<P>
   While others scramble to divine the stock market impact of, say,
a nuclear test on the Indian subcontinent, the folks who run the
Calvert World Values International Equity fund spend much of their
time on a broader question. Is the nuclear testing right or wrong?
</P>
<P>
   You may recognize the fund's parent, Calvert Group of Bethesda,
Md., known for its ``socially responsible'' domestic funds, which
shun companies that deal in tobacco, alcohol or weaponry. Calvert
World Values, however, is the only socially responsible fund
tracked by Morningstar that invests solely in foreign stocks.
(Citizens Global Equity, a global fund, invests in the United
States as well as abroad).
</P>
<P>
   The first thing investors should know is that the ethical
compass used by Calvert World Values differs from of domestic
Calvert siblings _ a difference that the company readily
acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our view of corporate social responsibility but at the
end of the day, we're running a competitive investment portfolio,''
said Jon H. Lickerman, director of social investment research for
Calvert. ``We're certainly not purists.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Calvert expects its American companies to derive
virtually none of their revenues from tobacco or alcohol. But
Calvert World Values can invest in companies that derive as much as
10 percent of their revenues from tobacco or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The fund cannot buy shares of companies that earn more than 10
percent of their revenue from weapons contracting, which is the
same restriction its parent applies in the United States. But in
America, Calvert applies extra screens, for example, knocking off
all companies that net the top 85 percent of the Defense
Department's weapons contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Lickerman attributes the differing standards to ``cultural and
social'' differences. He added that ``markets abroad tend to be
more concentrated, and we focus on blue-chip companies.'' Many
foreign companies are conglomerates with, say, a spirits distiller
as part of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   There are some absolutes. The fund will not buy shares in
companies that use child labor or forced labor. And because their
countries are on Calvert's short list of human-rights abusers, the
fund would be hard-pressed to own shares in companies based in
Burma, China or Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But American concepts like workplace equality and the rights of
workers to organize are ``aspirational,'' Lickerman said. ``We
don't really expect Japanese companies to have equal employment
opportunities for women, but we seek to find them.''
</P>
<P>
   How does the fund work? The portfolio is managed by Andrew V.
Preston, director of Murray Johnstone International, based in
Glasgow, Scotland. Preston starts with a top-down approach,
searching for markets that are relatively undervalued. Then, he and
seven Murray Johnstone analysts search for stocks with good
earnings-growth potential and reasonable valuations.
</P>
<P>
   After Preston has selected a list of likely stocks, he goes
through the social criteria prepared by Calvert and tosses out
those that don't make the grade. (Calvert won't say how many.)
</P>
<P>
   When the fund decided that Germany was looking attractive, it
zeroed in on Daimler-Benz. That automaker did not fit its social
criteria _ Calvert won't say why _ so the fund bought Volkswagen
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes it's frustrating, but it's also challenging to find
companies that fit both criteria,'' Preston said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in July 1992, Calvert World has returned
10.8 percent, annualized, compared with 11.5 percent for the
average foreign stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the
financial publisher in Chicago. But through May 29, its three-year
average annualized total return was 14 percent, versus 12.5 percent
for its average peer fund. For the 12-month period, it returned
15.2 percent, versus 13.8 for its average peer.
</P>
<P>
   As for the fund's biggest current holdings, there are a lot of
staid financial firms: Zurich Insurance of Switzerland, Banque
National de Paris and Fortis, a Belgian insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Preston's favorite market is Britain, at 19 percent
of the fund; followed by France, 14 percent, and Japan, 11 percent.
The fund does not put its money to work in markets that might seem
to need it most. Just 10 percent of the fund is in emerging
markets. And it has not decided whether to avoid India or Pakistan
because of the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Lickerman has become something of a globe-trotting shareholder
activist. ``We visit with senior management, address our social and
environmental concerns and nudge them forward,'' he said. One
example is First Group, a British bus company that he helped push
into using more compressed natural gas to minimize greenhouse
gases.

JURY TO HEAR OF OFFICER'S ALLEGED PRIOR BRUTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By   BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan ruled Thursday that a
jury may be told of allegations of an earlier incident of police
brutality by Francis Livoti. The former police officer is charged
with violating the civil rights of Anthony Baez, a Bronx man who
died after he was choked during a 1994 arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had wanted to use the earlier incident, as well as a
third such incident, on which the judge has not yet ruled, ``to
show that Livoti's assault on Anthony Baez was intentional and
knowing, and not a mistake or an accident,'' wrote Mark Pomerantz,
chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's office, in
court papers filed in April.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier incident, Livoti was accused of slapping and
choking a Bronx teen-ager named Steven Resto in 1993. Livoti was
later convicted in that assault, and sentenced to 7 1/2 months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision to allow prosecutors to use
the Resto incident in Livoti's civil-rights trial is a setback for
the defense of the former police officer, who was dismissed from
the force last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Livoti was acquitted on state charges in connection
with Baez's death in a trial in which a judge said that he would
not allow allegations of other cases of misconduct to be introduced
at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Scheindlin set a hearing for Tuesday to consider the third
incident prosecutors are seeking to use at trial. According to the
government's account in court papers, Livoti was in the process of
arresting one man, Manuel Bordoy, in 1990 by twisting his arm
behind his back, when a second man, Ivan Cruz, approached and told
Livoti that he was being unnecessarily rough. The two men were
returning home to the Bronx from a nightclub in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Livoti then punched Bordoy in the face twice, breaking his jaw
in three places, the prosecutors said. They said that Cruz was
charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, but those
charges were dismissed. Bordoy was also charged with resisting
arrest, but was acquitted following a trial, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Livoti's lawyer, Stuart London, declined comment Thursday night
on Judge Scheindlin's ruling, but had objected earlier in court to
the government's attempt to introduce the 1990 and 1993 incidents.
London had argued that they could prejudice the jury as it weighed
the evidence against Livoti in Baez's death, the only incident for
which he has been charged with a federal violation of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have also told the judge that ``there are numerous
other incidents in which Livoti was alleged to have used excessive
force in connection with his work as a police officer,'' and that
they may seek to use them at trial if Livoti testifies in his own
defense.
</P>
<P>
   London said Thursday night that his client, who has pleaded not
guilty in the civil rights case, denies using any excessive force
in any of the incidents raised by the government. If convicted,
Livoti faces up to 10 years in prison.

YANKS WIN; JETER TO BE OUT FOR TWO WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A third of the 162-season is complete, and the New
York Yankees are on a pace to win 123 games after beating Tampa
Bay, 6-1, at Yankee Stadium Thursday night. But the Yankees will
have to play at least the next two weeks without star shortstop
Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, perhaps the Yankees' best player in the first two months
of the season, was placed on the 15-day disabled list Thursday with
a strained abdominal muscle, an injury he sustained while taking a
swing in Wednesday night's game. In his absence Thursday night, the
Yankees (41-13) pummeled the Devil Rays' Dennis Springer, who has
nine losses since April 7 _ the same number the Yankees' entire
team has in the same period. Hideki Irabu allowed only six hits and
one run in 7 1/3 innings, and Bernie Williams had three hits and
two runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is hitting .325 with eight home runs and 34 RBI. He has
scored 52 runs, the most of any player in the major leagues, and
before his injury he ranked eighth in the American League in
batting average, second in hits, seventh in multihit games, seventh
in stolen bases. Many in the game believe that if the season were
to end today, Jeter could be the American League's most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   He would prefer to try playing through his injury, but moments
before the Yankees announced that Jeter would be placed on the
disabled list, he said he understood their reasoning. ``I would be
stupid to go out there and make it worse,'' said Jeter, who said
this was the first time an injury had prevented him from playing
baseball. ``It would be stupid to ask me, because I'd want to go
out and play. They don't want this to last the rest of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, 23, swung and missed in the fifth inning of Wednesday's
game and immediately stiffened with pain. Jeter tried some practice
swings, pronounced himself fit and continued his at-bat, grounding
out. But after trying some throws before the next half-inning,
Jeter walked off, replaced by Luis Sojo, and was found to have a
mild abdominal strain. Torre said he expected Jeter to be ready by
the end of the 15 days on the disabled list, but noted the
sometimes indefinable nature of abdominal strains. Sometimes an
abdominal injury heals quickly, sometimes it lingers, and this
early in the season, the Yankees want to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to play with the kid's future,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo, who after Thursday night's 0-for-4 is batting .174 in
limited action, will start in Jeter's place, with Scott Brosius
moving from the bottom of the order to fill the No. 2 slot where
Jeter has batted all season. The Yankees are somewhat vulnerable,
however, because their Class AAA shortstop, Gabby Martinez, is out
of action because of personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lessening the blow, however, is the fact that the Yankees are in
a stretch of games against truly bad teams. They beat the hapless
Chicago White Sox on Monday and Tuesday, play host to the
dismantled Florida Marlins in a three-game interleague series
beginning Friday night and then travel to Montreal for a three-game
series next week.
</P>
<P>
   And they completed a two-game wipeout of Tampa Bay Thursday
night. Orlando Hernandez mesmerized the Devil Rays on Wednesday,
and Irabu (5-1) overpowered them Thursday night, striking out six.
He struck out the side in the fourth, whiffing Fred McGriff, Paul
Sorrento and Bobby Smith in order. Graeme Lloyd finished the last
inning and two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees jumped on Springer early, effectively deciding the
outcome in the first three innings. Springer walked Tino Martinez
to open the Yankees' second inning before Williams hit the first of
his three singles. Darryl Strawberry then blooped a hit over
shortstop, and when the ball skipped past left fielder Dwight Winn,
Martinez scored. Williams scored later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was named the AL player of the month for May,
slapped a two-run single in the third inning, giving the Yankees a
4-1 advantage; Williams has 26 RBI in his last 23 games. Paul
O'Neill capped the Yankees' scoring in the seventh with a solo home
run.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees continue to play on the fringes of history: The
best 54-game start in club history was achieved by the 1939
Yankees, who were 43-11. They lead second-place Boston by 10 games
in the loss column in the AL East; Baltimore, in fourth place, is
15{ games behind. The Yankees could win just half of their
remaining 108 games and finish with a 95-67 record, and that, in
itself, probably would be good enough to qualify for the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees traded pitcher Willie Banks to the Arizona
Diamondbacks for a right-handed reliever, Scott Brow, and a minor
league pitcher, Joe Lisio. Brow, 29, flew across country and was
activated for Thursday night's game to replace Derek Jeter on the
roster. Brow, 29, had a 7.17 earned run average in 17 appearances
for the Diamondbacks. Banks, 29, went 1-1 with a 10.05 ERA in nine
appearances this season before being designated for assignment last
week. Lisio is being assigned to Class AA.

Hampton, 
Astros get 
a lesson
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ashby dominant &QL; 
in Padres' 5-1 win
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ Mike Hampton's command abandoned him on day when Andy
Ashby happened to be conducting a seminar on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, that summed up the Astros' 5-1 loss to the San
Diego Padres on Thursday at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby lectured the Astros' bats with an assortment of pitches
that ranked among the best they had seen all season. The
righthander sprinkled eight hits over nine innings to notch his
third consecutive complete game and his fourth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou's homer leading off the ninth inning spoiled Ashby's
shutout bid, but that was about the only mistake the hot-handed
pitcher made all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashby had everything working,'' said Dave Clark, who started
in right field and was 0-for-4 with three strikeouts. ``It seemed
like everything he threw was a strike. He just messed everyone up.
He was on top of it, and he pitched a hell of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times this season, Hampton was at the other
end of the spectrum _ although he still managed to keep the Astros
close. Hampton held the Padres to five hits in 6 innings, but he
walked five batters.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the walks led to runs, but they proved to be meaningless.
Ashby got all the run support he needed in the first inning when
Greg Vaughn hit a two-run homer to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Asbhy credit,'' Hampton said. ``That home run
in the first was plenty for him. I just didn't have anything. I
didn't have a fastball, a curveball, a changeup or a cutter. I went
six-plus innings with absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some good movement on some of my pitches, but it was a
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating. Good pitchers have to be able to win even
when they don't have their best stuff. I didn't have much, and I
just wasn't able to get the job done. I walked a lot of guys, but
some of the walks were situational. I had good enough control to
throw strikes; I just didn't want to give in to the hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss cut the Astros' National League Central Division lead
over the idle Chicago Cubs to one game and left them with a 3-3
record on the six-game road trip to Colorado and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros open a three-game homestand against Kansas City
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to have won today, but 3-3 is all right,''
manager Larry Dierker said. ``After losing those last two at
Colorado, it was good to see us come here and get a couple of wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sweep would have been nice, but it just wasn't meant to be.
Ashby was tough. He's not a guy you want to face right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros missed Padres ace Kevin Brown, but they couldn't
dodge the hottest pitcher in San Diego's rotation. Ashby, who had
eight strikeouts Thursday, is 2-1 with a 1.73 ERA in his last three
starts.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Alou's 12th homer, the Astros didn't get a
runner into scoring position after the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caught him when he's hot,'' Tim Bogar, who started at
second base for the Astros, said of Ashby. ``I don't think I saw
any pitches that were straight all day. He was really moving the
ball around on us. He's one of the overlooked guys in the league,
but when he's on, he's hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamp battled and kept us in the game, but Ashby just had the
better hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros got off to an inauspicious start when Quilvio Veras
led off first with what appeared to be a bloop single. Center
fielder Carl Everett charged the ball and nearly made the play, but
it got past him and Veras was credited with a double.
</P>
<P>
   That all but assured Hampton (7-3) would have to face Vaughn,
one of the hottest hitters in the majors, with a runner in scoring
position. Vaughn's homer was his third in the series and his fifth
against the Astros in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vaughn hit a pretty decent pitch,'' Hampton said. ``It was a
changeup down and away, and he just went and got it. When you're
hot like he is right now, you hit everything. I didn't think he'd
be looking for an off-speed pitch, but I guess he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton retired eight batters in a row after Vaughn's homer and
faced 13 batters before he allowed another hit. Veras broke through
with a single in the fifth to score Andy Sheets, who had drawn a
leadoff walk. The Padres added two runs in the seventh on a squeeze
bunt by Ashby (7-4) and a sacrifice fly by Veras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamp didn't have his good stuff, and every pitcher is going to
have games like that,'' said catcher Brad Ausmus, who caught Ashby
when he played for the Padres. ``Andy was on his game. He's added a
split-finger pitch, which he hasn't thrown before, and it's just
made him that much more effective. He pretty much shut us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres pitching coach Dave Stewart said of Ashby: ``His sinker
is so devastating that from time to time I don't know the sinker
from the forkball, to be honest. He was nasty today.''

   Real Quiet takes on Belmont mystique
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ELMONT, N.Y. _ The nagging question Thursday _ no pun intended _
was this: If Real Quiet is in a class of his own, why are a dozen
colts so eager to challenge him in the Belmont Stakes?
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate matchup, of course, was assured once this dark bay
emerged from the bargain basement to win the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness. The bigger race is Real Quiet against the years, and
against the world.
</P>
<P>
   When Affirmed held off Alydar to win the Triple Crown 20 years
ago, the last time it was done, only four colts bothered to run
against them in the Belmont. The size of Saturday's field speaks to
the history of this event and the delayed judgment on Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed against the Bob Baffert entry is Victory Gallop, the
best of the dirty dozen, and an outbreak of human nature. Of the 11
horses who made the sweep, six led from wire to wire, and their
names have the sound of trumpets. Secretariat and Count Fleet ran
virtually alone. The others who won from start to finish were War
Admiral, Seattle Slew and Affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   This is a schizoid time for racing fans, who crave another
Triple Crown winner to uplift the sport, but worry the newest
contender might be unworthy of such elite company. The naysayers
rate Real Quiet as a good horse, getting better, in a less than
vintage year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Belmont is often a cure for skepticism. This is where
champions come to get their tickets punched, and their names
immortalized. As Baffert points out, it isn't Real Quiet's fault so
many promising rivals met with misfortune, like characters in a
script by Agatha Christie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't help it if others fell by the wayside,'' Baffert
said. ``It's a survival of the toughest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont has a mystique all its own. To begin with, the
racetrack is an hour by train from the sidewalks of New York, which
means that if you can make it here you can make it anywhere. The
Long Island area drips with history. The nearby Roosevelt Field,
now a shopping center, is built on property that once included the
300-foot, dirt runway used by Amelia Earhart. She is referred to
locally as the last woman to leave Roosevelt Field without buying
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, it is the unsparing physical demands of the Belmont
that offers Real Quiet his passport to greatness. At a mile and
half, the race is a throwback to another America, when the Pony
Express delivered the mail and the premium was on endurance, not
speed. You might conclude the postal priorities haven't changed
much, but this is certain: horses that win the Belmont are not
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a knock-the-favorite clique,'' says Mrs. Penny
Chenery, who owned the incomparable Secretariat. ``My horse had
people who were pulling against him. But when he entered the
paddock, I remember the crowd gave him an ovation, and he loved the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then people began to come up to wish me luck. There were so
many well-wishers, I feared I would miss the race. I had to push my
way through them. I said, `Out of my way, please, I have to see
this race.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was 25 years ago. Secretariat, with Ron Turcotte in the
saddle, was expected to be threatened by Sham, a terrific colt
ridden by Lafitte Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the outside,'' Pincay recalls, ``and we were even at
the pole. But that was the end of it. My horse wasn't willing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who saw or heard the race still get goose bumps listening
to Dave Johnson call the finish: ``An unbelievable, amazing
performance Secretariat is going to win by 25 lengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, by measuring the film, the final margin was put at 31
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   The Triple Crown and more than $5 million in bonus purses await
a victory by Real Quiet on Saturday. But whether the pace is fast
or slow, this will be the Belmont's anniversary waltz. Fifty years
after Citation's stunning victory, 25 for Secretariat and 20 for
Affirmed. Since 1984, no Belmont winner has won it wire to wire,
and none has come from more than four lengths back in the final
half-mile.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Touch Gold trailed with a furlong to go, and roared
past Silver Charm at the finish, denying Bob Baffert a Triple
Crown. He is the first trainer in this century to win the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness in back-to-back years, and he believes the
Belmont owes him one. He is 0-for-7 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has walked past a stable will tell you horses have a
personality, even an attitude. After Secretariat's triple, Mrs.
Chenery, then known as Penny Tweedy, commissioned the artist LeRoy
Neiman to paint a mural of Big Red.
</P>
<P>
   A friend walked in while he was standing in front of his
unfinished work, hands resting on his hips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is missing,'' Neiman said.
</P>
<P>
   From behind him, the friend started to speak. Sensing the
moment, the artist said, curtly: ``I am not open to suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he stepped forward, with one stroke added a white line
across the canvas _ the rail _ and the painting came alive.
</P>
<P>
   Advice is plentiful at the track, but the great ones, horses or
jockeys or trainers, go their own way.

<P>
   GLEN SPEY, N.Y. _ In this tiny hamlet where about a quarter of
the residents are elderly Ukrainians, the few people who knew
Dmytro Sawczuk were more sympathetic then alarmed about the news
that the federal government had moved to revoke his citizenship
because he apparently lied about his Nazi past when he immigrated
to this country 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sawczuk, now 73, said he had been a sawmill worker in Germany
and a farmer in his native Poland, in an area of the country
divided between the Russians and Germans during World War II. But
according to the Justice Department's office of special
investigation, which handles cases of suspected war criminals and
collaborators, Sawczuk had been a guard at a succession of Nazi
labor and death camps from 1943 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors, however, would not condemn what he may have done
in the war. ``It was no picnic,'' said Councilman Peter Melnyk,
also an emigre from the sliver of Poland that is now part of
Ukraine. ``The Germans came. The Russians came. There was no
guidance to tell anyone what's good and what's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the conscription of Sawczuk and others, Melnyk holds them
blameless. ``They took anybody, even 14-year-old boys,'' he said,
as his wife, Natalie, laid out a lunchtime repast of white fish,
salad, black bread and babka. ``It was just a labor. They should be
looking for the people who are responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Melnyk lives on a street named for a prominent Ukrainian, in a
neighborhood where little English is heard. Down the country road
are two Ukrainian churches, one Orthodox and one Catholic, built to
mimic the folk architecture of the wooden churches in the
Carpathian Mountains. There is also a Ukrainian resort here, the
scene of an annual summer festival that draws more than 10,000
people from Ukrainian strongholds throughout the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The councilman, who once directed a Ukrainian variety show on
public-access television, said that 150 Ukrainian families live
here full time and 500 others own properties, either weekend
retreats or land they plan to use when they retire. Among the
residents of Glen Spey is the esteemed Ukrainian poet Wasyl Barka,
one of many who helped build the wooden church by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across, Ukrainians, that way, Ukrainians, all over,
Ukrainians,'' the Rev. Peter Hronsky said in broken English,
gesturing this way and that from his kitchen table, just a few
doors down from St. Volodymyr's Ukrainian Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the non-Ukrainians here know Sawczuk and even his
countrymen had only a glancing acquaintance, describing him and his
wife, Elizabeth, as reserved, private people. The postmaster,
Bernard Lehr, said he knew most of the Ukrainians in town, since
they preferred post office boxes to home delivery and came once a
day to claim their mail, often bringing him sweet treats. But
Sawczuk, although he has a box, is a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't connect the face,'' Lehr said.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Bodnaruik, the town clerk whose husband is Ukrainian,
also could not recall Sawczuk. ``If he didn't have a dog that
needed licensing and he didn't get married in town, there was no
reason to come to Town Hall, I guess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Melnyk had contact with Sawczuk at church and during election
campaigns. But he detected nothing amiss. ``Sometimes people when
you talk to them give a sign of something in their past,'' the
councilman said. ``But not here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The councilman often saw Sawczuk in town and inquired about his
failing health. Hronsky asked the same question last Sunday when
the ailing old man came for services at St. Volodymyr's. To both,
Sawczuk gave the same answer: He was going downhill, losing his
battle with cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Hronsky saw Dmytro and Elizabeth Sawczuk each Sunday at church.
Last January, during the Epiphany, the priest visited the couple to
bless their house, a modern, unadorned structure on an unpaved road
outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   During that Epiphany pastoral call, the priest learned that the
Sawczuks came from Yonkers, as he did. Mrs. Sawczuk offered to buy
Hronsky delicacies at a Ukrainian market the next time she drove
her husband there for a doctor's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Sawczuk house was dark and apparently empty. No
one responded to a knock at the door and windows to the foyer were
masked with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Retired people dominate in these parts, whether they are
native-born Americans, Ukrainians or German immigrants who settled
in an enclave known as Black Forest, for its resemblance to the
countryside of Bavaria. During the war, locals say, Black Forest
was thought to be a Nazi haven; rumor had it the area was under
federal surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The Ukrainians, like the Germans, have been attracted to the
same landscape, with forests of fir and pine and ice-cold trout
streams. Melnyk, for one, drove through on the way to New York 50
years ago, stumbled into a restaurant where the owner spoke his
language, bought a weekend place and knew he had found his
retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the nearest restaurant is a few towns away. The only
commerce is a general store and gas station and working people find
jobs only in Monticello or Middletown. In the summer, children's
camps liven things up a bit. But ask the locals what is most
interesting about Glen Spey and they will mention a state preserve
for the protection of nesting bald eagles.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 19th century and the early 20th, the area bustled
with commerce. An executive at the Singer sewing machine company
built a splendid weekend estate in 1870 and turned his 3,000 acres
into an earthly paradise, with artificial lakes, a golf course, a
church and a schoolhouse. Eventually the executive, George
McKenzie, built seven lesser estates for his relatives. One now
houses the Ukrainian resort.
</P>
<P>
   With so many residents here about Sawczuk's age, and from the
same contested part of Eastern Europe, one man wondered if Glen
Spey might not be of interest to Nazi hunters. ``I wouldn't be
surprised,'' said George Frey, a retired New Jersey transit worker,
``if there were a lot more of them around.''

CAPS BEAT SABRES FOR FIRST STANLEY CUP BERTH
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ For the first time in their 24-year history, the
Washington Capitals are going to the Stanley Cup finals. They
earned their berth Thursday night by beating the Buffalo Sabres by
3-2 in overtime to clinch the Eastern Conference finals, 4 games to
2.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Joe Juneau scored the winning goal at 6 minutes 24
seconds of overtime when he charged toward the crease and knocked a
loose puck over the goal line after Buffalo goalie Dominic Hasek
failed to cover it. The play was fashioned by Brian Bellows of the
Capitals, who stickhandled around the defense on the left side and
fired the first shot against Hasek. Hasek was sprawled in his
crease and reaching with the glove on his left hand when Juneau
knocked it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We faced the best goalie in the world,'' Juneau said of Hasek.
``It's not easy. The puck just came out and he had no chance to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals will face either Detroit or Dallas in the
championship round, which will begin Tuesday night in the arena of
the Western Conference winner. The defeat ended the brilliant
season of Dominik Hasek, the Buffalo goalie who led the Czech
Republic to the gold medal in the Olympic Games last February.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hasek and his teammates are through for the season,
Hasek is a finalist for both the Hart and Vezina trophies, given to
the league's most valuable player and its best goalie. Despite
Hasek's great efforts this season, the Capitals are also led by a
good goalie: Olaf Kolzig. Born in South Africa, raised in several
places in Canada and an international player for Germany, Kolzig
has been, consistently, the best goalie remaining through the first
three rounds of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third overtime game of the series; Washington won the
first two.
</P>
<P>
   The teams exchanged goals in the second and the third periods.
Playing in his first postseason game this spring, Paul Kruse of the
Sabres scored at 7 minutes 40 seconds of the third period to break
a 1-1 tie. After a long shot by defenseman Bob Boughner, Kruse and
his linemates charged and created congestion in front of Capitals
goalie Olaf Kolzig. The puck may have hit Kruse as it passed
through.
</P>
<P>
   Washington evened it at 2-2 at 14:01 on a power-play goal by
Peter Bondra. Geoff Sanderson was in the penalty box for
interfering with Dale Hunter of the Capitals, a call that was
bitterly protested by the Sabres and their fans. Bondra, uncovered
in front of the net, knocked the puck past Dominik Hasek as the
goalie tried to scramble back into position, from left to right.
</P>
<P>
   After playing a scoreless tie for more than 33 minutes, the
teams exchanged even-strength goals within a span of 22 seconds,
and the score stood at 1-1 going into the third period. Scoring for
Buffalo was Michael Peca, who slapped the puck past Kolzig at 13:04
after a pass from Dixon Ward. The goal finished a rush that formed
at the other end after Washington had maintained pressure for an
entire shift. The Capitals got the goal right back at 13:26 when
Esa Tikkanen, uncovered next to Hasek's crease, turned in a shot by
Mark Tinordi.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Sabres came into the game with the momentum of a 2-1 victory
in Game 5 in which they were out-played and out-shot by 35-16. The
difference in that one was Hasek, who emerged from a mini-slump to
perform brilliantly in what may have been his most important and
impressive victory since he lead the Czech Republic to a gold medal
in the Winter Olympics in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Final Four round, both East and West, has been a goalie
story. Except for Kolzig the netminding has been erratic and, in
some cases, below standard. In the West, where Detroit holds a
three-games-to-two edge over Dallas, Chris Osgood of the Wings and
Ed Belfour of the Stars have taken turns making major mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has fouled opposing forwards with his stick and has
played the puck poorly when roaming from his crease. Before and
after games, he has called Osgood ``lucky.'' Osgood probably did
not feel that way after Game 5 on Wednesday night when he gave up
the winning goal in overtime on a 90-foot shot by Jamie
Langenbrunner. Game 6 of that series will be Friday night in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, Hasek gave up a ``soft goal'' to Peter Bondra in an
overtime defeat in Game 3. After playing below his high standards
again in Game 4, he took the ice in practice wearing on his jersey
a sign that read ``Swiss Cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   He redeemed himself in Game 5 while his young teammates were
being overwhelmed. That was not the case in the first period
Thursday night. It ended scoreless, but the Sabres had played
better and had a 16-10 edge in shots. Both coaches started their
muscle lines: Chris Simon, Hunter and Craig Berube for the
Capitals; Rob Ray, Kruse and Wayne Primeau for the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   This matchup could have led to fights in the regular season. But
in this important a game, it created only a few extra hard hits and
a couple of penalties. Kruse went off for roughing at 5:06. Hunter
got the same minor at 13:56.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best saves of the period came with 11:27 left when
the Capitals had a two-on-one. Mike Eagles ended up alone in front
of Hasek. He switched to his backhand and put a shot low. Hasek
stopped it while on his knees. The crowd cheered. A sign on the
balcony rail, even with that goal line, was decorated with Hasek's
number 39 and the words: ``He's Baaack.''

ST. JOHN'S REMAINS UNDECIDED ON HIRING NEW COACH
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The search for a head basketball coach at St. John's
plodded on Thursday with the school insisting that it has not given
up hope of hiring George Washington Coach Mike Jarvis, but also
making a move to secure a backup plan.
</P>
<P>
   While St. John's officials have not made an offer or even a call
to Jarvis since meeting with him on Monday, an athletic department
official said Thursday that school lawyers were still hopeful that
a deal could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   While Jarvis may be the most qualified candidate, he is not the
only one under consideration. The official said that one of the
three other coaches who were interviewed last week will be brought
in for a second interview.
</P>
<P>
   School officials would not confirm which of the three among
Siena's Paul Hewitt, Davidson's Bob McKillop and St. Bonaventure's
Jim Baron would be invited back, but according to one Division I
coach, it was believed to be Hewitt. Hewitt posted a 17-12 record
in his first season as a head coach after five seasons as an
assistant at Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marks four weeks since St. John's informed Fran
Fraschilla of its intention to dismiss him, and the school has yet
to make an offer to anyone. Despite speculation that Jarvis, who
met with Athletic Director Ed Manetta, the executive vice
president, Robert Crimmins, and the university president, the Rev.
Donald Harrington, would be the next coach, Jarvis' lawyer, Robert
Ades, said Thursday that there has been no word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has said that he would take the job if the conditions
were right,'' Ades said. ``But he can't take the job unless it is
offered. If they made an offer that was serious, he would consider
it. But there has been no offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis would command more money than any of the other
candidates, but he also has the best credentials, including four
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament appearances in
eight seasons at George Washington, more than the other coaches
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis earned $600,000 last year and still has four years left
on his contract. His salary demands would be in the range of
$800,000 per year, although Ades insisted that numbers were never
discussed with St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person familiar with the situation, St. John's
believes it could bring in any of the other three coaches for
between $300,000 and $350,000 per year, less than it was paying
Fraschilla, who earned $450,000.

   LAS VEGAS _ How to tell the genuine from the fake in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   The Michelangelo David at the front entrance of Caesar's Palace
attracts hordes every day, but is faux. So do the white tigers in
the lobby of the Mirage next door and they, to be sure, are real.
</P>
<P>
   And so, by the way, are the seven Picassos hanging in the same
hotel's top restaurant, Melange. Tap one with your butter knife and
watch how fast the security goons rush in.
</P>
<P>
   Take seriously also the giant hoardings that went up last week
outside the still unfinished Bellagio Hotel. While other properties
along the Strip boast a predictable roster of entertainers past
their sell-by dates _ Paul Anka, David Cassidy and Wayne Newton _
the Bellagio trumpets: ``Coming soon, Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir and
Cezanne.''
</P>
<P>
   A second sign tantalizes: ``Special Guests, Pablo Picasso and
Henri Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   The word is out, and it may make you shudder. Las Vegas, the
world capital of temptation and tat, is branching out.
</P>
<P>
   To the familiar sinner's brew of roulette, one-armed bandits and
fast-as-you-like wedding ceremonies, add a new, altogether
unexpected ingredient: fine art and never-before-seen antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens in October, the Bellagio, conceived by Steve Wynn,
the American gaming tycoon and owner of the Mirage, will be more
than just the latest word in architectural excess, though it has
enough of that.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to evoke the villas of northern Italy, it has its own
mini-Lake Como lapping the Strip, quivering cypress trees and 1,100
tinkling fountains.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be crammed, however, with a collection of
Impressionist and contemporary art to rival the world's leading
galleries. It is already being dubbed the ``Louvre of Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the screamingly brash Rio All-Suites and Casino,
just off the Strip, will open its doors to the largest exhibition
of Romanov Dynasty treasures ever to leave the Peterhof
Reserve-Museum in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, Wedgewood dinner services, a Faberge egg and the
throne of Peter the Great will be among more than 1,000 pieces
displayed in a series of rooms being built in the Casino to
recreate, down to the last detail, the salons and galleries of the
Peterhof itself.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-to-imagine joining of hands between the Rio and the
Peterhof was marked Sunday by an equally unlikely ceremony in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after purchasing a rare Romanov snuffbox at auction
in New York for $74,000, the president of the Rio Casino, David
Hanlon, Sunday morning delivered it to Dr. Vadim Znamenov, the
Peterhof's general director, as a gift. ``To the Peterhof with
love: Sin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Other casinos in Vegas are also dipping into serious art. The
MGM Grand, while coy about its plans, is expected to decorate its
soon-to-be-built ``MGM Mansion'' with world-class paintings.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, is likely to rival Wynn, who has surfaced as
the most important art buyer in the world. He personally, and the
Mirage company he heads, have spent almost $300 million on art in
just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Among his acquisitions, some of which now decorate the Mirage
awaiting the completion of Bellagio, is Edgar Degas's `Dancer
Taking her Bow' (bought for $12 million), Picasso's `Seated Woman'
($1.65 million) and Alberto Giacometti's `Pointing Man' ($7.35
million).
</P>
<P>
   In March, he paid $50 million for seven contemporary pieces by
artists such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and
Cy Twombly.
</P>
<P>
   David Nash, a former Sotheby's auctioneer and now a leading
dealer in New York, sees in Steve Wynn the same appetites displayed
by very wealthy men before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the grand tradition of American industrialists such as
Frick and Mellon and Barnes, who have made large sums of money and
bought prodigious collections to show off,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has greeted Wynn's spree with such equanimity. Nash
concedes that it has ``most certainly driven up the price among
top-of-the-line pictures.'' Other collectors are being squeezed
out, as well as galleries and museums hungry for masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the company's shareholders began to get restless
earlier this year, Wynn sold some of his shares in Mirage and began
to buy on his own account. He will lease back the pictures he has
bought to the Bellagio for display.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question: can vulgar Vegas appreciate what
it is getting? Even to ask it raises the hackles of Alan Feldman, a
spokesman for Wynn, who instantly detects elitism and snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the general public may not immediately recognize a Monet
from a Manet, but they are as moved and touched by the paintings as
anybody. They can't put those feelings into words in the way a
professor can, but they still feel. It's amazing to me how the
cognoscenti, as it were, dismiss that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Cagley, who is heading the design team recreating the
Peterhof at the Rio, believes he sees, meanwhile, a broad maturing
both of the city and of the punters coming to play in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the customer has become more educated and more
sophisticated and I think Las Vegas has as well,'' he said.
Clearly, attracting new and, hopefully, wealthier clients, is part
of what both the Rio and Mirage are after.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, though, only a tiny fraction of the punters will
notice the new rarification of the desert air.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, a waiter at Melange, calculates that the Picassos inside
go completely unnoticed by about half of the diners who come in.
And usually he does not disturb their ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is. When a gentleman comes in with a lady, he
doesn't want to hear about Picasso.'' Show a ``Seated Woman'' to
folk in Las Vegas, he seems to be saying, and how many will know
whether it is real or fake? And, more to the point, how many will
care? &QL;

ELWAY RESPECTS HIS ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The other shoe is dropping on professional
athletes, whose collective image has become so scuffed, sneaker
industry executives are discarding them like, well, old, smelly
shoes. The marked drop-off in the number of superstars pitching
sneakers is no mystery to the sports-marketing executive at one
shoe company who recently told Sports Illustrated, ``Kids aren't
inspired by athletes anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably just as well, given how many of today's
well-heeled sportsmen trample all over propriety. But all decency
is not lost. John Elway has spent the past two decades proving it's
possible to nimbly sidestep the cracks in the gold-paved road that
swallow up many a superstar athlete.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the Denver Broncos quarterback retraced his
footsteps all the way back to his beginnings. The football field at
Granada Hills High, where Elway engineered the first of his fabled
comebacks, was renamed John Elway Stadium in a ceremony that
celebrated the goodwill and goodness of the greatest athlete the
school has produced.
</P>
<P>
   The assemblage that honored the future Hall of Famer included
teachers who knew Elway when he was a football and baseball prodigy
for the Highlanders in the late 1970s, teammates who were sure
Elway would forget them once fame and fortune found him, and an
entire student body that wasn't yet born (or was barely so) when
Elway matriculated with honors in 1979 and moved on to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   In the time it has taken the Granada Hills High Class of 1998 to
go from diapers to diplomas, Elway has finished second in the
Heisman Trophy balloting, to Herschel Walker in 1982, earned an
undergraduate degree in economics, played for the New York Yankees'
Single-A team, been named to six Pro Bowls, played in four Super
Bowls and engineered 45 come-from-behind game-winning drives. The
most recent of those drives, in January, produced his first Super
Bowl win, over the defending champion Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   He married his college sweetheart, fathered four children and
became the favorite son of an entire football-crazed state. But he
remained grounded even as his profile soared. A regular at the
Highlanders' annual alumni baseball game, Elway also has kept in
close touch with the friends he had made while playing prep
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so lucky,'' Elway said, reflecting on his adolescence.
``I had a great high school experience. The friendships I made,
it's very important for me to still have those relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling apparently was mutual for some 50 former teammates
who honored Elway with their presence Thursday. He firmly
demonstrated where his priorities stood, turning down David
Letterman, who wanted him to do a stand-up spot after the ceremony
for Letterman's late-night telecast, so he could spend the time
catching up with his longtime friends before catching a flight back
to Denver with his pint-sized sidekick, his 8-year-old son Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are the guys I started with,'' Elway said at one
point in his dedication address, pointing in the direction where
his former teammates were seated, ``and I'll never forget you.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway was the seventh speaker _ fitting since that's his jersey
number _ and he delivered the verbal equivalent of a long touchdown
spiral, his inspirational message connecting with most of his
audience. Sadly, there was a section of students in the bleachers
to his right who seemed far more interested in hearing themselves
talk than Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Those with the good manners _ and good sense _ to listen were
treated to Elway's prescription for success: Be humble; seize every
opportunity; persevere and identify what it is you do best and do
it to the best of your abilities.
</P>
<P>
   A more eloquent earful no senior can hope to get from any
commencement speaker this or any spring.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's net worth extends into nine figures, but money isn't
what makes this man. Someone driven by the bottom line would have
no reason to place the occasional long-distance call of
encouragement to football players at his old high school, always on
his own dime and time.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't think of making a long day longer by showing up
early to the gymnasium on the day he was being honored to address a
group of football players with whom he shares only a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Someone driven by the bottom line wouldn't dream of standing in
a stuffy gymnasium at 9 in the morning, sleep still in his eyes,
patiently and pleasantly signing every last autograph and posing
for every last picture, obliging many of the faculty members who
had just gotten through telling their students not to pester him
for autographs or pictures.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't have people walking away from him, saying, ``He
hasn't changed a bit'' and meaning it as the highest form of
praise.
</P>
<P>
   And someone driven by the bottom line certainly wouldn't hold
the admiration of two sophomores who are vying to be the next in a
long line of storied Highlanders quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Elway has succeeded in life,'' said Eddie Whitaker. ``He's
a role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Jason Winn, ``We look up to him because he got good
grades, got his degree from Stanford and is the perfect
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, looking at himself through the same lens in which all his
teen-age insecurities once were filtered, doesn't think much has
changed in 20 years, except for his hairline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking out with the same eyes as when I was at Granada
Hills High School,'' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   Of all Elway's achievements, that might be his greatest.

   LAS VEGAS _ How to tell the genuine from the fake in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   The Michelangelo David at the front entrance of Caesar's Palace
attracts hordes every day, but is faux. So do the white tigers in
the lobby of the Mirage next door and they, to be sure, are real.
</P>
<P>
   And so, by the way, are the seven Picassos hanging in the same
hotel's top restaurant, Melange. Tap one with your butter knife and
watch how fast the security goons rush in.
</P>
<P>
   Take seriously also the giant hoardings that went up last week
outside the still unfinished Bellagio Hotel. While other properties
along the Strip boast a predictable roster of entertainers past
their sell-by dates _ Paul Anka, David Cassidy and Wayne Newton _
the Bellagio trumpets: ``Coming soon, Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir and
Cezanne.''
</P>
<P>
   A second sign tantalizes: ``Special Guests, Pablo Picasso and
Henri Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   The word is out, and it may make you shudder. Las Vegas, the
world capital of temptation and tat, is branching out.
</P>
<P>
   To the familiar sinner's brew of roulette, one-armed bandits and
fast-as-you-like wedding ceremonies, add a new, altogether
unexpected ingredient: fine art and never-before-seen antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens in October, the Bellagio, conceived by Steve Wynn,
the American gaming tycoon and owner of the Mirage, will be more
than just the latest word in architectural excess, though it has
enough of that.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to evoke the villas of northern Italy, it has its own
mini-Lake Como lapping the Strip, quivering cypress trees and 1,100
tinkling fountains.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be crammed, however, with a collection of
Impressionist and contemporary art to rival the world's leading
galleries. It is already being dubbed the ``Louvre of Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the screamingly brash Rio All-Suites and Casino,
just off the Strip, will open its doors to the largest exhibition
of Romanov Dynasty treasures ever to leave the Peterhof
Reserve-Museum in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, Wedgewood dinner services, a Faberge egg and the
throne of Peter the Great will be among more than 1,000 pieces
displayed in a series of rooms being built in the Casino to
recreate, down to the last detail, the salons and galleries of the
Peterhof itself.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-to-imagine joining of hands between the Rio and the
Peterhof was marked Sunday by an equally unlikely ceremony in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after purchasing a rare Romanov snuffbox at auction
in New York for $74,000, the president of the Rio Casino, David
Hanlon, Sunday morning delivered it to Dr. Vadim Znamenov, the
Peterhof's general director, as a gift. ``To the Peterhof with
love: Sin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Other casinos in Vegas are also dipping into serious art. The
MGM Grand, while coy about its plans, is expected to decorate its
soon-to-be-built ``MGM Mansion'' with world-class paintings.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, is likely to rival Wynn, who has surfaced as
the most important art buyer in the world. He personally, and the
Mirage company he heads, have spent almost $300 million on art in
just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Among his acquisitions, some of which now decorate the Mirage
awaiting the completion of Bellagio, is Edgar Degas's `Dancer
Taking her Bow' (bought for $12 million), Picasso's `Seated Woman'
($1.65 million) and Alberto Giacometti's `Pointing Man' ($7.35
million).
</P>
<P>
   In March, he paid $50 million for seven contemporary pieces by
artists such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and
Cy Twombly.
</P>
<P>
   David Nash, a former Sotheby's auctioneer and now a leading
dealer in New York, sees in Steve Wynn the same appetites displayed
by very wealthy men before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the grand tradition of American industrialists such as
Frick and Mellon and Barnes, who have made large sums of money and
bought prodigious collections to show off,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has greeted Wynn's spree with such equanimity. Nash
concedes that it has ``most certainly driven up the price among
top-of-the-line pictures.'' Other collectors are being squeezed
out, as well as galleries and museums hungry for masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the company's shareholders began to get restless
earlier this year, Wynn sold some of his shares in Mirage and began
to buy on his own account. He will lease back the pictures he has
bought to the Bellagio for display.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question: can vulgar Vegas appreciate what
it is getting? Even to ask it raises the hackles of Alan Feldman, a
spokesman for Wynn, who instantly detects elitism and snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the general public may not immediately recognize a Monet
from a Manet, but they are as moved and touched by the paintings as
anybody. They can't put those feelings into words in the way a
professor can, but they still feel. It's amazing to me how the
cognoscenti, as it were, dismiss that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Cagley, who is heading the design team recreating the
Peterhof at the Rio, believes he sees, meanwhile, a broad maturing
both of the city and of the punters coming to play in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the customer has become more educated and more
sophisticated and I think Las Vegas has as well,'' he said.
Clearly, attracting new and, hopefully, wealthier clients, is part
of what both the Rio and Mirage are after.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, though, only a tiny fraction of the punters will
notice the new rarification of the desert air.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, a waiter at Melange, calculates that the Picassos inside
go completely unnoticed by about half of the diners who come in.
And usually he does not disturb their ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is. When a gentleman comes in with a lady, he
doesn't want to hear about Picasso.'' Show a ``Seated Woman'' to
folk in Las Vegas, he seems to be saying, and how many will know
whether it is real or fake? And, more to the point, how many will
care? &QL;

TWO TAXI COMMISSIONERS SIDE WITH DRIVERS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By   ANDY NEWMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deepening the dissension at the Taxi and Limousine
Commission over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's strict new taxi rules, two
commission members filed affidavits Thursday supporting a suit by
fleet owners against the commission and the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The suit itself challenges only a rule authorizing liveries to
pick up street fares during taxi strikes. The commissioners,
Alberto Torres and Elias Arout, swore that the rule they approved _
at a May 13 meeting that itself may have been in violation of the
state's open-meeting law _ was far narrower than the one the city
says was approved.
</P>
<P>
   But the affidavits by sitting commissioners against their own
agency add considerably to the disarray surrounding the mayor's
attempts to win approval for his 17-point package of new safety
rules, two of which have yet to be voted on. And the commissioners'
statements parallel comments they have made questioning the
legality of another closed-door commission meeting, held just
before the vote on the bulk of the mayor's rules.
</P>
<P>
   This week, more than half of the eight commission members said
they were having second thoughts about one rule they approved,
making it much easier to suspend cabbies' licenses. These comments
may be significant, because five votes are needed to pass, amend or
rescind any rules. The commissioners have not yet voted on rules
lowering the threshold for license suspensions and requiring all
yellow cab owners to post a $100,000 insurance bond.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavits and the lawsuit take issue with a rule that was
enacted the day the city's cabbies stayed home to protest the
mayor's proposals. The rule allows the taxi commission to authorize
car services and commuter vans to pick up passengers who hail them
in the street during work stoppages by yellow cabs.
</P>
<P>
   The group filing the suits, the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of
Trade, represents the owners of 2,000 yellow cabs. The group says
that actions by the taxi commission and the Giuliani administration
have been rife with secrecy and impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the group's lawyers say, the May 13 meeting,
which was never announced publicly, was in violation of the
open-meetings law, which requires that all meetings of public
bodies be announced as far in advance as practical and made open to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, Arout and Torres said in their affidavits, the
rule approved by the commission allows liveries only to take people
to and from the airports, and only on the day of the meeting. Two
other commissioners have given similar accounts of what took place
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to verify what actually took place. The city
said in court papers filed Thursday that there were no minutes
taken at the meeting, which is also in conflict with the
open-meetings act. The livery cab rule itself was not drafted until
the day after the meeting. And the commission would not say
Thursday which members had voted for the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be inappropriate for me to comment on matters subject
to litigation,'' said the commission's spokesman, Allan Fromberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, in a way,'' said the fleet group's lawyer, David
Ross. ``There's nothing in writing, there's no record. You tell me,
is that valid government? How are you going to know that what is
later written down is accurate?''
</P>
<P>
   Arout said Thursday that he never would have voted for a law
allowing liveries to compete with medallion cabs. While he said he
sympathized with the complaints from both the yellow-cab and livery
industries about the onerousness of the mayor's rules, he said he
filed his affidavit simply to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to do a job,'' he said. ``Don't do things behind our
backs like that. It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres has said he voiced doubts to the commission's lawyer,
Matthew Daus, as to whether the meeting and the vote were legal,
but that Daus assured him they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I relied upon counsel to advise me,'' Torres said on Monday.
``He better know.'' Calls to Daus' office were referred to
Fromberg, the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Russianoff, senior attorney for the New York Public
Interest Research Group, said that it was highly unusual for
members of government agencies to file affidavits challenging their
own rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to express an opinion,'' he said. ``It's
another to sign a notarized affidavit that you and your colleagues
broke the law. This has real legal consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It will be noticed at City Hall. They keep a list,
and it gets entered on the you-did-something-we-didn't-like list.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said that taken together with an hourlong closed-door
meeting on May 28 just before the panel approved 15 of the 17
points of Giuliani's plan, the commission's behavior represented a
disturbing pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on accounts made known to me,'' he said, ``there seems
to be minimal consciousness of the requirements of the
open-meetings law at the TLC &UR; . &LR;  How deep does the hole get?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They call them the Righteous Brothers. James
Dobson, Gary Bauer and John Ashcroft are the vanguard of a new
conservative Christian movement that is marching on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After some years in the political wilderness, America's
religious right is back.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives feel that the Republican Party has taken
them for granted, led them down the garden path and given nothing
back in return.
</P>
<P>
   They want an end to abortion, gay rights and gun control, and
their demands are causing uproar in the party as America gears up
for elections.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Britain's Labour Party of the early 1980s crossed with
the schisms of the early Church, and you're close.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson, 62, is a broadcaster based in Colorado Springs, Colo.
Bauer, 51, a former Reagan Administration official, heads the
Family Research Council. Ashcroft, 56, is a senator from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   They are the heirs to a tradition of religious conservatism in
America that helped keep Ronald Reagan in office for eight years.
But they feel that the party _ Reagan included _ scorned them,
refusing to adopt their key demands, and that the Republican
party's candidate in the 1996 Presidential race, Robert Dole,
betrayed the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Now they want to put things right, in every sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that religion is on the march in America; church
attendance are down over the last decade. But there is a community
within a community _ what conservative thinker William Kristol
calls a ``parallel universe'' _ a flourishing world of radio
stations, syndicated columns and newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   It intersects with the political universe when candidates are
being nominated, and small groups of highly motivated individuals
can be very influential.
</P>
<P>
   The Righteous Brothers have money, and they have an audience.
Bauer's Political Action Committee, the Campaign for Working
Families, has raised $3.7 million in contributions in a year.
Nearly 6 million people listen to Dobson's radio show every day;
millions more have bought his books.
</P>
<P>
   All three are astute, confrontational and uncompromising figures
who know how to promote themselves and their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say you can't legislate morality,'' says Ashcroft.
``Well, you certainly can.''
</P>
<P>
   But what has made them important is, in some ways, the weakness
of the conservative Christian leadership. Pat Robertson, its star
in the 1980s, has been in eclipse for years. His Christian
Coalition, once the moving force behind the religious right, lost
influence and became regarded by many as too willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson and his Focus on the Family have moved into the vacuum,
with a brisk, family-oriented, authoritarian moralism.
</P>
<P>
   He first made his name with the charmingly-titled Dare to
Discipline, a child-rearing guide for the tough of mind and hard of
hand. And it is discipline which he wants to bring back to the
Republican Party: the smack of firm government.
</P>
<P>
   At a series of bad-tempered meetings earlier this year, Dobson
publicly threatened to pull away from the Republican Party
altogether unless it started adopting his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have had to listen: since his demarche, the
quixotic party leader in the House of Representatives, Newt
Gingrich, has veered towards the trio's positions and taken a much
harder stand on morality questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anxiety amongst the official Republican
political class to see that these guys are aboard,'' says Mark
Silk, director of the Center for the Study of Religion in Political
Life at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concern about people like Dobson and Bauer is not an
interest in what they can do positively, it is the fear of what
they can do negatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Influence behind the scenes is not enough, however: Bauer and
Ashcroft have both started to sound out the prospects of a
presidential candidacy in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Ashcroft, with plenty of on-the-stump experience, is
more likely, and could be one of three or four Republicans with a
serious shot at the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But his righteous partners are already having a political
impact, backing candidates in Republican primaries for this year's
Congressional races with their words and their cash, which in turn
has triggered conflicts among different factions within the party.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is booming and President Bill Clinton is as popular
as ever, but the Republicans could still have expected a good
showing in November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right, however, is causing near-civil war in some
of their key campaigns. While the Dobson and Bauer candidates have
not been that successful, they have driven wedges into cracks that
were already opening up within the Right.
</P>
<P>
   Their most notable victory was a primary for a special
Congressional election in California, where their candidate beat a
moderate for the Republican nomination, only to be trounced later
by the Democrat. Ironically, Reagan's home is in the district.
</P>
<P>
   The social conservatives in the Republican Party are finding it
increasingly hard to get on with the economic conservatives, and
the historic marriage which Reagan helped to forge between them and
the moderates is on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer and Dobson in particular are less interested in the free
market than in morality, and have sparked angry words from the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge the Republican leadership to abandon their plans to
follow Bauer and Dobson to sure electoral defeat and instead
develop a message to the fiscal conservative voters who dominate
the center of the American electorate,'' wrote Mark Miller of the
Republican Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   In a trenchant analysis of the party's ills in the Atlantic
Monthly, Christopher Caldwell, a conservative, argues that the
party, caught between economic conservatives, the religious right
and its moderate wing, will tear itself apart. It is becoming
``obsolescent,'' he argues.
</P>
<P>
   How much does that bother Dobson or Bauer? ``I believe a
Republican meltdown is preferable to ... the present betrayal of
the moral agenda,'' wrote Dobson.
</P>
<P>
   His ally puts it more simply, saying: ``We are the party.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   All three are astute, confrontational and uncompromising figures
who know how to promote themselves and their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say you can't legislate morality,'' says Ashcroft.
``Well, you certainly can.''
</P>
<P>
   But what has made them important is, in some ways, the weakness
of the conservative Christian leadership. Pat Robertson, its star
in the 1980s, has been in eclipse for years. His Christian
Coalition, once the moving force behind the religious right, lost
influence and became regarded by many as too willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson and his Focus on the Family have moved into the vacuum,
with a brisk, family-oriented, authoritarian moralism.
</P>
<P>
   He first made his name with the charmingly-titled Dare to
Discipline, a child-rearing guide for the tough of mind and hard of
hand. And it is discipline which he wants to bring back to the
Republican Party: the smack of firm government.
</P>
<P>
   At a series of bad-tempered meetings earlier this year, Dobson
publicly threatened to pull away from the Republican Party
altogether unless it started adopting his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have had to listen: since his demarche, the
quixotic party leader in the House of Representatives, Newt
Gingrich, has veered towards the trio's positions and taken a much
harder stand on morality questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anxiety amongst the official Republican
political class to see that these guys are aboard,'' says Mark
Silk, director of the Center for the Study of Religion in Political
Life at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concern about people like Dobson and Bauer is not an
interest in what they can do positively, it is the fear of what
they can do negatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Influence behind the scenes is not enough, however: Bauer and
Ashcroft have both started to sound out the prospects of a
presidential candidacy in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Ashcroft, with plenty of on-the-stump experience, is
more likely, and could be one of three or four Republicans with a
serious shot at the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But his righteous partners are already having a political
impact, backing candidates in Republican primaries for this year's
Congressional races with their words and their cash, which in turn
has triggered conflicts among different factions within the party.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is booming and President Bill Clinton is as popular
as ever, but the Republicans could still have expected a good
showing in November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right, however, is causing near-civil war in some
of their key campaigns. While the Dobson and Bauer candidates have
not been that successful, they have driven wedges into cracks that
were already opening up within the Right.
</P>
<P>
   Their most notable victory was a primary for a special
Congressional election in California, where their candidate beat a
moderate for the Republican nomination, only to be trounced later
by the Democrat. Ironically, Reagan's home is in the district.
</P>
<P>
   The social conservatives in the Republican Party are finding it
increasingly hard to get on with the economic conservatives, and
the historic marriage which Reagan helped to forge between them and
the moderates is on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer and Dobson in particular are less interested in the free
market than in morality, and have sparked angry words from the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge the Republican leadership to abandon their plans to
follow Bauer and Dobson to sure electoral defeat and instead
develop a message to the fiscal conservative voters who dominate
the center of the American electorate,'' wrote Mark Miller of the
Republican Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   In a trenchant analysis of the party's ills in the Atlantic
Monthly, Christopher Caldwell, a conservative, argues that the
party, caught between economic conservatives, the religious right
and its moderate wing, will tear itself apart. It is becoming
``obsolescent,'' he argues.
</P>
<P>
   How much does that bother Dobson or Bauer? ``I believe a
Republican meltdown is preferable to ... the present betrayal of
the moral agenda,'' wrote Dobson.
</P>
<P>
   His ally puts it more simply, saying: ``We are the party.'' &QL;

<P>
   Sanchez Vicario adds &QL; 
to Davenport's woes
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ This was the year, Lindsay Davenport promised herself. This
was the year she would get stronger, faster and meaner. She would
lose weight and acquire an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   No more Miss Nice Girl, Lindsay said, gritting her teeth and
snarling. She would light a fire in her belly, and shrink same a
bit. She would focus her appetite on winning championships, not her
next meal.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's professed goal: a Grand Slam title. Pretty
ambitious, considering she had not reached a Grand Slam final.
</P>
<P>
   And no, she still hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport botched a grand opportunity in the French Open
semifinals Thursday, although her opponent, Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario, a fast-fading clay-court diva in recent months, knows
Court Central at Roland Garros as well as anybody on the women's
tour. The tenacious little Spaniard, a two-time winner here, always
has been as gritty as the clay under her feet, the antithesis of
Madam Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsay is improving. Formerly soft and gawky, and weak
mentally, she has at once slimmed down and grown into her 6-3
frame. Through a hellish training regimen and the normal maturing
process, she has become enough of a force to have risen, albeit
quietly, to No. 2 in the world rankings at the age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   These days, that's middle age. But better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   For now, for at least until the Williams posse reaches full
tennis flower, Davenport can stand tall proudly, literally and
figuratively, as the best American-born player going. (As of later
Thursday afternoon, it became painfully clear who the top American
player, period, is once again.)
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is also the reigning Olympic champion, having beaten
Sanchez Vicario for the gold medal in Atlanta in 1996. They never
can take that away from her. Nonetheless, she's still too slow and
too nice, if no longer too, uh, chubby.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario exploited Davenport's weaknesses on both fronts,
winning 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) in a mistake-filled 94-minute match that
featured twice as many dreadful moments as delightful ones. If
Monica Seles' return to the Roland Garros final was a tour de
force, the Sanchez Vicario-Davenport undercard was more of a tour
de farce.
</P>
<P>
   Lord, it got ugly at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't play that well,'' Davenport said. ``I guess I
beat myself, but she kind of forced it on me, I guess. She runs
extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Davenport's match gone on second, though, she might have
drawn inspiration from the whupping Seles put on top-ranked and
top-seeded Martina Hingis. Seles, whose own post-stabbing battle of
the bulge has been excruciatingly chronicled, knocked every bit of
swagger from the self-confident countenance of the 17-year-old
Swiss phenom in arguably the most satisfying victory of her
tragically split career.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay has endured a lot, to be sure _ the constant harping on
her weight and appearance, plus her parents' hurtful divorce. But
her travails are almost trivial by comparison to what Seles has
been through. If Seles can regain the level of excellence to which
she ascended in stomping Hingis, Davenport surely can raise her
personal standards several notches as well.
</P>
<P>
   They're good friends, Monica and Lindsay. After Thursday, some
of the former is bound to rub off on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the one player I most respect,'' Davenport has said of
Seles. ``I love to watch her play; she's the most fearless player.
Monica is always trying her hardest, always fighting no matter how
far down she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport battled plenty hard against Sanchez Vicario. Effort
wasn't the problem. The problem was how hard she had to battle
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay was done in by that unabated flood of errant shots _ 56
unforced errors, according to the stat sheet _ and her maddening
inability to use her bigger serve to any kind of advantage. If
anything, she was better off trying to return, seeing as how her
service breaks of Sanchez Vicario outnumbered her own holds by a
7-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, she lost eight of 10 service games, facing a break
point in nine of them and trailing in every one. She would lose 64
percent of the points she served. Even at Roland Garros, where the
terre battue is the greatest of equalizers, that's ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's the way it goes,'' Davenport said. ``I feel I
played the right way, by going for my shots. I think I lost my
confidence when I got close. But I'm not ashamed of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's decorum was clearly above reproach. How nice is too
nice? She reversed an ``out'' call by a linesman on a Sanchez
Vicario forehand that would have given her a break point in the
sixth game of the second set.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario held, winning a game point on which Davenport
seemingly swatted at least three clear-cut winners, only to have
Arantxa, her short legs churning, chase each of them down.
</P>
<P>
   So the Spaniard advances to her sixth Roland Garros final, and
Lindsay goes home. Perhaps Wimbledon can be different. Grass is, in
theory, a more suitable surface for her, and for a change, she
needn't be in a hurry to forget Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great tournament _ but one bad day,'' she said. ``I'm
ready to get back out there. Hopefully, it will be a great
Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be, but that's up to her. Monica knows.

Turning back clock, 
Seles bounces Hingis
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ Once, Monica Seles was Martina Hingis, the Martina
Hingis at whom we marvel today. Back then, Hingis was, in her
words, ``just a little kid.'' And Seles would be the world
champion, en route perhaps to becoming the most accomplished woman
player ever.
</P>
<P>
   In the Open era, nobody else had won seven Grand Slam titles
before turning 20.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Steffi Graf. Now, Hingis might, but she has a ways to
go, and she got no closer Thursday, suffering a 6-3, 6-2 throwback
thumping in the French Open semifinals from the born-again Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure if I could do that today,'' said the
sixth-seeded Seles, ``but I really believed I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, same old Seles. Kind of ditzy, but what a player.
</P>
<P>
   They first met in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1989, Seles and
Hingis. The bubbly, disarming teen from Yugoslavia took a picture
with the child who shared her tennis dreams. Their paths didn't
cross again until Hingis, a sassy 16 with the No. 1 ranking in her
cross hairs, humiliated Seles on a tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis would prevail the next four times they played, too,
including last year's French semis, as Seles, overweight and
overwrought, fought a losing battle with the demons destroying her
career. While she protests, ``I don't think the real Monica ever
left,'' obviously she did.
</P>
<P>
   Seles missed more than two years after Gunther Parche, a
deranged German, plunged a knife into her back during the
changeover of a match in Hamburg in April 1993. And when she did
return physically, her killer game didn't automatically follow.
</P>
<P>
   When it appeared it might, when her body and psyche were almost
well, she would be confronted by the cancer in her father's
stomach. Karolj Seles died May 14, less than two weeks before the
French Open. Seles wasn't sure if she should come to Paris. She
didn't hit a ball for 12 days.
</P>
<P>
   But in her grief, she decided to play, to honor Karolj's memory.
And now, she's in the final, having beaten the top-seeded Hingis at
her own game.
</P>
<P>
   Playing her old game. And wearing Karolj's wedding ring on a
chain around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after I decided to play,'' she said, ``I felt content
with the decision. That helped, because in the last few years I was
never content with any decision I made. I knew this was the right
place for me to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad really just wanted me to do what I wanted to do. Tennis
is one of the things that I love to do. He was, you know, the
person who started me on it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Thursday, saddened but in a strange way finally unburdened,
Seles was free to be Seles again, the Monica who won three times in
a row at Roland Garros from 1990 through 1992, a feat unprecedented
in tennis' modern age. Or any age since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis hadn't met this Seles, not on a tennis court, anyway. The
Swiss miss didn't know the lady who was taking Hingis' best shots
and returning them with the same accuracy and twice the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a different player than when I played her before,''
Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   She had heard about this Seles, to be sure, but she couldn't
have known her. Hingis tried to put up a brave, happy front
afterward, but she wore a dazed and distant face.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody beats Hingis like that. Nobody. Except somebody just had.
Hingis was, for an afternoon, a little kid again, being spanked by
an elder.
</P>
<P>
   Was she surprised by the fearless, unmitigated fury of the
two-fisted, single-minded, way-it-used-to-be Seles attack?
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica surprised everybody,'' Hingis said. ``Here she is back,
in better shape, probably better than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Could be. Her opponent in Saturday's final, fourth seed Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, won their most recent meeting in the Chase
Championships last fall, but Seles had taken 14 of the previous 15.
Sanchez Vicario, having defeated second-seeded Lindsay Davenport
6-3, 7-6 (7-5) in their semifinal, understands only too well what
she's in for.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she didn't watch the Seles-Hingis match, which lasted
barely 69 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting a little tired,'' Hingis said, ``and she didn't
make any mistakes. Usually I don't lose the first set, and then she
didn't let me get back into the match. She was the better player.
Usually, she makes more mistakes and gets more tired, but she
didn't do that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles, who broke Hingis' serve five times and held all but once,
was so good she could afford to reverse a ``let'' call, of all
things, giving Hingis a point. Hence, Seles won the sportsmanship
award as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows I can play better tennis than I played
today,'' Hingis said. ``But it can't happen for me every time.
Other players want to win it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I put a little too much pressure on myself. I really
want to win this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains the only Grand Slam she hasn't won, although she
doesn't turn 18 until late September. She was beaten in the French
Open final a year ago by fellow teen Iva Majoli, but that defeat
followed a long rehabilitation from arthroscopic knee surgery
necessitated by a fall from a horse. She was fine this day.
</P>
<P>
   Just overmatched. The one time Hingis made a move, breaking to
start the second set, Seles promptly broke back at 15-40, forcing
Hingis into an unusually timid net error.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a next year,'' Hingis said, and, of course,
there is.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of them. Except Seles, 24, is a force to be reckoned with,
and that changes the coronation equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, nothing beyond my control will happen to me in the
next few years,'' Seles said, ``so I can really focus on my tennis
career and give it the best shot I have left.''
</P>
<P>
   After what she has been through, that seems a reasonable
request.

   AWESOME-CRUISESHIPS (Venice, Italy) _ The Grand Princess _ twice
the size of the Titanic and three times as costly _ sailed into
port and all but eclipsed the cupola of St. Mark's Cathedral. As
passengers spilled out to to inspect the canals of Venice, most of
Venice stared, awestruck, at the world's largest cruise ship. The
cruise industry, boosted first by the hit TV show ``The Love Boat''
and more recently by the movie ``Titanic,'' has calculated that
bigger ships provide economies of scale. And it thinks it can draw
in more passengers with ever more varied and baroque forms of
entertainment. By Alessandra Stanley.

terrain is Schuylkill County, the shovel-shaped anthracite coal

By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tony Stewart could sell your daughter
anything.
</P>
<P>
   He has piercing brown eyes that could make her forget Jeff
Gordon and a smile that would give a milk mustache an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   He has an A.J. Foyt kind of swagger and driving ability that
transcends debates about open wheels and fenders.
</P>
<P>
   He has a 1997 Indy Racing League championship for Team Menard
tucked under his arm, and he's walking away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that there are a lot of drivers that are glad that
Tony is not going to be driving in this series next year,'' Team
Menard crew chief Larry Curry said yesterday between practice
sessions for tomorrow night's True Value 500k. ``No one can say
that it isn't going to be a big loss. He's a great driver and a
great talent. He's kind of what the IRL was all about early on.''
</P>
<P>
   He was its matinee idol, the young American driver that the
league, in its third season, wanted to promote and nurture and
showcase in its centerpiece race, the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's running away to join the Winston Cup circus.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Gordon defecting to the Championship Auto Racing Teams
series _ virtually ripping the sweet heart out of NASCAR. That's
what Stewart's departure from this fledgling league is being
compared with, but it's not entirely an honest comparison.
</P>
<P>
   After winning 1995 U.S. Auto Club titles in sprint, midget and
Silver Crown divisions, Stewart signed a three-year deal with Harry
Ranier's NASCAR Busch Grand National team that November. The next
January, his agent negotiated a deal with John Menard to give
Stewart a ride in the Indy Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't so much outgrown the league as he was spirited away
from it: Joe Gibbs bought Ranier's team and agreed to allow Stewart
to focus on IRL this year while racing BGN on off-weekends with the
intent of moving him up to Winston Cup next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this is a chapter in my life that's almost
finished,'' said Stewart, 27. ``With the exception of the Indy 500,
we've won a race and a championship, so it's time to move on.
Honestly, there's a lot of young talent here _ not so much in age
as experience in these cars. Filling my shoes isn't going to be a
hard thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Team Menard, that job will be filled by teammate Robbie Buhl,
who said he ``wouldn't mind seeing us stay together because we have
different approaches and it's been a good mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhl and teammate J.J. Yeley, 21, don't see Stewart's departure
as the death knell for the league pointing to up-and-comers like
Foyt-protege Billy Boat. Nor do they see it as a permanent
abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody moves on,'' Buhl said. ``I'd like him to stick
around, but he'll be back one day, at least for the 500.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing second last season at Indianapolis, engine
problems handed Stewart a last-place finish two weeks ago. Hoping
to emulate his idol, Foyt, Stewart longs to win Winston Cup's
Daytona 500 and the IRL's Indy 500 before his career is through.
Gibbs has consented to letting him drive in the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated to Winston Cup's 33-date calendar, Stewart's swinging
schedule of racing two and three nights a week with midget cars,
BGN or IRL will stop, Gibbs has said, somewhat to Stewart's
chagrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that driving in the IRL has helped me in
stock-car racing, but I do know that every time I'm in a midget car
or sprint car or whatever, I'm gaining more general knowledge about
racing,'' Stewart said, emphasizing that he hasn't outgrown the
IRL. ``I don't think you can learn everything there is to learn in
any kind of race car. I still race midgets and sprints and I still
learn something every time I get in one of those. I just feel like
this chapter is through.''
</P>
<P>
   As he says this, his name is atop the IRL points standings, and
yesterday at Texas Motor Speedway, Stewart pushed his neon yellow
Glidden Menards Special to a top speed of 223 mph in practice.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles a smile that could sell a thousand cans of paint or
boxes of cereal. This chapter's not over. There's work to be done
this weekend.
