Report: Malaysian state warns fishermen not to stray
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP ) _ A Malaysian coastal state has
warned fishermen not to wander too far into international waters
where they may be easy prey for armed pirates, a newspaper reported
Monday.
	   After three instances of fishermen kidnapped by pirates for
ransom, maritime security would be beefed up off the coast of
Johor, said the southern state's chief minister Abdul Ghani Othman.
	   ``Since the attacks took place in international waters beyond
the 12-nautical-mile zone, we urge fishermen not to go too far to
fish,'' he was quoted as saying by Star newspaper.
	   The kidnappings occurred once in April and twice in May when
fishermen were taken to Indonesia. They had to pay up to 6,000
ringgit (dlrs 1,500) ransom to the pirates.
	   Abdul Ghani said Indonesia needed to step up measures to check
piracy in the Straits of Malacca.
	   The last big instance of piracy in the area was the hijacking of
the Malaysian-registered Petro Ranger as it sailed from Singapore
to Ho Chi Minh City on April 17.
	   Malaysia is reportedly seeking to extradite 12 Indonesians held
by China in connection with that hijacking. The ship and its crew
of 21 were released on May 30 after a Chinese investigation, but
there has been no word about charging the Indonesians.
	   Neither the ship's agents in Singapore nor the Chinese
authorities have said what happened to the cargo _ dlrs 1.4 million
worth of gas, oil and kerosene.
	   Of the 229 cases of piracy reported in 1997, more than half
occurred in Asia, whose waters are flecked with small islands.

North Korea's economy shrinks for eight straight year in 1997
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea's economy contracted 2.6
percent in 1997, the eighth straight year of decline in the
reclusive communist country, South Korea's central bank said
Monday.
	   The North's economy began shrinking in 1990 when it lost most of
its former trade and aid partners with the collapse of communism in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
	   Seoul's central Bank of Korea said North Korea generated only
dlrs 12 billion in gross national product in 1997, down 2.6 percent
from the previous year.
	   The North's 1997 GNP was about one-25th of that of capitalist
South Korea for the same year, the report said.
	   South Korea's economy grew 7.7 percent last year but shrank 3.5
percent in the first quarter of this year as the country went
through a serious financial crisis. Analysts expect South Korea's
economic slide to continue.
	   South Korea was forced to accept a record dlrs 58 billion
package from the International Monetary Fund to bail out its
economy in December.
	   The Bank of Korea's report estimated North Korea's trade volume
in 1997 at dlrs 2.18 billion, up slightly from dlrs 1.98 billion
the previous year. The increase was due to imports of more food
from China and other countries, it said.
	   North Korea, the report said, exported dlrs 910 million worth of
goods last year but imported dlrs 1.27 billion worth, posting a
dlrs 360 million trade deficit.
	   The bank estimated North Korea's foreign debt totaled dlrs 11.9
billion last year.
	   North Korea seldom releases economic figures, but has
acknowledged in recent years that its economy was facing ``grim
difficulties.''
	   South Korea compiles annual estimates on North Korea's economy
with data obtained from the North's trading partners and other
sources.
	   North Korea has been relying on outside aid since 1995 to feed
its people. Chronic food shortages have been worsened by three
years of bad weather.
	   The North's huge defense expenditures are also a major stumbling
block in efforts to revive the economy. The country keeps a 1.1
million strong military, the world's fifth largest.

Japan: Asia crisis caused by reckless investing, poor oversight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source for release at 0800 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asia's economic woes are the result of speculative
investments, over-reliance on short-term foreign capital and poor
supervision by financial authorities, according to a Japanese
government report released Monday.
	   In contrast to the warm reviews of the recent past, the Economic
Planning Agency's 1998 report on the region takes many of Japan's
neighbors to task for allowing the East Asian economic miracle to
turn into a mirage.
	   The report on Asia outside of Japan comes just as many countries
have stepped up criticism of Tokyo for prolonging the Asian crisis
by not dealing with its own economic problems.
	   Japan, they say, must quickly restore growth so it can absorb
the exports Asian countries must sell if they are to recover
themselves.
	   Japan's EPA focused on structural problems in Indonesia, South
Korea and Thailand. All three countries were forced to accept huge
bailouts from the International Monetary Fund after a wave of
currency devaluations swept the region last year.
	   These nations became the victims of their own success as the
prudent economic policies of the 1980s were replaced by mistakes
resulting from the ``extreme economic optimism'' of the 1990s, the
agency said.
	   ``Flowing foreign capital became shorter-term, much of which
went to bubble real estate investments or excessive investments
based on an excessively optimistic demand outlook,'' the report
said.
	   The problems highlighted include:
	   _dependence on short-term, indirect foreign capital such as
bonds as opposed to longer-term, direct foreign capital like
factories.
	   _preference for high-risk investments in speculative deals.
	   _tolerance of corporate strategies featuring low profit margins,
high debt loads and reliance on government bailouts.
	   _use of fixed exchange rates which inflate the money supply.
	   _weak oversight by financial authorities.
	   The report noted Asian economies least affected by the regional
crisis such as China, Singapore and Taiwan are characterized by few
of these problems.
	   Unlike Mexico, which quickly rebounded from a currency crisis in
1994, the hardest-hit Asian nations appear unlikely to stage a
swift recovery because an expected surge in exports has not
materialized, the agency said.
	   But the outlook for Asia may not be as dire as the decade-long
slump in Latin America during the 1980s because Asian nations boast
stronger economic fundamentals and lighter debt loads, it said.

Bulls fans celebrate NBA victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Chicago Bulls fans by the thousands cut loose in
jubilation Sunday night as their heroes clinched their sixth NBA
title of the 1990s.
	   Honking horns echoed among the skyscrapers along Michigan
Avenue, and fans packed Rush Street, heart of Chicago's biggest
nightlife district, dancing and chanting ``We're number one'' under
the watchful eye of mounted police.
	   Light rain helped keep the early stages of Sunday's celebration
fairly sedate. The volume of calls to the city's emergency center
Sunday night was slightly lower than it was after last year's
championship clincher, said Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden. He
said there was one confirmed report of a man shot, but it wasn't
immediately known if the shooting was related to the Bulls
celebration. Figures on arrests were not immediately available.
	   That was a sharp contrast to the mayhem that followed the Bulls'
early championships. In 1991, more than 1,000 people were arrested
and looters hit stores across the city after the Bulls won their
first championship.
	   Such violence led to what became a well-rehearsed routine for
Chicago police. About 8,000 police were on duty Sunday night at a
cost of dlrs 1 million; extra space had been cleared at the Cook
County Jail, and authorities were prepared to close major streets
and expressway exit ramps to keep crowds under control.
	   TV stations aired a public service announcement from Michael
Jordan, coach Phil Jackson and Dennis Rodman, calling on fans to
celebrate responsibly, and public school students were given a
similar message in letters signed by Jordan.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ A day after facing
angry villagers screaming for vengeance, a Mexican human rights
official promised to investigate a police-and-army raid on
pro-rebel villages in Chiapas state that resulted in nine deaths.
	   At a news conference Sunday, Adolfo Hernandez Figueroa said the
National Human Rights Commission had opened an investigation and
would examine all aspects of the case.
	   Officials say they are trying to reimpose ``the state of law''
in chaotic Chiapas, where Zapatista rebels staged a brief uprising
in 1994 and where their sympathizers still often defy the
government.
	   They deny that Wednesday's raids, or recent raids on three other
pro-rebel towns, constitute a violation of a cease-fire with the
Zapatista National Liberation Army.
	   However, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and Amnesty
International last week expressed alarm at the raids.
	   Reporters visiting the villages after the raids found homes and
stores looted and belongings smashed. Newspaper photographs of the
raids showed suspects bound in rope and tossed like logs, one atop
another, in the back of police trucks.
	   Hernandez also asked that rough treatment he received Saturday
at the hands of grieving peasants in the village of Union Progreso
not be used as an excuse for more police action against them.
	   More than 1,000 angry Indians surrounded the team from the
National Human Rights Commission, which had come to deliver the
bodies of eight people killed last week during raids on two
villages and the small town of El Bosque.
	   On Wednesday, hundreds of troops and state police, with weapons
including grenade launchers, entered the towns in scores of trucks
to serve 15 arrest warrants.
	   The Chiapas state attorney general's office said in a statement
Sunday that one of those detained, Mario Santiz Ruiz, had confessed
that he and six other Zapatista rebels with rifles ambushed the
hundreds of troops approaching Union Progreso. It said the troops
fired in response to the aggression.
	   The agency said officials have freed 24 of the 53 people
arrested in the raids, and 29 have been arraigned on various
charges.
	   Some villagers in Union Progreso said that six of the eight
killed there had been seen alive after being captured by state
police.
	   Apparently due to the controversy over the deaths, officials in
the southern state conducted a second autopsy at the human rights
commission's request, Hernandez said. Results were pending.
	   On Saturday night, villagers trapped Hernandez atop a truck and
berated him for several hours as the most visible symbol of
government before letting him go.
	   ``What crime was committed by those in the coffins? They only
defended their rights,'' an elderly woman demanded in a squeaky
voice. ``We know that the government killed them.''
	   More than 145 people were killed in the Zapatistas' two-week
uprising before a truce was called. Peace talks have been stalled
since 1996.

Howard under pressure to change election strategy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John
Howard came under pressure Monday to change his national election
strategy after lawmakers upset by the results of a weekend state
election urged the premier to drop key elements of his policies.
	   As the Cabinet met to discuss the fallout from Saturday's
election in the state of Queensland, ruling coalition legislators
warned the right-wing One Nation party may repeat its surprise
success in Queensland on a national level if Howard sticks with his
election plan.
	   Howard must call a national election before March 1999.
	   Some lawmakers from the rural-based National party have signaled
a split may be emerging in the ruling conservative coalition.
	   A faction of the National party appears ready to embrace some of
One Nation's nationalist, populist and protectionist policies to
try and win back support from disaffected voters.
	   Before the Queensland election, the prime minister had been
widely expected to go to the polls within months, probably after
releasing a tax reform package including a broad-based sales tax.
	   But the outcome of the vote in Queensland cast doubt on Howard's
plans for an early election. Many voters abandoned traditional
conservative parties to support Pauline Hanson's One Nation
movement.
	   Hanson opposes many of Howard's key planned reforms, such as the
introduction of a sales tax. She has also been critical of Howard's
plan to sell off the government stake in telecommunications carrier
Telstra Corp.
	   In addition, Hanson wants a harder line on Aboriginal people's
entitlements to land and the abolishment of government gun-control
measures.
	   But Howard has reaffirmed his commitment to his policies and
pledged not to compromise on his tax initiative or other issues.
	   ``I don't intend to back away from taxation reform,'' Howard
said in a television interview Monday.
	   Senior National party figures said Monday that trying to sell a
sales tax to Queensland voters at an early federal poll would be
electoral suicide.
	   ``It would be mad to go ahead with a GST,'' unless voters can be
assured it is going to benefit them, National party director Don
McDonald said.
	   National lawmaker De-Anne Kelly said the election result showed
a goods and services tax was ``plainly not going to be acceptable
in Queensland.''
	   Some Nationals have also indicated the party should distance
itself from Howard's metropolitan-based Liberal Party and adopt
more conservative policies.
	   ``It's time to take a very independent view of policy ... if we
don't change our course, quite plainly people will send us the same
message at federal level as they have at a state level,'' Kelly
said.
	   The final tally for the Queensland race was expected to take
days to compile, but One Nation attracted about 23 percent of the
vote. It stands to win nine and possibly more electorates in the
state's 89-seat Parliament.
	   If the party won similar support at the national level, it would
likely hold the balance of power in the Upper House, the Senate.

Seagram increases stakes in South Korean joint venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Canada's Seagram Co. Ltd. has signed a
dlrs 59 million contract to strengthen ties with South Korea's
largest alcoholic beverage maker, Doosan, industry officials said
Monday.
	   The deal will increase Seagram's stake in Doosan Seagram Co.
Ltd. to 77.8 percent from the current 50 percent, they said.
	   Doosan Seagram was set up in 1980 as a 50-50 joint venture to
sell Seagram's whiskey products in South Korea. It holds about 55
percent of the nation's dlrs 643 million whiskey market.
	   Under a separate deal announced Monday, Seagram also will lend
dlrs 31 million to Doosan at an annual interest rate of 5 per cent.
The loan's maturity date has not been decided.
	   Doosan officials said the deals are part of their company's
efforts to improve its financial structure amid the worst financial
crisis in years.
	   Doosan, a major conglomerate, has plans to sell or merge 19 of
its 23 subsidiaries by the end of this year to focus on its food
and beverage, advertising and construction businesses.

 &UR; Bulls fans celebrate NBA victory &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported looting, bottle throwing, cars
overturned. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Chicago Bulls fans by the thousands cut loose in
jubilation Sunday night as their heroes clinched their sixth NBA
title of the 1990s.
	   Honking horns echoed among the skyscrapers along Michigan
Avenue, and fans packed Rush Street, heart of the city's biggest
nightlife district, dancing, slapping hands, and chanting ``We're
number one'' under the watchful eye of a detachment of mounted
police.
	   Light rain helped keep the early stages of Sunday's celebration
fairly sedate. The volume of calls to the city's emergency center
Sunday night was slightly lower than it was after last year's
championship clincher, said Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden.
	   He said there was one confirmed report of a man shot, but it
wasn't immediately known if the shooting was related to the
celebration. There were also uncomfirmed reports of looting, some
bottles being thrown and a few cars being overturned, he said.
	   Figures on arrests were not immediately available.
	   That was a sharp contrast to the mayhem that followed the Bulls'
early championships. In 1991, more than 1,000 people were arrested
and looters hit stores across the city after the Bulls won their
first championship.
	   Such violence led to what became a well-rehearsed routine for
Chicago police. About 8,000 police were on duty Sunday night at a
cost of dlrs 1 million; extra space had been cleared at the Cook
County Jail, and authorities were prepared to close major streets
and expressway exit ramps to keep crowds under control.
	   TV stations aired a public service announcement from Michael
Jordan, coach Phil Jackson and Dennis Rodman, calling on fans to
celebrate responsibly, and public school students were given a
similar message in letters signed by Jordan.

Manila airport reopens after JAL plane is removed from mud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Manila's airport reopened Monday
nearly 12 hours after a Japan Airlines plane swerved halfway off a
wet runway and onto a patch of muddy grass while landing, officials
said.
	   At least 23 passengers were injured while being evacuated from
the plane, flight JL 745, after the accident late Sunday night. Two
Japanese and a Filipino were hospitalized, officials said.
	   Tower supervisor Rolly Pelayo said the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11
plane was lifted from the mud and towed away.
	   The airport has only one runway long enough to service large
planes.
	   The plane, which had 264 people aboard, was making its second
landing approach when the accident occurred.
	   Pelayo said the pilot had been apprehensive because of limited
visibility caused by a thunderstorm during the first landing
attempt.
	   The plane's pilot, Capt. Takahashi Minami, said that when he
reversed the thrust of the two engines to slow the plane after
touching down he felt the left engine reverse, but not the right
one. That forced the plane to swerve to the left on the wet runway,
he said.
	   The plane's left and central landing gear veered off the runway
and into the mud. The plane came to a halt with its left wing and
engine about a foot (30 centimeters) from the ground.
	   Pelayo said damage to the runway was minimal and work crews were
able to repair the wiring for runway lights cut by the plane.
	   Because of the accident the Philippines President, Fidel Ramos,
was forced to delay a trip to Senegal, where he is to receive a
U.N. peace award for his role in forging a peace accord with Muslim
rebels.

NATO allies to give Milosevic a lesson in power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with support planes in the air and scheduled time of
takeoff. Will be led after planes take off, estimated at 0555 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ NATO forces hope a show of force
will persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to reconsider
his tough policies in Kosovo province.
	   Eighty NATO fighters and reconnaissance aircraft were set to
take off at dawn Monday for several hours of exercises over
neighboring Albania and Macedonia. The exercise, involving 13 of
NATO's 16 member countries, is meant to show how quickly and
powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces if needed.
	   The planes were scheduled to depart at 7:55 a.m. (0555 GMT)
Monday, leaving air bases in Italy, Greece, France, Germany and
Britain. Support planes, including refueling tankers, already were
in the air.
	   ``This is an exercise intended to demonstrate the alliance's
commitment to peace and stability in the region and the alliance's
ability to project power into the region,'' Lt. Gen. Michael Short,
commander of NATO air forces in the alliance's southern Europe
division, said at Aviano Air Base Sunday evening.
	   Asked early Monday if he expected the aircraft to be picked up
by Yugoslav ground radar, Short said ``it's very reasonable to say
the aircraft will be tracked by Yugoslav early warning systems.''
	   ``We will do nothing in this exercise to provoke a response from
the federal republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   The planes will fly down the Adriatic coast into Albanian air
space, making a clockwise circle into Macedonia, before heading
back over Albania and out over the Adriatic Sea, Short said.
	   More than 300 people have been killed in Kosovo since Yugoslavia
launched a crackdown on the southern province's ethnic Albanian
majority in March. Thousands have fled across the border into
Albania and Macedonia, as well as the Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro.
	   Western leaders want to halt the violence, but have also said
they do not support efforts by ethnic Albanian militants seeking
independence.
	   NATO defense ministers ordered the air exercises on Thursday
during a meeting in Brussels. The ministers also ordered the
alliance's military planners to begin looking at a wide range of
options for future action, including direct intervention in
Yugoslavia with air and ground forces.
	   In the Adriatic sea aboard USS Wasp, Col. Emerson Gardner told
reporters: ``We need to show the people that need to know exactly
what we can do.''
	   The Wasp will throw four Harrier jump-jet attack aircraft into
the exercise, code-named Determined Falcon.
	   Planes are departing from 15 bases in five nations. Only Iceland
and Luxembourg, which have no air forces, and Canada, which could
not deploy planes to Europe on such short notice, will not
participate.
	   Among the aircraft taking part will be F-16s from Portugal,
F-18s from Spain, U.S. Air Force F-16s and KC-135 tankers, and
Marine Corps EA-6B early warning planes.
	   The NATO exercise will take place before Russian President Boris
Yeltsin has an opportunity to try to persuade Milosevic to back off
in Kosovo. Milosevic is in Moscow Monday and Tuesday. The Russian
leader has promised to use what influence he has on Milosevic to
defuse the situation.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed any direct intervention in
Yugoslavia, considering that all of the diplomatic options have yet
to be exhausted.
	   Emerson noted the Serbs have wide-range fighters from old MiG
21s to the newer MiG 29s, with surface-to-air missiles.
	   ``But all the risks have been assessed and we have taken
measures against it,'' Emerson said without elaborating. ``We feel
the mission can be accomplished safely.''
	   Short would not say just how close the allied planes will come
to the Yugoslav border. But Emerson said: ``We will be close enough
that the Serbs will know NATO will be there.''

East Timorese stage independence rally on city campus

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of East Timorese students in
bright blue and yellow jackets demonstrated Monday for a vote on
independence from Indonesian control.
	   The protesters, who also want Indonesia to release jailed rebel
leader Xanana Gusmao, have stepped up rallies urging the Indonesian
military to withdraw from the former Portuguese colony.
	   President B.J. Habibie, whose predecessor, Suharto, invaded East
Timor in 1975, has said Indonesia will not relinquish control.
	   Instead, Habibie has suggested East Timor may be granted a
special status, which would likely give some measure of autonomy to
the half-island territory.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's annexation of
East Timor as its 27th province. In the 1970s, tens of thousands of
East Timorese died in fighting and famine and disease that followed
Indonesia's takeover.
	   Students at the rally at East Timor University in Dili, the
territory's capital, waved banners and chanted slogans calling for
the release of Gusmao, a revered separatist rebel who is serving a
20-year sentence in a Jakarta jail.
	   Several protesters wore headbands that read, ``Independence.''
	   Some critics warn that the poor territory can ill afford
independence because it has grown economically dependent on
Indonesia. Independence could also stir up internal differences
among the local population of more than 800,000, critics have said.

Queen Mother becomes oldest royal in history
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Queen Mother Elizabeth has entered the record
books as the oldest royal in British history.
	   The mother of Queen Elizabeth II, she has lived for 97 years and
315 days, and on Sunday passed the longevity record held by Queen
Victoria's granddaughter Princess Alice, who died Jan. 3, 1981.
	   She will celebrate her 98th birthday Aug. 4.
	   ``It is difficult to say it categorically but I cannot find any
British royal from our records who has lived longer than the Queen
Mother,'' the Express newspaper reported royal expert Harold
Brookes-Baker, editor of Burke's Peerage, as saying.
	   The Queen Mother married into the royal family in 1923 and was
51 when her husband, King George VI, died in 1952.

 &UR; Bulls fans celebrate NBA victory &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with further violence. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Chicago Bulls fans by the thousands cut loose in
jubilation Sunday night as their heroes clinched their sixth NBA
title of the 1990s with reports of some minor violence and arrests.
	   Honking horns echoed among the skyscrapers along Michigan
Avenue, and fans packed Rush Street, heart of the city's biggest
nightlife district, dancing, slapping hands and chanting ``We're
number one'' under the watchful eye of a detachment of mounted
police.
	   Light rain helped keep Sunday's celebration fairly sedate. The
volume of calls to the city's emergency center Sunday night
mirrored that of last year's championship clincher, said Chicago
police spokesman Pat Camden.
	   He said there was one confirmed report of a man shot, but it
wasn't immediately known if the shooting was related to the
celebration. A police sergeant was hit by a car on the city's West
Side, and there were reports of scattered looting, bottles being
thrown and cars being overturned, he said.
	   ``Our contingency plan is working the way we want it to work,''
Camden said. ``It would be nice to report that there were no
incidents, but that would be more of a fairy tale than reality.''
	   Citywide figures on arrests would not be available until Monday
morning at the earliest, he said.
	   The latest celebration was a sharp contrast to the mayhem that
followed the Bulls' early championships. In 1991, more than 1,000
people were arrested and looters hit stores across the city after
the Bulls won their first championship.
	   Such violence led to what became a well-rehearsed routine for
Chicago police. About 8,000 police were on duty Sunday night at a
cost of dlrs 1 million; extra space had been cleared at the Cook
County Jail, and authorities were prepared to close major streets
and expressway exit ramps to keep crowds under control.
	   Television stations aired a public service announcement from
Michael Jordan, coach Phil Jackson and Dennis Rodman, calling on
fans to celebrate responsibly, and public school students were
given a similar message in letters signed by Jordan.

Censorship, poor media quality lead to financial turmoil: study
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Government censorship and the poor quality of
reporting from Asia's media were partly to blame for the region's
recent financial turmoil, a study by a prestigious Hong Kong-based
consultancy said.
	   The study found that Asia's easily-intimidated media have fallen
short on reporting the problems faced by regional governments and
financial institutions.
	   ``People did not have the information they needed to have an
accurate understanding of how radically conditions could change,''
said a report released this weekend by the Political and Economic
Consultancy.
	   The consultantcy's survey asked over 400 local and foreign
businessmen working in the region to grade 11 countries in terms of
censorship, media quality and access to foreign print and broadcast
media on a scale of zero to 10, with zero being the best grade.
	   Hong Kong, the Philippines, Japan and Thailand topped the poll
on media quality, while the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Thailand were perceived as having the freest press.
	   Hong Kong scored 3.80 in media quality, followed by the
Philippines at 4.53, and Japan 4.72.
	   Vietnam's media, graded the worst in quality, received 8.00,
followed by China at 7.88 and South Korea at 6.86.
	   Journalists in Taiwan and the Philippines were seen as having
the freest hands, with the two countries receiving 3.75 and 3.80 in
media freedom. Despite Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese rule last
July 1, the territory was ranked third for press freedom, scoring
3.95.
	   The report said there were fears that China would restrict media
freedom, but that this has not happened.
	   Censorship is perceived as the heaviest in Vietnam, China and
South Korea, which received 9.33, 8.22 and 7.47 respectively.
	   The report said South Korea's media ``lacks impartiality,
accuracy and diversity,'' partly because of chaebol, or giant
Korean conglomerates, own most of the established media outlets.
	   It added that economic changes are ``leading to structural
changes in the Korean media sector that should result in much
needed improvements in content and diversity.''
	   The survey, conducted before former Indonesian President
Suharto's resignation, gave Indonesia's press middle grades in both
censorship and media quality.
	   The study said Suharto's downfall has produced a ``heady
renaissance'' in the local press, which is enjoying the first taste
of real freedom in more than three decades.
	   But it warned the change merely reflects ``the inability of the
current elite to control the political and social forces ...
unleashed by the economic crisis,'' not ``a surge in support for
democratic principles'' among the leaders.
	   The report also commended the press in Thailand, one of the
hardest hit countries in the recent economic crisis, for ``speaking
out more boldly against repression in neighboring countries,
arguing that the absence of democratic government and a free press
exacerbated economic weakness.''

Philippines planning to revise growth, inflation targets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Government economic planners proposed
Monday revisions of the country's growth and inflation targets for
1998 following worse-than-expected first quarter economic results.
	   The proposals by the National Economic and Development Authority
are to be discussed by the Development Budget Coordinating Council,
an interagency group composed of economic, finance and monetary
officials.
	   NEDA is recommending that the government's gross national
product growth target for the year be revised to between 2.5
percent and 3.5 percent from an earlier goal of between 3 percent
and 4 percent.
	   It is also recommending that the inflation target be raised to
between 9.4 percent and 10.3 percent from an earlier 7.5 percent to
8.5 percent.
	   Considerably lower-than-expected first quarter growth data
caused the government to review its targets, even though the
Philippines has weathered the regional financial crisis better than
most of its neighbors.
	   GNP in the first three months expanded by 2.5 percent, compared
to 5.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997. GNP growth averaged
5.8 percent in 1997.
	   Inflation in May was 10.3 percent, hitting double-digit levels
for the first time since mid-1996.

Japanese only foreigners leaving Singapore so far
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Except for Japanese, the number of foreign
executives and other highly-paid workers in Singapore has remained
stable during the economic crisis, according to official figures
quoted by a newspaper Monday.
	   However, the figures were valid only through April, while the
majority of expatriate workers usually move on in the summer during
school breaks.
	   A number of American firms have plans to close Singapore
operations this summer, or leave only local staff in place.
	   The immigration figures covered only six nationalities.
	   The Business Times quoted immigration department figures that
showed the number of Japanese employment pass holders in Singapore
had declined from 10,300 to 10,200 between October 1997 and this
April.
	   The Asian-wide economic crisis has cut profits and led to
downsizing of staff. Companies based in recession-hit Japan have
been badly hit.
	   The number of Americans, however, increased from 5,500 to 5,600;
Australians from 3,100 to 3,300; British from 6,400 to 6,600; and
French from 1,500 to 1,600.
	   The number of South Korean pass holders remained steady during
that period at 1,400.
	   Employment pass holders must earn a minimum of 2,000 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 1,142) per month. The figures measured only the
wage-earners, not dependents.

Howard under pressure to change election strategy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 1st paragraph that it is Howard facing pressure &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John
Howard came under pressure Monday to change his national election
strategy after lawmakers upset by the results of a weekend state
election urged him to drop key elements of his policies.
	   As the Cabinet met to discuss the fallout from Saturday's
election in the state of Queensland, ruling coalition legislators
warned the right-wing One Nation party may repeat its surprise
success in Queensland on a national level if Howard sticks with his
election plan.
	   Howard must call a national election before March 1999.
	   Some lawmakers from the rural-based National party have signaled
a split may be emerging in the ruling conservative coalition.
	   A faction of the National party appears ready to embrace some of
One Nation's nationalist, populist and protectionist policies to
try and win back support from disaffected voters.
	   Before the Queensland election, the prime minister had been
widely expected to go to the polls within months, probably after
releasing a tax reform package including a broad-based sales tax.
	   But the outcome of the vote in Queensland cast doubt on Howard's
plans for an early election. Many voters abandoned traditional
conservative parties to support Pauline Hanson's One Nation
movement.
	   Hanson opposes many of Howard's key planned reforms, such as the
introduction of a sales tax. She has also been critical of Howard's
plan to sell off the government stake in telecommunications carrier
Telstra Corp.
	   In addition, Hanson wants a harder line on Aboriginal people's
entitlements to land and the abolishment of government gun-control
measures.
	   But Howard has reaffirmed his commitment to his policies and
pledged not to compromise on his tax initiative or other issues.
	   ``I don't intend to back away from taxation reform,'' Howard
said in a television interview Monday.
	   Senior National party figures said Monday that trying to sell a
sales tax to Queensland voters at an early federal poll would be
electoral suicide.
	   ``It would be mad to go ahead with a GST,'' unless voters can be
assured it is going to benefit them, National party director Don
McDonald said.
	   National lawmaker De-Anne Kelly said the election result showed
a goods and services tax was ``plainly not going to be acceptable
in Queensland.''
	   Some Nationals have also indicated the party should distance
itself from Howard's metropolitan-based Liberal Party and adopt
more conservative policies.
	   ``It's time to take a very independent view of policy ... if we
don't change our course, quite plainly people will send us the same
message at federal level as they have at a state level,'' Kelly
said.
	   The final tally for the Queensland race was expected to take
days to compile, but One Nation attracted about 23 percent of the
vote. It stands to win nine and possibly more electorates in the
state's 89-seat Parliament.
	   If the party won similar support at the national level, it would
likely hold the balance of power in the Upper House, the Senate.

Vietnam donors discuss progress of economic reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HUE, Vietnam (AP) _ The World Bank struck a supportive and
conciliatory note Monday as Vietnamese government officials and the
country's major donors began one-day talks on ways to speed up a
lagging economic reform program.
	   ``We are serious friends of Vietnam and we are here because
Vietnam is going through a difficult time externally,'' World Bank
country director Andrew Steer said in a speech, belying the
frustration many donors feel about the slowness of change.
	   The meeting won't discuss new financial aid for Vietnam _ the
dlrs 2.4 billion package for 1998 was already agreed last December
at a meeting in Tokyo _ but the donors wanted to hold an unusual
midyear gathering to remind Hanoi of the pressing need for a
shakeup.
	   Donors are expected to remind the government that economic
reform is the way Vietnam can protect itself as export and economic
growth slows and foreign investment falls due to a slowdown across
Asia.
	   In the past, donors have said they want the sell-off of some of
the 6,500 state-held companies speeded up, trade barriers cut as
Vietnam prepares for membership in the Asian Free Trade Area, and
an overhaul of the debt-ridden financial sector.
	   Steer said the Asian crisis is now entering a second and more
``virulent'' phase which ``heralds a recession in the region
greater than has been seen in the last 50 years.''
	   Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said in the opening speech that the
government has taken measures to improve the investment climate,
simplify import-export procedures and improve transparency, and
will continue to push economic liberalization.
	   When donors such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund,
Asian Development Bank, United Nations Development Program, Japan,
France, Sweden and Australia met in Tokyo last December to pledge
aid for 1998, they warned that exports and foreign investment would
be hurt by the regional slowdown.
	   This has proved to be the case. Vietnam's exports to its
Southeast Asian neighbors fell by 48 percent in the first quarter
of this year as demand in those countries, hard hit by the regional
crisis, has slowed.
	   Even though Vietnam's overall exports are still growing,
economists expect the 1998 trade deficit to be wider than the dlrs
2.35 billion seen in 1997 due to continuing import demand.

Philippine Airlines losses pose problem for banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Heavy losses at strike-hit Philippine
Airlines could cause problems for local and international banks
with loans to the airline, a securities company says.
	   A recent study by ABN Amro Asia Ltd. says that while most major
Philippine banks have minimal loan exposure to PAL, Philippine
National Bank is a glaring exception.
	   Analysts have long been concerned over PNB's asset quality.
There are fears that the bank is sitting on a minefield of bad
debts that have accumulated since the region's financial crisis.
	   A crippling pilots' strike has caused PAL to drastically
downsize its international flight operations and focus on domestic
routes. PAL has said the strike is pushing the airline to the brink
of financial ruin.
	   PAL has said it hasn't missed any of its debt payments due to
the strike.
	   Last week, the airline reported a net loss of 8.08 billion pesos
(dlrs 202 million) in its financial year to March 31, 1998, more
than triple the year-earlier loss.
	   PNB also has equity exposure in PAL via a 752 million peso (dlrs
18.8 million) investment in PR Holdings, which owns 67 percent of
PAL.
	   ABN Amro's report said Philippine Commercial International Bank
has loan exposure to PAL of close to 200 million pesos (dlrs 5
million).
	   The report noted that in 1996, Allied Bank Corp. arranged dlrs
182 million in financing for PAL with Security Bank Corp. as lead
manager.
	   Other lenders included China Banking Corp., Union Bank and
Equitable Banking Corp. and Union Bank of the Philippines.
	   ``All up, we estimate that PAL's total outstanding debt stood at
dlrs 1.5 billion as of December 1997,'' the report said, noting
that much of this burden is being carried by international banks
and credit agencies.
	   And these, it said, will be hard hit should PAL seek to
restructure its debts.
	   In January 1997, PAL issued dlrs 200 million in floating-rate
notes which were almost wholly taken up by Korean banks, the report
said.
	   Most of the debt was raised to bankroll an ambitious dlrs 4
billion refleeting program to modernize the airline.
	   This program, which involved buying 36 new jets, is now on hold,
although deliveries have already been made of some 20 Boeing and
Airbus jets.
	   The report says that by far the airlines' largest exposure is to
European export credit agencies, which supplied loans totaling dlrs
850 million to cover nine new Airbus orders.
	   ABN Amro believes that although PAL is meeting its loan
commitments, it ``remains to be seen how long this can be sustained
given the present state of affairs.''
	   ``Even if the strike ends quickly, PAL will remain in a critical
financial position,'' the report said, adding that the company
``might consider a temporary closure in order to force the
government to become involved.''
	   The Philippine government holds an estimated stake of around 18
percent in PAL through affiliates. PAL's biggest shareholder is
Filipino-Chinese tycoon Lucio Tan.

Communist lawmaker shot and killed in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PATNA, India (AP) _ A communist lawmaker and two of his
supporters were shot and killed by unidentified assailants in
India's eastern state of Bihar, the second killing in two days of a
state legislator, police said Monday.
	   The assailants riding a motorbike sprayed bullets Sunday on Ajit
Kumar Sarkar's car, killing all three passengers in Purnea, a town
1,600 kilometers (1,000) east of New Delhi, said K.A. Jacob, the
director-general of police.
	   About 10,000 people poured into Purnea's streets and attacked
police with rocks as news of Sarkar's killing spread. Police fired
in the air and beat protesters with bamboo sticks.
	   On Saturday, Brij Bihari Prasad, a former state minister
belonging to the governing Rashtriya Janata Party, and his guard
were murdered by suspected political rivals.
	   Bihar has a reputation as India's most lawless state. Many of
its legislators are accused of leading criminal gangs and buying
their way into local politics. The gangs often are caught up in
Bihar's caste conflicts, pitting upper caste landowners against
lower caste tenant farmers who claim they are exploited.
	   Sitaram Yechury, a Communist Party of India leader, blamed
Sunday's attack on Sarkar on a private army organized by
landowners.
	   The killings prompted the opposition to demand the dismissal of
the state government run by the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Electoral support for the One Nation
party shows Australians are concerned about the level of Asian
immigration, party power broker David Oldfield said Monday.
	   One Nation, led by independent federal legislator Pauline
Hanson, attracted about 23 percent of the vote in Saturday's
Queensland election, giving the party at least nine seats in the
state's Parliament and possible direct influence on government.
	   The federal conservative coalition government, whose parties
suffered most from a defection to One Nation, is concerned the
party's popularity will be repeated nationally.
	   Oldfield said Hanson's policies had struck a chord with a
disaffected public increasingly wary about the ``Asianization'' of
Australia.
	   ``Australians, like Asians and like everybody else, are a little
culturally intolerant of each other,'' Oldfield said in a radio
interview Monday.
	   ``It's not a matter of racism, it's a matter of cultural
intolerance. We are different. It doesn't mean we're better or
they're better or either of us are worse _ we are simply
different.''
	   Most Asian countries are part of the third world and have
different cultural values, he said.
	   Echoing an earlier Hanson speech to the national Parliament,
Oldfield said Asian immigrants congregated in certain areas and
some could not communicate with the wider community because they
had no English.
	   He blamed past governments for not assimilating migrants by
promoting policies which allowed immigrants not to learn English.

	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ Two U.S. F-16 fighter jets took
off early Monday as part of a NATO show of power over Albania and
Macedonia that allied leaders hope will convince Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to back down from his tough policies in Kosovo
province.
	   ``This is an exercise intended to demonstrate the alliance's
commitment to peace and stability in the region and the alliance's
ability to project power,'' Lt. Gen. Michael Short, commander of
NATO air forces in the alliance's southern Europe division, said at
Aviano Air Base late Sunday.
	   The planes began departing about 7:50 a.m. (0550 GMT) Monday,
leaving from air bases in Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Britain
and the Adriatic Sea. Support planes, including refueling tankers,
already were in the air.
	   The exercise included 80 planes from 13 of NATO's 16 member
countries.

Labor department rules PAL can require pilots to retire early
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Department of Labor has ruled
that financially troubled Philippine Airlines can require its
pilots to retire early, the chief complaint in a crippling strike
by the pilot's union.
	   Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said PAL management followed
the terms of a collective bargaining agreement in ordering the
early retirement last December of Capt. Albino Collantes, 45, a
senior pilot.
	   The management and union were informed of Trajano's ruling on
Monday.
	   The 625-member pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest a
management policy of ordering pilots to retire who have reached 20
years of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   The policy puts 225 pilots in danger of forced retirement, said
Capt. Sotico Lloren, president of the union.
	   PAL, however, said it was following a provision in the
collective bargaining agreement signed by airline and union
officials.
	   Meanwhile, the labor department said the pilots' union has filed
another notice of strike, this time citing alleged unfair labor
practices. The notice was filed by mail last Thursday.
	   The union first filed a notice of strike in December following
Collantes' forced retirement.
	   The strike was finally called June 5 after the union accused
management of filing administrative charges against another pilot
who delayed a flight by returning to the gate for refueling, and of
delays in turning over union dues.
	   The refueling delay will be investigated under proper
procedures, airline officials said.
	   Last week, the airline announced it will no longer accept back
the striking pilots and will sharply scale back its operations.
	   PAL said it plans to concentrate on domestic operations and use
some of its Boeing 747 jets, previously used for long-haul flights,
for shorter domestic routes emanating from Manila.
	   It currently has only 25 management pilots _ senior pilots who
train other pilots.
	   The airline had previously announced plans to cut staff, slash
costs and reduce flights to survive its long-term financial
problems.
	   President Fidel Ramos ordered labor department officials to find
ways to settle the dispute. However, a series of
government-mediated meetings between airline and union
representatives ended without success.
	   PAL said the strike has cost it about 150 million pesos (dlrs
3.8 million) a day in lost revenue. It lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs
202 million) last fiscal year _ three times more than the previous
year.

	   The fighting in Kosovo has sparked alarm that the violence could
spread to neighboring Albania and Macedonia, which have agreed to
let their territory be used for the exercises.
	   The exercise, dubbed Determined Falcon, is meant to show how
quickly and powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces
if needed.
	   The planes will fly down the Adriatic coast into Albanian air
space, making a clockwise circle into Macedonia, before heading
back over Albania and out over the Adriatic Sea, Short said. The
exercise was to last until midday.
	   Asked early Monday if he expected the aircraft to be picked up
by Yugoslav ground radar, Short said ``it's very reasonable to say
the aircraft will be tracked by Yugoslav early warning systems.''
	   ``We will do nothing in this exercise to provoke a response from
the federal republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   More than 300 people have been killed in Kosovo since Yugoslavia
launched a crackdown on the southern province's ethnic Albanian
majority in March. Thousands have fled across the border into
Albania and Macedonia, as well as the Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro.
	   Western leaders want to halt the violence, but have also said
they do not support efforts by ethnic Albanian militants seeking
independence.
	   NATO defense ministers ordered the air exercises on Thursday
during a meeting in Brussels. The ministers also ordered the
alliance's military planners to begin looking at a wide range of
options for future action, including direct intervention in
Yugoslavia with air and ground forces.
	   In the Adriatic sea aboard USS Wasp, Col. Emerson Gardner told
reporters: ``We need to show the people that need to know exactly
what we can do.''
	   The Wasp will throw four Harrier jump-jet attack aircraft into
the exercise, code-named Determined Falcon.
	   Planes are departing from 15 bases in five nations. Only Iceland
and Luxembourg, which have no air forces, and Canada, which could
not deploy planes to Europe on such short notice, will not
participate.
	   Among the aircraft taking part will be F-16s from Portugal,
F-18s from Spain, U.S. Air Force F-16s and KC-135 tankers, and
Marine Corps EA-6B early warning planes.
	   The NATO exercise will take place before Russian President Boris
Yeltsin has an opportunity to try to persuade Milosevic to back off
in Kosovo. Milosevic is in Moscow Monday and Tuesday. The Russian
leader has promised to use what influence he has on Milosevic to
defuse the situation.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed any direct intervention in
Yugoslavia, considering that all of the diplomatic options have yet
to be exhausted.
	   Emerson noted the Serbs have wide-range fighters from old MiG
21s to the newer MiG 29s, with surface-to-air missiles.
	   ``But all the risks have been assessed and we have taken
measures against it,'' Emerson said without elaborating. ``We feel
the mission can be accomplished safely.''
	   Short would not say just how close the allied planes will come
to the Yugoslav border. But Emerson said: ``We will be close enough
that the Serbs will know NATO will be there.''

New campaign seen helping offset declining tourism from Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Tourist Commission on
Monday said it will spend U.S. dlrs 88 million (Australian dollars
150 million) on an advertising campaign showcasing Australia in
Europe, the United States, Asia and New Zealand.
	   The campaign aims to offset some of the losses to the U.S. dlr
3.54 billion (Australian dollar 6 billion) annual tourism industry
caused by a drop in visitors from Asia because of the regional
economic crisis.
	   The commission, a government marketing body, will draw the money
partly from its government funding and partly from tourism sector
companies for the four-year campaign, said spokeswoman Katrina
Fraser.
	   In the May federal budget, the government increased the
commission's funding by U.S. dlrs 30 million (Australian dollars 50
million) to U.S. dlrs 212 million (Australian dollars 359 million)
over the four years to June 30, 2002.
	   ``Our budget decision to boost funding to the commission means
we are able to proceed with a wider range of global activities _
including this new advertising campaign,'' said Tourism Minister
Andrew Thomson.
	   ``This campaign will see the ATC increasing its focus on the
United States, the United Kingdom and Germany _ markets which hold
the greatest potential for Australia over the next few years.''
	   Commission managing director John Morse said the new campaign
will shift away from the traditional focus on Australia's physical
dimensions toward presenting the ``personality'' of the country.
	   The campaign will incorporate television and print advertising,
tactical campaigns with industry partners, Internet marketing,
direct mail and trade advertising, the commission said.
	   The new Asia campaign is expected to be launched later this
year, while the new campaigns for the other target countries will
be launched in early 1999.

Share plunge on high interest rates, weak yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices continued their weak run Monday,
with Hong Kong's benchmark index tumbling 4.7 percent by midday on
sharply higher local interbank rates.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed the morning session at its
intraday low of 7,545.87 points, down 369.57 points from the
previous close.
	   The indicator shed 7.6 percent last week to end the week at
7,915.44, its lowest level in more than three years.
	   Monday's plunge ``is mainly due to currency instability. The yen
has weakened to around 145 (per U.S. dollar) and interbank rates
are rising,'' said Emerald Yuen, dealing director of Mees Pierson
Securities (Asia) Ltd.
	   Earlier Monday, the U.S. dollar soared at one point above 145
yen for the first time in eight years in Tokyo amid growing
pessimism about the Japanese economy.
	   The falling yen prompted Hong Kong interbank rates to surge
early Monday to levels not seen since January, when the stock
market was hit by a mini-crash and the Hong Kong dollar was rocked
by international speculators.
	   The volatile overnight Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate is
quoted at 15.0 percent, up from 6.0 percent late Friday. The
three-month rate is 16.25 percent, up from 12.5 percent late
Friday.
	   A dealer with a local bank said interbank rates spiked after the
spot Hong Kong dollar was sold off in London and New York Friday
after the close of the local market.
	   The local jitters were compounded early Monday by a newspaper
report quoting China's executive vice premier Li Lanqing as saying
Beijing will be in ``a very difficult position if the Japanese yen
continued its fall.''
	   While the reported comment was in line with comments by a
People's Bank of China official last week, it unnerved an already
skittish market.
	   The higher interest rates are plaguing Hong Kong stocks because
they will trim corporate earnings considerably.
	   In an address on the first day of an Australian visit, Hong Kong
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa told a dinner of business and
academic leaders that Japan should be doing more to stabilize the
economic turmoil in the region.
	   ``No one should doubt the tremendous sacrifice that both Hong
Kong and the mainland of China are bearing to prevent the problems
of currency depreciation from cascading,'' Tung said.
	   Investors were also waiting for unemployment figures for the
three months to May to be announced late Monday. The data is
expected to show a sharp increase in unemployment to above 4
percent, higher than the 3.9 percent for the three months to April.
	   ``The market has already discounted bad unemployment news into
share prices but once the headlines hit people,'' it will still be
a shock, said Henry Lui, an analyst at Mansion House Securities.
``Investors prefer to keep their money in their pockets.''

Fifteen killed in fire in condemned building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fifteen people, including five children, were
killed when an apartment fire broke out in a southeastern Russian
region, news agencies reported Monday.
	   Four people were rushed to a hospital near the settlement of
Olovyannaya, 250 kilometers (156 miles) south of the southeastern
city of Chita, with burns of varying degrees after the Sunday fire,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The blaze broke out in a condemned wooden building, which housed
40 apartments. Some tenants in the aged structure had already moved
elsewhere, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The dead bodies were found by firefighters, who battled the fire
for five hours before putting it out, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Local investigators are trying to determine the cause of the
fire.

Fighting escalates in Kosovo as NATO prepares for show of force

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting escalated on several Kosovo
fronts, with Serbs and ethnic Albanians accusing each other of
starting clashes that killed at least five people.
	   Meanwhile, NATO warplanes flew across the skies early Monday
outside Kosovo's borders in an effort to intimidate the Serbs into
stopping attacks on the ethnic Albanians.
	   On Sunday, Serb forces launched 500 grenades into villages in
the Decani area in western Kosovo, according to the Kosovo
Information center, which is close to the pro-independence Albanian
leadership.
	   In the provincial capital of Pristina, Serbian police colonel
Novica Zdravkovic said ethnic Albanian militants killed two
policemen and injured two others in separate incidents in Kosovo's
southwestern Djakovica region and the Decani area.
	   More than 300 people have died since the crisis escalated in
March, when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown on separatist ethnic Albanians fighting to free the
province from Serbia.
	   Fearing the conflict could spill over into neighboring Albania
and Macedonia, Western nations warned Milosevic last week that he
must change his hard-line policy or face the threat of force.
	   NATO warplanes took off early Monday for simulated air attacks
in Albania and Macedonia in an effort to intimidate the Serbs into
stopping attacks on the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Albania and Macedonia, countries neighboring Kosovo, have agreed
to let their territory be used for the exercises, which were
ordered by allied defense ministers Thursday.
	   NATO also has called for its military planners to study options
for even tougher action, while insisting that it is only studying
its options to be ready for any political decisions.
	   Outside Belgrade on Sunday, Yugoslavia demonstrated its own air
power in an airshow displaying military helicopters and planes,
including Russian-made MiG29 jets. The show is an annual event.
	   The main ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic League of Kosovo,
said Serbian military and police forces ``began a broad attack''
with heavy artillery against three villages in the Djakovica area,
near the border with Albania.
	   The Kosovo Information Center added that Serb police brought
reinforcements of about 40 armored vehicles and 15 tanks into the
region.
	   The center also said Serb forces launched grenades against a
cluster of villages northwest of Pristina in the Drenica region,
where the government crackdown began earlier this year.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed, since
police and ethnic Albanian militants, known as the Kosovo
Liberation Army, have set up a maze of blockades in contested areas
across the province.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement. But since the
crackdown began, the KLA has grown stronger and more popular among
ethnic Albanians.
	   The KLA controls an estimated 40 percent of the province, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   About 50,000 people have fled the fighting, many of them across
the border to Albania or Macedonia, or to the province of
Montenegro, which together with Serbia forms Yugoslavia.

Philippine stocks, peso plunge on weak yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks and the peso fell
sharply Monday as a result of the Japanese yen's continued
weakness, traders said.
	   The weaker yen stoked fears of a further economic contraction in
the region and raised the specter that China may devalue its
currency, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index plunged 82.16
points, or 4.5 percent, to 1,746.86, a new five-month low. The
index fell at one point as much as 102 points.
	   The main index fell 88.85 points on Thursday. Philippine markets
were closed Friday for the centennial of the country's declaration
of independence from Spanish colonial rule.
	   Traders said the market's closure on Friday may have compounded
its troubles Monday as it caught up with other slumping markets in
the region.
	   Analysts said some bargain-hunting may emerge Tuesday, but doubt
it could force a recovery given the volatility of regional
currencies.
	   BPI Securities Corp. analyst Spencer Yap said investors,
especially foreigners, will probably wait until the currency market
stabilizes before taking a new look at Philippine stocks.
	   Noel Reyes, vice president for research of Anscor Hagedorn
Securities, said it is unlikely Philippine markets will recover
until the Japanese currency settles.
	   ``This looks like the second wave of contagion and this could
prove more serious because it involves Japan,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the peso fell to a four-month low against
the dollar in brisk morning trading Monday, traders said.
	   At midday the dollar averaged 41.175 pesos compared to 40.319
pesos Thursday. It rose at one point as far as 41.880 pesos.
	   The dollar last hit 41 pesos on Feb. 13.
	   Japan's Economic Planning Agency reported on Friday that
economic output fell for the second quarter in a row in the
January-March period, officially throwing Japan into recession by
Western standards.
	   Traders said the peso will continue to align itself with
regional currencies in the coming weeks because of the need for
Philippine exports to remain competitive with other Asian
countries.

Dollar higher, Japanese stock prices fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency
prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar soared above 145 yen for the first
time in eight years Monday in Tokyo amid growing pessimism about
the Japanese economy. Japanese stock prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 145.62 yen at mid-afternoon, crossing the
145-yen level for the first time since August 1990. It is up 1.60
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and well above 144.72 yen Friday in
New York.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 197.16 points, or 1.31
percent, to close at 14,825.17. On Friday, the Nikkei gained 8.29
points, or 0.06 percent.
	   Gross domestic product figures released Friday confirmed what
many investors had feared: Japan's economy is in the midst of its
deepest recession in over 50 years.
	   The world's second-largest economy recorded its worst year in
1997 since the end of World War II, contracting 0.7 percent, the
Economic Planning Agency said.
	   That sent investors scurrying for cover, dumping yen for
dollars. One concern is that Japan may be forced to cut interest
rates from already historic lows.
	   An interest rate cut would make overseas investments look more
attractive because of their relatively higher rates of return.
While the Bank of Japan's policy board decided Friday to leave
rates unchanged, traders pointed out the vote wasn't unanimous,
with some favoring a cut.
	   ``If some members are actually in favor of credit easing, that
would certainly accelerate investment in foreign bonds by
institutional investors,'' said Ryuichi Takami, a senior trader at
Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   There is also increasing doubt that Japan's central bank could
stem the yen's fall even if it follows through on threats to
intervene in currency markets. Japan's economic fundamentals are
simply too weak, and other countries have shown little enthusiasm
for propping up the yen.
	   ``Even if there is intervention, it will be solo,'' said Seiji
Masumoto, a dealer at Nippon Trust Bank Ltd.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stocks fell amid worries the
weakening yen may throw the rest of Asia into renewed economic
turmoil.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section ended down 10.04 points or 0.85 percent, at 1,167.21. The
TOPIX closed down 1.56 points, or 0.13 percent, on Friday.
	   A weak yen helps Japan's exporters at the expense of the rest of
Asia. As the yen falls, Japanese products become cheaper in key
markets like the United States, snatching market share from Asian
competitors.
	   That deprives hard-pressed economies like Thailand of
desperately needed export revenues and foreign currency.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond dropped to 1.185 percent from Friday's close of
1.210 percent. Its price rose to 112.12 yen from 111.94 yen.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ The leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia have
agreed to immediately stop using air strikes in their border war,
according to a U.S. presidential spokesman.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke by telephone with the leaders
of the two countries while flying Sunday from Los Angeles to
Washington, deputy press secretary Joe Lockhart said.
	   While the agreement does not end the border dispute between the
Horn of Africa countries, the White House said it ``can help
restore the mutual confidence necessary to achieve a peaceful
resolution of the conflict as quickly as possible.''
	   Eritrea welcomed the air-strike ban as a first step towards
meeting its call for a total halt to hostilities.
	   ``I think the Ethiopian goverment is beginning to realize that
force is not going to solve this problem,'' said government
spokesman Yemane Gebreab. ``We do hope they will not want to fight
on the ground anymore either.''
	   There was no immediate comment from the Ethiopians.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea, one-time allies who less than a decade ago
were part of the same country, have battled since early May over
several stretches of their common border with the loss of hundreds
of lives. No skirmishes have been reported since Thursday.
	   Ethiopia has insisted that Eritrea withdraw its troops from more
than half a dozen disputed areas, the largest being the
160-square-mile (410-square-kilometer) Yirga triangle _ before
peace talks can begin. Eritrea has refused, claiming it owns the
disputed territory, based on boundaries drawn by Italy when it
occupied the country in 1885.
	   The White House statement said the moratorium against air
strikes, and threats of air strikes, ``will continue indefinitely
or until such time as either party concludes that any prospect for
a peace process has come to an end and provides formal advance
notice to the U.S. government that it will no longer respect this
moratorium.''
	   The statement also thanked Italy for diplomatic efforts that
helped to secure the agreement.
	   Italian envoy Rino Serri met late Saturday with Eritrean's
President Isaias Afwerki before flying Sunday to the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa.
	   Other diplomatic efforts were in the works. Five leaders
appointed by the Organization of African Unity planned to begin a
mission later in the week.
	   To avert a full-scale war that could destabilize the region, the
African delegation is seeking a plan that would let both Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Isaias back down with honor.
	   The agreement to stop air strikes was the first sign that the
two men are willing to compromise.
	   Also, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was trying to arrange a
cease-fire on the ground, according to Eritrean foreign minister
Haile Woldensae.
	   Eritrean bombing raids have killed at least 48 civilians in two
attacks on northern Ethiopia. Ethiopian warplanes killed four
people in two attacks at a military-civilian airport on the
outskirts of the Eritrean capital, Asmara.
	   Commercial flights to Eritrea have been halted since the first
bombing on June 5. Fearing continued violence, embassies evacuated
thousands of their citizens in chartered flights.
	   Ships have hovered off the coast, fearing the Ethiopians would
bomb the port of Massawa as they did during Eritrea's 30-year war
for independence.
	   Eritrea has complained bitterly to international officials about
the effective air and sea blockade.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991. Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   After just seven years of peace, many Eritreans want no more
war.
	   Swaddled in traditional gauzy white, hundreds of barefoot women
prayed for peace Sunday at Eritrea's biggest Orthodox church.
	   ``I pray, `Please come back, my baby,''' said Hiwat, mother of a
28-year-old soldier sent to the front.

members of the United Nations, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto
warned Monday that South Asia was ``dangerously close to war.''
	   With India and Pakistan _ now proven nuclear powers _ facing
each other across a disputed border in the Kashmir region,
regularly lobbing mortars and firing artillery at each other, Ms.
Bhutto said the key to peace is a settlement of the 51-year dispute
over Kashmir.
	   Split between the two uneasy neighbors after the British
departed the subcontinent in 1947, Kashmir has been the flash point
of two previous wars between Pakistan and India.
	   Ms. Bhutto, who was twice elected prime minister, warned that
economic sanctions will only exacerbate an already volatile
situation.
	   The leaders of both Pakistan and India also have rejected as
counterproductive economic sanctions recommended last Friday at a
meeting in Britain of the foreign ministers of the world's major
powers.
	   In her letter to the security council, Ms. Bhutto urged nations
to ``put aside punitive measures _ sanctions will not put the
nuclear genie back in the bottle _ and assume a proactive,
constructive and positive role in the worsening South Asian
crisis.''
	   Ms. Bhutto asked that U.S. President Bill Clinton ``chair a
peace process on Kashmir.''
	   China, Russia and Britain _ all Security Council members _
should be included in a process modeled on the Irish peace talks
and subsequent accord, she said.
	   Ms. Bhutto urged India to drastically reduce its troops in
Kashmir _ estimated at 600,000 _ and open its half of Kashmir to
international human rights monitors.
	   She suggested that Pakistan give ``observer status'' at Kashmiri
negotiations to an umbrella group claiming to represent nearly a
dozen Kashmiri groups. Also Ms. Bhutto urged Pakistan to open its
borders with India.
	   ``Nuclear parity demands a maturity that we no longer have the
luxury to ignore,'' Ms. Bhutto wrote to Clinton. ``For this, we
need your active and concerted leadership beyond the nuclear
issue.''

One of China's oldest pandas in captivity dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ One of China's oldest pandas in captivity has
died, according to state media reports.
	   Zhuzhu, who was 31, died June 8 from respiratory failure in the
zoo in Guiyang, capital of southwest Guizhou province, the Xinhua
News Agency reported Sunday. Pandas live an average 16 years in the
wild and 20 to 25 years in captivity, the report said.
	   Xinhua said doctors of the Guiyang Medical College tried
emergency measures to save the panda's life.
	   The country's oldest panda is 36-year-old Dudu kept in the zoo
in the central industrial city of Wuhan.
	   The giant panda is highly endangered in China. Only about 1,000
are believed to remain in the wild.

U.S. embassy allows its staff to return to Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy said Monday it has
allowed American diplomats and their families who fled Indonesia
last month during riots and protests to return.
	   The embassy also dropped a warning to American citizens to avoid
travel to Indonesia unless the trip was essential, saying that
visitors should exercise caution and avoid crowds.
	   ``Although the violence has subsided, the political and economic
situation in Indonesia remains unsettled,'' the embassy said in a
statement.
	   Riots last month in the capital, Jakarta, killed more than 1,000
people by some estimates and contributed to the downfall of
President Suharto, the authoritarian leader of Indonesia for three
decades.
	   Suharto's popularity plunged as Indonesia slipped into economic
turmoil that has stripped millions of people of their jobs and
forced many business enterprises to close.
	   Thousands of foreigners, including many U.S. diplomats, fled the
city on chartered flights during the unrest.
	   Also Monday, several dozen protesters held a peaceful rally
outside the U.S. Embassy. They accused the United States of trying
to delay disbursement of aid that is part of a dlrs 43 billion
bailout package for Indonesia led by the International Monetary
Fund.
	   The United States is a key player in the Washington-based IMF,
which suspended the aid because of the political turmoil.
	   Indonesian legislators also want U.S. President Bill Clinton and
the U.S. Congress to help free up the assistance. On Saturday, they
delivered two letters with that request to the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Stapleton Roy, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   The letters were signed by 89 of the 500 members of Parliament.

Foreign Ministry: Yeltsin-Milosevic meeting ``potentially

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday called
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's imminent meeting with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin ``potentially decisive'' in
defusing the explosive conflict in the Kosovo province of southern
Yugoslavia.
	   ``We place greater hopes on this meeting'' than on the exercises
NATO began Monday over Albania and Macedonia, said Vladimir
Rakhmanin, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official, in comments
reported by the Interfax news agency.
	   Milosevic is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Monday evening and
meet with Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin is expected to deliver a stark warning to Milosevic that
the crisis facing him is far more serious than he appears to
realize, said a western official speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   NATO planes began taking off early Monday from air bases in
Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Britain and the Adriatic Sea to fly
maneuvers over Albania and Macedonia, both of which border on
Kosovo. The exercise included 80 planes from 13 of NATO's 16 member
countries.
	   The Russian government has strongly opposed any direct
intervention in Yugoslavia, considering that all of the diplomatic
options have yet to be exhausted.
	   The Defense Ministry said Monday that Russia has recalled its
military envoy to NATO, Lt.-Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, Interfax and the
ITAR-Tass news agencies reported. No explanation was given.
	   The Foreign Ministry urged the western alliance to take care
that its exercises ``not provoke either the Albanian community of
Kosovo or Belgrade to escalate (tension), and give diplomats the
possibility to work on regulating the Kosovo conflict,'' Rakhmanin
was quoted as saying.
	   Russia considers it ``necessary to use first of all political
means for resolving the conflict in Kosovo,'' Rakhmanin said.

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of East Timorese students in
bright blue and yellow jackets demonstrated Monday for a vote on
independence from Indonesian control.
	   The protesters, who also want Indonesia to release jailed rebel
leader Xanana Gusmao, have stepped up rallies urging the Indonesian
military to withdraw from the former Portuguese colony.
	   President B.J. Habibie, whose predecessor, Suharto, invaded East
Timor in 1975, has said Indonesia will not relinquish control.
	   Instead, Habibie has suggested East Timor may be granted a
special status, which would likely give some measure of autonomy to
the half-island territory.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's annexation of
East Timor as its 27th province. In the 1970s, tens of thousands of
East Timorese died in fighting, famine and disease that followed
Indonesia's takeover.
	   Students at the rally at East Timor University in Dili, the
territory's capital, waved banners and chanted slogans calling for
the release of Gusmao, a revered separatist rebel who is serving a
20-year sentence in a Jakarta jail.
	   Several protesters wore headbands that read, ``Independence.''
	   Some critics warn that the poor territory can ill afford
independence because it has grown economically dependent on
Indonesia. Independence could also stir up internal differences
among the local population of more than 800,000, critics have said.
	   Also Monday, a group of East Timorese students went to the
National Commission on Human Rights in Jakarta to complain about
police handling of a protest by hundreds of separatist East
Timorese at the foreign ministry on Friday.
	   Officers broke up the protest, clubbing some demonstrators and
herding them onto buses.
	   The commission, which was formed by the government but has often
been critical of the state, lacks the power to take legal action
and can only make recommendations.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A meeting between President Boris Yeltsin and
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, scheduled for Monday, has been
postponed due to illness.
	   This time it wasn't Yeltsin who was feeling under the weather,
but the youthful premier.
	   Kiriyenko had a cold and was running ``a slight temperature,''
said his spokesman Konstantin Voitsekhovich, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The youth of the 35-year-old prime minister made him the target
of scores of jokes at the time of his appointment to the job this
spring. Unlike his boss, Kiriyenko has no history of frequent
illnesses.
	   Kiriyenko was to work at his country residence Monday,
Voitsekhovich was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass and Interfax
news agencies.
	   He planned to work on the government's program to reduce the
budget deficit and stabilize Russian financial markets, which have
fallen sharply since late May. Kiriyenko had been expected to
discuss the program with Yeltsin during the meeting Monday.
	   Yeltsin was still scheduled to meet with Deputy Premier Boris
Nemtsov, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin and a number of other
officials on Monday.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Incumbent president Murtaza Rakhimov easily won a
second term in the Russian republic of Bashkotorstan, according to
preliminary results released Monday.

agency.
	   Overall turnout for the vote in the southern republic was more
than 68 percent, making the election valid.

 &UR; With BC-Australia-Queensland-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Electoral support for the One Nation
party shows Australians are concerned about the level of Asian
immigration, party power broker David Oldfield said Monday.
	   One Nation, led by independent federal legislator Pauline
Hanson, attracted about 23 percent of the vote in Saturday's
Queensland election, giving the party at least nine seats in the
state's Parliament and possible direct influence on government.
	   The federal conservative coalition government, whose parties
suffered most from a defection to One Nation, is concerned that the
party's popularity will be spread nationally.
	   Oldfield said Hanson's policies had struck a chord with a
disaffected public increasingly wary about the ``Asianization'' of
Australia.
	   ``Australians, like Asians and like everybody else, are a little
culturally intolerant of each other,'' Oldfield said in a radio
interview Monday.
	   ``It's not a matter of racism, it's a matter of cultural
intolerance. We are different. It doesn't mean we're better or
they're better or either of us are worse _ we are simply
different.''
	   Senior government ministers rejected this assessment, saying
support for One Nation reflected fear among Queensland voters about
the pace of trade liberalization and globalization.
	   ``Much of what happened on Saturday was not an endorsement of
things Pauline Hanson has said, it was a cry from the heart of
rural Queensland who are feeling insecure at a time of rapid
change,'' said Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson.
	   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, currently visiting Egypt,
said: ``Our exports to Asia and elsewhere are the lifeblood of our
country _ provide jobs and our prosperity .... Politicians who run
around saying you can cut yourself off from the rest of the world
are people who would simply destroy Australia as we know it.''
	   Oldfield said most Asian countries are part of the Third World
and have different cultural values.
	   Echoing an earlier Hanson speech to the national Parliament,
Oldfield said Asian immigrants congregated in certain areas and
some could not communicate with the wider community because they
had no English.
	   He blamed past governments for not assimilating migrants by
promoting policies that allowed immigrants not to learn English.

NATO allies give Milosevic a lesson in power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further details &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) - NATO fighters and reconnaissance
aircraft roared off into the Monday morning sunshine give Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic a lesson in power and persuade him to
think again in Kosovo.
	   Eighty-four aircraft from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries were
conducting several hours of exercises over Albania and Macedonia in
hopes of intimidating the Yugoslav president by showing how quickly
and powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces if
needed.
	   ``This is an exercise intended to demonstrate the alliance's
commitment to peace and stability in the region and the alliance's
ability to project power into the region,'' said Lt. Gen. Michael
Short, commander of NATO air forces in the alliance's southern
Europe division.
	   Taking off from this NATO air base snuggled at the foot of the
Dolomite Mountains, the aircraft flew down the Adriatic coast, then
into Albanian airspace, turning a clockwise circle into Macedonia
and back across Albania in what Short called a ``wagon train'' 120
miles (200 kilometers) long.
	   The planes began departing about 7:50 a.m. (0550 GMT) Monday,
leaving from air bases in Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Britain
and the Adriatic Sea. Support planes, including refueling tankers,
already were in the air. It was expected to end about midday.
	   First of the 24 aircraft departing Aviano were two American
F-16s, followed by four Spanish F-18s, a tanker and another half
dozen American F-16s.
	   ``This is a model for the NATO of the 21st century,'' enthused
Short, saying Monday's maneuvers showed just how fast the alliance
could react to events outside its traditional territory ``to
rapidly mass power where it's needed.''
	   The fighting in Kosovo has sparked alarm that the violence could
spread to neighboring Albania and Macedonia, which have agreed to
let their territory be used for the exercises.
	   The exercise, code-named Determined Falcon, is meant to show how
quickly and powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces
if needed.
	   Asked early Monday if he expected the aircraft to be picked up
by Yugoslav ground radar, Short said ``it's very reasonable to say
the aircraft will be tracked by Yugoslav early warning systems.''
	   ``We will do nothing in this exercise to provoke a response from
the federal republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   In the Adriatic sea aboard USS Wasp, Col. Emerson Gardner told
reporters: ``We need to show the people that need to know exactly
what we can do.''
	   The Wasp will throw four Harrier jump-jet attack aircraft into
the exercise.
	   Planes, which are departing from 15 bases in five nations, are
being provided by all NATO members except Iceland and Luxembourg,
which have no air forces, and Canada, which could not deploy planes
to Europe on such short notice.
	   Among the aircraft taking part were F-16s from Portugal, F-18s
from Spain, U.S. Air Force F-16s and KC-135 tankers, and Marine
Corps EA-6B early warning planes.
	   The air exercise was ordered by NATO defense ministers on
Thursday during their meeting in Brussels. The ministers also
ordered the alliance's military planners to begin looking at a wide
range of options for future action, including direct intervention
in Yugoslavia with air and ground forces.
	   Much of the world has been aghast as Milosevic's Serb-led army
and police cracked down on dissent in Kosovo province, inhabited
mostly by ethnic Albanians. More than 300 people have been killed
and thousands have fled across the border into northern Albania.
	   Western leaders want to halt the violence, but they also are at
pains not to be seen giving comfort to the Kosovo Liberation Army,
fighting for independence of the province, which the alliance does
not support.
	   The NATO exercise will take place before Russian President Boris
Yeltsin has an opportunity to try to persuade Milosevic to back off
in Kosovo. Milosevic is in Moscow Monday and Tuesday. The Russian
leader has promised to use what influence he has on Milosevic to
defuse the situation.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed any direct intervention in
Yugoslavia, considering that all of the diplomatic options have yet
to be exhausted.
	   Emerson noted the Serbs have wide-range fighters from old MiG
21s to the newer MiG 29s, with surface-to-air missiles.
	   ``But all the risks have been assessed and we have taken
measures against it,'' Emerson said without elaborating. ``We feel
the mission can be accomplished safely.''
	   Short would not say just how close the allied planes will come
to the Yugoslav border. But Emerson said: ``We will be close enough
that the Serbs will know NATO will be there.''

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A small bomb exploded in front of
a regional court in north Moravia early Monday but nobody was
injured in the blast, the news agency CTK reported.
	   The agency said the explosive, hidden in a garbage can in front
of a regional court in Prerov, 310 kilometers (193 miles) east of
Prague, went off shortly after midnight Monday.
	   Nobody was injured in the blast, and a car parked nearby was
only slightly damaged, CTK said.
	   It quoted judge Jana Tylova as saying that no important trials
which could provoke such attack were scheduled for Monday.

Asian markets extend losses as yen falls further
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stocks and currencies plunged Monday on
worries about economic weakness in Japan and the yen's fall to an
eight-year low against the U.S. dollar.
	   Share prices in Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, the Philippines,
Singapore, and South Korea all dived.
	   In midafternoon in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 145.62 yen,
up from 144.33 late Friday in New York and 144.53 in London. The
dollar was above 145 yen for the first time since August 1990.
	   The weakness of the Japanese currency hurt stocks throughout the
region.
	   In Tokyo, the key Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell
below the 15,000 mark for the first time in five months.
	   The average dropped 197.16 points, or 1.31 percent, closing at
14,825.17, the lowest close since 14,755.94 on Jan. 13.
	   Investors fear the yen's continuing slide could lead to another
round of currency devaluations in Asia and trigger a global
recession.
	   On Friday, Japan reported that its gross domestic product fell
1.3 percent in the first quarter compared with the previous
quarter, an annual rate of 5.3 percent. The figure confirmed that
the world's second-largest economy is in the midst of its deepest
recession in more than 50 years.
	   The report prompted many investors to dump yen for dollars out
of concern that Japan may be forced to cut interest rates from
already historic lows. An interest rate cut would make overseas
investments look more attractive because of their relatively higher
rates of return.
	   But dealers said the main reason for the dollar's strength was
growing speculation that Japan's central bank won't be able to gain
the cooperation of other major central banks in defending the yen.
	   Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index had tumbled 4.7 percent by
midday as local interbank rates surged to levels not seen since
January. Rates rose as the falling yen threatened to drag down the
Hong Kong dollar.
	   The fall ``is mainly due to currency instability. The yen has
weakened to around 145 (per U.S. dollar) and interbank rates are
rising,'' said Emerald Yuen, dealing director of Mees Pierson
Securities (Asia) Ltd.
	   The index closed the morning session at its intraday low of
7,545.87 points, after ending last week 7.6 percent lower at
7,915.44, its lowest level in more than three years.
	   Thailand's key Stock Exchange of Thailand index shed 4.3
percent, closing the morning session at 267.27 points.
	   Philippine shares also fell sharply, with the Philippine Stock
Exchange index plunging 4.5 percent to 1,746.86, a new five-month
low.
	   In South Korea, the benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index
opened the session 1 percent lower at 299.70 points, just below the
psychologically important 300-point support level. On Friday, it
had plunged a record 8.1 percent.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index had
slipped 2 percent by midday to 1,067.49 points.
	   Southeast Asian currencies also fell as investors fled the
region for the safe haven of U.S. dollars.
	   The Singapore dollar continued to slide against the U.S. dollar,
hovering at around 1.7525.
	   The Malaysian ringgit was also down against the U.S. dollar,
trading at 4.0425, compared with 4.0250 in Asian trading late
Friday.
	   In Thailand, the U.S. dollar rose to 43.6500 baht, compared to
43.4700 late Friday.
	   The Indonesian rupiah was down against the U.S. dollar as well.
The dollar was quoted at 14,275, up from 13,800 late Friday.
	   Share prices in Indonesia were mostly down at the opening but
arbitrage-related buying in telecommunications shares led the
Jakarta Composite Index slightly higher.

Road congestion builds early as two-day underground strike starts
</HEADLINE>
to bite &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A partial subway strike clogged roads into London
Monday as thousands of people struggled to get to work.
	   The strike closed 19 stations, including some of the busiest
such as Oxford Circus and Bond Street in the heart of London's
shopping district, while four out of 10 rush hour trains were
canceled.
	   But London Underground, which operates the 243-mile (about
390-kilometer) subway system, said it was running a better service
than it had anticipated.
	   Sixty one percent of trains were running and some lines were
operating normally, it said. The worst affected line was the
Piccadilly, where just 28 percent trains were running.
	   A London Underground spokesman, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity, said he was reluctant to predict the effects of the
strike but said he was surprised by the limited action at the kick
off.
	   	   ``We have had no dramatic reports of overcrowding at station and
at the moment we are getting people to work,'' the spokesman said.
	   The head of the striking Rail, Maritime and Transport union,
Jimmy Knapp, had previously predicted the walkout would cause
``complete stoppage'' of the network.
	   More than 2 million people, including commuters and tourists,
travel every day on the London Underground, popularly known as the
``tube.''
	   Officials were encouraging people to walk or cycle to work when
possible, but with the strike coinciding with England's first game
in the 1998 World Cup soccer tournament, many businesses expected
some workers to take the day off.
	   A front-page cartoon in The Times depicted a man watching the
game on television while his wife holds out the telephone receiver
and says: ``It's your boss _ he says you can have the rest of your
career off.''
	   Members of the union voted for a 48-hour strike after pressing
for government assurances that conditions of service, jobs and
pensions will not be affected by plans for private firms to become
involved in running parts of the network.
	   Knapp said Monday that London Underground has still failed to
give workers the assurances they were seeking. But London
Underground said managers had done all they could to assure staff
over jobs, pay and pensions.
	   The strike is to end at 1729 GMT on Tuesday.

Vietnam donors discuss progress of economic reforms

<TEXT>
	   HUE, Vietnam (AP) _ Striking a supportive note, the
International Monetary Fund said Monday that Vietnamese officials
are aware of the serious problems their economy faces but aren't
yet sure how to solve them.
	   A similar tone was taken by the World Bank as Vietnamese
government officials and the country's major donors began one-day
talks on ways to speed up a lagging economic reform program.
	   ``We are serious friends of Vietnam and we are here because
Vietnam is going through a difficult time externally,'' World Bank
country director Andrew Steer said in a speech, belying the
frustration many donors feel about the slowness of change.
	   Speaking after a closed meeting of the donors and Prime Minister
Than Van Khai, IMF resident representative Eric Offerdal said,
``There is a keen awareness of the problems they face. Clearly,
policy initiatives are on the way.''
	   The donors called the unusual midyear meeting to remind Hanoi of
the pressing need for reforms in the face of the regional economic
crisis. The meeting won't discuss new financial aid for Vietnam _
the dlrs 2.4 billion package for 1998 was agreed last December at a
meeting in Tokyo.
	   In his opening speech, Khai said Vietnam's greatest obstacles to
growth come from its own inefficient economy.
	   Offerdal said Khai's comments were realistic.
	   ``The government is right in pointing out its limited
institutional capacity. It's not an indication of denial, it's a
recognition of an unfortunate fact,'' Offerdal said.
	   Diplomats and economists question how much Khai, viewed as a
reformer, will be able to accomplish. Members of the ruling
Politbureau apparently want reforms in Vietnam to proceed very
slowly.
	   However, some donors are cheered because they believe that the
central bank is finally coming to grips with Vietnam's banking
problem and they also sense that privatization of some of the
country's 6,500 state-owned companies may be speeded up.
	   Donors have said they also want to see a reduction of trade
barriers as Vietnam prepares for membership in the Asian Free Trade
Area and an overhaul of the country's debt-ridden financial sector.
	   They are expected to remind the government that economic reform
is the way Vietnam can protect itself as export and economic growth
slows and foreign investment falls due to a slowdown across Asia.
	   Steer said the Asian crisis is now entering a second and more
``virulent'' phase that ``heralds a recession in the region greater
than has been seen in the last 50 years.''
	   Khai decided late last week that he would attend the morning
session of the meeting, but his opening speech was long on cliches
and short on solutions.
	   He said the government has taken measures to improve the
investment climate, simplify import-export procedures and improve
transparency, and will continue to push economic liberalization.
	   When donors such as the World Bank, IMF, Asian Development Bank,
United Nations Development Program, Japan, France, Sweden and
Australia met in Tokyo last December to pledge aid for 1998, they
warned that exports and foreign investment would be hurt by the
regional slowdown.
	   This has proved to be the case. Vietnam's exports to its
Southeast Asian neighbors fell by 48 percent in the first quarter
of this year as demand slowed in those countries, hard hit by the
regional crisis.
	   Even though Vietnam's overall exports are still growing,
economists expect the 1998 trade deficit to be wider than the dlrs
2.35 billion in 1997 due to continuing import demand.

Taiwan says lack of U.N. membership hampering fight against virus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Lack of access to World Health
Organization medical data has hampered Taiwan's efforts to combat a
deadly intestinal virus, a senior health official said Monday.
	   Health authorities here had to search a variety of international
sources for case histories when the enterovirus 71 struck last
month, said Hsu Kuo-hsiung of the Health Department. That delayed
an accurate identification of the virus that so far has killed 36
children, Hsu said.
	   And if the contagion were to worsen, Taiwan would be poorly
placed to coordinate an international effort to contain it, Hsu
said.
	   ``Of course international cooperation is desirable, but if we
needed help, it would be difficult,'' Hsu said.
	   Taiwan's seat in the United Nations was transferred to China in
1971, excluding it from membership in U.N. organizations including
the WHO, which compiles information on diseases and coordinates
eradication measures against them world wide.
	   Despite the lack of U.N. support, the U.S. Center for Disease
Control has sent three epidemiologists to study the virus, which
health authorities say may have been responsible for three more
deaths since Saturday.
	   Early symptoms of the virus resemble the flu, with fever,
headache or vomiting. Ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on
the hands and feet can also develop. Later, possible deadly
complications can include encephalitis, meningitis, and acute
inflammation of the heart muscle.
	   Hsu said doctors were studying the possibility that a bacterial
infection was worsening effects of the virus in some cases.
	   Taiwan is hit by similar viruses each summer, but this year's
strain has been the most virulent in years, doctors say. Spread by
physical contact, the virus has infected mostly toddlers and young
children who have not been exposed to it previously and lack
antibodies.
	   Some nursery schools have been closed in parts of central Taiwan
hit hardest by the virus. Authorities have advised parents to
ensure their children wash frequently and to avoid taking them out
in public.

Chinese Communist Party's leading paper turns 50
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The People's Daily, the voice of China's ruling
Communist Party, published its 50th anniversary edition Monday
doing what it has always done _ promoting the image and ideas of
Chinese leaders.
	   The top half of the front page showed photographs of China's
``three generations'' of communist leaders _ Mao Tse-tung, Deng
Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin. Mao and Jiang were shown separately
reading the paper, and Deng was photographed looking up from a desk
where the paper lay folded in front of him.
	   A front-page commentary promised the People's Daily would
continue to focus on the ``art of propaganda'' by improving its
delivery of the news. The party and government closely supervises
all news media.
	   ``Adhere to correct guidance of the mass media, actively serve
as propaganda for the party's theories and policies, and play the
role as the front line for the country's newspapers,'' Jiang wrote
in an anniversary inscription the paper published beside the
photos.
	   The party uses the People's Daily to announce policies, tout
models of reform and cover the country's leaders in flattering if
bland terms. Other national newspapers follow the lead of the paper
and top propaganda officials.
	   The staid paper has been losing readers as China's publishing
world has become more diverse with tabloids, magazines and books.
In January, the paper introduced new weekly sections on the
economy, arts and society.

Eritrea, Ethiopia agree to halt air strikes

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ The leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia have
agreed to immediately stop using air strikes in their border war,
according to a U.S. presidential spokesman.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke by telephone with the leaders
of the two countries while flying Sunday from Los Angeles to
Washington, deputy press secretary Joe Lockhart said.
	   While the agreement does not end the border dispute between the
Horn of Africa countries, the White House said it ``can help
restore the mutual confidence necessary to achieve a peaceful
resolution of the conflict as quickly as possible.''
	   Eritrea welcomed the air-strike ban as a first step towards
meeting its call for a total halt to hostilities.
	   ``I think the Ethiopian goverment is beginning to realize that
force is not going to solve this problem,'' said government
spokesman Yemane Gebreab. ``We do hope they will not want to fight
on the ground anymore either.''
	   But Ethiopia on Monday reiterated its demand that Eritrea
withdraw from disputed land.
	   ``There will be no direct talks or negotiations through third
parties before Eritrea withdraws its troops from our territory,''
government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said in the Ethiopian capital
Addis Ababa.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea, one-time allies who less than a decade ago
were part of the same country, have battled since early May over
several stretches of their common border with the loss of hundreds
of lives. No skirmishes have been reported since Thursday.
	   Ethiopia has insisted that Eritrea withdraw its troops from more
than half a dozen disputed areas, the largest being the
160-square-mile (410-square-kilometer) Yirga triangle _ before
peace talks can begin. Eritrea has refused, claiming it owns the
disputed territory, based on boundaries drawn by Italy when it
occupied the country in 1885.
	   The White House statement said the moratorium against air
strikes, and threats of air strikes, ``will continue indefinitely
or until such time as either party concludes that any prospect for
a peace process has come to an end and provides formal advance
notice to the U.S. government that it will no longer respect this
moratorium.''
	   The statement also thanked Italy for diplomatic efforts that
helped to secure the agreement.
	   Italian envoy Rino Serri met Saturday with Eritrean's President
Isaias Afwerki and on Sunday with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi.
	   Other diplomatic efforts were in the works. Five leaders
appointed by the Organization of African Unity planned to begin a
mission later in the week.
	   To avert a full-scale war that could destabilize the region, the
African delegation is seeking a plan that would let both Meles
Zenawi and Isaias back down with honor.
	   Also, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was trying to arrange a
cease-fire on the ground, according to Eritrean foreign minister
Haile Woldensae.
	   Eritrean bombing raids have killed at least 48 civilians in two
attacks on northern Ethiopia. Ethiopian warplanes killed four
people in two attacks at a military-civilian airport on the
outskirts of the Eritrean capital, Asmara.
	   Commercial flights to Eritrea have been halted since the first
bombing on June 5. Fearing continued violence, embassies evacuated
thousands of their citizens in chartered flights.
	   Ships have hovered off the coast, fearing the Ethiopians would
bomb the port of Massawa as they did during Eritrea's 30-year war
for independence.
	   Eritrea has complained bitterly to international officials about
the effective air and sea blockade.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991. Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   After just seven years of peace, many Eritreans want no more
war.
	   Swaddled in traditional gauzy white, hundreds of barefoot women
prayed for peace Sunday at Eritrea's biggest Orthodox church.
	   ``I pray, `Please come back, my baby,''' said Hiwat, mother of a
28-year-old soldier sent to the front.

NATO-led peace force arrests Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peace force
arrested a Bosnian Serb suspected of committing war crimes while
running a detention facility in eastern Bosnia, NATO officials said
Monday.
	   Milorad Krnojelac, a captain in the former Yugoslav army, was a
commander at the infamous Foca prison, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southeast of Sarajevo, between April 1992 and August 1993, NATO
said in a press release.
	   Maj. Sheena Thomson, a NATO spokeswoman, said the peace force
arrested Krnojelac without incident around 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday
in Foca.
	   The press release said Krnojelac surrendered to soldiers when it
was clear his ``attempts to evade (authorities) were at an end.''
The arrest ``resulted from opportunities that developed recently''
when peacekeepers confirmed Krnojelac's identity and location.
	   ``He is charged with permitting prolonged torture and beatings,
countless killings and forced labor practices,'' the press release
said.
	   The Hague tribunal accused Krnojelac of being present during the
separation and segregation of non-Serb detainees, for ``providing
inhumane conditions'' in the Foca prison, as well as for assisting
in the deportation of Muslims, who made up the majority of the
population in Foca, the press release said.
	   Krnojelac is among an unknown number of war crimes suspects
contained on a secret list of indictees compiled by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. In addition, the names
of 75 Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim indictees have been released.
	   Thomson said that immediately after the arrest, NATO took
Krnojelac to the Hague.
	   So far, the peace force has arrested nine war-crimes suspects,
most of them Bosnian Serbs.

Anti-flea treatment thumbs-up from most European Union countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ An anti-flea treatment allowing cat
owners to stroke their pets without getting chemicals on their
hands has been approved by regulators in most European countries,
Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis said Monday.
	   The advantage of the new injectable treatment, Novartis said, is
the lack of chemical residue on the animal, which means owners can
pet their cats without worry. Half of all cats in Europe develop a
new flea infestation every year, the company said.
	   The six-month flea treatment can be marketed in Austria, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg.
	   The approvals came under the European Union's decentralized
licensing system of certain products.

NATO allies give Milosevic a lesson in power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES and UPDATES with further details of exercises; quote
from Russian foriegn ministry official. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ NATO fighters and reconnaissance
aircraft roared off into the skies early Monday in a show of power
that allied leaders hope will persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to back down from his tough policies in Kosovo province.
	   Eighty-four aircraft from 13 NATO members were conducting hours
of exercises over Albania and Macedonia to intimidate the Yugoslav
president by showing how quickly and powerfully the Western
alliance could deploy its forces.
	   ``This is an exercise intended to demonstrate the alliance's
commitment to peace and stability in the region and the alliance's
ability to project power into the region,'' Lt. Gen. Michael Short,
commander of NATO air forces in the alliance's southern Europe
division said at Aviano Air Base late Sunday.
	   Much of the world has been aghast at Milosevic's Serb-led army
and police crackdown on dissent in Kosovo province, inhabited
mostly by ethnic Albanians. More than 300 people have been killed
and thousands have fled across the border into Albania, Macedonia,
as well as the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   Western leaders want to halt the violence, but they also are at
pains not to be seen giving comfort to the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. The alliance does not support the drive for
independence in Kosovo.
	   Taking off from this NATO air base snuggled at the foot of the
Dolomite Mountains, the aircraft were to fly down the Adriatic
coast, then into Albanian airspace, turning a clockwise circle into
Macedonia and back across Albania.
	   The planes began taking off about 7:50 a.m. (0550 GMT) Monday
from air bases in Italy, Greece, France, Germany and Britain as
well as ships in the Adriatic Sea. Support planes, including
refueling tankers, already were in the air. The exercise was
expected to end about midday.
	   Two American F-16s were the first of 24 aircraft departing
Aviano. They were followed by four Spanish F-18s, a tanker and
another six American F-16s.
	   ``This is a model for the NATO of the 21st century,'' said
Short, explaining that the maneuvers showed how fast the alliance
could ``rapidly mass power where it's needed'' _ even outside its
traditional territory.
	   The fighting in Kosovo has sparked alarm that the violence could
spread to neighboring Albania and Macedonia, which gave use of
their territory for the exercise, code-named Determined Falcon.
	   Asked early Monday if he expected the aircraft to be picked up
by Yugoslav ground radar, Short said ``it's very reasonable to say
the aircraft will be tracked by Yugoslav early warning systems.''
	   ``We will do nothing in this exercise to provoke a response from
the federal republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   The NATO exercise will take place before Russian President Boris
Yeltsin has an opportunity to try to persuade Milosevic to back off
in Kosovo. Milosevic is in Moscow Monday and Tuesday. The Russian
leader has promised to use what influence he has on Milosevic to
defuse the situation.
	   ``We place greater hopes on this meeting'' than on NATO's Monday
exercises, said Vladimir Rakhmanin, a high-ranking Russian Foreign
Ministry official, in comments reported by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed any direct intervention in
Yugoslavia, considering that all of the diplomatic options have yet
to be exhausted.
	   The Defense Ministry said Monday that Russia has recalled its
military envoy to NATO, Lt.-Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, Interfax and the
ITAR-Tass news agencies reported. No explanation was given.
	   Planes for the exercise were being provided by all NATO members
except Iceland and Luxembourg, which have no air forces, and
Canada, which could not deploy planes to Europe on such short
notice.
	   The air exercise was ordered by NATO defense ministers on
Thursday during their meeting in Brussels. The ministers also
ordered the alliance's military planners to begin examining options
for future action, including direct intervention in Yugoslavia with
air and ground forces.

Thai petition seeks refund of down payment on jets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BK101-102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A popular Bangkok radio station on
Monday delivered to the U.S. Embassy a petition with more than
85,000 signatures asking for the return of a dlrs 74.5 million down
payment on eight F/A-18 jet fighters.
	   Thailand ordered the planes when its economy was booming, but
found itself unable to pay after last year's financial crisis
nearly emptied the government's coffers.
	   In an unusual move aimed at easing Thailand's burden, President
Bill Clinton said in March that the U.S. government was prepared to
take over the contract, limiting the Thai obligation to the
deposit. The contract called for dlrs 317 million more to be paid
for delivery of the jets, or dlrs 250 million in termination costs.
	   ``This is not a protest. We would like the American government
to help us share the burden by returning a portion of the money, if
not all, because our economy is in a very critical situation,''
said Praphan Chiraphonghe, who led a group of 27 people in
presenting the petition to the embassy.
	   Praphan, deputy manager of Jor Sor 100, a radio station that
caters to Bangkok's drivers, said the station initiated the
petition drive after receiving many calls from concerned listeners.
	   ``We understand the money already has been used for the
production of the jet fighters and that somebody will have to pick
up the bill. But if there is a buyer for the jets, we are hoping
that the American government could be sympathetic and return us the
money,'' he said.
	   The United States had agreed to allow Thailand to try to find a
new buyer who would assume all costs for the warplanes, but
Bangkok's efforts failed,
	   Last month, the embassy announced that the U.S. Marine Corps
would take the jets, but had not agreed to refund the down payment.
	   ``The U.S. has never done this or intervened with a contractor
for any country before,'' said defense expert Panitan
Wattanayagorn, a professor at Chulalongkorn University. ``This was
a very positive outcome for Thailand.''
	   ``This is a difficult situation for both sides. We have a
contract to fulfill,'' he said. ``But then again, 85,116 is a lot
of people.''

Taiwan plans major live firing exercises for September: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's military will hold its largest
multi-service live-firing exercise in almost four years in
September, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Quoting unnamed military sources, the United Daily News said the
display was planned along the coast of southeast Taiwan's Taitung
County, near where exercises were staged in May.
	   The war games will be the largest in scale since September 1994,
putting on show recently acquired hardware including Mirage 2000-5
and F-16 jet fighters, along with Lafayette missile cruisers
purchased from France, the paper said.
	   The new military technology has allowed Taiwan to mothball
weaponry dating from the 1950s and 1960s, completely overhauling
its defenses.
	   China, which views Taiwan as a renegade province, has said it
will use force if necessary to bring reunification.
	   The Defense Ministry spokesman's office said a military display
is planned for later in the year, but neither the time or place has
been set.

Opposition politicians protest planned hydroelectric dam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Opposition politicians in Pakistan's
rugged frontier province protested the planned construction of a
dam in their backyard Monday by tearing up copies of the provincial
budget and trying to attack the chief minister.
	   The turmoil began Monday when Mehtab Ahmed Khan, the chief
minister of the tribal Northwest Frontier Province, presented his
government's 33 billion rupees (dlrs 740 million) budget.
	   Opposition politicians, condemning government plans to build the
Kalabagh dam, some 208 kilometers (130 miles) south of the frontier
capital of Peshawar, tore up the budget and threw it at the chief
minister.
	   One parliamentarian lunged toward Khan but was stopped by other
lawmakers, said eyewitnesses.
	   The decision to construct the proposed dam was announced last
week by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. It is expected to flood
hundreds of acres (hectares) of farm land in the province, where it
has little support.
	   Electricity generated from the dam will be used to feed
Pakistan's most populous province of Punjab, home to 60 percent of
the country's 140 million people.
	   Since the announcement of the dam's construction the ruling
Pakistan Muslim League in the province has lost its key ally, the
Awami National Party, which now is threatening to unseat the
provincial government.
	   The ruling Muslim league and its independent allies hold 45
seats in the 83-seat legislature, giving it a majority and making
it possible to survive a no-confidence motion.

Chief inspector: Iraq close to being free from U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is very close to becoming free of U.N.
economic sanctions, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, said Monday.
	   ``The light at the end of the tunnel today is more visible than
anytime,'' Butler told reporters at the end of his three-day talks
with Iraqi officials on disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council will allow the lifting of the
sanctions only after Butler's United Nations Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has no more illegal weapons.
	   Butler said that UNSCOM can finish its job in two months
provided Iraq fully cooperates with its arms inspectors.
	   ``I am very positive about it. It is good news ... provided Iraq
fulfills its promises and gives us access to materials and
documents,'' Butler said.
	   On Sunday, Iraq and UNSCOM agreed to lay down a 2-month work
program to end U.N. disarmament activities in Iraq.
	   Butler said he sensed that Iraq is serious this time and both
sides have already embarked on ``concrete steps'' to get the job
done. He did not elaborate.

World Cup: Battle of the North Sea is do-or-die for Scots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ One of the Norwegians dubbed it ``The
Battle of the North Sea.''
	   If Norway wins that battle Tuesday against Scotland, it means a
big step towards the second round, the Norse having tied Morocco
2-2 in their Group A opener.
	   For Scotland it's a do-or-die game. A second straight loss _ the
Scots lost 2-1 to defending champion and Group A favorite Brazil in
their opener _ would end their hopes and render meaningless the
following week's game against Morocco in Saint-Etienne.
	   ``The loser will probably be eliminated from the World Cup, so
it's a very big game for both teams,'' said Norway's coach Egil
``Drillo'' Olsen.
	   Neither team has reached the second round in World Cup history.
Scotland failed seven times, the last time in Italy eight years
ago. Norway failed three times, the last time in the United States
four years ago.
	   Scotland's manager Craig Brown says the Norway match was always
going to be the key game in Group A.
	   ``There was lot of hype about our match with Brazil on the
opening day,'' he said. ``It was seen as a glamour game and rightly
so. But the match against Norway is the one that could make or
break our hopes of qualifying for the second phase.
	   ``In the hearts and the heads of the players, this game is more
important than the opener. There is no tension in the camp, just
eager anticipation of the game to come. The players are ready to
play now and there is great anxiety to get on with this match.''
	   Norway is undefeated in 15 games, fourth in the world in FIFA's
rankings and Europe's in-form team.
	   But the Norwegians have been caught up in controversy with two
of their players, defender Henning Berg of Manchester United and
midfielder Erik Mykland of Panathinaikos, under fire after visiting
a nightclub until the early hours of Saturday.
	   When it emerged that neither player drank alcohol, Olsen said
the incident ``was now closed'' and both would be considered for
selection.
	   Berg and Mykland, two of the senior members of the squad, played
the entire match against Morocco. And they're likely to retain
their places against Scotland, although Olsen promised to make
changes in his starting lineup.
	   ``One, two or three new players will get the chance from the
start,'' Olsen said. ``I never use the same players for two matches
in a row.''
	   In 84 games since his debut as coach in 1990 against Cameroon,
Olsen has never used the same team in two straight games.
	   ``We have 22 players and 21 are fit and available for
selection,'' Olsen said.
	   The exception is defender Vegard Heggem, who has a nagging groin
strain. He did not play against Morocco.
	   Brown also indicated that he would make changes in view of
Norway's long-ball game.
	   Norway tends to use a lone striker, Chelsea's Tore Andre Flo.
	   ``He is a danger and acts as a decoy,'' Brown said. ``We have to
combat that.''
	   Scotland's warmup record was dismal, drawing with Finland, the
United States and Colombia and being beaten by France and Denmark.
	   Norway, meanwhile, outscored fellow World Cup sides Denmark,
Mexico and Saudi Arabia by a combined 13-2 in its last three
exhibitions.
	   ``We're probably the most predictable of all the teams in the
World Cup and our style won't change, although there may be some
change of personnel,'' Olsen said.

Israeli opposition leader meets Mubarak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ehud Barak, the leader of Israel's
opposition Labor Party, met with President Hosni Mubarak on Monday
to discuss the 15-month-old deadlock in the Middle East peace
process.
	   Barak was accompanied by a team of party officials and Mubarak
was with his top political adviser, Osama el-Baz, and Deputy Prime
Minister Youssef Waly, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   No details of the meeting were available.
	   The talks are expected to focus on the efforts by the United
States, the European Union and Egypt to revive the stalemated peace
talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   The peace process was begun in 1993 by the late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the Labor Party and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat. It came to a halt in 1997 when the hard-line
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began constructing
a Jewish settlement in the traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The crisis was worsened by Palestinian suicide bombings and a
reluctance by Netanyahu to carry out more troops withdrawal from
the West Bank, which Israel captured and occupied in the 1967
Mideast war.
	   Citing security concerns, Netanyahu has rejected a U.S. proposal
that calls for Israel to withdraw from a further 13 percent of West
Bank territory.
	   Palestinians have accepted the plan, and Barak, Israel's most
decorated soldier, has warned that Netanyahu will lead the country
toward bloodshed and possibly war unless he also accepts the U.S.
proposal.
	   Mubarak also made the same point in a interview published Monday
in the weekly Mayo newspaper of the ruling National Democratic
Party.
	   ``The Palestinian side has given all it can give, whereas the
Israeli stance has become ... intransigent,'' Mubarak said. ``If
the peace process collapses, everything will become confused and
violence will spread,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu has reportedly been holding out for nine percent pull
out but right wing parties in the ruling coalition have threatened
to bring down his government if he carries out any withdrawal.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England and Tunisia fought their World
Cup match a day early, heaving bottles, smashing windows and
shouting filthy insults. The melee that continued into the early
hours Monday left nearly 50 people injured, three seriously.
	   Some 50 people were arrested, according to police. Among them
were about 30 British, six Tunisians and up to a dozen French,
according to France-Provence radio.
	   Of the some 50 injuries, about 36 spent the night in the
hospital, according to the radio.
	   One English fan was hospitalized in serious condition after an
attacker slashed an artery in his neck, according to police and
Narine rescue officials. Two others were also reported in serious
condition.
	   Marseille Police Chief Michel Sappin said police ranks were
being reinforced in the city center and around the stadium.
	   Lines of riot police ready to sweep in if needed could be seen
strategically placed outside Marseille.
	   Authorities had already planned to deploy a total of 1,600
uniformed or plainclothes city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100
elite CRS national police for Monday's match scheduled for 1230
GMT.
	   Sappin said that scheduling the English-Tunisia match for Monday
was ``an error'' because it gave hooligans a chance to drink
throughout the weekend.
	   At Saint-Charles train station, a group of Tunisians ambushed
English fans arriving on a midnight train. Heads were bloodied on
both sides before police could intervene.
	   ``It will get worse, whatever happens,'' said Gary Lazarus, a
London printer who came for a tranquil soccer match. ``If England
loses, people will want revenge. If Tunisia loses, they'll come
after us.''
	   English fans spent most of Sunday drinking peacefully, if
noisily, at bars on the Canebiere, a once elegant boulevard that
has gone to seed. Young Tunisians from the tough northern suburbs
buzzed them repeatedly on motorscooters, waving flags.
	   ``Some silly person hit a Tunisian and started it,'' according
to Jeff Cotgrave, 30, an electrical worker from Birmingham, who
left the area for safety.
	   ``I know Englishmen aren't all so good, but the Tunisians and
police provoked English supporters all day,'' he said. ``We haven't
even played a match and look what they're doing. It's all because
of a bad reputation. I find that scandalous.''
	   Few Tunisians were anxious to speak. When asked how the trouble
started, one brandished the heavy metal pole he was carrying.
	   Hundreds of police, with riot gear, tear gas and dogs, separated
small groups of Britons from excited crowds of local Tunisians, who
chanted and taunted.
	   The English fought back when they could evade police lines. At
one point, a dozen of them stood behind an unfurled Union Jack,
urging a bottle-throwing crowd to attack. When one young Tunisian
advanced, a Briton slammed him with a chair.
	   Police picked off drunken English stragglers, wrestling them to
the ground, handcuffing them and hauling them off to jail.
	   As riot troops led away a bald, burly Englishmen, Tunisian kids
jeered.
	   ``Give us their ears, and keep a count,'' one yelled.
	   ``Hit that queer with your nightstick,'' another shouted.
	   The running battle prevented an outdoor concert that brought
people from miles (kilometers) around for a World Cup party in the
ancient port.
	   ``We were eating dinner and suddenly got a mouthful of tear
gas,'' said Christian Pierre, a mason who brought his wife from
their Vaucluse village for a night on the town.
	   Three sober young Englishmen were distressed by the rioting.
They had met the day before at a police station where they
separately reported break-ins of their cars.
	   ``I'm here on holiday, and all I want to do is see my team
play,'' said Lazarus, one of the three. He had covered up his blue
and red Coventry soccer jersey with a sweatshirt.
	   He said part of the blame belonged to unruly English soccer
thugs, but he added that the French had allowed tension to build.
	   ``They were even selling an official World Cup knife,'' he said,
although sales were halted well before the tournament began. ``Can
you imagine? Here, buy your official murder weapon.''
	   Lazarus spent an entire day dialing Paris to order one of the
extra tickets France made available after European Union partners
complained that too many were kept for the French.
	   ``As soon as I said I was from London, the lady hung up the
phone,'' He said. His friends confirmed that French operators
refused to sell tickets to people with English addresses,
apparently in fear of hooligan violence.
	   In London, British Sports Minister Tony Banks called the
troublemakers ``drunken, brain-dead louts.'' Home Secretary Jack
Straw said French police had full support of the British
government.

Swiss supreme court rejects final appeal over Marcos funds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1000 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A final appeal to block the
transfer of assets in Swiss banks belonging to the former
Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos has been rejected,
Switzerland's supreme court said Monday.
	   The decision by the Federal Tribunal clears the way for the
transfer to Manila of some dlrs 270 million still frozen in
Switzerland pending a final appeal by several Liechtenstein- and
Panama-based foundations, set up by Marcos to control the assets.
	   The foundations had appealed against the tribunal's rulings in
December and January which ordered the transfer of the Marcos
assets _ estimated to total around dlrs 570 million with interest.
	   Their appeal was rejected as groundless, and the foundations
were ordered to pay court costs.
	   Some dlrs 300 million had already been transferred to an escrow
account in Manila when the foundations in April lodged their
last-minute appeal.
	   In its original ruling, the court said it was against Swiss
interests ``to serve as a safe haven'' for flight capital or
criminal proceeds, suggesting the Marcos money, frozen in
Switzerland since 1986, had dubious origins.
	   The Philippine government has said the Swiss deposits are part
of billions of dollars in ill-gotten wealth accumulated by Marcos
during his 20-year presidency.
	   The Swiss court says the money can only be released from the
escrow account to the government if it wins a criminal conviction
against Marcos' widow, Imelda, in connection with the funds.
	   The Philippine government also is required to protect the rights
of the Marcos family in the trial, and inform the Swiss court on
measures to compensate victims of human rights violations under
Marcos.
	   Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986 and fled into
exile in Hawaii where he died three years later. He denied any
wrongdoing during his administration.
	   The transfer should be complete in the next few days, according
to Dieter Jann, deputy of the leading Swiss prosecutor in the case.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Cesare Saqr, a senior aide to the
commander of Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army, died Monday after a
long illness at age 75, his family announced.
	   Saqr was a leader of the radical Guardian of the Cedars, a
Christian militia formed during the 1975-90 civil war, which openly
sided with Israel during its 1982 invasion and subsequent
occupation of southern Lebanon.
	   Saqr, who was born in Bajjeh north of Beirut, moved to live in
Marjayoun in Israeli-occupied South Lebanon where the Israeli
troops trained and armed the 2,500 members of South Lebanon Army.
	   Saqr became Gen. Antoine Lahd's adviser in 1984 when Lahd became
the commander of SLA after the death of Saad Haddad.
	   Saqr, a cousin of the Cedars founder Etienne Saqr, married a
Spanish woman. They had no children.
	   The funeral is scheduled for later Monday.

Government raids factories, arrests hundreds to recover bad debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Police raided factors in eastern
Punjab province and arrested hundreds of people accused of not
paying billions of rupees (millions of dollars) in outstanding
utility bills, according to news reports Monday.
	   Outstanding utility bills of factories in the Punjab capital of
Lahore alone amount to 3.3 billion rupees (dlrs 74 million), the
independent English-language newspaper, The News reported.
	   Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd., a government-run gas company,
is trying to recover 4 billion rupees (dlrs 75 million), the
newspaper said.
	   The campaign to recover outstanding utility bills follows Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif's austerity program announced last week on
national television.
	   The clamp down comes as Pakistan tries to reduce the impact of
economic sanctions being imposed to punish this poor country of 140
million people for exploding six nuclear devices.
	   Last month's nuclear testing was in response to five tests by
its uneasy neighbor India, which also has been hit by international
sanctions.
	   Sharif, who currently is in Britain to raise money from
expatriate Pakistanis, also has promised to confiscate 1.25 million
acres (500,000 hectares) of land from some of the country's largest
and most powerful land owners.
	   When the British left the subcontinent in 1947, they gave huge
tracts of land to local leaders as payment for their loyalty. That
land will be taken away and given to the country's landless, Sharif
has promised.
	   A land reforms implementation committee has been established to
recover the land. According to several reports the government is
preparing legislation that would sentence to seven years anyone
found guilty of illegally possessing land.

NATO forces detain one more war crimes suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO peacekeeping forces in Bosnia have
detained a war crimes suspect accused of prison camp atrocities and
were sending him to the War Crimes court in The Hague, Netherlands,
the alliance announced Monday.
	   A statement released by NATO headquarters identified the suspect
as Milorad Krnojelac, indicted for war crimes by the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
	   No details on the detentions by the NATO-led Stabilization
Force, known as SFOR, were immediately given.
	   Krnojelac, a former prison camp commander, is accused of
``beatings, murder, willful killing, willfully causing serious
injury, cruel treatment, and inhumane acts towards prisoners
between April 1992 and October 1994,'' said NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana.
	   ``This action by SFOR serves as yet another warning to all those
indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they, too, will
be brought to justice,'' said Solana.
	   He urged war suspects who are still at large to ``surrender
immediately'' to the tribunal in The Hague.

NATO-led peace force arrests Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peace force
arrested a Bosnian Serb suspected of committing war crimes while
running a detention facility in eastern Bosnia, NATO officials said
Monday.
	   Milorad Krnojelac, a captain in the former Yugoslav army, was a
commander at the infamous Foca prison, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southeast of Sarajevo, between April 1992 and August 1993, NATO
said in a press release.
	   Maj. Sheena Thomson, a NATO spokeswoman, said the peace force
arrested Krnojelac without incident around 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday
in Foca.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said in a statement that
German and French troops were involved in the arrest.
	   The NATO press release said Krnojelac surrendered to soldiers
when it was clear his ``attempts to evade (authorities) were at an
end.'' The arrest ``resulted from opportunities that developed
recently'' when peacekeepers confirmed Krnojelac's identity and
location.
	   ``He is charged with permitting prolonged torture and beatings,
countless killings and forced labor practices,'' the press release
said.
	   The Hague tribunal accused Krnojelac of being present during the
separation and segregation of non-Serb detainees, for ``providing
inhumane conditions'' in the Foca prison, as well as for assisting
in the deportation of Muslims, who made up the majority of the
population in Foca, the press release said.
	   Krnojelac is among an unknown number of war crimes suspects
contained on a secret list of indictees compiled by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. In addition, the names
of 75 Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim indictees have been released.
	   Ruehe said the arrest of war crimes suspects is vital. ``War
criminals who are still at large not only hinder implementation of
the peace accord but block reconciliation among the former
combatants, undermine credibility of the international tribunal and
awake calls of vengeance from victims.''
	   Thomson said that immediately after the arrest, NATO took
Krnojelac to the Hague.
	   So far, the peace force has arrested nine war-crimes suspects,
most of them Bosnian Serbs.

Delegates gather in Rome to forge international court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with conference opening, Annan speech; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on the
international community Monday to create a ``bulwark against evil''
by establishing a permanent world criminal court.
	   In opening a U.N. conference to set up the tribunal, he appealed
for a ``court strong and independent enough to carry out its task''
of bringing war criminals and perpetrators of crimes against
humanity to justice.
	   The United States and its partners on the Security Council other
than Britain have been pushing for stronger council control over
the court's prosecutor. Human rights advocates say that would
cripple the court's independence.
	   ``People all over the world want to know that humanity can
strike back -- that wherever and whenever genocide, war crimes or
other such violations are committed, there is a court before which
the criminal can be held to account,'' Annan told the delegates.
	   ``We have an opportunity that can save lives and serve as a
bulwark against evil.''
	   As he opened the five-week conference of more than 180 nations,
Western warplanes elsewhere in Europe were teaching a different
sort of lesson.
	   They staged mock air raids over Yugoslavia's neighbors. It was a
warning against Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo, a reminder of the
slaughter in Bosnia which helped bring about the conference here.
	   The road to a world court will be long and hard. Success is by
no means certain.
	   The delegates must wrestle with basic issues, such as the powers
granted the prosecutor, what will set a prosecution in motion, how
much influence the U.N. Security Council and its members will have
over the court's functioning and what crimes it would cover.
	   All parties basically agree that the court will target genocide,
war crimes and crimes against humanity. Defendants will be
individuals, unlike at the existing International Court of Justice
at The Hague, where nations lodge complaints against nations. It
would take on a limited number of cases and not duplicate national
efforts.
	   The negotiators have a 173-page draft statute two years in the
making. Small working committees will attempt to reach agreement on
wording.
	   Next, the statute goes before the U.N. General Assembly.
Finally, individual nations must ratify the statute, and if need
be, change their own laws to conform with it.
	   The idea of a global justice arena dates back to the period
right after World War II, when the Nuremberg trials of Nazis and
war crimes trials in Japan were carried out.
	   Supporters kept hope alive for the next half century, but little
was done. The horrors this decade in Bosnia and Rwanda -- for which
ad hoc courts have been formed to prosecute war criminals --
brought the idea to life.

Dollar at eight-year high, Japanese stock prices fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency prices;
ADDS trader comment in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar climbed above 146 yen in Tokyo for
the first time in eight years Monday, propelled by growing
pessimism about Japan's economy. Tokyo stock prices tumbled.
	   The dollar bought 146.44 yen in late afternoon, surpassing 145
and then 146 yen for the first time since August 1990. The U.S.
currency was up 2.42 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and well above
144.72 yen Friday in New York.
	   The dollar now has climbed a total of 6.08 yen in Tokyo's last
four trading days.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 197.16 points, or 1.31
percent, closing at 14,825.17. On Friday, the Nikkei had gained
8.29 points, or 0.06 percent.
	   The dollar gained momentum against the yen as traders concluded
that world central bankers probably would not support the Bank of
Japan even if it intervenes on the yen's behalf
	   ``If it's the Bank of Japan acting alone, the impact will be
limited,'' said Takashi Nakauchi, foreign exchange manager at Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
	   This came after comments last week by U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin that efforts to halt the yen's slide would be futile
because of economic fundamentals.
	   The yen has tumbled against the dollar as investors shift funds
from the moribund Japanese economy into robust U.S. and European
markets.
	   Gross domestic product figures released Friday confirmed what
many investors had feared: Japan's economy is in the midst of its
deepest recession in more than 50 years.
	   In 1997, the world's second-largest economy recorded its worst
year since the end of World War II, contracting 0.7 percent, the
Economic Planning Agency said.
	   That fanned concerns Japan may be forced to cut interest rates
from already historic lows.
	   An interest rate cut would make overseas investments look more
attractive because of their relatively higher rates of return.
While the Bank of Japan's policy board decided Friday to leave
rates unchanged, traders pointed out the vote wasn't unanimous,
with some favoring a cut.
	   ``If some members are actually in favor of credit easing, that
would certainly accelerate investment in foreign bonds by
institutional investors,'' said Ryuichi Takami, a senior trader at
Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   The dollar traded as high as 146.58 yen and as low as 144.17
yen.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stocks fell amid worries the
weakening yen might throw the rest of Asia into renewed economic
turmoil.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section ended down 10.04 points, or 0.85 percent, at 1,167.21. It
had fallen 1.56 points, or 0.13 percent, on Friday.
	   While a weak yen helps Japan's exporters, those gains come at
the expense of the rest of Asia. As the yen falls, Japanese
products become cheaper in key markets like the United States,
snatching market share from Asian competitors.
	   That deprives hard-pressed economies like Thailand of
desperately needed export revenues and foreign currency.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond dropped to 1.185 percent from Friday's close of
1.210 percent. Its price rose to 112.12 yen from 111.94 yen.

No one injured in bombing at headquarters of election winners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A bomb destroyed the balcony and a door
of the headquarters of the Young Democrats-Civic Party in the early
morning hours Monday, police said.
	   The bomb exploded at 1:13 a.m. (23:13 GMT), in Budapest's sixth
district, near several embassies. No one was injured in the attack.
	   Monday's attack was the latest in a string of bombings at party
headquarters and homes of party leaders.
	   In March, a bomb was defused in front of the headquarters of the
right-wing Smallholders Party. Then a bomb destroyed the home of
Smallholders' Party leader Jozsef Torgyan. Last month, the
apartment building where Young Democrats Vice President Jozsef
Szajer lived was damaged. Nobody was injured in the incidents.
	   The Young Democrats won May general elections, and negotiations
are under way to form a new government.
	   ``This attack only reaffirms in us our determination to
radically improve public safety by strengthening the police
force,'' Szajer told state TV.
	   Police hoped that such attacks would cease after they raided a
laboratory set up to produce explosive devices earlier this month.
Huge quantities of explosives and chemicals were found.

	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) - NATO fighters and reconnaissance
aircraft roared off into the Monday morning sunshine give Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic a lesson in power and persuade him to
think again in Kosovo.
	   Eighty-four aircraft from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries were
conducting several hours of exercises over Albania and Macedonia in
hopes of intimidating the Yugoslav president by showing how quickly
and powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces if
needed.
	   ``This is an exercise intended to demonstrate the alliance's
commitment to peace and stability in the region and the alliance's
ability to project power into the region,'' said Lt. Gen. Michael
Short, commander of NATO air forces in the alliance's southern
Europe division.
	   Taking off from this NATO air base snuggled at the foot of the
Dolomite Mountains, the aircraft flew down the Adriatic coast, then
into Albanian airspace, turning a clockwise circle into Macedonia
and back across Albania in what Short called a ``wagon train'' 120
miles (200 kilometers) long.
	   The planes began departing about 7:50 a.m. (0550 GMT) Monday,
leaving from air bases in Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Britain
and the Adriatic Sea. Support planes, including refueling tankers,
already were in the air. It was expected to end about midday.
	   First of the 24 aircraft departing Aviano were two American
F-16s, followed by four Spanish F-18s, a tanker and another half
dozen American F-16s.
	   ``This is a model for the NATO of the 21st century,'' enthused
Short, saying Monday's maneuvers showed just how fast the alliance
could react to events outside its traditional territory ``to
rapidly mass power where it's needed.''
	   The fighting in Kosovo has sparked alarm that the violence could
spread to neighboring Albania and Macedonia, which have agreed to
let their territory be used for the exercises.
	   The exercise, code-named Determined Falcon, is meant to show how
quickly and powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces
if needed.
	   Asked early Monday if he expected the aircraft to be picked up
by Yugoslav ground radar, Short said ``it's very reasonable to say
the aircraft will be tracked by Yugoslav early warning systems.''
	   ``We will do nothing in this exercise to provoke a response from
the federal republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   In the Adriatic sea aboard USS Wasp, Col. Emerson Gardner told
reporters: ``We need to show the people that need to know exactly
what we can do.''
	   The Wasp threw four Harrier jump-jet attack aircraft into the
exercise.

Indonesian police arrest four people in town riot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Several dozen people hurled stones at
a school, shops and two churches in an Indonesian town Monday.
Police said they arrested four people.
	   It was the second riot in a week in the Java Island town of
Tegal, 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of the capital, Jakarta.
	   Many of the rioters were men who have lost their jobs in
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades.
	   ``We detained four people on the streets when they pelted shops
and churches. There was broken glass, but we came and controlled
the situation,'' police Lt. Sukirno said.
	   Last week, violence broke out after student protesters demanded
that the mayor of Tegal step down because of alleged corruption.
Mobs gathered at the protest and vandalized shops and cars.
	   Last month, Jakarta was hit by citywide riots in which hundreds
of people were killed. The unrest helped dislodge President Suharto
after 32 years in power.

 &UR; Bulls fans celebrate NBA victory &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying fatality was gang related; Minor
edits. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Chicago Bulls fans by the thousands cut loose in
jubilation after their heroes clinched a sixth NBA title of the
1990s, and police reported some minor violence and arrests.
	   Honking horns echoed among the skyscrapers along Michigan Avenue
on Sunday night, and fans packed Rush Street, heart of the city's
biggest nightlife district, dancing, slapping hands in the air and
chanting ``We're Number One!'' under the watchful eye of mounted
police.
	   Light rain helped keep Sunday's celebration fairly sedate. The
volume of calls to the city's emergency center Sunday night
mirrored that of last year's championship clincher, said Chicago
police spokesman Pat Camden.
	   Camden said one person was killed in a shooting unrelated to the
game. It was not known if four other reported shootings were
related to the Bulls celebration. A police sergeant was hit by a
car on the city's West Side, and there were reports of scattered
looting, bottles being thrown and cars being overturned, he said.
	   The latest celebration was a sharp contrast to the mayhem that
followed the Bulls' early championships. In 1991, more than 1,000
people were arrested and looters hit stores across the city after
the Bulls won their first championship.
	   Such violence led to what became a well-rehearsed routine for
Chicago police. About 8,000 police were on duty Sunday night at a
cost of dlrs 1 million; extra space had been cleared at the county
jail, and authorities were prepared to close major streets and
expressway exit ramps to keep crowds under control.
	   TV stations aired a public service announcement from Michael
Jordan, coach Phil Jackson and Dennis Rodman, calling on fans to
celebrate responsibly, and public school students were given a
similar message in letters signed by Jordan.

102 illegal immigrants detained at Czech-Slovak border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech police detained more than
100 illegal immigrants at the border with Slovakia, most of them
coming from the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Four Czechs, suspected of helping the foreigners, also were
arrested Saturday, the daily Zemske Noviny said.
	   The daily said most of the 102 refugees detained by police were
from Kosovo, with others coming from India and Bangladesh. A woman
who is eight months pregnant received medical treatment.
	   The detainees, who crossed the border in two separate groups
near the village of Strani, were handed over to Slovak authorities.
	   Strani seems to be one of the most frequent points of illegal
border crossings. According to official statistics, more than 450
illegal immigrants have been detained there during the first half
of the year. Most said they were heading to Germany.

Israel: Yassin will be able to return to Gaza
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has decided to allow Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
the spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, to return
to the Gaza Strip after his 14-week fundraising tour of the Arab
world, an official said Monday.
	   Israel officials had wavered whether to let Yassin back into
Gaza, but apparently determined that the quadriplegic Hamas leader
posed more of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his activities can
be monitored by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   Yassin has raised millions of dollars and pledges of support for
Hamas during his trip, and Arafat apparently is increasingly
concerned about the challenge to his rule posed by Hamas.
	   The Islamic militant group opposes Arafat's peace agreements
with Israel and has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings
since 1994 in hopes of wrecking the accords.
	   Yassin is currently in Khartoum, Sudan, awaiting permission to
return to Gaza via Egypt.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Yassin had permission to return to Gaza, but that no date had been
set.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the group was informed by the
Palestinian Authority that Israel would allow Yassin to return as
early as the end of the week. Palestinian officials have asked
Hamas to notify them of Yassin's return 24 hours ahead of time.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall in exchange for
the freedom of two Israeli spies captured in Jordan during a
bungled assassination attempt against another Hamas leader.

Finland's May inflation down to 1.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's annual inflation rate in May
fell to 1.5 percent, down from 1.8 percent during the previous
month, the government statistics agency said Monday.
	   In May 1997, Finland's inflation rate was 1.0 percent,
Statistics Finland said.
	   During a 12-month period, a 2.2-percent increase in the cost of
housing pushed up inflation the most _ by 0.5 percentage points.
The price of food and non-alcoholic beverages was up by 2.4
percent, the agency said.
	   Inflation was curbed mainly by the abolition of stamp duty on
loans and lower mobile phone charges.

English, Tunisian fans fight their match a day early

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England and Tunisia fought their World
Cup match a day early, heaving bottles, smashing windows and
shouting filthy insults. The melee that continued into the early
hours Monday left nearly 50 people injured, three seriously.
	   Some 50 people were arrested, according to police. Among them
were about 30 British, six Tunisians and up to a dozen French,
according to France-Provence radio.
	   About 36 injured spent the night in the hospital, including an
young English fan slashed in the neck and suffering from a slit
artery, according to police and Narine rescue officials. Two others
were also in serious condition.
	   Marseille Police Chief Michel Sappin said police ranks were
being reinforced in the city center and around the stadium.
	   Lines of riot police ready to sweep in if needed could be seen
strategically placed outside Marseille.
	   Authorities had already planned to deploy a total of 1,600
uniformed or plainclothes city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100
elite CRS national police for Monday's match scheduled for 1230
GMT.
	   Sappin said that scheduling the English-Tunisia match for Monday
was ``an error'' because it gave hooligans a chance to drink
throughout the weekend.
	   At Saint-Charles train station, a group of Tunisians ambushed
English fans arriving on a midnight train. Heads were bloodied on
both sides before police could intervene.
	   ``It will get worse, whatever happens,'' said Gary Lazarus, a
London printer here for the match. ``If England loses, people will
want revenge. If Tunisia loses, they'll come after us.''
	   English fans spent most of Sunday drinking peacefully, if
noisily, at bars on the Canebiere, a once elegant boulevard that
has gone to seed. Young Tunisians from the tough northern suburbs
buzzed them repeatedly on motorscooters, waving flags.
	   ``Some silly person hit a Tunisian and started it,'' according
to Jeff Cotgrave, 30, an electrical worker from Birmingham, who
left the area for safety.
	   ``I know Englishmen aren't all so good, but the Tunisians and
police provoked English supporters all day,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair Monday branded troublemakers a
``total disgrace'' and offered French authorities his unreserved
backing in dealing with offenders.
	   ``The activities of those fans are a total disgrace,'' he told
Today. ``They have nothing whatever to do with the best interests
of English football or our country ... I condemn it completely.''
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks earlier called the
troublemakers ``drunken, brain-dead louts.''
	   Few Tunisians were anxious to speak. When asked how the trouble
started, one brandished the heavy metal pole he was carrying.
	   Hundreds of police, with riot gear, tear gas and dogs, separated
small groups of Britons from excited crowds of local Tunisians, who
chanted and taunted.
	   The English fought back when they could evade police lines. At
one point, a dozen of them stood behind an unfurled Union Jack,
urging a bottle-throwing crowd to attack. When one young Tunisian
advanced, a Briton slammed him with a chair.
	   Police picked off drunken English stragglers, wrestling them to
the ground, handcuffing them and hauling them off to jail.
	   As riot troops led away a bald, burly Englishmen, Tunisian kids
jeered.
	   ``Give us their ears, and keep a count,'' one yelled.
	   ``Hit that queer with your nightstick,'' another shouted.
	   Three sober young Englishmen were distressed by the rioting.
They had met the day before at a police station where they
separately reported break-ins of their cars.
	   ``I'm here on holiday, and all I want to do is see my team
play,'' said Lazarus, one of the three. He had covered up his blue
and red Coventry soccer jersey with a sweatshirt.
	   He said that part of the blame belonged to unruly English soccer
thugs, but that the French had allowed tension to build.
	   ``They were even selling an official World Cup knife,'' he said,
although sales were halted well before the tournament began. ``Can
you imagine? Here, buy your official murder weapon.''
	   Lazarus spent the day dialing Paris to order one of the extra
tickets France made available after European Union partners
complained that too many were kept for French.
	   ``As soon as I said I was from London, the lady hung up the
phone,'' He said. His friends confirmed that French operators
refused to sell tickets to people with English addresses,
apparently in fear of hooligan violence.

Chief inspector: Iraq close to being free from U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is very close to becoming free of U.N.
economic sanctions, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, said Monday.
	   ``The light at the end of the tunnel today is more visible than
anytime,'' Butler told reporters at the end of his three-day talks
with Iraqi officials on disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council will allow the lifting of the
sanctions only after Butler's U.N. Special Commission certifies
that Iraq has no more illegal weapons.
	   Butler said that UNSCOM can finish its job in two months
provided Iraq fully cooperates with its arms inspectors.
	   ``I am very positive about it. It is good news ... provided Iraq
fulfills its promises and gives us access to materials and
documents,'' Butler said.
	   On Sunday, Iraq and UNSCOM agreed to lay down a two-month work
program to end U.N. disarmament activities in Iraq.
	   Butler said he sensed that Iraq is serious this time and both
sides have already embarked on ``concrete steps'' to get the job
done. He did not elaborate.

Hun Sen supporter elected head of Cambodian constitutional group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A supporter of Cambodia's ruling
party was chosen Monday to head the body assigned to resolve
election-related disputes. Opposition politicians charged he would
act as a ``rubber-stamp'' for strongman Hun Sen.
	   Chan Sok, former president of the Supreme Court, received votes
from five of the seven members who attended the meeting of the
constitutional council.
	   Opposition politicians said the body, set up to determine the
constitutionality of all laws and resolve election-related
disputes, will not be truly neutral and independent of Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party.
	   ``It is an institution unacceptable to the people. I don't have
any faith in it. They will decide everything according to the
(wishes of the) CPP,'' said Ahmad Yahya, a member of Parliament
from the FUNCINPEC party of deposed Co-Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Outspoken politician Sam Rainsy described the selection of the
council's president as ``a symbol of corruption, injustice and bias
in Cambodia.''
	   ``It clearly shows that (the council) is merely a rubber-stamp
for the CPP,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   One vote was cast for Bin Chhin, another Hun Sen supporter.
There also was one abstention, believed to be by King Norodom
Sihanouk's appointee, Pung Peng Cheng, who presided over the
council's meeting.
	   Son Sann and Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum, also appointees of the
monarch, did not attend the session. Their absence was believed to
be a boycott to protest the composition of the council, which has
six members who are supporters of Hun Sen's party.
	   The newly elected Chan Sok argued that his selection ``was
rightful with rules and regulations. The council now gets moving.''
	   He said list of the council's new composition will be sent to
King Sihanouk, currently living in Siem Reap province, for final
approval.
	   Chan Sok said he did not know how to deal with the king's two
appointees if they continue to boycott council sessions, but that
he will move on to draft internal rules and regulations for the
council.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's defense minister publicly rebuked a top
U.S. military commander Monday, accusing NATO of failing to consult
with Moscow on holding air exercises over the Balkans.
	   The rare public clash came as the Russian Foreign Ministry said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's imminent meeting with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow would be ``potentially
decisive'' in defusing the explosive conflict in Kosovo.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev gave visiting Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dressing-down before
reporters. He said that NATO had decided to launch the air
exercises, which are intended to put pressure on Yugoslavia to curb
its forces in Kosovo, only after he had left consultations in
Brussels last week.
	   The Defense Ministry said Monday that Russia had recalled its
military envoy to NATO, Lt.-Gen. Viktor Zavarzin. The move was
apparently to protest the NATO air patrols.
	   The Russian government has strongly opposed any direct
intervention in Yugoslavia, contending that all of the diplomatic
options have yet to be exhausted.
	   NATO planes began flying maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo. The exercise included 80
planes from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries.
	   ``We specifically underlined the need to find a political
solution, and then, all of a sudden, I find out the next morning
that the exercises are being launched,'' Sergeyev complained.
	   ``And that was a consultative council, supposed to bring a joint
solution. As a soldier, most of all, I value honesty in relations
with colleagues. And I cannot understand what they did to me in
Brussels after I left.''
	   Milosevic is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Monday evening and
meet with Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin is expected to deliver a warning to Milosevic that the
crisis facing him is far more serious than he appears to realize,
said a western official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We place greater hopes on this meeting'' than on the exercises
NATO began Monday, said Vladimir Rakhmanin, a high-ranking Foreign
Ministry official, in comments reported by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Shelton said that the possibility of holding military exercises
had been discussed during the two-day consultations between NATO
and Russia, and that they were intended to help persuade both sides
in the conflict to reach a peaceful conclusion.
	   ``That military exercise was designed to simply underscore the
work being done by Presidents Yeltsin and Milosevic,'' Shelton
said.
	   The Foreign Ministry urged the western alliance to take care
that its exercises ``not provoke either the Albanian community of
Kosovo or Belgrade to escalate (tension), and give diplomats the
possibility to work on regulating the Kosovo conflict,'' Rakhmanin
was quoted as saying.

NATO-led peace force arrests Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peace force on
Monday arrested a Bosnian Serb suspected of committing war crimes
while running a detention facility in eastern Bosnia, the alliance
said.
	   Milorad Krnojelac, a captain in the former Yugoslav army, was a
commander at the infamous Foca prison, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southeast of Sarajevo, between April 1992 and August 1993, NATO
said in a press release.
	   Maj. Sheena Thomson, a NATO spokeswoman, said the peace force
arrested Krnojelac without incident Monday morning in Foca.
	   ``This action by SFOR serves as yet another warning to all those
indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they, too, will
be brought to justice,'' NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said
in Brussels, Belgium.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said in a statement that
German and French troops were involved in the arrest.
	   The NATO press release said Krnojelac surrendered to soldiers
when it was clear his ``attempts to evade (authorities) were at an
end.'' The arrest ``resulted from opportunities that developed
recently'' when peacekeepers confirmed Krnojelac's identity and
location.
	   ``He is charged with permitting prolonged torture and beatings,
countless killings and forced labor practices,'' the press release
said.
	   The Hague tribunal accused Krnojelac of being present during the
separation and segregation of non-Serb detainees, for ``providing
inhumane conditions'' in the Foca prison, as well as for assisting
in the deportation of Muslims, who made up the majority of the
population in Foca, the press release said.
	   Krnojelac is among an unknown number of suspects indicted for
war crimes on a secret list compiled by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. In addition, the names of 75
Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim indictees have been released.
	   Ruehe said the arrest of war crimes suspects is vital. ``War
criminals who are still at large not only hinder implementation of
the peace accord but block reconciliation among the former
combatants, undermine credibility of the international tribunal and
awake calls of vengeance from victims.''
	   Thomson said that immediately after the arrest, NATO took
Krnojelac to the Hague.
	   So far, the peace force has arrested nine war-crimes suspects,
most of them Bosnian Serbs.

World Cup: Morocco hopes to beat Brazil at its own game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Speed, creativity, a whirlwind attack.
Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo expects to see it all _ from Morocco.
	   The defending World Cup champions face the Atlas Lions in this
northwestern French city Tuesday night in a game Zagallo picks as
the toughest of Group A.
	   ``They have more movement and more velocity than any team I've
seen in the Cup,'' he said. ``Morocco has a Brazilian style of
soccer, with touches, give-and-go passes and speed.''
	   After beating Scotland 2-1 in the Cup opener, Brazil can qualify
for the next round with a victory Tuesday. That would take some of
the pressure off its final game with Norway.
	   But the Lions need a win to control their destiny and not depend
on other results. And their strong showing in a 2-2 tie against
favored Norway has raised expectations.
	   ``I dream, I hope that we can show our skills, the abilities of
Moroccan football, and come away with a good result,'' coach Henri
Michel said. ``At the very least, I hope to create problems for the
Brazilian team.''
	   Much depends on whether two stars can play through their
injuries.
	   Noureddine Naybet, the team captain, was nursing a swollen leg
this weekend and midfielder El-Moustafa Hadji has a fractured right
toe. Doctors say it will take about three weeks for these injuries
to heal.
	   Michel said he'll use both despite their injuries.
	   ``Morocco ... is not Brazil. We have 11 excellent players and I
can't replace any of them,'' he said.
	   Zagallo spent the week preparing his squad to face the Moroccan
whirlwind. That meant plugging the defensive holes that were
evident against Scotland.
	   The coach wants his team more compact and pressing the Moroccans
in their own end. On offense, the Brazilians worked on
counterstrikes, free kicks and an aerial game.
	   If Brazilians are preparing to play defensively, it's a sign of
their respect for the improved Lions.
	   ``Brazil has to open its eyes,'' said defender Roberto Carlos.
``Morocco comes at you quickly, and we need total concentration on
defense because they could cause problems.''
	   ``They're a fast team, an organized stampede,'' said veteran
goalie Taffarel. ``We'll have trouble with them.''
	   Hadji is likely to get special attention. The midfielder of
Spain's Deportivo La Coruna was a standout against Norway and
scored on a brilliant solo run.
	   ``He's very quick, very impressive, doesn't get ruffled. He
seems just like a Brazilian playing,'' said Taffarel, paying Hadji
the ultimate accolade.
	   To buttress the midfield, Leonardo is expected to start in place
of Giovanni, who played poorly against Scotland and was yanked at
half-time. Brazil improved in the second half, when it got the
winning goal.
	   At a final pre-game scrimmage on Sunday, Leonardo trained with
the starters and scored a goal in their 5-1 victory over the
reserves.
	   ``The coach hasn't told me anything yet, but I'm ready,'' the
Milan midfielder said. ``Morocco is a dangerous team, with many
variations. But the defense doesn't seem to be much concerned with
tactics. They leave spaces.''
	   Against Norway, Morocco was nearly undone by its defense.
Defender Youssef Chippo headed a ball into his own net attempting
to clear, and goalie Driss Benzekri often looked hesitant. Michel,
the coach, admitted defense was ``our weak point.''
	   Brazil hopes to exploit that weakness with Cafu and Roberto
Carlos, charging up the wing and lofting passes to Ronaldo, Bebeto
and Rivaldo. Another weapon is the accuracy of Bebeto on free kicks
and corners.
	   ``The team is meshing, the plays are starting to flow
naturally,'' said Bebeto, who scored three goals in the scrimmage.
``What's missing is that last pass, the one that puts the player in
front of the goal. But it's coming.''

 &UR; FRANCE: Jamaican World Cup fans weather defeat with enthusiasm &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Beating drums, dancing and waving a sea of
colorful national flags, Jamaican fans turned their nation's World
Cup debut into a Caribbean carnival.
	   About 10,000 Jamaican supporters, many with their faces painted
in the national colors, packed into Felix Bollaert Stadium to cheer
on the underdog ``Reggae Boyz'' against Croatia.
	   For most, the biggest thrill was simply being there Sunday night
for a party that even Croatia's 3-1 win couldn't spoil.
	   ``We're here to have fun,'' said Trevor Bird, 34, who had driven
from Amsterdam to watch his team. ``We know we won't win the World
Cup. But we don't even have a professional league and we qualified.
That's reason enough to celebrate.''
 &UR; SURINAME: Labor unions halt strike while president mulls demands
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Labor unions said Sunday they would
halt a five-day general strike that closed schools and shut down
businesses across Suriname last week.
	   Union leaders said they suspended the protest because President
Jules Wijdenbosch, under pressure from both workers and business
owners to resign as Suriname's economy continues to sink, has
promised to issue an official response to their demands by Friday.
	   Workers have criticized Wijdenbosch's plans to privatize
government-owned corporations, including the State Oil Co. and
Surland, a banana company. They also complain that despite giving
raises to nurses and teachers, he has done little to boost most
salaries and stem inflation.
	   Suriname, a former Dutch colony located on the northeast
shoulder of South America, is the second poorest country in the
Western Hemisphere after Haiti.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Gorbachev urges United States to end Cuban embargo
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, whose reforms heralded the end of the Soviet Union, is
urging the United States to loosen its embargo against Cuba.
	   In an interview published Sunday, Gorbachev told the San Juan
Star that an increase of trade would spur moves toward democracy.
Gorbachev visited Puerto Rico on Saturday to attend a dinner
sponsored by the State of the World Forum.
	   ``I think it's a shame that the blockade is continuing,''
Gorbachev said. ``If it is lifted, very soon there would be a rapid
process of democratization in Cuba.''
	   He warned the U.S. from making Castro a target for diplomatic
pressure, calling the Cuban president a ``broad-minded'' leader who
``requires that he be respected.''
 &UR; NEW YORK: Puerto Rican parade draws huge crowd in New York
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Waving and wearing all varieties of the red,
white and blue Puerto Rican flag, thousands jammed a rainy Fifth
Avenue in New York on Sunday for the 40th annual parade celebrating
the culture of the Caribbean island.
	   The parade, which some critics say was maligned in one of the
last episodes of the television comedy, ``Seinfeld,'' was an
opportunity for Puerto Ricans to display their passion for the
heritage of the U.S. territory.
	   ``He disrespected us by burning the flag like that, it wasn't
right,'' said Jennifer Roman, a 23-year-old accountant from New
Jersey.
	   Use of the Puerto Rican flag is a painful subject for many
because flying it was prohibited during part of the U.S. occupation
of the island.
 &UR; GUYANA: Man freed after prosecutors decide against third drug
trial
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A North Carolina man tried twice on
charges he smuggled cocaine inside cricket equipment is free after
Guyanese prosecutors decided against trying him a third time.
	   Steven Ross Kivett, 26, of Greensboro, North Carolina, was
released by a Guyanese judge Friday afternoon, local newspapers
reported.
	   Kivett was convicted in April 1997 of trying to export 4.5
kilograms of cocaine in cricket bats, gloves and other gear. He
claimed the cricket gear belonged to a friend and that he was
carrying it on a flight to London as a favor.
	   An appeals court annulled the first verdict in October after
discovering unspecified procedural errors in Kivett's trial. A
second trial in March was abandoned halfway through because the
judge detected evidence of jury tampering.
 &UR; MIAMI: Haitian immigrants say son's organs taken without
permission
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The parents of a little boy killed in a car crash
eight years ago are suing the University of Miami, charging their
son's organs were taken without their consent and against the
cultural beliefs of their native Haiti.
	   ``My son can never rest in peace because he doesn't have eyes or
a heart,'' Emmanuel Vernet said in a recent interview. ``In Haiti,
we bury the whole body _ just as we came into the world.''
	   In a key test case of Florida's law governing organ donation,
the lawsuit brought by Emmanuel Vernet, a Collier County, Florida,
farm contractor, and his common-law wife Immacula Vincent is to go
to trial July 13 in Lee County, Florida.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Court orders new election in four districts
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's Election Court has ordered
four southeastern polling districts to hold new parliamentary
elections for a third time because of irregularities in vote
counts.
	   Voters in west-central St. Andrew Parish, an area near the
capital of Kingston, will once again choose between Warren Blake of
the ruling People's National Party and Andrew Holness of the
Jamaica Labor Party.
	   Holness became Jamaica's youngest lawmaker at age 25 by winning
the Dec. 18 election with 8,649 votes to Blake's 8,496. The
election court later annulled the results because of discrepancies
discovered during ballot-counting.
	   Blake, a medical doctor, won the second election on March 26 by
297 votes.

Hong Kong's jobless rate rises to 4.2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 4.2
percent in the three months ended in May _ the highest in 15 years
_ as Asia's economic crisis showed no signs of abating, the
government said Monday.
	   The figure marked a worsening from the three months ended in
April, when the jobless rate hit a 13-year high of 3.9 percent.
	   Government economist Elley Mao told a news conference the rise
in joblessness was ``triggered largely by the financial turmoil and
the unstable economic conditions in the Asian region.''
	   ``Short of the onset of an economic recovery, there are no quick
fixes to the problem,'' she added.
	   Last month, the government announced that Hong Kong's economy
had shrunk by 2 percent in this year's first quarter, the first
such contraction in 13 years.
	   Pressure is mounting on the government to increase public
spending and make further tax cuts to lift the economy. A coalition
of seven political parties has said it would back a deficit budget
if necessary.
	   But Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa has hinted the government
would not consider budgeting a deficit, saying that would bring a
new round of currency speculation against the Hong Kong dollar.
	   Although Hong Kong has weathered Asia's economic crisis better
than many other economies, the territory is suffering from rapidly
falling property prices and weak stock prices.

Cesare Saqr, adviser to pro-Israel militia chief, dies at 75
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Cesare Saqr, a senior aide to the
commander of Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army, died Monday after a
long illness at age 75, his family announced.
	   Saqr was a leader of the radical Guardian of the Cedars, a
Christian militia formed during the 1975-90 civil war, which openly
sided with Israel during its 1982 invasion and subsequent
occupation of southern Lebanon.
	   Born in Bajjeh north of Beirut, Saqr moved to Marjayoun in
Israeli-occupied South Lebanon where the Israeli troops trained and
armed the 2,500 members of South Lebanon Army.
	   Saqr became Gen. Antoine Lahd's adviser in 1984 when Lahd became
the commander of SLA after the death of Saad Haddad.
	   Saqr, a cousin of the Cedars founder Etienne Saqr, is survived
by his wife.
	   The funeral is scheduled for later Monday.

Thai petition seeks refund of down payment on jets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: DELETES photo tag, no pictures transmitted; no other changes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A popular Bangkok radio station on
Monday delivered to the U.S. Embassy a petition with more than
85,000 signatures asking for the return of a dlrs 74.5 million down
payment on eight F/A-18 jet fighters.
	   Thailand ordered the planes when its economy was booming, but
found itself unable to pay after last year's financial crisis
nearly emptied the government's coffers.
	   In an unusual move aimed at easing Thailand's burden, President
Bill Clinton said in March that the U.S. government was prepared to
take over the contract, limiting the Thai obligation to the
deposit. The contract called for dlrs 317 million more to be paid
for delivery of the jets, or dlrs 250 million in termination costs.
	   ``This is not a protest. We would like the American government
to help us share the burden by returning a portion of the money, if
not all, because our economy is in a very critical situation,''
said Praphan Chiraphonghe, who led a group of 27 people in
presenting the petition to the embassy.
	   Praphan, deputy manager of Jor Sor 100, a radio station that
caters to Bangkok's drivers, said the station initiated the
petition drive after receiving many calls from concerned listeners.
	   ``We understand the money already has been used for the
production of the jet fighters and that somebody will have to pick
up the bill. But if there is a buyer for the jets, we are hoping
that the American government could be sympathetic and return us the
money,'' he said.
	   The United States had agreed to allow Thailand to try to find a
new buyer who would assume all costs for the warplanes, but
Bangkok's efforts failed,
	   Last month, the embassy announced that the U.S. Marine Corps
would take the jets, but had not agreed to refund the down payment.
	   ``The U.S. has never done this or intervened with a contractor
for any country before,'' said defense expert Panitan
Wattanayagorn, a professor at Chulalongkorn University. ``This was
a very positive outcome for Thailand.''
	   ``This is a difficult situation for both sides. We have a
contract to fulfill,'' he said. ``But then again, 85,116 is a lot
of people.''

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders must plot a course
Monday out of a tangle of disputes or risk delaying their plan to
draw in their eastern neighbors in hopes of finally ending the
post-war division of Europe.
	   The 15 nations agree the EU's workings must be streamlined
before they bring in Poland, Cyprus, Estonia and up to eight other
new members. But they opened a two-day summit hopelessly split on
how the reforms should adjust the EU's balance of power.
	   The leaders know taking on the poor farmers and declining
industries of the old east bloc will add to the EU's budget burden,
but they can't agree on who should pay.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose country provides almost one-third
of the EU budget, says Germany's should pay less and get more in
return. Poorer members _ Greece, Portugal and Spain _ resist talk
of diverting the flow of EU funds from south to east.
	   ``Chancellor Kohl will make his point very strongly on behalf of
Germany and that is his right,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
the current EU president, told BBC radio Monday. ``But I would
doubt myself whether the summit would go any further than ... to
note that there is this issue here, but not to resolve it today.''
	   Blair is at least hoping the showpiece summit of his six-month
EU presidency will get the debate on track so the enlargement can
go ahead in the first half of the next decade.
	   ``If we can put economic reform and political reform for the
future right at the top of the agenda, that is a significant
advance,'' he told reporters in the Welsh capital Sunday.
	   French President Jacques Chirac said reform was essential before
the union could open its arms to its ``brothers'' to the east and
reunite the European ``family'' after the divisions of the Cold
War.
	   ``To be frank, (EU institutions) do not work very well,'' Chirac
told BBC television Sunday. ``When we are more than 15, they won't
work at all.''
	   Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wrote to Blair to say
the way ahead was to devolve power from EU head office to national
governments to create what the French leader called a ``Europe of
nations.''
	   The idea appealed to Blair, who told the BBC: ``The answer is
not a European superstate, but is decentralization in Europe.'' But
smaller EU nations fear a ploy to allow the EU's big countries to
dominate.
	   When the EU leaders last sought to overhaul the body a year ago,
they produced the Treaty of Amsterdam, a much watered-down
compromise that most now acknowledge solved none of their problems.
By relaunching the debate now, the Europeans are aiming to resolve
the institutional dispute and the divisions over who pays by 2000.
	   They are unlikely to get a breakthrough on Germany's 21 billion
mark (dlrs 11.7 billion) net-contribution to EU coffers until after
the country's legislative elections in September.
	   Away from their internal problems, the EU leaders will have
their customary debate on how to get Europe's 18 million unemployed
back to work. They are boosted this time by encouraging signs of
economic recovery.
	   EU foreign ministers, also in Cardiff, will monitor developments
in the Balkans as NATO launches air exercises over Albania in an
effort to dissuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from
pursuing his military action in Kosovo.
	   The 15 finance ministers will focus on the latest economic
wobbles in Russia and Japan, where the yen fell to an eight-year
low against the dollar and stock prices tumbled Monday.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _The Australian Tourist Commission Monday
said it will spend U.S. dlrs 88 million (Australian dollars 150
million) on an advertising campaign showcasing Australia in Europe,
the United States, Asia and New Zealand.
	   The campaign aims to offset some of the losses to the U.S. dlr
3.54 billion (Australian dollar 6 billion) annual tourism industry
caused by a drop in visitors from Asia because of the economic
crisis in the region.
	   The commission, a government marketing body, will draw the money
partly from its government funding and partly from tourism sector
companies for a four-year campaign, said spokeswoman Katrina
Fraser.
	   The campaign will incorporate television and print advertising,
tactical campaigns with industry partners, Internet marketing,
direct mail and trade advertising, the commission said.
	   The new Asia campaign is expected to be launched later this
year, while the new campaigns for the other target countries will
be launched in early 1999.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Department of Labor has ruled
that financially troubled Philippine Airlines can require its
pilots to retire early, the chief complaint in a crippling strike
by the pilot's union.
	   Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said PAL management followed
the terms of a collective bargaining agreement in ordering the
early retirement last December of Capt. Albino Collantes, 45, a
senior pilot.
	   The management and union were informed of Trajano's ruling on
Monday.
	   The 625-member pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest a
management policy of ordering pilots to retire who have reached 20
years of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   The policy puts 225 pilots in danger of forced retirement, said
Capt. Sotico Lloren, president of the union.
	   Meanwhile, the labor department said the pilots' union has filed
another notice of strike, this time citing alleged unfair labor
practices. The notice was filed by mail last Thursday.
	   The union first filed a notice of strike in December following
Collantes' forced retirement.
	   The strike was finally called June 5 after the union accused
management of filing administrative charges against another pilot
who delayed a flight by returning to the gate for refueling, and of
delays in turning over union dues.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Government economic planners proposed
Monday revisions of the country's growth and inflation targets for
1998 following worse-than-expected first quarter economic results.
	   The proposals by the National Economic and Development Authority
are to be discussed by the Development Budget Coordinating Council,
an interagency group composed of economic, finance and monetary
officials.
	   NEDA is recommending that the government's gross national
product growth target for the year be revised to between 2.5
percent and 3.5 percent from an earlier goal of between 3 percent
and 4 percent.
	   It is also recommending that the inflation target be raised to
between 9.4 percent and 10.3 percent from an earlier 7.5 percent to
8.5 percent.
	   Considerably lower-than-expected first quarter growth data
caused the government to review its targets, even though the
Philippines has weathered the regional financial crisis better than
most of its neighbors.
	   GNP in the first three months expanded by 2.5 percent, compared
to 5.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997. GNP growth averaged
5.8 percent in 1997.
	   Inflation in May was 10.3 percent, hitting double-digit levels
for the first time since mid-1996.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Seagram Co. Ltd. of Canada has signed
a dlrs 59 million contract to increase its stake in South Korea's
largest alcoholic beverage maker, Doosan, industry officials said
Monday.
	   The deal will increase Seagram's 50 percent stake in Doosan
Seagram Co. Ltd to 77.8 percent, they said.
	   Doosan Seagram was set up in 1980 as a 50-50 joint venture to
sell Seagram's whiskey products in South Korea. It holds about 55
percent of the nation's dlrs 643 million whiskey market.
	   Under a separate deal announced Monday, Seagram also will lend
dlrs 31 million to Doosan at an annual interest rate of 5 per cent.
The loan's maturity date has not been decided.
	   Doosan officials said the deals are part of their company's
efforts to improve its financial structure amid the worst financial
crisis in years.
	   Doosan, a major conglomerate, has plans to sell or merge 19 of
its 23 subsidiaries by the end of this year to focus on its food
and beverage, advertising and construction businesses.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea's economy contracted 2.6
percent in 1997, the eighth straight year of decline in the
reclusive communist country, South Korea's central bank said
Monday.
	   The North's economy began shrinking in 1990 when it lost most of
its former trade and aid partners with the collapse of communism in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
	   Seoul's central Bank of Korea said North Korea generated only
dlrs 12 billion in gross national product (GNP) in 1997, down 2.6
percent from the previous year.
	   The North's 1997 GNP was about one-25th of that of capitalist
South Korea the same year, the report said.
	   The Bank of Korea's report estimated North Korea's trade volume
in 1997 at dlrs 2.18 billion, up slightly from dlrs 1.98 billion
the previous year. The increase was due to imports of more food
from China and other countries, it said.
	   North Korea, the report said, exported dlrs 910 million worth of
goods last year but imported dlrs 1.27 billion worth, posting a
dlrs 360 million trade deficit.
	   The bank estimated North Korea's foreign debt totaled dlrs 11.9
billion last year.
	   South Korea compiles annual estimates on North Korea's economy
with data obtained from the North's trading partners and other
sources.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese government trade promotion organization
called Monday for Asian economies to stop tying their currencies to
the U.S. dollar and start using the yen to carry out more
transactions.
	   The Japan External Trade Organization, a state-funded affiliate
of the Japanese Trade Ministry, urged the abandonment of so-called
currency pegs to the dollar as a means of speeding Asia's recovery
from the recent economic crisis.
	   Instead of a dollar-based peg system, it suggested using a
pricing gauge made up of a currency basket, or trade-weighted
average of several regional monetary units.
	   At the same time, JETRO also recommended an expanded role for
the yen as a key currency for carrying out financial and trade
deals in Asia.
	   Many regional economies, including Hong Kong, have suffered
lower growth as a result of interest rates hikes carried out to
defend the fixed value of local currencies against the dollar.
	   Abandoning a dollar peg in favor of a more flexible regional
currency basket could lead lower interest rates, but it also might
increase foreign exchange market volatility.
	   To increase the use of the Japanese currency in the Asian
region, JETRO called for the creation of more yen-based financial
instruments and transaction settlement arenas.

Israel: Yassin will be able to return to Gaza
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has decided to allow Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
the spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, to return
to the Gaza Strip after his 14-week fundraising tour of the Arab
world, an official said Monday.
	   Israel officials wavered on letting Yassin back into Gaza, but
apparently determined that the quadriplegic Hamas leader posed more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his activities can be
monitored by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   Yassin has raised millions of dollars and pledges of support for
Hamas during his trip, and Arafat apparently is increasingly
concerned about the challenge to his rule posed by Hamas.
	   The Islamic militant group opposes Arafat's peace agreements
with Israel and has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings
since 1994 in hopes of wrecking the accords.
	   Yassin is currently in Khartoum, Sudan, awaiting permission to
return to Gaza via Egypt.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Yassin had permission to return to Gaza, but that no date had been
set.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the group was informed by the
Palestinian Authority that Israel would let Yassin return as early
as the end of the week. Palestinian officials have asked Hamas to
notify them of Yassin's return 24 hours ahead of time.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall in exchange for
the freedom of two Israeli spies captured in Jordan during a
bungled assassination attempt against another Hamas leader.

Yeltsin to chair Cabinet meeting on anti-crisis program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will chair an expanded
Cabinet meeting next week on the government's measures to combat
Russia's financial crisis and stabilize the markets, the
presidential press service said Monday.
	   The meeting on June 23 will also be attended by members of the
both houses of parliament, the press service said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko will present the
government's anti-crisis program at an economic forum in St.
Petersburg on Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted the
speaker of parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov, as saying.
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, had earlier been
scheduled to hold a discussion of the anti-crisis program of
Wednesday, and Kiriyenko was expected to attend. But the debates
have been called off, Seleznyov said, without providing a new date.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said Monday the government
is dealing with a ``very difficult situation,'' including both the
new financial crisis and the chronic problems of a debt-ridden
economy and the need for reforming the tax system.
	   ``All these problems have fallen on the government like a
snowball,'' Nemtsov was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.
	   ``If we don't solve these problems during the summer, things
will get very hot in the fall.''
	   The collapse of Russia's financial markets late last month has
prompted fears of devaluation of the national currency, the ruble _
which would lead to a sharp rise in prices. Russian officials worry
that inflation, combined with the government's continuing inability
to pay state workers' wages on time, could lead to mass protests.
	   The stock market fall has been slowed slightly by rumors of an
emergency bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Many market participants say the continued slide on the markets
can only be halted with the aid of a substantial aid package
involving multilateral financial institutions.

Hong Kong shares plunge on high interest rates, weak yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices tumbled Monday, sending
the key index down 5.7 percent, as investors dumped stocks because
of worries over the weakening Japanese yen and soaring local
interbank interest rates.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 452.94 points to 7,462.50, its lowest close since Jan. 30,
1995.
	   Turnover amounted to 6.24 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
800 million), up from Friday's 5.99 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 767 million).
	   Brokers attributed the plunge to the sinking yen, which fell
below 146.00 against the U.S. dollar Monday.
	   As a result, Hong Kong interbank rates surged to levels not seen
since January, when the stock market was hit by a mini-crash and
the Hong Kong dollar was rocked by international speculators.
	   ``The interbank rates have remained relatively high compared
with the previous weeks, and we continue to see some dramatic
selling of the yen today,'' said Vincent Cheung, a trader at
Sassoon Securities Ltd.
	   The volatile overnight Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate was
quoted at 8.00 percent, up from 6.00 percent late Friday, but well
off its intraday high of 15.0 percent. The three-month rate was 14
percent, up from 12.5 percent late Friday, but down from 16.25
percent earlier Monday.
	   The local jitters were compounded early Monday by a newspaper
report quoting China's executive vice premier, Li Lanqing, as
saying Beijing would be in ``a very difficult position if the
Japanese yen continued its fall.''
	   While the reported comment was in line with comments by a
People's Bank of China official last week, it unnerved an already
skittish market.
	   In an address on the first day of an Australian visit, Hong Kong
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa told business and academic leaders
that Japan should be doing more to stabilize the economic turmoil
in the region.
	   ``No one should doubt the tremendous sacrifice that both Hong
Kong and the mainland of China are bearing to prevent the problems
of currency depreciation from cascading,'' Tung said.
	   After the market closed, the Hong Kong government said
unemployment rose to 4.2 percent in the three-month period ended in
May. It was the highest unemployment rate in 15 years.

France hands Spain a veteran Basque separatist leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A man thought to be a Basque separatist
leader was arrested early Monday by Spanish police after being
expelled from neighboring France.
	   Jose Luis Ansola Larranaga is wanted in Spain for his
involvement with the Basque separatists and for his direct
participation in at least 16 attacks.
	   Ansola, also known as ``Pello el Viejo'' or Pello the Elder, was
arrested on Feb. 19 on the French-Spanish border for violating
house arrest.
	   France had already expelled Larranaga once from its territory in
1984, but he later returned clandestinely. In 1986, he was
sentenced to six years in jail by a French court on charges of
criminal association.
	   The French government has cooperated for several years with
Spain, expelling Basque separatists wanted by Spanish police, and
breaking its tradition of letting ETA members take refuge in three
Basque provinces in southwest France.
	   Also Monday, Spanish police arrested six suspected separatists
in the northern Basque towns of Carranza y Sopelana.
	   Nearly 800 people have been killed since ETA began fighting for
independence of northern Spain's three Basque provinces in 1968.

Anti-flea treatment thumbs-up from most European Union countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ An anti-flea treatment allowing cat
owners to stroke their pets without getting chemicals on their
hands has been approved by regulators in most European countries,
Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis said Monday.
	   The advantage of the new injectable treatment, Novartis said, is
the lack of chemical residue on the animal, which means owners can
pet their cats without worry. Half of all cats in Europe develop a
new flea infestation every year, the company said.
	   The six-month flea treatment can be marketed in Austria, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg.
	   The approvals came under the European Union's decentralized
licensing system of certain products.

Foreign secretary calls on Yugoslav leader to stop violence in
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-NATO-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic Monday that NATO is prepared ``to take
action'' if he doesn't act immediately to halt the violence against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   As 84 aircraft from 13 NATO countries including Britain and the
United States began exercises over Albania and Macedonia, Cook
urged Milosevic to look very closely at the impressive show of air
power.
	   ``He has got to stop the violence now and get back to the
negotiating table,'' Cook told GMTV.
	   At a meeting in London Friday, leaders of the eight major
industrialized nations demanded that Milosevic call an immediate
cease-fire, allow effective international monitoring, facilitate
the return of over 50,000 refugees who have been made homeless, and
``make rapid progress'' in talks with Albanian leaders.
	   ``We said on Friday that President Milosevic has to act
immediately. There is no future deadline. He has to act now,'' Cook
said.
	   Milosevic has ignored increasing international pressure and his
army has stepped up an offensive against ethnic Albanians, who
account for nearly 90 percent of the population in Kosovo.
	   The Yugoslav leader is expected to meet later Monday in Moscow
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who has been reluctant to
sanction any military action in Kosovo. The United States, Britain,
Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada have entrusted Yeltsin
with the job of convincing Milosevic to withdraw his army.
	   ``Hopefully he (Milosevic) will take the opportunity at the
forthcoming meeting with President Yeltsin to confirm he has
accepted the wishes of the international community,'' Cook said.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England and Tunisia fought their World
Cup match a day early, heaving bottles, smashing windows and
shouting insults. The melee that continued into the early hours
Monday left nearly 50 people injured, three seriously.
	   Some 50 people were arrested, according to police. Among them
were about 30 British, six Tunisians and up to a dozen French,
according World Cup organizers.
	   About 36 injured spent the night in the hospital, including a
young English fan slashed in the neck and suffering from a slit
artery, according to police and Narine rescue officials. Two others
were also in serious condition.
	   ``The fear is that the better-known ringleaders are still on
their way to Marseille. The fact that they are coming so late
proves that they are not interested in the football, only what
comes after,'' said FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper at a press briefing
Monday in Paris.
	   Marseille Police Chief Michel Sappin said police ranks were
being reinforced in the city center and around Velodrome stadium in
advance of the England-Tunisia game at 2:30 p.m. (1230 GMT).
	   Lines of riot police ready to sweep in if needed could be seen
outside Marseille. Authorities had already planned to deploy 1,600
uniformed or plainclothes city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100
elite CRS national police for the match.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair Monday branded the
troublemakers a ``total disgrace'' and offered French authorities
his unreserved backing in dealing with offenders.
	   ``The activities of those fans are a total disgrace,'' he was
quoted in the tabloid Today. ``They have nothing whatever to do
with the best interests of English football or our country ... I
condemn it completely.''
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks had earlier called the
troublemakers ``drunken, brain-dead louts.''
	   Sappin said that scheduling the English-Tunisia match for a
Monday was ``an error'' because it gave hooligans a chance to drink
throughout the weekend.
	   At Saint-Charles train station, a group of Tunisians ambushed
English fans arriving on a midnight train. Heads were bloodied on
both sides before police could intervene.
	   ``It will get worse, whatever happens,'' said Gary Lazarus, a
London printer here for the match. ``If England loses, people will
want revenge. If Tunisia loses, they'll come after us.''
	   English fans spent most of Sunday drinking peacefully, if
noisily, at bars on the Canebiere, a once elegant boulevard that
has gone to seed. Young Tunisians from the tough northern suburbs
buzzed them repeatedly on motorscooters, waving flags.
	   ``Some silly person hit a Tunisian and started it,'' according
to Jeff Cotgrave, 30, an electrical worker from Birmingham, who
left the area for safety.
	   ``I know Englishmen aren't all so good, but the Tunisians and
police provoked English supporters all day,'' he said.
	   Few Tunisians wanted to comment. When asked how the trouble
started, one brandished the heavy metal pole he was carrying.
	   During the eruptions Sunday and into the early hours of Monday,
hundreds of police, with riot gear, tear gas and dogs, separated
small groups of Britons from excited crowds of local Tunisians, who
chanted and taunted.
	   The English fought back when they could evade police lines. At
one point, a dozen of them stood behind an unfurled Union Jack,
urging a bottle-throwing crowd to attack. When one young Tunisian
advanced, a Briton slammed him with a chair.
	   Police picked off drunken English, wrestling them to the ground,
handcuffing them and hauling them off to jail.
	   As riot troops led away a bald, burly Englishman, Tunisian kids
jeered.
	   Three sober young Englishmen were distressed by the rioting.
They had met the day before at a police station where they
separately reported break-ins of their cars.
	   ``I'm here on holiday, and all I want to do is see my team
play,'' said Lazarus, one of the three. He had covered up his blue
and red Coventry soccer jersey with a sweatshirt.

Defector: Resistance force exists in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A prominent defector from North Korea
said Monday an anti-government resistance force exists in the
reclusive communist state.
	   ``There has been a resistance force in North Korea, opposing its
leadership and distributing leaflets (with anti-government
slogans),'' Hwang Jang Yop, 75, told reporters at a news
conference.
	   ``But it is not known to the outside world because of North
Korea's isolation and its harsh suppression of such moves,'' he
said.
	   North Korea has been executing all people found to be involved
with such forces, and the government punishes families of defectors
to South Korea, he said.
	   The general public's attitude also has changed somewhat, he
said.
	   ``With so many people dying of starvation, people realize that
their leaders have been lying to them,'' Hwang said, referring to
the North Korean propaganda that the North is a socialist paradise.
	   ``Most people still don't think that their leaders are really
bad, but just say that they cannot stand the (food shortage)
situation any more and something should change,'' he added.
	   The North Korean government will change eventually, but it will
try to keep the change within the framework of the one-man
dictatorship of Kim Jong Il, based on a personality cult, Hwang
said.
	   ``Nothing in this world remains unchanged. And it depends much
on South Korea and the international community what kinds of
changes will be made in North Korea and how far they would reach,''
he said.
	   Promoting communication from the top and economic and culture
exchanges from the bottom between the two Koreas, as well as
humanitarian food aid, is most important to achieve the goal, he
said.
	   ``The most important thing is inducing North Korea toward reform
and opening to prevent a war on the Korean Peninsula,'' Hwang said.
	   Hwang, a former confidant of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il,
arrived in Seoul in April 1997, ending a 67-day odyssey that began
when he defected to the South Korean Embassy in Beijing early last
year.
	   Korea has been divided into the communist North and capitalist
South since 1945. The two sides fought a bloody war in 1950-53.

PLO Convenant, scope of third pullback, remaining sticking points
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Disagreement over who will annul the PLO
founding charter and determine the scope of a final West Bank troop
withdrawal are holding up Israeli acceptance of the U.S. peace
initiative, a senior Israeli official said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with key Cabinet ministers
for three hours Monday to discuss the U.S. plan, which calls for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged Netanyahu
to make a decision soon, but informal U.S. deadlines have passed
without U.S. action against Israel. The United States presented its
plan in January, and the Palestinians have accepted it.
	   Israel TV reported Sunday that Netanyahu had agreed to a 13
percent pullback after initially saying he could hand over only 9
percent. Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the
Americans had not informed the Palestinians of any such agreement.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, would not comment
Monday on the report, but suggested that the size of that
withdrawal, the second of three promised by Israel, was no longer
an issue.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu wants iron-clad U.S. assurances that
the scope of the third pullback be determined by Israel, without
U.S. involvement.
	   ``We don't want an open-ended situation about a third
redeployment,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press. ``The American
commitment that we be the
	   only ones to determine its scope must be nailed down.''
	   Israel also insists that the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, annul sections of the PLO
founding charter, rather than the much smaller PLO Executive
Committee.
	   In the U.S. proposal, a vote by the PLO Executive Committee is
considered sufficient to annul those sections. However, Bar-Illan
said the PLO charter itself stipulates that it can only be changed
by a two-thirds majority of the Palestine National Council.
	   In other developments Monday, four Palestinian opposition
groups, including the Islamic militant group Hamas, said they would
turn down offers by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to join his
Cabinet.
	   However, Hamas and two secular PLO factions, the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said they would attend consultations with
Arafat on Tuesday concerning his planned Cabinet reshuffle.
	   ``We are going to listen to the president and to present our
views, but we are not going to join the new Cabinet,'' said Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar.
	   A fourth group, Islamic Jihad, said it would not join the talks.
	   Arafat apparently hoped to neutralize the opposition groups by
offering them Cabinet posts.
	   Arafat is under pressure from the Palestinian legislative
council to reshuffle his Cabinet. Last month, the 88-member
legislature gave Arafat two weeks to respond to complaints about
corruption and inaction or face his first no-confidence motion.
	   Arafat has sent a letter to the council asking it to postpone
its no-confidence vote and give PLO leaders up to 10 days to
present a new Cabinet. The reshuffle is to be completed by Friday.

Turkey searches Maltese ship for missile parts to Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GELIBOLU, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities stopped a Maltese-flagged
cargo ship in Turkish waters Monday on suspicion that it was
carrying Russian missile parts to Cyprus, news reports said.
	   Maritime officials said they found some parts aboard the
Natasha-1 that they suspected of being Russian S-300 missile
launchers, the semi-official Anatolia news agency said. Military
experts were called to determine the nature of the cargo.
	   ``Our friends are checking the cargo,'' said Muhittin Gargili, a
maritime official, without elaborating.
	   Turkey has vowed to take military action if the missiles are
installed by the Greek Cypriots, claiming they are a threat to
Turkish Cypriots in the north and Turkey itself.
	   Cyprus says the missiles are purely defensive.
	   Turkey stepped up its surveillance in its waters to prevent the
shipment of the Russian made anti-aircraft missile parts to Cyprus
after reports last week that radars and control panels for five
S-300 missile systems had reached Cyprus by sea.
	   Coast guard boats, receiving a tip, stopped the ship in the
Dardanelles Strait, linking the Mediterranean Sea to Black Sea,
Anatolia said.
	   The agency said the ship declared its cargo as Russian tractors
for Egypt.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkey sent in troops in 1974
after an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. Only
Turkey recognizes the Turkish Cypriot state.

Japan trade body tells Asia to abandon dollar pegs, adopt yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese government trade promotion organization
called Monday for Asian economies to stop tying their currencies to
the U.S. dollar and start using the yen to carry out more
transactions.
	   The Japan External Trade Organization, a state-funded affiliate
of the Japanese Trade Ministry, urged that currency pegs to the
dollar be abandoned to help speed Asia's recovery from the recent
economic crisis.
	   Instead of a dollar-based peg system, it suggested using a
pricing gauge made up of a currency basket, or trade-weighted
average of several regional monetary units.
	   At the same time, JETRO also recommended an expanded role for
the yen as a key currency for carrying out financial and trade
deals in Asia.
	   Many regional economies, including Hong Kong, have suffered
lower growth as a result of interest rate increases made to defend
the fixed value of local currencies against the dollar.
	   Hong Kong so far has exceeded in keeping its currency steady
against the U.S. dollar.
	   Japan's own yen and the currencies of many other Asian nations
have fallen sharply against the dollar in recent months. While the
others generally have kept interest rates high in efforts to
prevent traders from dumping their currencies in favor of dollars,
Japan has kept interest rates at record lows in efforts to
stimulate its slumping economy.
	   Abandoning a dollar peg in favor of a more flexible regional
currency basket could lead interest rates lower, but it also might
increase foreign exchange market volatility.
	   To increase the use of the Japanese currency in the Asian
region, JETRO called for the creation of more yen-based financial
instruments and transaction settlement arenas.

Ex-president's son frees himself from kidnappers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A convicted son of former President
Kim Young-sam was kidnapped Monday but freed himself after
scuffling with assailants armed with dynamite, police said.
	   Kim Hyun-chul, 38, suffered minor bruises on his neck and body
in the scuffle near his home in northern Seoul, they said.
	   Hyun-chul, serving a three-year sentence for bribery and tax
evasion, was released on bail in November pending an appeal to the
Supreme Court.
	   He was found guilty of receiving dlrs 2.1 million in illegal
political funds from businessmen in 1994-95 while his father was in
office. His father left office in February at the end of a
five-year term.
	   Police said Hyun-chul was stopped by a man dressed in a
policeman's uniform as he was about to leave his home in a car to
hike on a nearby mountain.
	   Four more men appeared, forced Hyun-chul and his driver into
separate cars and left the scene, police said, quoting the
president's son and witnesses.
	   As his kidnapper's car slowed to negotiate a curve, Hyun-chul
fought with two abductors, broke open the vehicle's back door and
fled, police said.
	   Hyun-chul's driver was later released unharmed a few kilometers
(miles) away, they said.
	   Police said they found a bundle of dynamite and an electric stun
gun in the car in which Hyun-chul was taken. The car was found
abandoned near the scene of the scuffle, they said.
	   Police said the stun gun was registered to Oh Sun-yul, 54, who
once worked with Hyun-chul in the former president's election
campaign in 1992. He was being sought.
	   Oh's wife told reporters in the western port city of Inchon that
her husband felt betrayed by the ex-president and his son because
he didn't get a patronage job despite a 250 million won (dlrs
350,000) contribution to the campaign.
	   After the election, the president's son even refused to see him,
she said.

Lomu confirmed for England test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ Jonah Lomu has been confirmed in the
All Blacks team to play the first rugby union test against England
at Carisbrook on Saturday.
	   ``We were pleased with him, he did what was required of him on
Saturday, so he'll get to start the game,'' New Zealand coach John
Hart said Monday.
	   Lomu was bracketed with fellow Counties-Manukau winger Joeli
Vidiri when the test side was announced last week. He passed his
fitness and form trial with a strong performance in New Zealand A's
18-10 win over England at Hamilton.
	   Center Walter Little is the only New Zealand injury concern. He
is expected to train Tuesday to prove his foot injury won't trouble
him on Saturday. (djp)

 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders must plot a course
out of a tangle of disputes on Monday or risk delaying their plan
to draw in their eastern neighbors to end the postwar division of
the continent.
	   The 15 nations agree the EU's workings must be streamlined
before they bring in Poland, Cyprus, Estonia and up to eight other
new members. But they opened a two-day summit hopelessly split on
how the reforms should adjust the EU's balance of power.
	   When the EU leaders last sought to overhaul the body a year ago,
they produced the Treaty of Amsterdam, a much watered-down
compromise that most now acknowledge solved none of their problems.
By relaunching the debate now, the Europeans are aiming to resolve
the institutional dispute and the divisions over who pays by 2000.
	   The leaders know that taking on the poor farmers and declining
industries of the old Eastern Bloc will add to the EU's budget
burden, but they can't agree on who should pay.
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl says his country, which pays
almost one-third of the EU budget, should pay less and get more in
return. Poorer members _ Greece, Portugal and Spain _ resist talk
of diverting the flow of EU funds from south to east.
	   ``Chancellor Kohl will make his point very strongly on behalf of
Germany and that is his right,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
the current EU president, told BBC radio Monday. ``But I would
doubt myself whether the summit would go any further than ... to
note that there is this issue here, but not to resolve it today.''
	   Blair is at least hoping the showpiece summit of his six-month
EU presidency will get the debate on track so the enlargement can
go ahead in the first half of the next decade.
	   ``If we can put economic reform and political reform for the
future right at the top of the agenda, that is a significant
advance,'' he told reporters Sunday in the Welsh capital.
	   French President Jacques Chirac said reform was essential to
enable the union to open its arms to its ``brothers'' to the east
and reunite the European ``family'' after the divisions of the Cold
War.
	   ``To be frank, (EU institutions) do not work very well,'' Chirac
told BBC television Sunday. ``When we are more than 15, they won't
work at all.''
	   Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wrote to Blair to say
the way ahead was to devolve power from EU head office to national
governments to create what the French leader called a ``Europe of
nations.''
	   The idea appealed to Blair, who told the BBC: ``The answer is
not a European superstate, but is decentralization in Europe.'' But
smaller EU nations fear a ploy to let the EU's big countries
dominate.
	   They are unlikely to get a breakthrough on Germany's 21 billion
mark (dlrs 11.7 billion) net-contribution to EU coffers until after
the country's legislative elections in September.
	   Away from their internal problems, the EU leaders will have
their customary debate on how to get Europe's 18 million unemployed
back to work. They are boosted this time by encouraging signs of
economic recovery.
	   EU foreign ministers, also in Cardiff, will monitor developments
in the Balkans as NATO launches air exercises over Albania to try
to dissuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from pursuing his
military action in Kosovo.
	   The 15 finance ministers will focus on the latest economic
wobbles in Russia and Japan, where the yen fell to an eight-year
low against the dollar and stock prices tumbled Monday.

Christian Democrats urge Italy's Prodi to return to their fold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-EU Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Six European Union leaders, including
Germany's Helmut Kohl, urged Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi to
return to the leadership of Europe's Christian Democratic movement.
	   Prodi boycotted a meeting of Christian Democratic leaders Sunday
night, upset that 20 members of opposition leader Silvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia party were admitted last week to the
European Parliament's Christian Democratic group.
	   That was seen by many Christian Democrats and others as a
traditionally centrist group lurching to the right.
	   ``I am asking Mr. Prodi to retake his seat at the table of the
leaders'' of European Christian Democrats, Wilfried Martens, the
movement president, told reporters late Sunday, on the eve of a
two-day EU summit here.
	   Martens said that at Sunday night's meeting, Kohl, Spanish Prime
Minister Jose-Maria Aznar and others supported last week's vote of
136 of the 180 members in the European Parliament to absorb the
Forza Italia members.
	   Forza Italia was in power in 1994, running a government with the
far-right National alliance. Adding to his image problems,
Berlusconi is now on trial in several corruption cases.
	   The Christian Democrats in the European Parliament are known as
the European People's Party. With its newest adherents, it now has
200 members. The 213-member Socialist group remains the largest
group in the EU assembly.
	   The Forza Italia members were admitted after they assured
Martens in a letter that they would ``reject every form of
extremism.'' Martens reiterated that Forza Italia itself would not
join the European Christian Democratic movement, but rather 20 of
its members.
	   Still, it was grist for the mill of European Socialists.
	   Their leader, Pauline Green of Britain, said here, ``You see a
right that is today in disarray.''
	   Said Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the Social Democrats in
Germany's parliament, ``I cannot understand why the Christian
Democrats and Conservatives are doing that. You are seeing the
European Peoples' Party move away from its Christian Democratic
base.''

Russia to start lowering Mir's orbit this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Mir space station will start a slow descent
this week in preparation for its discarding, which is scheduled at
the end of 1999, officials said Monday.
	   A cargo ship attached to Mir will fire its engines on Thursday
to lower the station's orbit by about six kilometers (four miles),
said Viktor Blagov, deputy chief of the Mission Control Center.
	   A series of such pushes is supposed to gradually bring down the
Mir's orbit from 400 kilometers (250 miles) now to 120 kilometers
(75 miles), before it burns up in the atmosphere in December 1999.
A few large fragments are to fall into the ocean.
	   However, Yuri Semyonov, head of the state-run RKK Energia
corporation, which built Mir and has been running it since it was
put in orbit in early 1986, has said Russia might be forced to
discard the station as early as this fall because of the space
industry's desperate cash shortage.
	   Blagov, speaking to the ITAR-Tass news agency on Monday, said
the original plan has so far remained unchanged despite the money
problem. Russia hopes that Mir will still be able to earn more cash
by playing host to French and Slovak astronauts, whose nations must
pay for their stay aboard the space station.

Romania to support NATO in possible conflict with Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Defense Minister Victor Babiuc pledged
Romania would support NATO efforts if it decides to use military
intervention against Yugoslavia, newspapers reported Monday.
	   ``Romania will stand by the alliance,'' the daily Adevarul
quoted Babiuc as saying Sunday upon his return from Brussels, where
he sat in on a meeting of NATO defense ministers.
	   On Monday, NATO flexed its muscles in the Balkans, sending 84
aircraft in a military training exercise over Albania and
Macedonia. It was a move designed to show Yugoslavia how quickly
and powerfully the alliance can deploy its forces if needed.
	   Yugoslavia and Romania have a common border of more than 300
kilometers (188 miles) and the two countries have had good
relations both before and after the fall of communism.
	   Romania broke a U.N. embargo against the former Yugoslavia
several times, exporting gasoline to help its neighbor. The embargo
ended in 1996.
	   Romania badly wants to join NATO, but the military alliance
decided last year that it needed to further develop economic and
democratic institutions. The former communist countries of the
Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary were invited to join.

2 teens rescued from south China cave after 42 days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two teen-age girls who got lost in a cave when
their candle went out survived for 42 days until they were rescued,
but two others in their group died, the Xinhua News Agency reported
Monday.
	   Four young people exploring the countryside near Jinzitian
village in hilly Guizhou province discovered the survivors Saturday
and called for help. Local farmers pulled the girls out of the
narrow cave and medical teams took them to a hospital, the report
said.
	   The trapped students had entered the cave May 2 while on an
outing in the rural area outside Guiyang, capital of the province
in southwest China.
	   The report said they had some water to drink while trapped, but
no food.
	   The No. 1 Middle School in Guiyang, where the girls were
students and residents, did not know their destination and reported
them missing after seven days.
	   The report said Li Qingzhu, 16, and Liang Xiaofei survived. It
said the rescuers found the bodies of the girls' female classmate
Huang Yan and a boy from another school, Wang Shunrong.

Chief inspector: Iraq close to being free from U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background, Butler leaves Baghdad; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is very close to becoming free of U.N.
economic sanctions, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, said Monday.
	   ``The light at the end of the tunnel today is more visible than
anytime,'' Butler told reporters at the end of his three-day talks
with Iraqi officials on disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council will allow the lifting of the
sanctions only after Butler's United Nations Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has no more illegal weapons.
	   Butler said that UNSCOM can do that in two months provided Iraq
fully cooperates with its arms inspectors.
	   ``I am very positive about it. It is good news ... provided Iraq
fulfills its promises and gives us access to materials and
documents,'' Butler said at the news conference just before leaving
Iraq.
	   During his talks here, Butler had presented Iraq with a list of
obligations, or a ``road map,'' which he said Iraq must fulfill to
back its claims that it has dismantled all banned chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Butler has often said that it needs conclusive proof and cannot
take Iraq's word for it. He has also complained that Iraq has been
evasive in providing documentation.
	   But this time, Butler said, he sensed that Iraq is serious. Both
sides have already embarked on ``concrete steps'' to get the job
done, he said. He did not elaborate.
	   On Sunday, Iraq and UNSCOM agreed to lay down a 2-month work
program to end U.N. disarmament activities in Iraq. At the end of
that period, he and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz are expected
to meet again to take stock of the situation.
	   The developments mark the first signs of an improvement in
relations between UNSCOM and Iraq, which regularly accused Butler
of being a lackey of the United States and Britain.
	   Even Saturday, Sami Saadoun, head of Aziz's office, complained
in a newspaper article that Butler's ``road map'' was designed to
prolong economic sanctions on Iraq indefinitely.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
and bar exports of the country's main commodity of oil except in
limited quantities to earn enough money to feed its people.

Old U.S. Embassy in Saigon, symbol of defeat, being demolished
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The building that came to symbolize the
futility of the U.S. war effort in Vietnam, the former American
Embassy in Ho Chi Minh City, is being demolished, U.S. officials
said Monday.
	   Consular official Melissa Foynef said the demolition started
last Thursday and will take several weeks to complete. The United
States meanwhile is seeking a contractor to build a new consular
office, a job expected to take 12-18 months, she said.
	   The last U.S. personnel to leave what was then called Saigon
were airlifted by helicopter from the roof of the eight-story
building shortly before North Vietnamese troops took over the city
on April 30, 1975, completing the communist takeover of Vietnam.
	   Some 2,000 people _ Americans, Vietnamese and third-country
citizens _ were evacuated from the embassy compound, which was
besieged by Vietnamese desperately seeking escape.
	   News photos showing U.S. soldiers keeping the crowd at bay
became poignant symbols of how Washington had failed to sustain a
pro-Western government in southern Vietnam.
	   After the communist takeover, the embassy building housed the
offices of Petro Vietnam, the state oil exploration company. It was
returned to the United States in 1994, a year before Hanoi and
Washington normalized relations, which had been suspended after the
communist takeover.
	   In 1996, the two former foes exchanged ambassadors, and last
year Washington opened a consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, while Hanoi
opened one in San Francisco.
	   Since Washington lifted its trade embargo on Vietnam in 1994,
the United States has become the country's eighth largest foreign
investor with total investment pledged of dlrs 1.23 billion.
	   Two-way trade between the two countries stands at dlrs 1 billion
annually.

World Cup: English, Tunisian fans fight their match a day early
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new figures on injuries, arrests, FIFA concerned
more hooligans arriving, British prime minister condemning
incidents; separate version moved with ``i'' category code &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos XWCMA101-103

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England and Tunisia fought their World
Cup match a day early, heaving bottles, smashing windows and
shouting insults. The melee that continued into the early hours
Monday left nearly 50 people injured, three seriously.
	   Some 50 people were arrested, according to police. Among them
were about 30 British, six Tunisians and up to a dozen French,
according World Cup organizers.
	   About 36 injured spent the night in the hospital, including a
young English fan slashed in the neck and suffering from a slit
artery, according to police and Narine rescue officials. Two others
were also in serious condition.
	   ``The fear is that the better-known ringleaders are still on
their way to Marseille. The fact that they are coming so late
proves that they are not interested in the football, only what
comes after,'' said FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper at a press briefing
Monday in Paris.
	   Marseille Police Chief Michel Sappin said police ranks were
being reinforced in the city center and around Velodrome stadium in
advance of the England-Tunisia game at 2:30 p.m. (1230 GMT).
	   Lines of riot police ready to sweep in if needed could be seen
outside Marseille. Authorities had already planned to deploy 1,600
uniformed or plainclothes city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100
elite CRS national police for the match.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair Monday branded the
troublemakers a ``total disgrace'' and offered French authorities
his unreserved backing in dealing with offenders.
	   ``The activities of those fans are a total disgrace,'' he was
quoted in the tabloid Today. ``They have nothing whatever to do
with the best interests of English football or our country ... I
condemn it completely.''
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks had earlier called the
troublemakers ``drunken, brain-dead louts.''
	   Sappin said that scheduling the English-Tunisia match for a
Monday was ``an error'' because it gave hooligans a chance to drink
throughout the weekend.
	   At Saint-Charles train station, a group of Tunisians ambushed
English fans arriving on a midnight train. Heads were bloodied on
both sides before police could intervene.
	   ``It will get worse, whatever happens,'' said Gary Lazarus, a
London printer here for the match. ``If England loses, people will
want revenge. If Tunisia loses, they'll come after us.''
	   English fans spent most of Sunday drinking peacefully, if
noisily, at bars on the Canebiere, a once elegant boulevard that
has gone to seed. Young Tunisians from the tough northern suburbs
buzzed them repeatedly on motorscooters, waving flags.
	   ``Some silly person hit a Tunisian and started it,'' according
to Jeff Cotgrave, 30, an electrical worker from Birmingham, who
left the area for safety.
	   ``I know Englishmen aren't all so good, but the Tunisians and
police provoked English supporters all day,'' he said.
	   Few Tunisians wanted to comment. When asked how the trouble
started, one brandished the heavy metal pole he was carrying.
	   During the eruptions Sunday and into the early hours of Monday,
hundreds of police, with riot gear, tear gas and dogs, separated
small groups of Britons from excited crowds of local Tunisians, who
chanted and taunted.
	   The English fought back when they could evade police lines. At
one point, a dozen of them stood behind an unfurled Union Jack,
urging a bottle-throwing crowd to attack. When one young Tunisian
advanced, a Briton slammed him with a chair.
	   Police picked off drunken English, wrestling them to the ground,
handcuffing them and hauling them off to jail.
	   As riot troops led away a bald, burly Englishman, Tunisian kids
jeered.
	   Three sober young Englishmen were distressed by the rioting.
They had met the day before at a police station where they
separately reported break-ins of their cars.
	   ``I'm here on holiday, and all I want to do is see my team
play,'' said Lazarus, one of the three. He had covered up his blue
and red Coventry soccer jersey with a sweatshirt.

More than 1,000 killed in India's week-old cyclone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Health workers tried to head off
potential epidemics of cholera and malaria among survivors of the
cyclone-ravaged areas of western India, where the death toll
crossed 1,000 on Monday, officials said.
	   Rescue workers continued uncovering corpses six days after the
cyclone swept the coast bringing the count to 1,052 in Gujarat
state, said N.N. Sheikh at the crisis control room in Ahmedabad,
the state capital. Another nine people were reported killed in the
neighboring state of Rajastan, and 12 were reported dead across the
border in Pakistan.
	   More than 300 people were listed as missing in a report compiled
Sunday by soldiers and government officials after meetings with
local residents. An uncounted number of unregistered migrant
workers also disappeared in the storm, and an accurate death may
never be known.
	   The storm struck with winds up to 120 kilometers per hour (75
mph), pounding the shore with 7-meter (20-foot) waves, in one of
the most deadly cyclones to hit India in decades.
	   Bodies were still washing up along the coast, and relief workers
discovered more dead in remote villages that were previously
inaccessible.
	   About 40 health teams carrying chlorine tablets and other
medicines fanned out to the worst hit areas where clean drinking
water wasn't available. Thousands of villages were without power,
making it difficult to pump water from village wells.
	   The fear of disease prompted the government to cremate unclaimed
corpses in a mass funeral.
	   Some 7,000 people were being treated in hospitals for
dehydration and other ailments, and for injuries from tin sheets
ripped off roofs or by collapsing trees, electricity poles and
walls.
	   Worst hit were the migrant salt workers and port employees at
Kandla, 530 kilometers (330 miles) northwest of Bombay, where the
cyclone hit unexpectedly and without warning from meteorologists.
	   Survivors crowded into relief camps set up near Kandla, but aid
workers said many more were on the streets. Nearly 1,000 families
were waiting for government help to return to their homes, said
Meher Bhatt of the Disaster Mitigation Institute, a
non-governmental organization involved in relief work.

Police say disgruntled former rebels behind Philippine bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Disgruntled former Muslim rebels
left out of an integration program that would give them steady jobs
as government soldiers were responsible for a series of recent
bombings in the southern Philippines, police said Monday.
	   Regional police chief Dominador Resos said former Moro National
Liberation Front guerrillas launched the attacks in three towns in
Zamboanga del Sur province early this month that left at least five
people dead and 20 others wounded.
	   Resos said the attackers were angry because they were not among
7,500 former guerrillas selected for integration into the country's
military and police forces under a peace accord signed in 1996.
	   The accord ended a quarter-century rebellion that killed more
than 120,000 people on southern Mindanao Island. The two remaining
Muslim rebel groups are small and capable of only sporadic attacks.
	   On Friday, about 200 former MNLF guerrillas returned to an army
training camp they had left last Tuesday to protest strictness and
alleged mistreatment by trainers, military and MNLF officers said.
	   The former rebels are undergoing training prior to their
integration into the armed forces.
	   At least three trainers, including one officer, were reportedly
relieved of their positions following the walkout. The military's
Southern Command, which supervises the integration, refused to
comment.
	   The latest trainees are among 1,024 former rebels currently
undergoing basic infantry training before being absorbed into the
military.
	   An earlier batch of 1,101 former rebels completed training in
January and are now in the army.

Yeltsin to chair Cabinet meeting on anti-crisis program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 3 final grafs with deputy finance minister's
visit to IMF confirmed. Minor edits throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will chair an expanded
Cabinet meeting next week on government measures to combat Russia's
financial crisis and stabilize the markets, the presidential press
service said Monday.
	   The meeting on June 23 will also be attended by members of both
houses of parliament, the press service said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko will present the
government's anti-crisis program at an economic forum in St.
Petersburg on Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted the
speaker of the parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov, as
saying.
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, had earlier been
scheduled to discuss the anti-crisis program on Wednesday, and
Kiriyenko was expected to attend. But the debate has been called
off, Seleznyov said, without providing a new date.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said Monday that the
government is dealing with a ``very difficult situation,''
including the financial crisis, the chronic problems of a
debt-ridden economy and the need for reforming the tax system.
	   ``All these problems have fallen on the government like a
snowball,'' Nemtsov was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   ``If we don't solve these problems during the summer, things
will get very hot in the fall.''
	   The collapse of Russia's financial markets late last month
prompted fears of a devaluation of the national currency, the
ruble, which would lead to a sharp rise in prices. Russian
officials worry that inflation, combined with the government's
continuing inability to pay state workers their wages on time,
could lead to mass protests.
	   The stock market fall has been slowed slightly by rumors of an
emergency bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Although the IMF and Russian government officials say the
country is capable of overcoming the crisis on its own, many market
participants believe a substantial aid package involving the IMF is
vital in order to return market confidence to Russia.
	   The Finance Ministry said Monday that Deputy Finance Minister
Oleg Vyugin, who is in charge of the nation's talks with the IMF,
visited the fund's headquarters in Washington late last week.
	   ``It was part of the preparation for the (release) of the next
dlrs 670 million (loan),'' said ministry spokesman Oleg Zhukov,
adding that the IMF board will meet Thursday to discuss the loan
installment.
	   Zhukov denied that Vyugin had held talks with IMF officials
about additional lending to Russia to help stabilize the nation's
financial markets.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A mine explosion Monday killed two
soldiers and seriously injured another while they were clearing a
mine field on Greece's northeastern border, an army statement said.
	   The blast occurred near the village of Gemisti on the
Greek-Turkish border. The injured soldier was transported to a
hospital in Alexandroupolis, about 42 kilometers (26 miles)
southwest of Gemisti, the army said.
	   The army is investigating the cause of the explosion.
	   Each year, thousands of illegal immigrants attempt to sneak into
Greece across the Evros River separating the two countries and
sometimes stray into mine fields.
	   In April, two Moroccan immigrants were killed after accidentally
wandering into a mine field.

Singapore stocks dive, Merrill Lynch predicts recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Asian Markets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Sellers speeded up their dumping of Singapore
shares Monday as the main index dived 3.5 percent and another
investment house predicted a recession this year.
	   ``Twelve months into the economic crisis, the GDP contraction
across Asia has proved to be severe and widespread,'' said
investment banker Merrill Lynch in a monthly report.
``Fundamentally strong economies like Hong Kong and Singapore now
appear heading for recession.''
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index dropped 38 points,
to 1052.84, mainly because the sliding Japanese yen dragged down
markets and currencies across Asia and investors are nervous about
whether Hong Kong will be able to keep its currency pegged to the
U.S. dollar.
	   With nothing to stop the panic, Singapore's key index looked set
to fall this week below the 9 1/2-year record low of 1,043.34 set
on Jan. 6, 1989.
	   The Singapore dollar has also steadily declined, hovering around
1.75 to the U.S. dollar, compared to 1.43 last July 1, the day
before the Asian crisis began.
	   The main Singapore stock index has dropped 928 points from its
July 1 level of 1,981.28, losing 46.8 percent of its value.
	   Property and bank stocks are leading the sell-off, with the
Properties Index shedding 5.5 percent and the Finance Index losing
4.4 percent on Monday.
	   Merrill Lynch joined four other international investment houses
in predicting Singapore's economy will contract for the year.
Merrill Lynch predicted shrinkage for the last two quarters, the
accepted definition of recession. It forecast contraction of .2
percent for the full year.
	   The government has been denying there would be a recession since
Santander Investment Securities became the first to forecast it in
April, with an estimate of .3 percent contraction for the year.
	   However, the government has recently said it would revise its
rosy prediction of 2.5-4.5 percent growth.
	   Merrill Lynch noted reports that Singapore's non-oil domestic
exports fell 4 percent in April and May, compared to the previous
year, which calculates to a 14-16 percent trade drop, counting
depreciation.
	   With the services sector ``already mired in recession,'' Merrill
Lynch said, ``a downturn in the manufacturing sector because of
inventory overhang would almost certainly plunge Singapore growth
into negative territory for the remaining quarters of 1998.''

Chief inspector: Iraq close to being free from U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background, Butler leaves Baghdad; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is very close to becoming free of U.N.
economic sanctions, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, said Monday.
	   ``The light at the end of the tunnel today is more visible than
anytime,'' Butler told reporters at the end of his three-day talks
with Iraqi officials on the dismantling of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council will allow the lifting of the
sanctions only after Butler's inspectors certify that Iraq has no
more illegal weapons.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, bar
exports of the country's main commodity of oil except in limited
quantities to earn enough money to feed its people.
	   Butler said that his U.N. Special Commission can do that in two
months provided Iraq fully cooperates with arms inspectors.
	   ``I am very positive about it. It is good news ... provided Iraq
fulfills its promises and gives us access to materials and
documents,'' Butler said at the news conference just before leaving
Iraq.
	   During his talks here, Butler had presented Iraq with a list of
obligations, or a ``road map,'' which he said Iraq must fulfill to
support claims that it has dismantled all banned chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Butler has often said that it needs conclusive proof and cannot
take Iraq's word for it. He has also complained that Iraq has been
evasive in providing documentation.
	   But this time, Butler said, he sensed that Iraq is serious. Both
sides have already embarked on ``concrete steps'' to get the job
done, he said. He did not elaborate.
	   On Sunday, Iraq and the U.N. commission agreed to lay down a
2-month work program to end U.N. disarmament activities in Iraq. At
the end of that period, he and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz are
expected to meet again to take stock of the situation.
	   The developments mark the first signs of an improvement in
relations between the U.N. team and Iraq, which regularly accused
Butler of being a lackey of the United States and Britain.
	   Even Saturday, Sami Saadoun, head of Aziz's office, complained
in a newspaper article that Butler's ``road map'' was designed to
indefinitely prolong economic sanctions on Iraq.

Philippine stocks, peso plunge on weak yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing sharply lower &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks and the peso fell
sharply Monday as a result of the Japanese yen's continued
weakness, traders said.
	   The weaker yen stoked fears of a further economic contraction in
the region and raised the specter that China may devalue its
currency, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index plunged 82.16
points, or 4.5 percent, to 1,746.86, a new five-month low. The
index fell at one point as much as 102 points.
	   The main index fell 88.85 points last Thursday. Philippine
markets were closed Friday for the centennial of the country's
declaration of independence from Spanish colonial rule.
	   Traders said the market's closure Friday may have compounded its
troubles Monday as it caught up with other slumping markets in the
region.
	   Analysts said some bargain-hunting may emerge Tuesday, but doubt
it could force a recovery given the volatility of regional
currencies.
	   BPI Securities Corp. analyst Spencer Yap said investors,
especially foreigners, will probably wait until the currency market
stabilizes before taking a new look at Philippine stocks.
	   Noel Reyes, vice president for research of Anscor Hagedorn
Securities, said it is unlikely Philippine markets will recover
until the Japanese currency settles.
	   ``This looks like the second wave of contagion and this could
prove more serious because it involves Japan,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the peso fell to a four-month low against
the dollar in brisk trading.
	   The dollar averaged 41.566 pesos, up 1.247 pesos, or 3 percent,
from Thursday's 40.319 pesos. The dollar touched a high of 42.580
pesos, a level last reached in early February.
	   Volume was a hefty dlrs 203 million after dlrs 90 million on
Thursday.
	   Traders expect the dollar to easily hit 43 pesos Tuesday, noting
that the local currency is likely to continue to align itself with
the regional trend.
	   Japan's Economic Planning Agency reported Friday that economic
output fell for the second quarter in a row in the January-March
period, officially throwing Japan into recession by Western
standards.

Fifteen killed in fire in condemned building

fractures, gathering at the old house called to commemorate dead
relative. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fifteen people, including five children, were
killed when an apartment fire broke out in a southeastern Russian
region, news agencies reported Monday.
	   Four people were rushed to a hospital near the settlement of
Olovyannaya, 250 kilometers (156 miles) south of the southeastern
city of Chita, with burns of varying degrees after the Sunday fire,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Three of the people also had fractured vertebrae and the fourth
broke a foot after jumping out of a second-story window to escape
the flames, the report said.
	   The blaze broke out in a condemned wooden building, which housed
40 apartments. Some tenants in the aged structure had already moved
elsewhere, but the fire victims had gathered in the house to pay
last respects to a dead relative, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The dead bodies were found by firefighters, who battled the fire
for five hours before putting it out, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Local investigators are trying to determine the cause of the
fire.

World Cup: More English hooligans could be on way to France, FIFA

warns &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - FIFA warned Monday that some of England's most
hardened hooligans may be headed to Marseille to stir up more
violence, following street clashes on the eve of the
England-Tunisia World Cup match.
	   ``The fear is that the better known ringleaders may still be on
their way to Marseille,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said at the
regular World Cup news briefing.
	   The fact that more hooligans are coming so late ``shows that
they are not interested in the football, only in what comes
after,'' he said.
	   England plays Tunisia at 2:30 p.m. (1230 GMT) in the 60,000-seat
Velodrome stadium. Marseille security forces said they had
information that English supporters with a record of violence may
be en route _ not to attend the match but to cause trouble
afterwards.
	   Cooper sought to play down Sunday's violence in the
Mediterranean port city _ in which 37 people were hospitalized and
50 arrested _ by saying that some parts of the media had
exaggerated the disturbances.
	   ``The extent of the problem was not as great as elements of the
media would lead one to believe,'' Cooper said, adding that only a
few dozen ``mindless perverts'' were at fault.
	   FIFA officials confirmed that a ``minority'' of those arrested
had tickets, but declined to give specific numbers or reveal how
many had bought tickets through the English Football Association.
	   About 10,000 English fans are expected to attend the match.
Their ranks could be swelled by people who bought tickets at
inflated, black market prices.
	   FIFA condemned the violence and gave its full support to all
security measures taken by Marseille authorities.
	   ``The people creating these problems don't have the slightest
interest in football,'' Cooper said. ``We are determined not to
allow a small group of idiots to spoil the party.''
	   Asked why English fans were so often involved in soccer
hooliganism, Cooper said that ``England seems to be intent on being
world champion at this. It is not exclusively an English problem
but again and again the English are involved.''
	   ``There have been certain political groups at work, otherwise it
is difficult to know how these people could afford to came,''
Cooper said.
	   But Cooper said that there was no question of England being
thrown out of the World Cup.
	   The team, he said, is not responsible for the behavior of its
fans.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Police put a lock on Marseille on
Monday, bringing in reinforcements, banning alcohol and hauling
arriving English soccer fans out of the city center to thwart a
flare up of the violence that seriously injured two people.
	   England and Tunisia, fighting their World Cup match a day early,
heaved bottles, smashed windows and shouted filthy insults in
clashes Sunday night.
	   Police arrested 50 people in the melee that left 37 people
injured, local officials said.
	   Among the seriously injured was a young English fan slashed in
the throat.
	   Of the injured and arrested, 30 were British. Tunisians and
French also were injured and arrested.
	   Marseille Police Chief Michel Sappin said police ranks were
being reinforced in the city center and around the stadium. Lines
of riot police ready to sweep in if needed could be seen
strategically placed outside Marseille.
	   Authorities had already planned to deploy a total of 1,600
uniformed or plainclothes city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100
elite CRS national police for Monday's match scheduled for 1230
GMT.
	   The prefect of the Marseille region, Jean-Paul Proust, banned
the sale of alcohol in the city starting at 4:30 p.m. and ordered
all bars closed by 11 p.m.
	   Police searched luggage of droves of English fans arriving by
train and were escorting them to their hotels, police said. They
were being asked to stay out of the city center.
	   ``The fear is that the better known ringleaders are still on
their way to Marseille, said FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper at a Paris
press briefing. ``The fact that they are coming so late proves they
are not interested in the football, only what comes after.''
	   Sappin, the police chief, said that scheduling the
English-Tunisia match for Monday was ``an error'' because it gave
hooligans a chance to drink throughout the weekend.

Hong Kong's jobless rate rises to 4.2 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details, new quotes, closing stock figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 4.2
percent in the three-month period ended in May _ the highest in 15
years _ as Asia's economic crisis shows no signs of abating, the
government announced Monday.
	   The figure marked a worsening from the three months ended in
April, when the jobless rate hit a 13-year high of 3.9 percent.
	   The news came as Hong Kong's benchmark stock index fell to a new
three-year low Monday and local interbank interest rates rose to
their highest levels since January on escalating concern over
Japan's economic health.
	   Government economist Elley Mao told a news conference the rise
in joblessness was ``triggered largely by the financial turmoil and
the unstable economic conditions in the Asian region.''
	   ``Short of the onset of an economic recovery, there are no quick
fixes to the problem,'' she added.
	   Although Hong Kong has weathered Asia's economic crisis better
than many other economies, the territory is suffering from rapidly
falling property prices, weak stock prices and a sharp drop in
tourist arrivals.
	   Investors fear China will be forced to devalue its yuan if the
yen slides further. This would attract speculative attacks on the
Hong Kong dollar and put the Hong Kong currency's peg to the U.S.
dollar under pressure.
	   Rattled by the falling yen and soaring interbank rates, the Hang
Seng Index plummeted 5.7 percent Monday, closing at 7,462.50
points, the lowest since Jan. 30, 1995. The index had lost 7.6
percent last week.
	   Interest rates soared as a combination of capital outflow and
currency speculation have tightened interbank market liquidity.
	   The volatile overnight Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate hit a
15.0 percent high at midday Monday, before falling back to 8.00
percent late Monday, compared with 6.00 percent late Friday.
	   The benchmark three-month rate edged up to 16.25 percent at
midday before coming down to 14 percent, compared with 12.5 percent
late Friday.
	   Pressure is mounting on the government to increase public
spending and make further tax cuts to lift the economy, which
shrank 2 percent in the first quarter, the first contraction in 14
years. A coalition of seven political parties has said it would
back a deficit budget if necessary.
	   But Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa has hinted the government
would not consider budgeting a deficit, saying that would bring a
new round of currency speculation against the Hong Kong dollar.
	   He also has ruled out using foreign exchange reserves to stem
the stock market's slide.
	   Joseph Wong, secretary for education and manpower, said it is
``certainly conceivable that high unemployment, which could go
higher, may stay with us for a while.''
	   He said the government will likely announce new measures to
create jobs at a high-level employment task force meeting early
next month.
	   Henry Lui, an analyst at Mansion House Securities, said higher
unemployment would add to market pessimism. The figures were
released after the financial markets had closed.
	   ``The market has already discounted bad unemployment news into
share prices but once the headlines hit people,'' it will still be
a shock, said Lui. ``Investors prefer to keep their money in their
pockets.''

No decision yet on lifting of censorship of foreign media
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The government has not yet decided to
lift military censorship for foreign news organizations, a
government spokesman said Monday.
	   Officials had said earlier they expected an announcement last
Friday ending censorship for the international media, imposed June
5 after a furious battle between government troops and Tamil
rebels. There was no suggestion censorship would end for the local
media.
	   ``We have not received any instruction so far'' to lift the ban,
said Ariya Rubasinghe, the director of the Government Information
Department. Rubasinghe declined to elaborate, but other officials
said the government may be reconsidering whether to lift the ban.
	   Some ministers reportedly have argued that censorship is
ineffective in the age of the Internet. It also has failed to
prevent the distribution of information outside Sri Lanka by the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the main guerrilla force fighting
for a Tamil homeland in the North and East. The group has offices
in Europe.
	   Under the regulations, military-related news must be submitted
to a military censor prior to publication. International news
organizations have protested the order.
	   It was the third time censorship was imposed on war reporting
since 1995. On previous occasions, it was lifted within days for
foreign media.

Some 1,500 inmates might go free under new law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Some 1,500 inmates may be released soon under a new
law that allows convicted criminals to avoid prison if sentenced to
less than three years.
	   The law is not retroactive, but newspapers said authorities may
allow early releases because of overcrowding.
	   The law gives the possibility for those sentenced to up to three
years in prison to serve the time under house arrest or agreeing to
work in community service. It is up to a judge to decide following
a request from the defendant.
	   Italian jails were built to hold 35,000 people, but newspapers
said up to 50,000 people are now in prison.

British envoy returns to emotional welcome in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ British Ambassador Peter Penfold
returned to a hero's welcome in Sierra Leone following an inquiry
into charges that British officials helped break a U.N. arms
embargo to the West African country.
	   Penfold was carried on shoulders and in a hammock through the
streets of Sierra Leone's capital on Sunday. Throngs of civilians
praised his support for the country's elected government which was
restored to power by a West African intervention force in March
after months in exile.
	   The West African force known as ECOMOG had earlier ousted
military junta fighters led by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who
took power in a bloody coup last May.
	   Penfold was recalled to London about two months ago, following
accusations that Foreign Office officials authorized the British
mercenary firm Sandline to break U.N. Security Council weapons
sanctions intended to isolate the junta.
	   The British ambassador told journalists that British officials
were warned that Sandline intended to break the sanctions.
	   Sandline has admitted supplying security advisors and military
equipment to ECOMOG and forces loyal to the restored government led
by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   Since then, Britain and other Security Council members have
agreed in principle to partially lift the embargo so weapons can be
sold to the elected government.
	   No firm decisions have been announced into the Sandline inquiry.

Old U.S. Embassy in Saigon, symbol of defeat, being demolished
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The building that came to symbolize the
futility of the U.S. war effort in Vietnam, the former American
Embassy in Ho Chi Minh City, is being demolished, U.S. officials
said Monday.
	   Consular official Melissa Foynef said the demolition started
last Thursday and will take several weeks to complete. The United
States is seeking a contractor to build a new consular office on
the site of the old chancery, a job expected to take 12-18 months,
she said.
	   The last U.S. personnel to leave what was then called Saigon
were airlifted by helicopter from the roof of the eight-story
building shortly before North Vietnamese troops took over the city
on April 30, 1975, completing the communist takeover of Vietnam.
	   Some 2,000 people _ Americans, Vietnamese and third-country
citizens _ were evacuated from the embassy compound, which was
besieged by Vietnamese desperately seeking escape.
	   News photos showing U.S. soldiers keeping the crowd at bay
became poignant symbols of how Washington had failed to sustain a
pro-Western government in southern Vietnam.
	   After the communist takeover, the embassy building housed the
offices of Petro Vietnam, the state oil exploration company. It was
returned to the United States in 1994, a year before Hanoi and
Washington normalized relations, which had been suspended after the
communist takeover.
	   In 1996, the two former foes exchanged ambassadors, and last
year Washington opened a consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, while Hanoi
opened one in San Francisco.
	   The U.S. consulate in Ho Chi Minh City is staffed by 12
Americans, to be increased to 20 next year.
	   Since Washington lifted its trade embargo on Vietnam in 1994,
the United States has become the country's eighth largest foreign
investor with total investment pledged of dlrs 1.23 billion.
	   Two-way trade between the two countries stands at dlrs 1 billion
annually.

Feeling freer, Indonesians show hidden talent for street protest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Tapping the floor of the Jakarta
governor's office with canes, a few dozen blind masseurs rallied
Monday with all the verve of triumphant student protesters.
	   The target of their ire? Not the president, but prostitutes who
are taking away their massage business.
	   It was one of the more esoteric protests in Jakarta, a
playground for activists of all stripes since Indonesia's
authoritarian leader, President Suharto, quit last month.
	   Public demonstrations were rare under Suharto, who often dealt
harshly with his opponents, jailing and persecuting many during his
32 years in power. Then economic turmoil eroded his once solid hold
on Indonesia.
	   Student rallies across the country helped unseat Suharto and
ushered in rapid political reform. Now Indonesians revel in a
newfound freedom to speak out on the streets.
	   Police say an average of 16 protests are held daily in Jakarta,
the capital, a city of 10 million people. The menu usually includes
lots of banner-waving, slogan-chanting and raucous speeches
delivered over a sound system that grates on the ears.
	   The campaigns are myriad: put Suharto on trial on corruption
charges, raise salaries, lower prices, stop religious
discrimination, fire this minister or that one.
	   ``It is the logical outcome after the repressive government of
the last three decades,'' said Hendrajit, a researcher at the
Institute for Strategic Studies of Indonesia, a private think tank.
	   But the demonstration by the blind masseurs could rank as the
most unusual. The government offers a massage training program to
blind people to give them an occupation, but many customers looking
for more than just a rubdown are turning to prostitutes.
	   ``It's been hard to find clients during the past month,'' said
protester Surayani. Wearing headbands that read ``Peaceful
reform,'' they gathered at the governor's office to urge a
crackdown on their more versatile competitors.
	   Prostitution is illegal, but authorities largely condone its
practice in hotels, nightclubs and on the streets.
	   Students who pioneered the protest craze earlier this year,
reaching a climax with a five-day peaceful takeover of Parliament,
are also loosening up now that Suharto is gone.
	   Last week, a caravan of cars and buses filled with students
stopped by Parliament to drop off a list of demands for faster
reform. Then the protesters meandered around town, tooting horns,
singing and generally having fun.
	   The dark side of public protest in Indonesia lingers, though. On
Friday, police clubbed activists from East Timor who swamped the
Foreign Ministry to push for independence for their homeland, a
demand the government has rebuffed.
	   One month ago, police opened fire at a university rally, killing
four students and touching off huge riots in Jakarta. The unrest
hastened Suharto's downfall.
	   Now even new President B.J. Habibie, the self-declared champion
of reform in the nation of 200 million people, says he welcomes
protesters who rail against him.
	   ``It's part of living in a democracy,'' he said in an interview
with The Associated Press.

Guinea-Bissau rebels say they're ready to negotiate an end to
</HEADLINE>
conflict &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels in Guinea-Bissau have said they
will end their weeklong revolt if the government enters into talks
and if the president of the West African nation steps down.
	   A rebel spokesman said late Sunday that the soldiers mutinied
because President Joao Bernardo Vieira covered up the findings of
an investigation into the trafficking of arms to separatist forces
in Casamance, in neighboring Senegal.
	   Rebel spokesman Maj. Gomes Fernandes said Vieira ``cannot remain
as president.''
	   Fernandes did not specify the agenda for negotiations to end
hostilities. But he said the rebels did not aim to seize power, but
wanted to ``reestablish justice'' in the country.
	   He said that the rebels, who have been pinned in a military
garrison in a suburb of the capital Bissau since they mutinied June
7, were heavily armed. No information was provided about the
strength of the rebel force.
	   The Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted an unidentified Bissau
inhabitant as saying there were more than a hundred dead bodies on
the streets of Bissau.
	   Thousands of people were fleeing Bissau where abandoned shops
and houses were being looted, the source said.
	   Lusa reported on Sunday that 200 people had drowned as they fled
Bissau by boat two days before.
	   The refugees were on their way to the Bissagos archipelago, 50
kilometers (30 miles) off the coast, when the boat sank, Lusa said.
	   The leader of the rebels, Brig. Ansumane Mane, was implicated in
the trafficking scandal, according to Vieira, and subsequently was
removed from his post.
	   Fernandes told Portuguese state television RTP that Mane had
been ``set up'' by Vieira.
	   Vieira and other top-ranking army officers were running the arms
scam, Fernandes alleged.

Opposition leader says majority of Israelis want peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Barak quotes; CHANGES overline, ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MAE GHALWASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Most Israelis wish for peace in the region
despite their hard-line government's stand that has been blamed for
the deadlock in the Mideast peace process, an Israeli opposition
leader said Monday.
	   ``We in Labor believe that peace is the ultimate way to achieve
security for the citizens of Israel,'' Ehud Barak, the leader of
the Labor Party, told reporters after a meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
	   The two leaders met privately for 20 minutes before being joined
by officials for a one-hour meeting. The two sides discussed the
U.S. efforts to revive the stalemated peace talks between Israel
and the Palestinians.
	   ``We conveyed to Mubarak the feeling that the majority of
Israeli people want the peace process to continue and peace to be
brought with security to the whole region,'' Barak said.
	   The peace process was begun in 1993 by the late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the Labor Party and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat. It came to a halt in 1997 when the government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began constructing a Jewish
settlement in the traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The crisis was worsened by Palestinian suicide bombings and
Israeli foot-dragging on troops withdrawal from the West Bank,
which Israel captured and occupied in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Barak said the government may be reaching an agreement with the
Palestinians over withdrawing from at least 13 percent more land in
West Bank in line with a U.S. proposal.
	   Netanyahu had so far publicly refused to accept the proposal,
which has received the Palestinians' approval.
	   Asked to comment on a reported Israeli government plan to hold a
referendum on the pullout, Barak said it would be a waste of time
and money.
	   ``We know the answer: 75 percent of Israel wants the
(withdrawal) implemented,'' he said.
	   Barak, Israel's most decorated soldier, has warned that
Netanyahu will lead the country toward bloodshed and possibly war
unless he also accepts the U.S. proposal.
	   Mubarak also made the same point in a interview published Monday
in the weekly Mayo newspaper of the ruling National Democratic
Party.
	   ``The Palestinian side has given all it can give, whereas the
Israeli stance has become ... intransigent,'' Mubarak said. ``If
the peace process collapses, everything will become confused and
violence will spread,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu has reportedly been holding out for nine percent pull
out but right wing parties in the ruling coalition have threatened
to bring down his government if he carries out any withdrawal.

Yeltsin orders revamping of Interior Ministry troops, traffic

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ordered Russia's Interior
Ministry on Monday to sharply cut its forces and carry out other
reforms.
	   Under the plan, Interior Ministry troops will be cut from some
250,000 now to 120,000-140,000 within two years, Interior Minister
Sergei Stepashin told reporters after meeting with the president.
	   The ministry's troops are supposed to help police enforce public
order and intervene in case of mass riots and other disturbances.
They played an active role during the 1994-1996 war to put down
breakaway Chechnya's independence bid.
	   Interior Ministry troops have the same structure and weapons as
the Defense Ministry's ground forces. Stepashin said the reform
will end that ``duplication'' and increase the interior forces'
mobility, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin also issued an order to streamline Russia's GAI traffic
police, long accused of inefficiency and corruption. The reform
will simplify registration rules and other procedures to make
motorists' lives easier, Stepashin said.

Ionian Bank workers change demands to continue strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Workers at Greece's fourth-largest bank
pressed ahead with their five-week-long strike Monday despite three
court decisions declaring the action illegal.
	   Ionian Bank employees walked off the job May 8, demanding the
cancellation of plans to sell the state-run bank.
	   The strike has threatened to derail government efforts to
streamline the economy and meet criteria to join the European
Union's single currency club in 2001.
	   Workers changed their original demands after it became clear the
government would not back off its plans to sell the bank. The
latest walkout was called to request guarantees they will keep
current social security benefits when the bank is sold.
	   Ionian employees have threatened to extend their strike until
Friday, when the bank's shareholders meet to vote on the sale.
	   The bank's management has filed a fourth law suit calling for
the latest walkout also to be deemed illegal. The earlier strikes
were deemed to be illegal on the grounds that workers failed to
appoint a skeleton staff to serve clients.
	   Ionian deputy general manager Emmanouil Santorineos said the
bank's operation has been completely paralyzed since the strike
began, with 45,000 civil servants unable to receive their salaries
as their accounts had effectively been frozen.

Asian markets extend losses as yen falls further
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Monday on worries
over the sinking Japanese yen, with the key indexes in both Hong
Kong and Bangkok tumbling 5.7 percent.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 452.94 points to 7,462.50, its lowest close since
Jan. 30, 1995.
	   Brokers attributed the plunge to the yen's fall, which took it
Monday to an eight-year low against the U.S. dollar. In late Tokyo
trading, the dollar bought 146.44 yen, up 2.42 yen from late
Friday.
	   As a result, Hong Kong interbank interest rates surged to levels
not seen since January, when the stock market was hit by a
mini-crash and the Hong Kong dollar was rocked by international
speculators.
	   Thai share prices plunged in thin trading on worries over the
yen and the health of Thai financial institutions. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index dropped 15.98 points to 263.39.
	   Meanwhile, the Thai baht was trading at 43.80 to the dollar,
down from 43.45 at Friday's close.
	   Malaysian shares also tumbled, with the key index plunging to a
record eight-year low because of the volatile Japanese yen and weak
regional stocks.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index fell
20.13 points, or 4.26 percent, to 452.24. It was the index's lowest
close since 459.08 on Sept. 28, 1990.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 4.0750 Malaysian
ringgit, up sharply from 3.9950 ringgit late Friday.
	   In Seoul, the key index plunged 4.8 percent to a new 11-year low
as sentiment was battered by the Japanese yen's fall against the
dollar.
	   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 14.60 points to
288.21, its lowest level since since Jan. 13, 1987.
	   Philippine stocks and the peso fell sharply as a result of the
Japanese yen's continued weakness. The 30-share Philippine Stock
Exchange Index plunged 82.16 points, or 4.5 percent, to 1,746.86, a
new five-month low.
	   The dollar averaged 41.566 pesos, up 1.247 pesos, or 3 percent,
from Thursday's 40.319 pesos. The dollar touched a high of 42.580
pesos, a level last reached in early February.
	   Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index fell 38
points, or 3.5 percent, to 1,052.84. The Singapore dollar has also
steadily declined, hovering around 1.75 to the U.S. dollar,
compared to 1.43 last July 1, the day before the Asian crisis
began.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 197.16 points,
or 1.31 percent, closing at 14,825.17. On Friday, the Nikkei had
gained 8.29 points, or 0.06 percent.
	   The dollar gained momentum against the yen as traders concluded
that world central bankers probably would not support the Bank of
Japan even if it intervenes on the yen's behalf.
	   Investors fear the yen's continuing slide could lead to another
round of currency devaluations in Asia and trigger a global
recession.
	   On Friday, Japan reported that its gross domestic product fell
1.3 percent in the first quarter compared with the previous
quarter, an annual rate of 5.3 percent.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed sharply higher as investors bought
cheap technology stocks following the market's decline last week.
The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 166.72 points, or
2.3 percent, to 7,283.83.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher
after an extended trading session to accommodate the listing of
Australian insurance and funds manager AMP Ltd. on the New Zealand
Stock Exchange. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 1.08 points to
1,998.71.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed slightly lower. The All
Ordinaries Index fell 4.2 percent, or 0.16 percent, to 2,567.5.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower. The Composite Index fell
1.871 points, or 0.4 percent, to 406.501. Meanwhile, the rupiah was
trading at 14,700 to the dollar late Monday, down from its Friday
close at 14,000.

Two soldiers killed, one injured by mine explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A mine explosion Monday killed two
soldiers and seriously injured a third while they were clearing a
mine field on Greece's northeastern border, an army statement said.
	   The blast occurred near the village of Gemisti on the
Greek-Turkish border.
	   Each year, thousands of illegal immigrants attempt to sneak into
Greece across the Evros River separating the two countries and
sometimes stray into mine fields. In April, two Moroccan immigrants
were killed after accidentally wandering into a mine field.
	   Greece has designated mine fields along its northeastern border
with Turkey. The two neighbors have a long history of poor
relations and are at odds over a series of issues, including air
and territorial rights in the Aegean Sea and the war-divided island
of Cyprus.

Court rules ultra-right party can participate in parliament
</HEADLINE>
committees

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A Constitutional Court ruling will
allow members of a radical right-wing party to participate in
parliamentary committees, the state news agency MTI reported
Monday.
	   Last month, the Hungarian Truth and Life Party gained 5.5
percent of the vote in general elections, topping the 5 percent
threshold needed to claim seats in parliament.
	   The party, led by Istvan Csurka, will have 14 seats in the
368-seat, unicameral parliament. It is the first time since World
War II that such a xenophobic, anti-Semitic party is represented in
the country's legislature.
	   But parliament rules prevented any party with less than 15 seats
from forming a ``faction.'' As a faction, a party is allowed to
have a representative in every parliamentary committee, and its
leader can address parliament before the start of each session.
	   If any party gained less than 15 seats, its representatives were
considered independent members of parliament.
	   But the Constitutional Court ruled: ``Every party that passes
the 5 percent threshold has the right to form a faction, and the
house rule to forbid this is unconstitutional.''
	   None of the other parliamentary parties supported the idea that
Csurka's party be allowed to form a faction.
	   The winner of May's election, the Young Democrats-Civic Party,
has repeatedly refused to cooperate with the party.
	   However, Csurka has assured the coalition that will be formed by
the Young Democrats that his party will ``support them from the
outside.''
	   The new parliament is to convene June 18.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Monday on worries
over the sinking Japanese yen, with the key indexes in both Hong
Kong and Bangkok tumbling 5.7 percent. The Hang Seng Index, the
Hong Kong market's key indicator of blue chips, fell 452.94 points
to 7,462.50, its lowest close since Jan. 30, 1995. Brokers
attributed the plunge to the yen's fall, which took it Monday to an
eight-year low against the U.S. dollar. In late Tokyo trading, the
dollar bought 146.44 yen, up 2.42 yen from late Friday. As a
result, Hong Kong interbank interest rates surged to levels not
seen since January, when the stock market was hit by a mini-crash
and the Hong Kong dollar was rocked by international speculators.
Thai share prices plunged in thin trading on worries over the yen
and the health of Thai financial institutions. The Stock Exchange
of Thailand index dropped 15.98 points to 263.39. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will chair an expanded
Cabinet meeting next week on government measures to combat Russia's
financial crisis and stabilize the markets, the presidential press
service said Monday. The meeting on June 23 will also be attended
by members of both houses of parliament, the press service said,
according to the Interfax news agency. The collapse of Russia's
financial markets late last month prompted fears of a devaluation
of the national currency, the ruble, which would lead to a sharp
rise in prices. Russian officials worry that inflation, combined
with the government's continuing inability to pay state workers
their wages on time, could lead to mass protests. The stock market
fall has been slowed slightly by rumors of an emergency bailout
package from the International Monetary Fund. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 4.2
percent in the three-month period ended in May _ the highest in 15
years _ as Asia's economic crisis shows no signs of abating, the
government announced Monday. The figure marked a worsening from the
three months ended in April, when the jobless rate hit a 13-year
high of 3.9 percent. The news came as Hong Kong's benchmark stock
index fell to a new three-year low Monday and local interbank
interest rates rose to their highest levels since January on
escalating concern over Japan's economic health. Although Hong Kong
has weathered Asia's economic crisis better than many other
economies, the territory is suffering from rapidly falling property
prices, weak stock prices and a sharp drop in tourist arrivals.
(HONG KONG-JOBLESS)
	   HUE, Vietnam (AP) _ Striking a supportive note, the
International Monetary Fund said Monday that Vietnamese officials
are aware of the serious problems their economy faces but aren't
yet sure how to solve them. A similar tone was taken by the World
Bank as Vietnamese government officials and the country's major
donors began one-day talks on ways to speed up a lagging economic
reform program. The donors called the unusual midyear meeting to
remind Hanoi of the pressing need for reforms in the face of the
regional economic crisis. The meeting won't discuss new financial
aid for Vietnam _ the dlrs 2.4 billion package for 1998 was agreed
last December at a meeting in Tokyo. (VIETNAM-ECONOMIC REFORM)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Department of Labor has ruled
that financially troubled Philippine Airlines can require its
pilots to retire early, the chief complaint in a crippling strike
by the pilot's union. Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said PAL
management followed the terms of a collective bargaining agreement
in ordering the early retirement last December of Capt. Albino
Collantes, 45, a senior pilot. The management and union were
informed of Trajano's ruling on Monday. The 625-member pilots'
union went on strike June 5 to protest a management policy of
ordering pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of service or
flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts 225 pilots
in danger of forced retirement, said Capt. Sotico Lloren, president
of the union. (PHILIPPINES-PAL STRIKE)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ NATO fighter jets and
reconnaissance aircraft roared into the sky early Monday, hoping to
intimidate Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by showing him how
quickly and powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces
if needed. Eighty-four aircraft from 13 of NATO's 16 member
countries staged several hours of aerial exercises over Albania and
Macedonia, which border Yugoslavia. Much of the world has been
aghast as Milosevic's Serb-led army and police cracked down on
dissent in Kosovo Province, inhabited mostly by ethnic Albanians.
More than 300 people have been killed and thousands have fled
across the border into northern Albania. Western leaders want to
halt the violence. But they also do not want to be seen giving
comfort to the Kosovo Liberation Army, a group that is fighting for
independence of the province and which the alliance does not
support.
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ The leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia have
agreed to immediately halt the use of air strikes in their border
war, according to a U.S. presidential spokesman. President Bill
Clinton talked personally by telephone with the leaders of the two
countries Sunday during an Air Force One flight from Los Angeles to
Washington, deputy press secretary Joe Lockhart said. While the
agreement does not end the border dispute between the Horn of
Africa countries, the White House said it ``can help restore the
mutual confidence necessary to achieve a peaceful resolution of the
conflict as quickly as possible.'' Eritrea welcomed the air-strike
ban as a first step toward meeting its call for a total halt to
hostilities. (ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is very close to becoming free of U.N.
economic sanctions, the chief weapons inspector said Monday. ``The
light at the end of the tunnel today is more visible than
anytime,'' the U.N. envoy, Richard Butler, told reporters at the
conclusion of three days of talks with Iraqi officials on disarming
Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. The U.N. Security Council
will allow the lifting of the sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1991
invasion of Kuwait only after Butler's United Nations Special
Commission certifies that Iraq has no more illegal weapons. Butler
said that UNSCOM can finish its job in two months as long as Iraq
fully cooperates with its arms inspectors. (IRAQ-UN)
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Police put a lock on Marseille on
Monday, bringing in reinforcements, banning alcohol and hauling
arriving English soccer fans out of the city center to thwart a
flare up of the violence that seriously injured two people. England
and Tunisia, fighting their World Cup match a day early, heaved
bottles, smashed windows and shouted filthy insults in clashes
Sunday night. Police arrested 50 people in the melee that left 37
people injured, local officials said. Among the seriously injured
was a young English fan slashed in the throat. Of the injured and
arrested, 30 were British. Tunisians and French also were injured
and arrested. (FRANCE-WORLD CUP-STREET BATTLES)
	   ROME (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on the
international community Monday to create a ``bulwark against evil''
by establishing a permanent world criminal court. In opening the
five-week U.N. conference to set up the tribunal, he appealed for a
``court strong and independent enough to carry out its task'' of
bringing war criminals and perpetrators of crimes against humanity
to justice. The United States, Russia, China, and France _ four of
the five permanent Security Council members _ have been pushing for
stronger council control over the proposed court's prosecutor.
Human rights advocates say that would cripple the court's
independence. (UN-INTERNATIONAL COURT)

Yeltsin demands closer investigation into journalist's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded on Monday
that the murder of a politically active journalist be investigated
``to the utmost level.''
	   Yeltsin said that officials in the Russian republic of Kalmykia
who are investigating the case of Larisa Yudina ``cannot be fully
trusted,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yudina was found dead on June 8 in the Kalmykian capital Elista
with multiple knife wounds and a fractured skull.
	   She was the head of the Soviet Kalmykia Today newspaper, the
only opposition newspaper in Kalmykia, and was regional co-chairman
of the Yabloko liberal opposition party.
	   Lawmaker Sergei Ivanenko said that Yabloko was conducting its
own investigation into the case ``to put pressure on the
government'' to find the killer.
	   Yudina frequently wrote articles critical of President Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov. He announced on Sunday that he would run for the
presidency of Russia in 2000.
	   Three people, including a former official in Ilyumzhinov's
administration, have been detained in connection with the killing.

Indonesian attorney general in charge of corruption probe fired
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on
Monday fired his attorney-general, who had been in charge of
investigating alleged corruption during former President Suharto's
32 years in power.
	   The government said Habibie had replaced Soedjono Atmonegoro, an
old Suharto appointee, with Maj. Gen. Andi Muhammad Galib, who has
been the head of the military's law office.
	   No reason was given for the change. However, Soedjono's
departure comes amid growing demands that Suharto be directly
investigated for corruption.
	   Earlier this month, Soedjono announced that he had launched a
broad inquiry into state corruption, but he made it clear that
Suharto and his family were not being targeted specifically.
	   Critics claim the Suharto family amassed billions of dollars and
built huge business empires by abusing its power and position.
	   Since Suharto quit last month, student protesters and democracy
activists have gathered outside the attorney-general's office
daily, demanding a full investigation.
	   ``Put Suharto on trial. Investigate his wealth and return it to
the people,'' said a big banner unfurled by about 1,000 students in
a protest Monday.
	   On the weekend, a legal adviser to Suharto said the former
president denies any wrongdoing and that accusations that he had
made a fortune were not true.
	   On Saturday, Habibie said investigations of Suharto and his
family must be carried out lawfully and with respect for rights
enjoyed by all Indonesians, including the presumption of innocence.
	   Habibie, Suharto's longtime friend, Cabinet minister and deputy,
has indicated that he won't intercede to help the ex-autocrat fend
off allegations made in accordance with the law.

PLO Convenant, scope of third pullback, remain sticking points
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on PLO founding charter in 8th graf, UPDATES
with legislative council granting Arafat an additional 10 days to
reshuffle the Cabinet &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Disagreement over who will annul the PLO
founding charter and determine the scope of a final West Bank troop
withdrawal are holding up Israeli acceptance of the U.S. peace
initiative, a senior Israeli official said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with key Cabinet ministers
for three hours Monday to discuss the U.S. plan, which calls for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged Netanyahu
to make a decision soon, but informal U.S. deadlines have passed
without U.S. action against Israel. The United States presented its
plan in January, and the Palestinians have accepted it.
	   Israel TV reported Sunday that Netanyahu had agreed to a 13
percent pullback after initially saying he could hand over only 9
percent. Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the
Americans had not informed the Palestinians of any such agreement.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, would not comment
Monday on the report, but suggested that the size of that
withdrawal, the second of three promised by Israel, was no longer
an issue.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu wants iron-clad U.S. assurances that
the scope of the third pullback be determined by Israel, without
U.S. involvement.
	   ``We don't want an open-ended situation about a third
redeployment,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press. ``The American
commitment that we be the only ones to determine its scope must be
nailed down.''
	   Israel also insists that the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, annul sections of the PLO
founding charter that call for Israel's destruction, rather than
leave the vote to the much smaller PLO Executive Committee.
	   In the U.S. proposal, a vote by the PLO Executive Committee is
considered sufficient to annul those sections. However, Bar-Illan
said the PLO charter itself stipulates that it can only be changed
by a two-thirds majority of the Palestine National Council.
	   In other developments Monday, four Palestinian opposition
groups, including the Islamic militant group Hamas, said they would
turn down offers by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to join his
Cabinet.
	   However, Hamas and two secular PLO factions, the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said they would attend consultations with
Arafat on Tuesday concerning his planned Cabinet reshuffle.
	   ``We are going to listen to the president and to present our
views, but we are not going to join the new Cabinet,'' said Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar.
	   A fourth group, Islamic Jihad, said it would not join the talks.
	   Arafat apparently hoped to neutralize the opposition groups by
offering them Cabinet posts.
	   Arafat is under pressure from the Palestinian legislative
council to reshuffle his Cabinet. Last month, the 88-member
legislature gave Arafat two weeks to respond to complaints about
corruption and inaction or face his first no-confidence motion.
	   Arafat has said he would complete the reshuffle by Friday.
	   On Monday, the legislature voted to give the Palestinian leader
until June 25 at the latest to present his new Cabinet.

Hostage freed in North Ossetia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A man kidnapped in the Russian republic of North
Ossetia was freed Monday without any ransom being paid, a news
agency reported.
	   Bagautdin Kharsiyev, an ethnic Ingush, was kidnapped Saturday in
the North Ossetian village of Chermen, where he lived, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing local police.
	   Predominantly Orthodox Christian North Ossetia and Muslim
Ingushetia fought a short but bloody war in 1992. Hundreds of
people were killed and most ethnic Ingush were expelled from North
Ossetia.
	   Since the end of the war in neighboring Chechnya in 1996, a wave
of abductions has spread throughout the Caucasus republics of
Dagestan, Ingushetia and North Ossetia. Some of the kidnappings are
apparently in retribution for previous hostage-takings.
	   Police were still looking for six residents of the North
Ossetian village of Batako, who were kidnapped on June 8, and two
tractor drivers who were seized Friday while mowing hay, ITAR-Tass
said.

Officials abandon waterlogged DFS Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Officials of the DFS Classic
grass-court tournament abandoned the event Monday after driving
rain soaked the courts.
	   An offer to finish the tournament on indoor courts was rejected
by the four semifinals, three of whom were to play Tuesday in a
grass-court event in Eastbourne, England.
	   ``The general consensus was that the players didn't want to
continue indoors,'' said tournament referee Ann Jones.
	   Heavy rain stopped play Sunday after Nathalie Tauziat of France
took a 3-0 lead over Steffi Graf of Germany. The other semifinal
between Elena Likhovtseva of Russia and Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia
did not start.
	   The week-long tournament was stopped continually by daily
showers. The tournament finals were originally set for Sunday.
	   The tournament is one of the key grass-court warmups for
Wimbledon, which begins next week.
	   Graf, who celebrated her 29th birthday Sunday, was playing only
her third event in a year following knee surgery and various
injuries. She won six of seven sets in Birmingham en route to her
three match victories on grass.
	   Officials said all four semifinals would be awarded dlrs 6,600.

Kia Motors strikers clash with non-union workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Strikers and non-union workers at Kia
Motors Corp. clashed with fists and sticks Monday, leaving 20
people injured, company and labor officials said.
	   The clashes began when non-union employees took pictures of
union leaders who were urging other workers to join their picketing
against the company's decision to lock its plants for 10 days
beginning Monday.
	   As such pictures are often used for lawsuits accusing labor
leaders of illegal strikes, union members demanded that the company
hand over the film, which was rejected.
	   The two sides then clashed with fists and metal and wooden
sticks, witnesses said. Kia officials said at least two office
workers were seriously injured.
	   Kia Motors, once the nation's second largest automaker, is in
court receivership after going bankrupt last July under the weight
of dlrs 1 billion in bank loans.
	   After negotiations with striking workers failed to make
progress, Kia ordered its plants locked for 10 days beginning
Monday. The union said it would continue to picket the plants.
	   The government, Kia's largest stockholder with a 30 percent
stake, said late last month that it would announce a schedule in
late June to sell the car maker at auction.
	   Kia workers then walked off their jobs, demanding that the
company pay overdue wages and guarantee job security after the
auction. Kia workers have been paid only half of their wages since
last July.
	   Kia management rejected the union's demands, saying that even
companies in good financial condition are cutting wages amid the
worst financial crisis ever.
	   So far, U.S. car maker Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean
conglomerates _ Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung _ have expressed
interest in buying Kia, which produced about 780,000 cars last
year.
	   Ford has a 16.9 percent stake in Kia. The remaining Kia shares
are owned by thousands of small investors, including Kia employees.

 &UR; London tube workers strike, but fears of ghost town unfounded &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A strike halted many of London's subway trains
early Monday, but thousands of workers made it to their jobs
despite the added temptation of staying home and watching England's
first World Cup soccer match.
	   London business leaders had warned that the combination officer
and the strike would cost them some 35 million pounds (dlrs 57
million) on what they had already dubbed ``Idle Monday.''
	   But by midday, things were looking `a little less idle than we
feared,'' acknowledged Vincent Burke, spokesman for the London
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Burke couldn't provide firm
numbers but said more workers than expected were showing up.
	   ``I think we're encouraged, actually, by the fact that quite a
lot of people have struggled into work,'' Burke said. ``The effect
of the tube strike has not been as bad as feared. I still think
there will be several million pounds lost today. It will hit
productivity.''
	   Many employers sought to lure staffs into work by setting up
televisions to show Monday afternoon's England-Tunisia match. Their
theory: If people came into the office, at least something
productive might get done.
	   Getting to work on the London Underground was largely based on
luck and location. Some subway lines were running at more than 90
percent of capacity. Others were completely shut.
	   The strike initially closed 19 London Underground stations,
although by late morning managers said just 10 were closed.
	   London Underground, which operates the 243-mile (about
390-kilometer) system, popularly known as the ``tube,'' said
services were fuller than anticipated.
	   About 60 percent of trains were running, managers said.
	   The head of the striking Rail, Maritime and Transport union,
Jimmy Knapp, had previously predicted ``complete stoppage'' of the
network. The RMT union charged Monday that London Underground
bosses were ``misleading'' commuters about the levels of service
operating.
	   The union, which represents about one-third of the tube staff,
walked off the job for 48 hours beginning Sunday evening after
failing to secure agreements about working conditions, job security
and pensions that will be available after the Underground becomes
partially privatized.
	   More than 2 million passengers use the tube on a normal day, but
officials were encouraging people to walk or cycle to work when
possible.
	   A front-page cartoon in The Times depicted a man watching the
soccer match on television while his wife holds out the telephone
and says: ``It's your boss _ he says you can have the rest of your
career off.''

EU economy grows by 0.5 percent in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Gross Domestic Product of the 15-nation
European Union rose 0.5 percent in the first quarter of 1998,
compared with the last quarter of 1997, the EU's statistical office
Eurostat announced Monday.
	   The GDP in the 11 countries taking part in the launching of the
single currency, the euro on January 1, 1999, also rose by 0.5
percent over the same period, according to Eurostat's first
estimates.
	   ``This was the same rise as the previous quarter,'' Eurostat
said.
	   No figures were given for individual EU countries.
	   Compared with the first three months of 1997, the EU's GDP in
the first three months of 1998 rose by 3.1 percent, Eurostat said.
	   The U.S. economy continued to grow this year, up 1.2 percent in
the first quarter of 1998 after increasing 0.9 percent in the last
three months of 1997.

Chief inspector: Iraq close to being free from U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with more quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is very close to becoming free of U.N.
economic sanctions, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, said Monday.
	   ``The light at the end of the tunnel today is more visible than
anytime,'' Butler said at the end of his three-day talks with Iraqi
officials on disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council will allow the lifting of the
sanctions only after Butler's United Nations Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has no more illegal weapons.
	   Butler said that UNSCOM can do that in two months provided Iraq
fully cooperates with its arms inspectors, giving them materials
and documents.
	   ``In my view if that work is done satisfactorily ... I believe
we should be in a position'' to prepare for lifting the sanctions,
which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
embargo bars exports of oil, the country's main commodity, except
in limited quantities to earn enough money to feed its people.
	   ``I am very positive about it. It is good news,'' Butler told a
news conference before leaving for Kuwait en route to New York.
	   The statements are his most positive on Iraqi disarmament since
he took office in July last year, and reflect an improvement in
UNSCOM's relations with Iraq, which has regularly accused Butler of
being a lackey of the United States and Britain.
	   During his talks here, Butler had presented Iraq with a list of
obligations, which he said Iraq must fulfill to back its claims
that it has dismantled all banned chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   But in a sign of UNSCOM flexibility, Butler said his experts are
willing to accept that it is impossible to verify every Iraqi
claim.
	   In the past, UNSCOM insisted it needed conclusive proof and
rejected Iraqi arguments that it had unilaterally destroyed _
without keeping any records _ many weapons before the inspection
process began.
	   ``It may be that we won't ever get 100 percent verification
where physical parts have been torn apart and dispersed,'' Butler
said
	   He said searches for missile and chemical weapons are nearing
their end. Verification of Iraq's past germ warfare program is
cumbersome but the two sides have ``found a new way to deal with
it,'' he said without elaborating.
	   On Sunday, Iraq and UNSCOM agreed to lay down a 2-month work
program to end U.N. disarmament activities in Iraq. At the end of
that period, he and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz are expected
to meet again to take stock of the situation.
	   Indicating that the days of U.N.-Iraq tensions may be nearing an
end, Butler said he sensed that Iraq is serious about completing
the disarmament process.
	   Both sides have agreed to accelerate the work and ``my
estimation is that work will be of high quality with a high degree
of cooperation,'' he said.

Kwasniewski criticized for campaigning against government reform
</HEADLINE>
plan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski was
criticized on Monday for opening a campaign that advocates
administrative division of Poland into 17 provinces and torpedoes
the government-drawn maps with less.
	   On Sunday, Kwasniewski visited Opole, in southwestern Poland and
the central city of Kielce, which had been protesting government
plans to incorporate them into large provinces, under a bold reform
that largely reduces the number of Poland's provinces and gives
more power to local governments.
	   Kwasniewski, an ex-communist, said there he will only approve a
division into 17 provinces, advocated by the leftist opposition,
which preserves the two cities' current provincial capital status.
	   If the president vetoes the government plan of division, it will
be a ``catastrophe for the coalition and for the country,'' said
Henryk Wujec, a leader of the Freedom Union party, the junior
member in the Solidarity-led government.
	   Freedom Union leader Leszek Balcerowicz, who is finance
minister, appealed to Kwasniewski not to use the reform for
political games.
	   The Cabinet of Jerzy Buzek originally wanted a division into 12
provinces, but revised the plan to 15, following protests. The
reform is to take effect Jan. 1.
	   Kwasniewski's veto would jeopardize the whole reform, that is to
do away with the bureaucratic system inherited from the communist
era, observers said.
	   Newspaper commentators said Kwasniewski was bowing to his
ex-communist colleagues and opening his own campaign for reelection
in the year 2000.
	   Piotr Pacewicz in Gazeta Wyborcza, the largest national daily,
appealed to the government and the president to reach a compromise,
just as they did on NATO membership, because ``the administrative
reform is equally important.''
	   Kwasniewski is to visit three more provincial capitals later
this week.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Disagreement over who will annul the PLO
founding charter and determine the scope of a final West Bank troop
withdrawal are holding up Israeli acceptance of the U.S. peace
initiative, a senior Israeli official said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with key Cabinet ministers
for three hours Monday to discuss the U.S. plan, which calls for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged Netanyahu
to make a decision soon, but informal U.S. deadlines have passed
without U.S. action against Israel. The United States presented its
plan in January, and the Palestinians have accepted it.
	   Israel TV reported Sunday that Netanyahu agreed to a 13 percent
pullback after initially saying he could hand over only 9 percent.
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Americans had not
informed the Palestinians of any such agreement.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, would not comment
Monday on the report, but suggested that the size of the
withdrawal, the second of three promised by Israel, was no longer
an issue.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu wants iron-clad U.S. assurances that
the scope of the third pullback be determined by Israel, without
U.S. involvement.
	   ``We don't want an open-ended situation about a third
redeployment,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press. ``The American
commitment that we be the only ones to determine its scope must be
nailed down.''
	   Israel also insists that the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, annul sections of the PLO
founding charter that call for Israel's destruction, rather than
leave the vote to the much smaller PLO Executive Committee.
	   In the U.S. proposal, a vote by the PLO Executive Committee is
considered sufficient to annul those sections. However, Bar-Illan
said the PLO charter stipulates that it can only be changed by a
two-thirds majority of the Palestine National Council.
	   Also Monday, four Palestinian opposition groups, including the
Islamic militant group Hamas, said they would turn down offers by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to join his Cabinet.
	   However, Hamas and two secular PLO factions, the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said they would attend consultations with
Arafat on Tuesday concerning his planned Cabinet reshuffle.
	   ``We are going to listen to the president and to present our
views, but we are not going to join the new Cabinet,'' said Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar.
	   A fourth group, Islamic Jihad, said it would not join the talks.
	   Arafat apparently hoped to neutralize the opposition groups by
offering them Cabinet posts.
	   Arafat is under pressure from the Palestinian legislative
council to reshuffle his Cabinet. Last month, the 88-member
legislature gave Arafat two weeks to respond to complaints about
corruption and inaction or face his first no-confidence motion.
	   Arafat has said he would complete the reshuffle by Friday.
	   On Monday, the legislature voted to give the Palestinian leader
until June 25 at the latest to present his new Cabinet.

Philippine Airlines says it will lay off 5,000 workers

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with airline announcing extensive layoffs; adds

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Financially troubled Philippine
Airlines announced Monday it will lay off 5,000 workers _ nearly 40
percent of its work force _ in an effort to survive after a
crippling strike.
	   ``If we do not do this, we will be forced to close,'' said a PAL
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The 11-day strike by more than 600 pilots has cost the company
about 150 million pesos (dlrs 3.8 million) a day in lost revenue,
PAL said. The company lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in
the fiscal year that ended March 31 _ three times more than in the
previous year.
	   In a statement, PAL said it is in danger of being unable to pay
back its debts because the pilots' strike ``irreparably damaged the
company's cash flow'' and scared off potential investors, including
Northwest Airlines.
	   The strike ``has effectively robbed PAL of all options other
than to immediately downsize in order to forestall further losses
and certain closure,'' said the airline, which now has 13,000
workers.
	   Separately, the Department of Labor informed PAL and the pilots'
union Monday that the airline can require its pilots to retire
early, the chief complaint in the pilots' strike.
	   Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said PAL management followed
the terms of a collective bargaining agreement in ordering the
early retirement last December of Capt. Albino Collantes, 45, a
senior pilot.
	   The 625-member pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest
the new management policy of ordering retirement by pilots who have
reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of
age.
	   The policy put 225 pilots in danger of forced retirement, said
Capt. Sotico Lloren, president of the union.
	   Last week, the airline announced it would not accept back the
striking pilots and would sharply scale back its operations and
concentrate on domestic service.
	   It now has only 25 management pilots _ senior pilots who train
other pilots.
	   The airline had previously announced plans to slash costs,
reduce flights and cut staff to survive its long-term financial
problems, aggravated by Asia's currency crisis, but did not say how
many workers it planned to lay off.

Russia's atomic energy minister to visit India, China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov will
leave Moscow on Monday night for a visit to India and China, where
he is to discuss cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
	   Despite the recent international uproar over the recent nuclear
tests in India, Russia will not scrap plans to build power plants
in the country, Adamov said recently.
	   The Atomic Energy Ministry sees China and India as prime sources
of money to develop Russia's underfunded nuclear technology
programs.
	   Russia will provide the reactors for a dlrs 2.5 billion nuclear
power station project in India, and will also cooperate on
developing more advanced reactors in the country, the Interfax news
agency reported Monday.
	   A ministry spokesman said that sale of the reactors would
``allow us not only to survive, but to keep up with other countries
developing similar technologies,'' Interfax reported.
	   Russia is also expected to receive roughly dlrs 2.5 billion for
building a nuclear power plant in China.

Little group in lonely fight over Vatican's Jubilee celebration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY108-109 &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Prediction No. 1: The Vatican's nonstop celebrations
of Christianity's 2,000th birthday could draw 20 million people to
Rome.
	   Prediction No. 2: It's going to be an unholy mess.
	   The first forecast is the official one. The second comes from
Rome's self-appointed Jubilee watchdogs, who view the impending
invasion of visitors with dread.
	   Much of their fear and loathing centers on traffic, the curse of
the Eternal _ and eternally bottlenecked _ City.
	   Rome's congested streets are a daily battleground for lumbering
buses, hapless pedestrians and daredevils on motor scooters. Add
several thousand more tour buses and several hundred thousand extra
tourists a day and what will you get?
	   ``A catastrophe! A catastrophe!'' proclaims Giovanni Negri,
president of Osservatorio Laico, a small group that is fighting a
lonely battle against the Vatican's millennium mega-bash.
	   Osservatorio Laico, which publishes a newspaper under the same
name, is nothing if not irreverent.
	   Its name _ which translates as ``Lay Observation Post'' _ is a
takeoff on the Vatican's own newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano (The
Roman Observer). Negri's group also hopes to raise money by selling
olive oil under the label ``The Sack of Rome.''
	   Osservatorio's supporters object to the Jubilee extravaganza on
both philosophical and practical grounds.
	   First, they don't think the state should be footing the bill for
a church party. Second, they say hordes of religious pilgrims will
make life miserable for ordinary Romans.
	   Osservatorio's is a small voice amid the piety and official
happy talk surrounding the Jubilee. But it echoes the dread and
doubts that are heard every day in Rome's shops, streets, cabs and
cafes.
	   The David vs. Goliath battle is waged on a shoestring.
Osservatorio raised a modest sum from supporters, mostly liberal
intellectuals with firm ideas about church-state separation, and it
stays afloat selling bumper stickers and its newspaper.
	   As a mascot, Osservatorio chose Giordano Bruno, a 16th century
philosopher-astronomer-mathematician who was burned at the stake.
His ideas made him a heretic to the Roman Catholic Church _ and a
symbol of free thought to 19th century Italians fighting the
church's grip on Italy.
	   ``We're not a party or a movement, we're a network,'' Negri
says. ``We have an office of sorts, but it's really just a phone
and a fax.''
	   Until recently, Osservatorio was ignored by the Italian news
media, which has signed on _ literally _ to the Jubilee. The ANSA
news agency and state TV both have agreements with the Vatican to
give extensive coverage of Jubilee events, most of them religious
services.
	   A Jubilee ``trial run'' in May changed things a bit. Girding for
a gathering of 250,000 people in St. Peter's Square, the city sent
out flyers urging Romans to stay off the streets and not to use
their cars.
	   As huge crowds crammed the city and thousands of tour buses
muscled down streets, parts of Rome came to a standstill.
	   People pelted call-in radio shows with outrage; even the happy
talk about the Jubilee was strained. ``A hardship,'' one newspaper
admitted, then added: ``But not a cataclysm.''
	   Negri is more bleak. ``It was worse than we expected,'' he says.
``And the Vatican has at least 24 events this big in the Jubilee,
including one with at least 2 million people! Every few weeks
Romans will be prisoners in their own homes.''
	   The crowds predicted by city officials would be triple the usual
number of tourists in this city of nearly 3 million people.
	   Osservatorio thinks the taxpayers are being snookered on several
counts. Rome isn't getting much of what was promised, except a year
of huge headaches and hassles, the group says.
	   The most eagerly awaited public works projects tied to the
celebration _ a new subway line and a road underpass at a chronic
Vatican bottleneck _ fell through.
	   At the same time, the government is paying half the cost of a
huge underground parking lot in Vatican City.
	   ``The state has been reduced to a doormat for the church,''
Negri says.
	   Romans are also being promised a millennial tourist bonanza. But
religious pilgrims aren't big spenders. They often eat a bag lunch
and stay at modest hostels.
	   ``The real tourists, the ones who spend money, will be
terrorized,'' Negri predicts. ``They'll stay away.''

Government leaders condemn `disgrace' of English troublemakers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday condemned as a
``complete disgrace'' the English soccer fans who rampaged in
Marseille on the eve of England's World Cup opener against Tunisia.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and we've got to put a stop to it.''
	   Blair conceded the violence could harm England's bid to host the
2006 World Cup.
	   ``None of this helps, does it?'' he said. ``So it is important
that it stops now and that these people realize they undermine the
whole country.''
	   In running street battles shown repeatedly on British
television, English and Tunisian fans clashed with each other and
with French police in Marseille on Sunday night. Fifty people,
including 30 Britons, were arrested, and 37 people injured, local
officials said.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook spoke of his ``shock and shame'' at
the English hooliganism.
	   ``The great majority of England fans there are there to support
the team and enjoy the match,'' he said. ``It is such a shame for
them and for everyone else it is ruined by a very small group of
hooligans. They should either grow up or go home and let the others
enjoy the game.''
	   Sports Minister Tony Banks described the troublemakers as
``drunken, brain-dead louts'' and said a ``moronic minority'' were
ruining the country's reputation abroad.
	   Football chief executive Graham Kelly condemned the
``disgusting'' behavior of England fans but dismissed suggestions
that England should withdraw from the World Cup.
	   ``We are not going to give up and allow these people to spoil it
for 7,300 genuine supporters,'' he said.
	   The FA's security adviser, Sir Brian Hayes, said there had been
some provocation by Tunisians but the behavior of England fans had
been outrageous.
	   ``It's sad that well away from the stadium before a ball has
even been kicked, there are these people who are bringing disgrace
on British people,'' he said.
	   Eddie Curtis, the FA's police adviser, said some of the violence
was orchestrated by ringleaders.
	   ``It's very easy to coordinate undisciplined people who drank a
lot of alcohol,'' he said.
	   The violence dominated the front pages of newspapers and led
television and radio newcasts.
	   The headlines said it all:
	   ``A Disgrace for England.''
	   ``A Bloody Disgrace.''
	   ``Fans Shame England.''
	   ``Shamed Again by the Louts''
	   The Marseille violence brought back the dark days of hooliganism
which disgraced English soccer in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   In the most notorious incident, 39 people, mostly Italian fans,
died at Heysel Stadium in Brussels in 1985 when English fans rioted
before the European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus.
English clubs were subsequently banned from European competition
until the 1990-91 season.
	   English fans also were blamed for widespread destruction at the
1992 European championship in Sweden. In 1995, a friendly
international between Ireland and England in Dublin was abandoned
after 27 minutes when English fans rioted.
	   Last year, there were serious clashes at Rome's Olympic Stadium
when England and Italy played a World Cup qualifier.

Chief inspector: Iraq close to being free from U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with more quotes. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is very close to becoming free of
economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler said Monday.
	   ``The light at the end of the tunnel today is more visible than
anytime,'' Butler said at the end of his three-day talks with Iraqi
officials on disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council will allow the lifting of the
sanctions only after Butler's United Nations Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has no more illegal weapons.
	   Butler said UNSCOM can do that in two months provided Iraq fully
cooperates with its arms inspectors, giving them materials and
documents.
	   ``In my view, if that work is done satisfactorily ... I believe
we should be in a position'' to prepare for lifting the sanctions,
which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
embargo bars exports of oil, the country's main commodity, except
in limited quantities to earn enough to feed its people.
	   ``I am very positive about it. It is good news,'' Butler told a
news conference before leaving for Kuwait en route to New York.
	   The statements are his most positive on Iraqi disarmament since
he took office in July last year and reflect an improvement in
UNSCOM's relations with Iraq, which has regularly accused Butler of
being a lackey of the United States and Britain.
	   During his talks, Butler presented Iraq with a list of
obligations, which he said Iraq must fulfill to back its claims
that it has dismantled all banned chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   But in a sign of UNSCOM flexibility, Butler said his experts are
willing to accept that it is impossible to verify every Iraqi
claim.
	   In the past, UNSCOM insisted it needed conclusive proof and
rejected Iraqi arguments that it had unilaterally destroyed _
without keeping any records _ many weapons before the inspection
process began.
	   ``It may be that we won't ever get 100 percent verification
where physical parts have been torn apart and dispersed,'' Butler
said
	   He said searches for missile and chemical weapons are nearing
their end. Verification of Iraq's past germ warfare program is
cumbersome but the two sides have ``found a new way to deal with
it,'' he said without elaborating.
	   On Sunday, Iraq and UNSCOM agreed to lay down a two-month work
program to end U.N. disarmament activities in Iraq. At the end of
that period, he and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz are expected
to meet again to take stock of the situation.
	   Butler said he sensed Iraq was serious about completing the
disarmament process and that both sides have agreed to accelerate
the work.
	   ``My estimation is that work will be of high quality with a high
degree of cooperation,'' he said.

Police: Woman accused of stealing Diana letters won't be
</HEADLINE>
prosecuted &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A woman accused of stealing 62 love letters
written by Princess Diana to her former boyfriend James Hewitt will
not be prosecuted, police said Monday.
	   Anna Staiano Ferretti, 39, Hewitt's former fiancee, was arrested
in April after claims she tried to sell the letters to a tabloid
newspaper for 150,000 (dlrs 245,000). But Scotland Yard announced
she would not be prosecuted ``after advice from the Crown
Prosecution Service.''
	   Ms. Ferretti's lawyer, Michael Caplan, said his client had
cooperated fully with the police.
	   ``My client has asked me to say that she deeply regrets any
distress or embarrassment that may have been caused over this
matter to the family of the late Princess of Wales,'' Caplan said.
	   After Hewitt cooperated in a 1994 book about their affair,
called ``Princess in Love,'' Diana acknowledged the relationship
and said he had let her down. The affair began when he gave her
riding lessons and the two are believed to have exchanged many
letters, handwritten on blue airmail paper, when he served as a
tank commander in the Persian Gulf War.
	   The Mirror, a national daily tabloid, said Ms. Feretti had
approached editors there in an attempt to sell the letters, which
now are in the hands of Kensington Palace. Hewitt made a formal
complaint to police after returning home from Spain and finding
them missing from his safe.
	   If charges had been brought, the letters could have become court
exhibits.

Australia has new market giant following AMP float
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian funds management and
insurance concern AMP Ltd. made a blockbuster debut on the
Australian Stock Exchange Monday, becoming the country's largest
company for a moment before settling for fourth largest in market
capitalization at the end of the day.
	   After listing at 35.99 Australian dollars (about U.S. dlrs
21.25) a share, a 125 percent premium over its base price, the
company closed at 23 Australian dollars (about U.S. dlrs 13.60),
valuing the whole company at U.S. dlrs 14.5 billion (24.7 billion
Australian dollars).
	   Briefly in the first minutes of trading, AMP was the largest
stock on the Australian market when four trades totaling 1,716
shares went at U.S. dlrs 26.55 (45 Australian dollars) a share.
Stock brokers said these transactions were a puzzling anomaly.
	   Overall, some 35.1 million shares changed hands, worth U.S. dlrs
514 million (870.5 million Australian dollars), overshadowing
activity on the rest of the Australian share market Monday.
	   Chief executive officer George Trumbull, who pocketed the
equivalent of around U.S. dlrs 4.1 million (7 million Australian
dollars) in shares as part of his remuneration package, said the
listing price was ``beyond ... our wildest imagination.''
	   He said the company estimated the float would boost economic
growth in Australia by up to 0.5 percent, lift consumer confidence
and Australia's image overseas, and attract foreign investment.
	   ``This is a great statement for Australia. I think it ought to
give overseas investors more confidence in the country. I hope it
will buoy the market,'' he said.
	   The listing on Australian and New Zealand exchanges ends an
18-month process that saw AMP change to a company limited by shares
from a mutually owned society.
	   AMP issued its policy holders free shares while also providing
them with an opportunity to buy or sell shares through a special
facility.
	   It also issued a further 3 percent of equity capital, boosting
the total pool of stock available for institutional investors to
145 million shares, or 13.5 percent of AMP.
	   Andrew Fay, director of Australian equities at Axiom Funds
Management Ltd., said the listing price exceeded market
expectations, but that there is ``some justification'' for the high
valuation.
	   AMP has financial services businesses in four categories,
including Australasian financial services, U.K. operations, asset
management and general insurance.

Australian test player cleared on technicality
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby league international
Robbie O'Davis had his drug case thrown out on a legal technicality
at Monday's National Rugby League tribunal.
	   O'Davis and Newcastle officials Ian Bonnette and Dave Morley
entered the closed hearing to argue the Queensland State of Origin
winger's defense for having elevated levels of epitestoserone in
his system.
	   If he had been found guilty by the panel, O'Davis would have
faced a mandatory two-year ban.
	   After hearing more than two hours of evidence as to whether
O'Davis was guilty of steroid abuse, tribunal chairman Sir Laurence
Street accepted the NRL had no jurisdiction to make a ruling.
	   Published reports last week said O'Davis has recorded an
epitestosterone level greater than 6 to 1 and will have to undergo
further tests to track his personal level.
	   O'Davis, who was a late inclusion in the Queensland State of
Origin team for Friday's series-deciding game, was tested a month
ago as part of a random check by the Australian Sports Drug Agency.

President-elect says he's made up his mind on Marcos burial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President-elect Joseph
Estrada said Monday protests will not alter his decision to allow
the burial of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos at a Manila
military cemetery.
	   ``I've already made up my mind,'' Estrada told reporters. ``We
are Christians and should respect the dead.''
	   Estrada was reacting to a series of protests planned by
opponents of the burial, including former President Corazon Aquino,
who took office after Marcos was ousted in a ``people power''
revolt in 1986.
	   About 50 people, including priests and nuns, prayed Monday at a
bridge leading to the presidential palace to start the protests.
The bridge had been the site of many bloody protests against
Marcos.
	   Estrada said he was not impressed by the crowd.
	   ``Why waste my time (talking with the protesters),'' Estrada
said. ``If they like to sleep in the streets, let them sleep there.
I'll give them mineral water.''
	   Cecille Guidote-Alvarez, an organizer of the protests, said
Estrada's decision indicated he was ``suffering from amnesia about
some vivid portions of history,'' referring to Marcos' 20-year
strongman rule.
	   ``He said he is for the poor, yet his decision to bury Marcos
serves only the rich and the corrupt. But I have faith he will
listen to the cries of the poor,'' she said.
	   Last week, Marcos' widow, Imelda, said she has tentatively set
the burial at the Heroes' Cemetery for July 11. She said she has
agreed to a burial without state honors.
	   Mrs. Marcos had wanted full state honors for her husband because
he had served in the military and also as president. But many
Filipinos, including those who suffered human rights abuses during
Marcos' rule, opposed that demand.
	   Marcos fled after his ouster to Hawaii, where he died three
years later. His body was returned to the Philippines in September
1993 and has been kept since then in an air-conditioned glass crypt
in his hometown of Batac.
	   Outgoing President Fidel Ramos and his predecessor, Mrs. Aquino,
refused to allow Marcos to be buried at the Heroes' Cemetery,
fearing possible clashes between Marcos loyalists and opponents.
	   The Heroes' Cemetery is a burial ground for soldiers, regardless
of record. Two former presidents are also buried there.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, takes office June 30.

Health fund sues cigarette company, seeks payment for treatments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli health fund on Monday sued the
country's only cigarette manufacturer, Dubek, for 1.75 billion
shekels (dlrs 486 million) to cover the treatment of
smoking-related illnesses.
	   The Kupat Holim Maccabi health fund seeks 250,000 million
shekels (dlrs 71 million) a year it says it has paid since 1991 for
treating smokers. Maccabi's attorney, Gidi Frishtik, said it is up
to the court to rule if Dubek will have to pay Maccabi in the
future as well.
	   Eliezer Kapinsky, the head of the cardiac unit at Tel Hashomer
Hospital near Tel Aviv, said Dubek should be held accountable for
the health problems caused by the cigarettes it makes.
	   ``Whoever sells products that result in such serious health
damage must bear the consequences,'' Kapinsky, who will testify for
Kupat Holim Maccabi, told Israel army radio.
	   Dubek spokesman Ran Rahav said he would not comment until he had
read the court papers.
	   Earlier this month, a group of doctors and former smokers
suffering from heart disease and lung cancer asked the Supreme
Court to declare nicotine and tobacco ``dangerous drugs,'' thus
forcing the Health Ministry to restrict the sale and marketing of
cigarettes. The court has not ruled yet.
	   According to the Israeli Medical Association, some 5,000
Israelis die every year from smoking-related illnesses. Smoking
costs the economy over dlrs 500 million a year in lost work days
and damages caused by fires started by cigarettes.
	   Twenty-eight percent of Israel's 5.6 million citizens smoke.

<TEXT>
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ NATO fighter jets and
reconnaissance aircraft roared into the sky early Monday, hoping to
intimidate Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by showing him how
quickly and powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces
if needed.
	   Eighty-four aircraft from the United States and 12 other of
NATO's 16 member countries staged several hours of aerial exercises
over Albania and Macedonia, which border Yugoslavia.
	   ``This is an exercise intended to demonstrate the alliance's
commitment to peace and stability in the region and the alliance's
ability to project power into the region,'' said Lt. Gen. Michael
Short, commander of NATO air forces in the alliance's southern
Europe division.
	   Much of the world has been aghast as Milosevic's Serb-led army
and police cracked down on dissent in Kosovo province, inhabited
mostly by ethnic Albanians. More than 300 people have been killed
and thousands have fled across the border into northern Albania.
	   Western leaders want to halt the violence. But they do not want
to be seen giving comfort to the Kosovo Liberation Army, a group
that is fighting for independence of the province and which the
alliance does not support.
	   The planes began departing about (0550 GMT) Monday, leaving from
air bases in Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Britain and the
Adriatic Sea. Support planes, including refueling tankers, already
were in the air. The exercises were expected to end about four
hours later.
	   First of the 24 aircraft departing Aviano were two American
F-16s, followed by four Spanish F-18s, a tanker and another
half-dozen American F-16s.
	   NATO's air power exercise shows alliance unity on halting the
Kosovo crisis and the ability to act with ``significant lethal
capability'' should that be necessary, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said Monday.
	   The fighting in Kosovo has sparked alarm that the violence could
spread south to Albania and Macedonia, which agreed to let their
territory be used for the exercises.
	   Asked early Monday if he expected the aircraft to be picked up
by Yugoslav ground radar, Short said, ``It's very reasonable to say
the aircraft will be tracked by Yugoslav early warning systems.''
	   ``We will do nothing in this exercise to provoke a response from
the federal republic of Yugoslavia,'' he said.
	   Short would not say just how close the allied planes will come
to the Yugoslav border. But Col. Emerson Gardner, aboard the USS
Wasp in the Adriatic Sea, said: ``We will be close enough that the
Serbs will know NATO will be there.''
	   All NATO members sent aircraft except Iceland and Luxembourg,
which have no air forces, and Canada, which could not deploy planes
to Europe on such short notice.
	   The air exercise, code-named Determined Falcon, was ordered
Thursday by NATO defense ministers during their meeting in
Brussels.
	   The ministers also ordered the alliance's military planners to
look at a wide range of options for future action, including direct
intervention in Yugoslavia with air and ground forces.
	   Also Monday, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev publicly
rebuked a top U.S. military commander, accusing NATO of failing to
consult with Moscow on holding air exercises over the Balkans.
	   The rare public clash came as the Russian Foreign Ministry said
Milosevic's imminent meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
in Moscow would be ``potentially decisive'' in defusing the
explosive conflict in Kosovo.
	   Sergeyev gave visiting Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dressing-down before reporters. He said
NATO decided to launch the air exercises only after he had left
consultations in Brussels last week.
	   Milosevic is in Moscow on Monday and Tuesday, and Yeltsin has
promised to use what influence he has to defuse the situation in
Kosovo.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed any direct intervention in
Yugoslavia, saying all diplomatic options have yet to be exhausted.
	   The Defense Ministry said Monday that Russia has recalled its
military envoy to NATO, Lt.-Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, Interfax and the
ITAR-Tass news agencies reported. No explanation was given.
	   The Foreign Ministry urged the Western alliance to take care
that its exercises ``not provoke either the Albanian community of
Kosovo or Belgrade to escalate (tension), and give diplomats the
possibility to work on regulating the Kosovo conflict,'' Vladimir
Rakhmanin, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official, was quoted as
saying.

 &UR; Kwasniewski criticized for campaigning against government reform
plan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski was
criticized on Monday for opening a campaign that advocates
administrative division of Poland into 17 provinces and torpedoes
the government-drawn maps with less.
	   On Sunday, Kwasniewski visited Opole, in southwestern Poland and
the central city of Kielce, which had been protesting government
plans to incorporate them into large provinces, under a bold reform
that largely reduces the number of Poland's provinces and gives
more power to local governments.
	   Kwasniewski, an ex-communist, said there he will only approve a
division into 17 provinces, advocated by the leftist opposition,
which preserves the two cities' current provincial capital status.
	   If the president vetoes the government plan of division, it will
be a ``catastrophe for the coalition and for the country,'' said
Henryk Wujec, a leader of the Freedom Union party, the junior
member in the Solidarity-led government.
	   Freedom Union leader Leszek Balcerowicz, who is finance
minister, appealed to Kwasniewski not to use the reform for
political games.
	   The Cabinet of Jerzy Buzek originally wanted a division into 12
provinces, but revised the plan to 15, following protests. The
reform is to take effect Jan. 1.
	   Kwasniewski's veto would jeopardize the whole reform, that is to
do away with the bureaucratic system inherited from the communist
era, observers said.
	   Newspaper commentators said Kwasniewski was bowing to his
ex-communist colleagues and opening his own campaign for reelection
in the year 2000.
	   Piotr Pacewicz in Gazeta Wyborcza, the largest national daily,
appealed to the government and the president to reach a compromise,
just as they did on NATO membership, because ``the administrative
reform is equally important.''
	   Kwasniewski is to visit three more provincial capitals later
this week.

Witness: Maccabiah bridge plans never reviewed by city planners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Plans for a footbridge that collapsed
during Israel's Maccabiah Games last summer, killing four
Australian athletes, were never submitted for review by city
planners and engineers, a witness testified Monday.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the games and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are on trial in Tel Aviv Magistrates Court on charges of
negligent homicide and building without proper permits.
	   But Avraham Landstein, the attorney for engineer Micha Bar-Ilan,
said city officials in Ramat Gan, where the games were held, should
also be on trial.
	   ``I would put Ramat Gan Mayor Zvi Bar, the municipal engineer,
the local police chief of Ramat Gan, and whoever is responsible for
the Yarkon River at the Ministry of Environment on trial,''
Landstein told The Associated Press.
	   The bridge collapsed during the opening ceremony of the games on
July 14. About 100 Australian athletes were on the bridge when it
buckled, and dozens were injured after being plunged into the
polluted Yarkon River below.
	   On Monday, the court heard testimony from Shmuel Dor, a member
of the Ramat Gan city planning and building committee, who said the
subject of the bridge never before the committee.
	   Dor, questioned by Landstein, said the bridge should have been
approved by the city engineer.
	   Also testifying was draftsman Tomer Katz, who drew up the
blueprints for the bridge, based on specifications from the
contractors. Tomer said he had never before drawn plans for a
bridge.
	   The five defendants face up to three years in prison if
convicted.

Malaysia and Singapore joining in two-day air defense exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia and Singapore will start
a two-day exercise Wednesday to test their air defenses against a
simulated external threat, a Defense Ministry spokesman said.
	   A spokesman said Monday the exercise is being held under the
scope of the Five Power Defense Arrangement, whose other members
are Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
	   Five types of aircraft will join the exercises, including the
Malaysian air forces's MiG-29 Russian-made fighters.
	   Last week, Malaysia and Thailand canceled their planned joint
military exercises because of a lack of money.
	   Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said that in cutting costs,
Malaysia would bring back all military vehicles it had sent to
Bosnia-Herzegovina for the use of Malaysian troops who served with
the United Nations there.
	   He said it would be more economical to bring them back than buy
new ones.
	   The shipment would cost about 2 million ringgit (dlrs 500,000),
but the vehicles cost 26 million ringgit (dlrs 6.5 million).

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Police put a lock on Marseille on
Monday, bringing in reinforcements, putting a partial ban on
alcohol and searching and escorting arriving English soccer fans to
thwart a flare up of the violence that seriously injured two
people.
	   Less than two hours before the 2:30 p.m. (1230 GMT)
England-Tunisia World Cup match, police, turning tough, swung their
sticks at two English fans to head off a new melee outside the
stadium.
	   Police intervened after rocks and bottles flew through a crowd
of people outside the stadium on the Prado, the wide boulevard in
downtown Marseille.
	   It was a taste of the clashes that erupted here Monday night as
England and Tunisia supporters heaved bottles, smashed windows and
shouted insults.
	   Police arrested 50 people in the melee that left 37 people
injured, local officials said.
	   Among the seriously injured was a young English fan slashed in
the throat.
	   Of the injured and arrested, 30 were British. Tunisians and
French also were injured and arrested.
	   Marseille Police Chief Michel Sappin said police ranks were
being reinforced in the city center and around the stadium. Lines
of riot police ready to sweep in if needed could be seen
strategically placed outside Marseille.
	   Authorities had already planned to deploy a total of 1,600
uniformed or plainclothes city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100
elite CRS national police for Monday's match scheduled for 1230
GMT.
	   The prefect of the region, Jean-Paul Proust, said that eight
people were being brought before a Marseille court Monday in an
example of the swift justice aimed at curbing World Cup violence.
	   ``This was a little inevitable,'' Proust said on France Inter
radio, blaming the violence on drinking hooligans.
	   Proust banned the sale of alcohol in the city starting at 4:30
p.m. and ordered all bars closed by 11 p.m.

Belarus President Lukashenko in Egypt for trade visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus
arrived Monday on a two-day visit aimed at boosting trade ties with
Egypt.
	   Lukashenko was received at the airport by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, and later given an official welcome at Mubarak's
Ittehadiya Palace.
	   Lukashenko is scheduled to hold talks with Mubarak later Monday.
He is also scheduled to visit the Parliament and the headquarters
of the Arab League besides meeting with Egypt's businessmen.
	   A Belarus delegation accompanying Lukashenko is expected to sign
with Egyptian officials a dozen agreements, including those on
trade and economic cooperation, avoiding double taxation and
starting regular flights between the two countries.
	   During the visit, Belarus will open here an assembly line for
MAZ trucks, inaugurate the Belarusian trade house and set up a
joint Belarusian-Egyptian bank and an insurance company, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
	   It said the two sides are also expected to discuss the issue of
granting the most-favored-nation status to Belarus. Egypt has
refused to do that so far because Belarus is not a member of the
World Trade Organization.

U.S. ambassador: China having trouble stopping proliferation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has trouble controlling exports of
sensitive technology or expertise that could be used to develop
weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. ambassador to China says.
	   The assessment of China's porous export controls, made in an
interview transcript released Monday, came as a top White House
security adviser worked with Chinese officials in Beijing to
prepare for U.S. President Bill Clinton's China summit next week.
	   U.S. Embassy officials refused to confirm a report that Sandra
Kristoff, the National Security Council's leading Asia expert, was
trying to win agreement that both countries stop targeting each
other with nuclear missiles.
	   The Clinton administration has been trying to further
cooperation on military and other security issues as part of its
policy to improve relations with China.
	   Halting proliferation of nuclear, missile and other dangerous
technology has become a central issue in U.S.-China ties, one in
which ``significant progress'' has been made, Ambassador James
Sasser said in the interview.
	   Sasser said Washington and Beijing were working closely to
develop rules and regulations to toughen China's export controls on
weapons technology.
	   But he said Washington ``fairly routinely'' uncovers signs that
suspect technology is leaking out of China, despite existing bans.
	   ``They do have some problems enforcing the writ of the central
government all through the country and over the whole spectrum of
people who export technology or expertise,'' Sasser said in an
interview Friday with European reporters. ``They have some
difficulty in enforcing a discipline.''
	   Once Chinese officials learn of such technology leaks, Sasser
said, they take steps to halt the transfers.
	   Stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is
expected to be on Clinton's summit agenda with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin.
	   The issue has taken on added importance in the wake of India's
and Pakistan's nuclear tests last month. China is believed to have
provided Pakistan, a close ally, with equipment and know-how that
helped it build nuclear devices and the missiles to deliver them.
	   Chinese leaders have ``come to the view on their own that it is
in China's interest to move down the road of non-proliferation,''
Sasser said.
	   On another issue, Sasser said he was ``not optimistic'' that an
agreement on China's long-stalled entry into the World Trade
Organization could be readied in time for Clinton's visit, the
first by a U.S. president in nine years.
	   ``There's still a lot of negotiation to take place, a lot of
bridges to be crossed,'' he said.
	   The United States wants China to open its markets further to
foreign investors and products before it is allowed to join the
rule-setting body for world trade.

Kosovo exhibits mixed feelings as NATO planes soar neighboring

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with ethnic Albanian, Serb reaction to
NATO air maneuvers in Albania, Macedonia; edits throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The battered Serbian province of
Kosovo held its breath Monday in what appeared a brief respite in
violence as NATO warplanes roamed the skies of neighboring Albania
and Macedonia.
	   Eighty-four aircraft from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries were
conducting several hours of exercises in the two Balkan countries
in hopes of intimidating the Yugoslav president by showing how
quickly and powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces
if needed.
	   The governments of Albania and Macedonia agreed late last week
to allow their territory to be used for the exercise ordered by
Allied defense ministers Thursday.
	   Fearing the conflict could spill over into neighboring Albania
and Macedonia, Western nations warned Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic last week to change his hard-line policy or face the
threat of force.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, people welcomed or rejected the
show of NATO muscle, depending on their ethnic background.
	   Mahmut Bakali, a member of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating
team set up to talk with Serbian authorities, said NATO's air
exercise was ``a necessity, an international demonstration of
power, sending Milosevic the firmest warning yet to withdraw his
police, army and paramilitary force from the province and halt
attacks on ethnic Albanians.''
	   Bakali said he hoped Milosevic would heed the warning so that
``serious negotiations on the status of Kosovo can begin,'' _ a
feeling shared by most fellow ethnic Albanians.
	   Miran Bekteshi, a 42-year old Pristina teacher, said the
Americans and the rest of the world had learned from the experience
in the Bosnian war: ``Milosevic is not to be trusted.
	   ``He can't keep leading the rest of the world by their noses
forever, pretending to negotiate while waging war. The threat that
NATO actually can bomb Serbia is the maximum for now,'' Bekteshi
said.
	   Fehmi Agani, an ethnic Albanian leader, reiterated calls for
NATO to act on the ground as well, because ``all means are
legitimate when it comes to striving for peace in Kosovo.''
	   Pensioner Sadije Dumolli, 59, was relieved and ``more hopeful.
If it were not for NATO, Serbia wouldn't stop ridding Kosovo of its
last Albanian.''
	   The Albanians' reaction contrasted sharply with that from Kosovo
Serbs, who were asked to comment on the NATO maneuvers. Serbian
officials in Kosovo were not immediately available for comment.
	   ``I simply don't care. If this keeps on much longer, I'll pack
up my stuff and move to Serbia,'' said Branko Rakic, a clerk in a
state-owned company. He said he took part in the war in 1991 in
former Yugoslavia and was ``sick of wars...''
	   Unemployed Biljana Mitrovic, 30, was defiant: ``Let NATO come,
let just a single plane fly over our skies _ we'll all be up to our
knees in blood,'' she said, predicting a repetition of Somalia if
American soldiers ever landed in Kosovo.
	   ``I'll fight the Americans. This is a sovereign country and they
just can't do as they please,'' said Gojko, a 50-year-old Serb
refusing to give his second name.
	   More than 300 people have died since the crisis escalated in
March when Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist ethnic
Albanians fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   No reports of fresh violence in Kosovo were available by Monday
noon.
	   Fighting escalated Sunday on several Kosovo front-lines,
reportedly claiming the lives of three ethnic Albanians and two
Serb policemen. Another ten people were reported wounded. Ethnic
Albanian sources claimed that Serbian forces launched 500 grenades
against Albanian villages during the weekend.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement. But since the
crackdown began, the the underground Kosovo Liberation Army
fighting for independence has grown in numbers and popularity among
ethnic Albanians.
	   The KLA currently controls an estimated 40 percent of the
province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   Tens of thousands of people have fled the fighting, at least
13,000 of them crossing the mountainous border into Albania and
another 9,000 fleeing to Montenegro. An estimated 45,000 are
displaced within Kosovo, says the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.

Northern Russia's miners plan to restart railway blockade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Coal miners in northern Russia plan to resume
their blockade of a local railway because of the government's
failure to pay back wages, union officials said Monday.
	   Miners from the town of Inta in the Vorkuta region, who blocked
the main railroad in the area for about two weeks last month, had
set a Monday deadline for the government to pay all its debts to
them.
	   So far they have received only the money owed for last fall and
have gotten nothing due for this year, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported, quoting local union leader Sergei Nikitensky.
	   The blockades of several key railroads, including the
Trans-Siberian Railway, badly hurt the Russian economy. The Kremlin
said they also were a threat to the nation's national security.
	   The government has managed to persuade the workers to end their
action by covering some of the debts, but dozens of coal miners
have been picketing the government headquarters in Moscow since
Thursday to protest the unpaid wages.
	   Coal miners from Inta warned on Monday that they would launch a
``war on the rails'' again if officials fail to meet the rest of
their obligations.
	   Boris Nemtsov, a deputy premier who played a key role in
negotiating an end to the protests last month, will chair a
government meeting on Tuesday to discuss the situation in
coal-mining regions.
	   Millions of miners and other workers throughout Russia have gone
months without pay. Wage funds have shrunk in large part because
the government has continually been unable to meet its tax
collection targets.
	   The Kremlin has also said that a large chunk of the debt owed to
coal miners results from the activities of numerous intermediaries
who don't pay for the coal on time.
	   In the Kemerovo region of central Siberia, officials have opened
criminal proceedings against 15 coal-selling companies and are
currently investigating dozens of others.

Largest resort in Middle East to be built in biblical Jericho
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ An Austrian developer announced plans
Monday to build a dlrs 150 million resort in the biblical oasis of
Jericho and said it would be the largest tourism complex in the
Middle East.
	   The first stage, a casino with 35 tables and 220 slot machines
will open this fall, said lead developer Casinos Austria, the
largest casino chain in the world.
	   By the summer of 1999, a 220-room hotel will open next to the
casino. Eventually, another one or two hotels will be built at the
site, in addition to a golf course, tennis courts and conference
facilities, the company said.
	   The complex will cover two square miles (five square kilometers)
in the Judean desert on the outskirts of Jericho, a Palestinian-run
town of 15,000 residents.
	   Casinos Austria is a joint-stock company whose shares are held
by private and state-owned companies, such as the Austrian Mint and
a group of state-controlled insurance companies and banks.

Howard under pressure to change election strategy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Howard after Cabinet meeting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John
Howard came under pressure Monday to change his national election
strategy as lawmakers upset by the results of a weekend state
election urged him to drop key policy elements.
	   As the Cabinet met to discuss the fallout from Saturday's
election, ruling coalition legislators warned that the right-wing
One Nation party may repeat its surprise success in Queensland
state on a national level if Howard sticks with his election plan.
	   Howard must call a national election before March 1999.
	   Some lawmakers from the rural-based National party have signaled
a split may be emerging in the ruling conservative coalition.
	   A faction of the National party appears ready to embrace some of
One Nation's nationalist, populist and protectionist policies to
try to win back support from disaffected voters.
	   Before the Queensland election, the prime minister had been
widely expected to go to the polls within months, probably after
releasing a tax reform package including a broad-based sales tax.
	   But the outcome of the vote in Queensland cast doubt on Howard's
plans for an early election. Many voters abandoned traditional
conservative parties to support Pauline Hanson's One Nation
movement.
	   Hanson opposes many of Howard's key planned reforms, such as the
introduction of a sales tax. She has also been critical of Howard's
plan to sell off the government stake in telecommunications carrier
Telstra Corp.
	   In addition, Hanson wants a harder line on Aboriginal people's
entitlements to land and the abolition of government gun-control
measures.
	   Howard said after the Cabinet meeting Monday that the
government's position on the tax, Telstra and native titles were
unchanged after the election, and despite the wavering of some
Nationals.
	   ``Our policy on Telstra remains. Full steam ahead on tax
reform,'' Howard told Australian Broadcasting Corp. TV.
	   An early federal election, which because of electoral
technicalities would almost guarantee One Nation would win more
seats in the Senate than in a full-term election, was still a 50-50
chance, he said.
	   ``You don't react by panicking,'' he said of the Queensland
result. ``What you do is to analyze what has happened, understand
why it's happened.''
	   He said the main reason for the vote in Queensland was the sense
of vulnerability in the electorate over the impact of economic
change _ a direct protest against the political establishment
rather than a vote in favor of One Nation.
	   Senior National party figures said Monday that trying to sell a
sales tax to Queensland voters at an early federal poll would be
electoral suicide.
	   ``It would be mad to go ahead'' with such a tax unless voters
can be assured it is going to benefit them, National party director
Don McDonald said.
	   National lawmaker De-Anne Kelly said the election result showed
a goods and services tax was ``plainly not going to be acceptable
in Queensland.''
	   Some Nationals have also indicated the party should distance
itself from Howard's metropolitan-based Liberal Party and adopt
more conservative policies.
	   ``It's time to take a very independent view of policy .... If we
don't change our course, quite plainly people will send us the same
message at federal level as they have at a state level,'' Kelly
said.
	   The final tally for the Queensland race was expected to take
days to compile, but One Nation attracted about 23 percent of the
vote. It stands to win nine and possibly more seats in the state's
89-seat Parliament.
	   If the party won similar support at the national level, it would
likely hold the balance of power in the upper house, the Senate.

Delegates gather in Rome to forge international court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Annan news conference, British position, war
crimes suspect arrest; TRIMS, no pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on the
international community Monday to create a ``bulwark against evil''
by establishing a permanent world criminal court.
	   In opening a U.N. conference to set up the tribunal, he appealed
for a ``court strong and independent enough to carry out its task''
of bringing war criminals and perpetrators of crimes against
humanity to justice.
	   The United States, Russia, China, and France _ four of the five
permanent Security Council members _ have been pushing for stronger
council control over the proposed court's prosecutor. Human rights
advocates say that would cripple the court's independence.
	   ``People all over the world want to know that humanity can
strike back -- that wherever and whenever genocide, war crimes or
other such violations are committed, there is a court before which
the criminal can be held to account,'' Annan told the delegates.
	   ``We have an opportunity that can save lives and serve as a
bulwark against evil.''
	   He later told reporters that it was more important to have a
``credible, competent, independent'' court that may have fewer
signatories than a broadly supported weak one.
	   ''Sooner or later (other nations) will come aboard. If it is
ineffectual, no one gains and in fact this would be a waste of our
time,'' Annan said.
	   Monday brought another reminder of why many say the court is
necessary. NATO forces arrested a Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect
near Sarajevo, accused of atrocities committed at a prison during
the war.
	   The road to a world court will be long and hard. Success is by
no means certain.
	   The delegates must wrestle with basic issues, such as the powers
granted the prosecutor, what will set a prosecution in motion, how
much influence the U.N. Security Council and its members will have
over the court's functioning and what crimes it would cover.
	   Britain, alone among the Security Council permanent members,
seeks more independence for the court.
	   ``We hope the United States will get on board,'' said Tony
Lloyd, the British minister of state for foreign affairs.
	   All parties basically agree that the court will target genocide,
war crimes and crimes against humanity. Defendants will be
individuals, unlike at the existing International Court of Justice
at The Hague, where nations lodge complaints against nations.
	   The negotiators have a 173-page draft statute two years in the
making. Small working committees will attempt to reach agreement on
wording.
	   Next, the statute goes before the U.N. General Assembly.
Finally, individual nations must ratify the statute, and if need
be, change their own laws to conform with it.
	   The idea of a global justice arena dates back to the period
right after World War II, when the Nuremberg trials of Nazis and
war crimes trials in Japan were carried out.
	   The horrors this decade in Bosnia and Rwanda -- for which ad hoc
courts have been formed to prosecute war criminals --brought the
idea to life.

Bomb explodes near Russian tax police building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A remote-controlled bomb exploded near a tax
police office in the capital of Russia's restive republic of North
Ossetia on Monday morning, a news agency reported. No one was
injured.
	   The blast in Vladikavkaz occurred at 8 a.m. (0400 GMT) _ one
hour before the tax police office was to open _ shattering windows
and damaging a Mercedes that belongs to the tax police chief and
was parked nearby, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Investigators said the explosion may be related to a recent
pledge by local tax police chief Ruslan Kabaloyev to ``purge'' the
ranks of tax police from corrupt officials, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Many of Russia's wealthy entrepreneurs and businesses evade
taxes, and some reportedly try to bribe tax police officers to
conceal their assets or incomes.

Actress Brooke Shields accepts libel damages, apology over false

drug story &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Actress Brooke Shields on Monday accepted ``very
substantial'' libel damages and a public apology over a newspaper
article alleging that she was questioned by police for two hours in
connection with drug offenses as she left the Cannes Film Festival.
	   The Mail on Sunday reported May 24 in an ``exclusive'' that
began on the front page and continued on page three that Miss
Shields' luggage was searched and her flight at the Nice Airport
delayed while French police quizzed her.
	   After the actress filed suit against Associated Newspapers Ltd.,
the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, the paper's editor and two
Mail journalists, the Mail on Sunday published a front-page apology
and retraction on May 31.
	   The retraction said the story was totally false and conceded
Miss Shields had not even been stopped at the airport.
	   ``The defendants recognize that Miss Shields is a staunch and
committed anti-drug campaigner and that she has spent considerable
amounts of time supporting substance abuse programs and raising
much needed money for anti-drug abuse programs,'' said Claire
Shields, the defendants' attorney.
	   The newspaper's front-page article ``must therefore have been
especially hurtful to her and to her family,'' the attorney said.
	   The Sunday paper's editor, Jonathan Holborow, has written the
actress, who was not present in court Monday, a personal letter of
apology.
	   The amount of the damages was not disclosed.

Police crack down on neo-Nazis in northern German state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORANIENBURG, Germany (AP) _ Police in northeastern Brandenburg
state said Monday they had arrested 27 people for using banned
neo-Nazi salutes or slogans, including three people who gave the
Hitler salute at a former concentration camp.
	   Brandenburg police had said in February they were assigning
35-45 officers to crackdown on neo-Nazi hangouts. Other German
states have taken similar measures following an increase last year
in crime blamed on radical rightists.
	   That increase, combined with recent electoral successes for a
far-right party, has raised concerns about surging neo-Nazism in
Germany, especially among young people in the formerly closed and
communist east.
	   The arrests in Brandenburg were at three locations Friday night,
and involved mostly youths aged 15 to 25, although one of the
suspects was 37, police said.
	   In the town of Zehdenick, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north
of Berlin, a group of 21 people were arrested after they shouted
``Sieg Heil'' at a party, police said.
	   Police arrested four people suspected of giving the Hitler
salute at a youth club in Frankfurt an der Oder, on the Polish
border. They also arrested three people suspected of giving the
salute at the former concentration camp at Ravensbrueck, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) north of Berlin.
	   Conviction for use of banned neo-Nazi symbols can bring a prison
term of up to three years.

London stocks tumble in wake of Asian market carnage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices plunged on the London Stock Exchange early
Monday, as investors responded to sharp overnight drops on Asian
markets.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was
off 116.4 points, or 2 percent, at 5,653.4 in the early afternoon.
	   Investors were nervously selling shares after seeing markets in
Hong Kong and Bangkok dive by 5.7 percent, with the big Tokyo Stock
Exchange also dipping 1.3 percent as the Japanese yen tumbled
further against the U.S. dollar.
	   Analysts said the drop in London may have been exaggerated by
thin trading volume. Many workers in London were taking the day off
to watch England play Tunisia in the World Cup soccer tournament.
	   Volume came to 410.1 million shares by midday.
	   ``Dealing rooms are more quiet than usual because of the large
number of absentees,'' said Jeremy Batstone, head of research at
NatWest Stockbrokers in London. ``While there is a response to
falls on the Asian markets, the market is more interested in
football than the markets themselves.''

Thai authorities hope movie can overcome prejudice against mental
</HEADLINE>
illness &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Hoping to change attitudes toward
mentally ill people, the Thai government plans public showings of
the 1996 movie ``Shine,'' based on the true story of the
emotionally disturbed Australian pianist David Helfgott.
	   Officials of the Mental Health Department said Monday they hoped
the movie, which picked up an Oscar nomination for best picture,
would teach people how to welcome former mental patients back into
society.
	   Psychiatrists will attend a June 22 showing of the movie at the
public health ministry to provide commentary about the causes and
symptoms of mental illness, and how to deal with former patients.
	   The department expects at least 500 people to attend the
program, and if it is judged a success, hopes to repeat it.
	   Emotionally disturbed people in Thailand are often shunned by
their compatriots. A significant number of patients nationwide have
been abandoned at mental hospitals for more than 10 years by their
relatives, a Mental Health Department spokesman said.
	   The number of Thais suffering from mental illness rose sharply
from 162,555 in 1996 to 180,614 last year.
	   ``Shine'' details the story of Helfgott, a prodigy who suffered
a breakdown, spent a decade in mental hospitals but returned to the
stage, redeemed by love. The role won the 1996 best actor Oscar for
Geoffrey Rush.

Versace holds off plans for stock listing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COMO, Italy (AP) _ The Versace fashion house has no immediate
plans to quote the company's shares on the stock market, chairman
Santo Versace said Monday.
	   The company had been planning to go on the market before the
murder of designer Gianni Versace last summer.
	   But Santo Versace, Gianni's brother, noted that the plans have
been set aside.
	   ``It (a listing) was never forecast for 1999,'' he said when
asked about news reports that the company might launch an initial
public offering next year.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Police put a lock on Marseille on
Monday, bringing in reinforcements, putting a partial ban on
alcohol and searching and escorting arriving English soccer fans to
thwart a flare up of the violence that seriously injured two
people.
	   Less than two hours before the 2:30 p.m. (1230 GMT)
England-Tunisia World Cup match, police, turning tough, swung their
sticks at two English fans to head off a new melee outside the
stadium.
	   Police intervened after rocks and bottles flew through a crowd
of people outside the stadium on the Prado, the wide boulevard in
downtown Marseille.
	   It was a taste of the clashes that erupted here Monday night as
England and Tunisia supporters heaved bottles, smashed windows and
shouted insults.
	   Police arrested 50 people in the melee that left 37 people
injured, local officials said.
	   Among the seriously injured was a young English fan slashed in
the throat.
	   Of the injured and arrested, 30 were British. Tunisians and
French also were injured and arrested.
	   Marseille Police Chief Michel Sappin said police ranks were
being reinforced in the city center and around the stadium. Lines
of riot police ready to sweep in if needed could be seen
strategically placed outside Marseille.
	   Authorities had already planned to deploy a total of 1,600
uniformed or plainclothes city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100
elite CRS national police for Monday's match scheduled for 1230
GMT.
	   The prefect of the region, Jean-Paul Proust, said that eight
people were being brought before a Marseille court Monday in an
example of the swift justice aimed at curbing World Cup violence.
	   ``This was a little inevitable,'' Proust said on France Inter
radio, blaming the violence on drinking hooligans.
	   Proust banned the sale of alcohol in the city starting at 4:30
p.m. and ordered all bars closed by 11 p.m.

Jordan's national airline resumes flights to Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's flag carrier will resume Monday
commercial flights to Iran, which were suspended about 20 years ago
when the Islamic revolution soured ties between the two countries.
	   Transportation Minister Sami Gammo and Religious Affairs
Minister Abdul-Salam Abadi will leave on board the Royal Jordanian
flight to Tehran, which is scheduled to depart shortly before
midnight.
	   The airline revived the Tehran route for ``purely economical
reasons'' and will fly twice a week, Faruk Lambaz, a Royal
Jordanian official, said. He did not elaborate.
	   Iran Air has not yet reciprocated.
	   Jordan resumed diplomatic relations with Iran in 1992 in line
with the kingdom's efforts to consolidate commercial ties with
Islamic countries.
	   Relations were cut off in 1980, when Amman sided with Baghdad in
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Ties had already been lukewarm since the
February 1979 Islamic revolution ousted Iran's shah, Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, who was a close friend of Jordan's King Hussein.
	   In March, Jordan agreed to allow up to 7,000 Iranian tourists to
visit Shiite Muslim holy shrines in southern Jordan such as tombs
of religious figures in Islamic history.

Commission restricts `explosive' Protestant march through north
</HEADLINE>
Belfast
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A Protestant march this weekend
through north Belfast must steer clear of the area's Catholic
neighborhoods, a government-appointed commission ordered Monday in
hopes of preventing riots.
	   Several thousand members of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's
major pro-British Protestant fraternal organization, had planned to
snake their way through some of Belfast's most bitterly polarized
streets Friday.
	   But Catholics led by supporters of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party had vowed to block their way, all but guaranteeing a repeat
of the street violence that complemented the parade when it was
last held in 1996.
	   The Northern Ireland Parades Commission _ empowered this year to
rule whether traditional Protestant marches can go ahead in areas
where militant Catholics have organized opposition to them _
announced that the parade should be barred from entering
predominantly Catholic streets.
	   Commission chairman Alistair Graham said Friday's march, if
allowed to proceed without restrictions, would ``be even more
explosive than in l996.''
	   On Friday, several hundred anti-riot police officers will seal
off the parade route near the point where predominantly
Protestant-occupied residences give way to Catholic turf.
	   Orange Order leaders said they would hand in a letter of protest
at police lines before doing a peaceful U-turn, but couldn't
guarantee that some of their supporters wouldn't stick around to
cause trouble.
	   ``It's time the government got its act together and dealt with
the real troublemakers,'' the order's executive officer, George
Patton, said in reference to the Catholic protesters.
	   Orange leaders had refused to meet the protest group, calling
itself Community Response Against Sectarianism, on the grounds it
is led by Sinn Fein activists. The group was founded earlier this
year specifically to get the parade blocked.
	   ``We hope the Orangemen accept this position and can bring
themselves to talks with the residents,'' said protesters'
spokesman Tony Barnes. ``The decision should have been made weeks
ago. It was silly, and dangerous, to leave it to this stage because
tensions are running very high.''
	   Graham said the commission might have given the parade the
go-ahead if Orange leaders had ``taken responsible steps'' by
meeting the Catholic protesters ``well in advance of the parade.''
	   ``This is not a question of conceding territory, or indeed, of
seeking the permission of others to exercise fundamental rights,''
said Graham, a senior labor union official from England whose
handling of the commission has been fiercely criticized by both
sides.
	   ``It is a question of how two beleaguered communities, with a
relationship that is bedeviled by the scars of the past, can best
share the space available to them.''

Australia announces new air agreements with Germany and Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government on Monday
announced new air transport agreements that it said will double
passenger services to Germany and give Singapore Airlines
unrestricted air cargo access to Australia.
	   Transport Minister Mark Vaile said the present 14 weekly
services between Australia and Germany will increase immediately to
28 flights. The number of flights will be gradually increased to 50
a week by 2004, he said.
	   The expansion comes as Australian airlines are cutting their
services to Asian destinations, where business has been hurt by the
Asian economic crisis, and the industry seeks to attract more
European and American tourists.
	   ``The government has reacted swiftly to industry and market
changes,'' Vaile said.
	   Almost 130,000 German tourists visited Australia last year.
	   Under the Singapore agreement, Singapore Airlines will be
allowed to increase its freight services to Australia at any time
as the market requires. The airline currently operates four jumbo
jet freight flights each week to Australia.
	   Australia's air freight trade with the rest of the world grew by
42 percent over the past four years and totaled almost 644,000
metric tons in 1997. Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. carried 30
percent and Singapore Airlines 12 percent.
	   The agreement, which provides reciprocal benefits for Australian
carriers, will benefit Australian manufacturers and exporters who
were increasingly using air freight to ship their high value goods
to offshore markets, Vaile said.
	   ``Singapore is one of Asia's major hubs, providing connections
to the major export markets in Asia, Europe and emerging new
markets such as India and the Middle East,'' Vaile said.

Macedonians say NATO action brings sense of security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO jets streaking through the skies
over Macedonia in a show of force designed to stop fighting in
neighboring Kosovo were seen Monday as a sign of stability and
security.
	   ``The exercise will contribute to regional stability and could
stop the Kosovo conflict from spreading to Macedonia,'' government
spokesman Zoran Ivanov said.
	   For Macedonia, which has no air force, the 80 jets were the
first clear sign that the West wants to halt fighting in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, bordering this nation of 2.2 million.
	   ``This fighting is very scary, but NATO reacted at the right
time and in the right place to show some stubborn politicians that
no ideology is more valuable than people,'' said Liliana Hristovam,
45, an unemployed economist.
	   The flight was in response to Serbian security forces'
three-month crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels. Some 300 people
have died in fighting in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians account for
90 percent of the population.
	   For about three hours Monday, NATO planes crossed the skies,
passing within a few kilometers of Kosovo.
	   The airplanes were not visible from the capital, Skopje, but
local media carried regular updates on the airplanes' progress.
	   Skopje residents said the flights helped calm fears. But they
said Macedonia's own ethnic Albanians, who make up 23 percent of
the population, may now push for separation.
	   ``There is a 50-50 chance that the ethnic Albanians here will
try for independence,'' said waiter Sash Andonovski, 28.
	   He said local Albanians may interpret the NATO flights as
backing for the Kosovo Liberation Army, formed last year to fight
for independence from Yugoslavia.
	   Rizan Sulejmani, a member of parliament for the ethnic Albanian
Party for Democracy and Prosperity, rejected fears of separatism.
	   A senior western diplomat also downplayed ethnic tensions.
Albanians in Macedonia, ``hold one protest every three months in
solidarity with their brethren in Kosovo. At that rate, the tension
certainly isn't bubbling over.''

Vladivostok hit with water shortages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Residents of the port city of Vladivostok have
been without water for weeks as reservoirs reach critically low
levels, according to a news agency report on Monday.
	   Most industrial enterprises have been cut off from water in the
city of 700,000 people, located on Russia's east coast. In many
apartment buildings, the only source of water is a tap in the
basement or on the first floor.
	   City officials said a drought in 1997 had left suburban
reservoirs empty. Other, smaller wells are now running out of
water.
	   Vladivostok has been hit by water and energy cuts since the fall
of the Soviet Union. In October, locals lost water for days, and
endured power cuts lasting up to 12 hours.
	   Vladivostok Mayor Victor Cherepkov recently said that there
would be no hot water in the city for the entire summer, though
some homes in the region have not yet been cut off.
	   Because of the low level of water, mold has fully contaminated
some reservoirs, making the water in them undrinkable.
	   Cherepkov announced recently that he would spend 400,000 rubles
to renovate local water equipment, which would give the city access
to more water. But the project will take a month, his press center
said.

South Korea's Pohang Iron to reduce production for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel
Co., the world's second largest steel maker, said Monday it will
reduce production for the first time because of decreasing domestic
demand.
	   The company, commonly called POSCO, will cut production this
year by 6.4 percent, or 1.7 million tons, from 26.43 tons last
year, company officials said.
	   It will be the state-run steelmaker's first production cut since
it was built in 1968. In all previous years, it increased
production.
	   Pohang's decision reflected the magnitude of the economic crisis
gripping South Korea. The country was forced to call in the
International Monetary Fund to bail out its economy in December.
	   Domestic steel demand has dropped sharply as major consumers
such as builders and manufacturers of cars and electronic goods are
seeing sharp sales drops.
	   POSCO is the world's second largest steel maker after Nippon
Steel of Japan, which produced 26.9 million tons last year.

Kosovo exhibits mixed feelings as NATO planes soar neighboring

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with ethnic Albanian, Serb reaction to NATO
air maneuvers. EDITS to conform. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The battered Serbian province of
Kosovo appeared to have a brief respite from violence Monday as
NATO warplanes roamed the skies of neighboring Albania and
Macedonia.
	   Eighty-four aircraft from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries were
conducting several hours of exercises in hopes of intimidating
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by showing how quickly and
powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces.
	   The governments of Albania and Macedonia agreed late last week
to allow their territory to be used for the exercise. Much of the
world has been aghast as Milosevic's Serb-led army and police
cracked down on dissent in Kosovo, inhabited mostly by ethnic
Albanians. More than 300 people have been killed and thousands have
fled across the border into northern Albania.
	   Fearing the conflict could spill over in the Balkans, Western
nations warned Milosevic last week to change his hard-line policy
or face the threat of force.
	   In Kosovo's capital Pristina, people welcomed or rejected the
show of NATO muscle, depending on their ethnic background.
	   Mahmut Bakali, a member of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating
team set up to talk with Serbian authorities, said NATO's air
exercise was ``a necessity, an international demonstration of
power, sending Milosevic the firmest warning yet to withdraw his
police, army and paramilitary force from the province and halt
attacks on ethnic Albanians.''
	   Bakali said he hoped Milosevic would heed the warning so that
``serious negotiations on the status of Kosovo can begin,'' _ a
feeling shared by most fellow ethnic Albanians.
	   Miran Bekteshi, a 42-year old Pristina teacher, said the
Americans and the rest of the world had learned from the experience
in the Bosnian war that ``Milosevic is not to be trusted.
	   ``He can't keep leading the rest of the world by their noses
forever, pretending to negotiate while waging war. The threat that
NATO actually can bomb Serbia is the maximum for now,'' Bekteshi
said.
	   Fehmi Agani, an ethnic Albanian leader, reiterated calls for
NATO to act on the ground as well, because ``all means are
legitimate when it comes to striving for peace in Kosovo.''
	   Pensioner Sadije Dumolli, 59, was relieved and ``more hopeful.
If it were not for NATO, Serbia wouldn't stop ridding Kosovo of its
last Albanian.''
	   Some Kosovo Serbs had other sentimets.
	   ``I simply don't care. If this keeps on much longer, I'll pack
up my stuff and move to Serbia,'' said Branko Rakic, a clerk in a
state-owned company. He said he took part in the war in 1991 in
former Yugoslavia and was ``sick of wars.''
	   Unemployed Biljana Mitrovic, 30, was defiant: ``Let NATO come,
let just a single plane fly over our skies _ we'll all be up to our
knees in blood,'' she said.
	   ``I'll fight the Americans. This is a sovereign country, and
they just can't do as they please,'' said Gojko, a 50-year-old Serb
refusing to give his second name.
	   No reports of fresh violence in Kosovo were available by Monday
noon.
	   Fighting escalated Sunday on several Kosovo front-lines,
reportedly claiming the lives of three ethnic Albanians and two
Serb policemen. Another 10 people were reported wounded. Ethnic
Albanian sources claimed Serbian forces launched 500 grenades
against Albanian villages during the weekend.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement. But since the
crackdown began, the the underground Kosovo Liberation Army
fighting for independence has grown in numbers and popularity among
ethnic Albanians.
	   The KLA currently controls an estimated 40 percent of the
province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   Tens of thousands of people have fled the fighting, at least
13,000 of them crossing the mountainous border into Albania and
another 9,000 fleeing to Montenegro, the other republic with Serbia
that comprise the Yugoslav federation. An estimated 45,000 are
displaced within Kosovo, says the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.

Reform, Conservative Jews accept alternative prayer site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Trying to prevent clashes with ultra-Orthodox
Jews, leaders of the more liberal streams of Judaism on Monday
agreed in principle to hold co-ed prayer services in an area of the
Western Wall not normally used for worship.
	   The Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, is a remnant of the
second Jewish Temple that was destroyed in 70 A.D. by the Romans.
	   Israel's religious establishment, which is exclusively Orthodox,
insists that men and women should pray separately at the Wall, with
a partition dividing the sexes.
	   Leaders of the Reform and Conservative streams of Judaism on
Monday toured four sites near the Wall, accompanied by Finance
Minister Yaacov Neeman, who heads a government committee trying to
mediate between the religious establishment and non-Orthodox Jews.
	   Ultra-Orthodox Jews have repeatedly assaulted Reform and
Conservative Jews in the Western Wall with blows, stones and
garbage because men and women were praying together.
	   Reform leader Rabbi Uri Regev and Conservative leader Rabbi Ehud
Bandel said one of the proposed sites, the Herodian Street, could
be an acceptable compromise. The Herodian Street is an extension of
the Wall, but the view is obscured by a ramp and by large boulders
left behind after the destruction of the Temple.
	   Regev rejected the other three sites because they are adjacent
to the Southern Wall of the Temple Mount.
	   ``We would prefer that a section of the traditional site be set
aside for egalitarian (co-ed) prayers, but the Herodian Street
offers a basis for compromise,'' Regev told The Associated Press.
	   The Israel Antiquities Authority is opposed to any of the
alternative sites being used for prayers because they are part of
an archeological park.
	   The Religious Affairs Ministry boycotted Monday's tour. Ministry
spokesman Yair Wolf said the Herodian Street and the Southern Wall
``are just as holy as the Western Wall.'' Wolf said he did not know
whether the ministry would oppose a compromise.
	   No immediate reaction was available from the Chief Rabbinate.
	   Reform and Conservative Jews take a less strict interpretation
of Jewish law than the Orthodox. In Israel, the Reform and
Conservative movements are small, but in the United States they
have more followers than the Orthodox.

Nigeria's five approved parties seek consensus on transition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The leaders of Nigeria's five
government-approved political parties are huddling this week in
search of consensus on a transition program to civilian rule,
newspapers reported Monday.
	   A weekend meeting among the parties and Nigeria's new military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, dissolved into arguments at times
over election results during the past six months in local councils
and state and national assemblies.
	   Four of the parties have asked for the results to be annulled
while the fifth _ the United Nigeria Congress Party, which scored
well in the polls _ is demanding the results stand, newspapers
said.
	   All three elections were widely criticized. Few Nigerians
bothered to vote in April's National Assembly polls,
	   Disgusted after all five parties nominated the late dictator
Gen. Sani Abacha as their presidential candidate in Aug. 1
elections, only a minuscule percentage of registered voters turned
out.
	   Settling the argument over the elections, though, will allow the
parties to proceed with talks with Abubakar over the transition.
Abubakar has vowed to complete the transition on Oct. 1 as
scheduled, though he has yet to indicate how it could happen.
	   Party leaders will be meeting again with Abubakar on Wednesday.
	   Abubakar is also scheduled to meet with Liberia President
Charles Taylor, who left his battered West African country on
Monday to visit Nigeria.
	   ``The president has been in touch with the new Nigerian head of
state by phone since the death of Abacha,'' a government spokesman
said.
	   Taylor will hold talks with Abubakar and with Abacha's widow.
	   Abubakar came to power early last week, after Abacha died of a
heart attack.
	   Junta officials insist the transition date will stand, but Air
Vice Marshall Mohammed Alfa told reporters Sunday that the date of
the presidential elections ``is still under discussion.''
	   What remains to be seen is not just whether the transition goes
forward, but what form it takes. All five parties operate with
junta backing and often with the military's financial support.
	   Whether, with Abacha's death, they will be able to become truly
independent of the junta remains to be seen.

Seventy-two forest fires registered near Moscow over weekend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MOSB103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unusually hot and dry weather has contributed to
72 forest fires that have flared up in the Moscow region over the
weekend, a news agency said Monday.
	   Temperatures in Moscow during the past five days have been among
the highest for these dates in 100 years, Russia's Meteorology
Service spokesman Anatoly Yakovlev was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   On Sunday, the temperature in central Moscow rose to 34.7
degrees C (95 F), he said.
	   In another central Russian region, a powerful fire has spread
over some 1,000 hectares (2,470 acres) of forests near a military
base. More than 150 firefighters were trying to extinguish the fire
in the Vladimir region, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of
Moscow.
	   In the Moscow region, fires have engulfed a total of 72 hectares
(178 acres) of forests and peat-covered land, ITAR-Tass said.
	   More than 100 firefighters equipped with 35 trucks were trying
to combat the flames, but new fires keep flaring up, the report
said. Authorities have appealed to local residents not to throw lit
cigarettes or matches on the ground, and have warned that even a
spark flying out of a faulty car exhaust pipe can start a fire,
ITAR-Tass said.

Russian companies sign deals to buy Iraqi oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian companies have rushed to take advantage of
the next stage of Iraq's oil-for-food program, signing contracts
for the purchase of 24 million barrels of oil, a news agency
reported on Monday.
	   Russia's Zarubezhneft, Lukoil, Alfa-Eko and several other
companies may also sign other contracts soon to buy more oil from
the Iraqi SOMO state oil trader, the Interfax news agency reported,
citing Russian oil officials.
	   Along with France and China, Russia has taken the bulk of Iraqi
contracts under the previous three phases of the oil-for-food
program that began in December 1996.
	   The program grants an exception to the U.N. trade sanctions,
which were imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990. The
oil-for-food program was intended to soften the impact of sanctions
on ordinary Iraqis.
	   It has allowed Iraqi oil sales worth dlrs 2 billion every six
months, of which dlrs 1.32 billion are earmarked for humanitarian
imports. The rest has been used to compensate the victims of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait and U.N. operations in the country.
	   Iraq has said repeatedly that it will favor countries supporting
its fight against the U.N. embargo. Russia, France and China _ all
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ have strongly
advocated lifting sanctions.
	   Since the program started, France has shipped goods worth dlrs
572 million to Iraq. Russia has come in second, with dlrs 281
million, and China is third with supplies totaling dlrs 174
million.
	   Earlier this month, Russia's Foreign Ministry said it would
``vigorously'' help Russian companies that want to participate in
the oil-for-food program.
	   During the new phase of the plan, Iraq can increase the value of
oil exports to dlrs 5.2 billion. Its imports are expected to reach
dlrs 3 billion.

Government leaders condemn `disgrace' of English troublemakers

 &UR; Eds: Updates with reaction from home secretary

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday condemned as a
``complete disgrace'' the English soccer fans who rampaged in
Marseille on the eve of England's World Cup opener against Tunisia.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and they have just go to put a stop to it.''
	   Blair conceded the violence could harm England's bid to host the
2006 World Cup.
	   ``None of this helps, does it?'' he said. ``So it is important
that it stops now and that these people realize they undermine the
whole country.''
	   In running street battles shown repeatedly on British
television, English and Tunisian fans clashed with each other and
with French police in Marseille on Sunday night. Fifty people,
including 30 Britons, were arrested, and 37 people injured, local
officials said.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw said the blame ``lies fairly and
squarely on English football hooligans and criminals.''
	   Straw said soccer violence had been brought under control at
domestic matches in England but lamented that a ``hard core'' group
of hooligans was stirring up trouble abroad.

United States and Europe `twin pillars' of world stability, says
</HEADLINE>
Blair &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-EU Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair told
fellow European leaders Monday that Asia's financial crisis means
it is vital for the United States and the European Union to serve
as ``twin pillars of stabililty'' in a volatile world economy.
	   ``The world economy is facing its greatest risk for almost two
decades, since the Latin-American crisis,'' Blair said. ``Our
economies will not emerge from this turmoil unaffected. ... Our
task as leaders of the European Union is to lay the basis of the
long period of expansion that the United States has just enjoyed.''
	   Blair, whose remarks were reported by aides, was addressing a
closed session of the 15-nation EU summit, which opened Monday in
the Welsh capital.
	   Blair said he hopes the EU leaders will formally adopt ``action
plans'' on curbing unemployment that each has submitted, as well as
broader economic guidelines incorporating low-inflation,
low-deficit policies.
	   The job plans include tax breaks for employers, state-subsidized
training programs, and changing welfare regulations to make taking
a low-paid job more attractive than welfare.
	   The EU's need for economic stability and growth is spurred both
by Asia's economic crisis and by the introduction of the single
European currency, the euro, which 11 EU members will adopt from
Jan. 1 next year.
	   ``We have to quickly take account of the risks in the Japanese
situation and reflect collectively on the responses needed,''
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said.
	   ``What we must seek first of all is the strongest possible
growth for Europe, because that is the first condition necessary
for a lasting fall in unemployment,'' he added.
	   French plans to create jobs include a 35-hour week, which is at
odds with Blair's view that U.S.-style labor flexibility is vital
for Europe.

	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ Using his one good arm, Weldeslase
Hailu pulled an assault rifle off the stump of his left shoulder,
propped it up against his chest and took aim. His one good eye
sparkled.
	   Weldeslasse lost his left arm and eye to heavy artillery during
the 17-year war his people fought alongside Eritrean rebels to
overthrow Ethiopia's Marxist dictatorship.
	   Now he and many of his fellow wounded veterans are ready to go
back to war, this time to fight Eritrean troops massed along their
common border.
	   ``I want to go the war front to fight but the government won't
let us because we are already wounded,'' said the disappointed
veteran, scars along the right side of his face and mouth twisting
in a bitter smile.
	   ``We fought against the (former regime) not only to end the war
but to bring a better life to our people and recover the economy. I
lost parts of my body for this. But the Eritreans have attacked us
and brought us war.''
	   Since the first border clashes erupted on May 6, Ethiopia and
Eritrea have been locked in a bitter face-off that has shocked and
disappointed the people of both countries.
	   Sporadic fighting on three fronts have left hundreds dead, with
each side blaming the other for the violence.
	   The United States announced Sunday that it had achieved an
agreement from both governments to halt all air attacks, but ground
battles are expected to continue.
	   Drawn by patriotic spirit and fury at Eritrea's bombing of
civilian targets that have claimed at least 48 lives, hundreds of
aging and wounded Ethiopian veterans of the last war have signed up
to fight again.
	   Of the 500 disabled veterans who have come forward in the
northern Tigray region _ home of the majority of the Ethiopian
rebel force that brought Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to power in
1991 _ 200 have been accepted back, said a local official who gave
his name only as Allem.
	   ``They have answered a national call to go to the front and I am
sure they will succeed,'' he said.
	   Men with head wounds, others bound to wheelchairs have come
forward hoping to help defend their country.
	   For some, it's little more than a wish.
	   ``If I was able to walk as I did when I was fighting the (former
regime), I would volunteer to go to the front,'' said Tadele
Gebrekiros, 31, who lost both legs and partial use of both arms
when he stepped on a land mine in 1988.
	   Mehare Gebre Abezgi spent a year learning to walk again after
enemy guns shattered his left calf in 1990. Now 34, the limping
veteran performed his rifle drills Sunday, struggling to get up
from a defensive spread-eagle ground position.
	   ``I know that I am a handicapped soldier, but the Eritreans are
forcing me to rejoin the war effort because they have overrun my
country,'' Mehare said.
	   ``Their actions made me angry because we fought together and
made great history together and then we expected peace and
development and to work together.''
	   Mehare, whose wife is also a wounded former fighter, said his
family had encouraged him to fight again despite his injuries.
	   ``I may not be as strong physically, but my national spirit is
strong,'' he said.
	   Two years after assisting Ethiopian rebels to take control,
Eritrea achieved its 30-year struggle for independence from
Ethiopia. But close relations quickly strained over border and
economic issues that worsened when Eritrea introduced its own
currency last year.
	   Trade between the two countries waned as Ethiopia began moving
goods through the port of Djibouti instead of Eritrea's Assab and
Massawa ports and tensions then spiraled into battle.
	   In Tigray, the fight is personal, with many feeling friends have
turned on them. National feeling is running high and officials say
thousands of former fighters have volunteered and been retrained to
move to the front lines.
	   For the wounded veterans, it's a time of frustrated patriotism
as they helplessly watch former comrades fight their former allies.
	   ``I never expected to fight again,'' said Gebre Amlak, who lost
his left calf and foot in battle in 1988. ``After the war, we had
turned toward development. But now this has happened and I will
fight, not just now, but in the future also to defend my
government.''
	   ``I am ready to give up not just my leg but also my life,'' he
added.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 8th graf to CLARIFY that ad hoc Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal exists &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on the
international community Monday to create a ``bulwark against evil''
by establishing a permanent world criminal court.
	   In opening a U.N. conference to set up the tribunal, he appealed
for a ``court strong and independent enough to carry out its task''
of bringing war criminals and perpetrators of crimes against
humanity to justice.
	   The United States, Russia, China, and France _ four of the five
permanent Security Council members _ have been pushing for stronger
council control over the proposed court's prosecutor. Human rights
advocates say that would cripple the court's independence.
	   ``People all over the world want to know that humanity can
strike back -- that wherever and whenever genocide, war crimes or
other such violations are committed, there is a court before which
the criminal can be held to account,'' Annan told the delegates.
	   ``We have an opportunity that can save lives and serve as a
bulwark against evil.''
	   He later told reporters that it was more important to have a
``credible, competent, independent'' court that may have fewer
signatories than a broadly supported weak one.
	   ''Sooner or later (other nations) will come aboard. If it is
ineffectual, no one gains and in fact this would be a waste of our
time,'' Annan said.
	   Monday brought another reminder of why many say a permanent
court is necessary. NATO forces arrested a Bosnian Serb war crimes
suspect near Sarajevo, accused of atrocities committed at a prison
during the war.
	   A court has been set up on a temporary basis in the Hague for
Yugoslav war crimes. The world tribunal would supersede such
courts.

Yeltsin orders revamping of Interior Ministry troops, traffic
</HEADLINE>
police &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of traffic police reform plan in two
final grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ordered Russia's Interior
Ministry on Monday to sharply cut its forces and carry out other
reforms.
	   Interior Ministry troops will be cut from 250,000 to
120,000-140,000 within two years, Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin told reporters after meeting with the president.
	   The ministry's troops are supposed to help police enforce public
order and intervene in case of mass riots and other disturbances.
They played an active role during the 1994-1996 war to put down
breakaway Chechnya's independence bid.
	   Interior Ministry troops have the same structure and weapons as
the Defense Ministry's ground forces. Stepashin said the reform
will end that ``duplication'' and increase the interior forces'
mobility, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin also issued an order to streamline Russia's traffic
police, long accused of inefficiency and corruption. The reform
will simplify registration rules and other procedures to make
motorists' lives easier, Stepashin said.
	   For example, vehicles that are less than 10 years old will have
to undergo technical checks every five or 10 years, not annually as
now, saving time and reducing opportunities for bribes, the
ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Stepashin as saying.
	   ``The reforms is aimed at protecting those who are behind the
wheel,'' Stepashin said.

EU trade chief says fall of yen will affect yuan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's trade commissioner
warned Monday that the continuing decline of the Japanese yen will
put pressure on nearby China's currency.
	   In turn, the impact of the yen's fall on China's yuan will have
``far reaching consequences for the region and for the world
economy,'' Leon Brittan told delegates at a Brussels seminar on
Japan's future.
	   Japan's economy is officially in recession, following the
release of government statistics earlier this month that showed
negative economic growth in two consecutive quarters.
	   Last week, China's Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said
his government was standing by its policy of maintaining the yuan's
value, even though this is hurting Chinese exports.
	   China's monetary policy ``effectively prevented further
deterioration of the Southeast Asian economy,'' he told
participants at a China-European Union trade seminar in Brussels.
	   The EU is China's third-largest trading partner behind the
United States and Japan. China's exports to the European Union rose
20 percent in 1997 to dlrs 23.81 billion, while imports grew 3.4
percent to dlrs 19.19 billion.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's defense minister publicly rebuked a top
U.S. military commander Monday, accusing NATO of failing to consult
with Moscow on holding air exercises over the Balkans.
	   The rare public clash came as the Russian Foreign Ministry said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's imminent meeting with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow would be ``potentially
decisive'' in defusing the explosive conflict in Kosovo.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev gave visiting Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dressing-down before
reporters. He said that NATO had decided to launch the air
exercises, which are intended to put pressure on Yugoslavia to curb
its forces in Kosovo, only after he had left consultations in
Brussels last week.
	   The Defense Ministry said Monday that Russia had recalled its
military envoy to NATO, Lt.-Gen. Viktor Zavarzin. The move was
apparently to protest the NATO air patrols.
	   In Warsaw, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen responded to
Sergeyev's charges, saying he and other NATO ministers had ``a
number of meetings'' with the Russian minister in Brussels.
	   ``It was very clear NATO expected the air exercises to take
place. ... It should come as no surprise to anyone that they took
place today,'' Cohen said.
	   The Russian government has strongly opposed any direct
intervention in Yugoslavia, contending that all of the diplomatic
options have yet to be exhausted.
	   NATO planes began maneuvers Monday over Albania and Macedonia,
both of which border on Kosovo. The exercise included 80 planes
from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries.
	   ``We specifically underlined the need to find a political
solution, and then, all of a sudden, I find out the next morning
that the exercises are being launched,'' Sergeyev complained.
	   ``And that was a consultative council, supposed to bring a joint
solution. As a soldier, most of all, I value honesty in relations
with colleagues. And I cannot understand what they did to me in
Brussels after I left.''
	   Milosevic is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Monday evening and
meet with Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin is expected to deliver a warning to Milosevic that the
crisis facing him is far more serious than he appears to realize,
said a western official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We place greater hopes on this meeting'' than on the NATO
exercises, said Vladimir Rakhmanin, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry
official, in comments reported by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin was expected to discuss the meeting late Monday in a
phone call to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Shelton said that the possibility of holding military exercises
had been discussed during the two-day consultations between NATO
and Russia, and that they were intended to help persuade both sides
in the conflict to reach a peaceful conclusion.
	   ``That military exercise was designed to simply underscore the
work being done by Presidents Yeltsin and Milosevic,'' Shelton
said.
	   The Foreign Ministry urged the western alliance to take care
that its exercises ``not provoke either the Albanian community of
Kosovo or Belgrade to escalate (tension), and give diplomats the
possibility to work on regulating the Kosovo conflict,'' Rakhmanin
was quoted as saying.

Trial opens in the 1970 killing of 44 protesting shipyard workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Seven former top communist officials went
on trial in a provincial court on Monday, charged in the December
1970 deaths of 44 shipyard workers during a riot police action to
quell wage protests.
	   The Provincial Court in the Baltic port city of Gdansk opened
the case on March 28, 1996, but the trial was delayed by constant
absences of some of the defendants or of their lawyers.
	   The former officials were charged with ordering and directing
the police action that killed 44 people and injured more than
1,000.
	   Last year, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, defense minister at the
time of the killings, and four other officials were exempted from
the trial due to ill health and will be tried separately. In 1981,
Jaruzelski was Poland's leader and ordered the martial law
crackdown on the Solidarity democratic movement.
	   The relatives of the workers, killed in Gdansk, Gdynia, Szczecin
and Elblag, gathered in front of the court building holding their
pictures and banners reading: The Crimes of Communism were
Genocide.
	   Among the defendants are two former communist party politburo
members: Stanislaw Kociolek and Wladyslaw Kruczek.
	   If convicted, the seven face up to life in prison.

Albanians watch NATO planes, some in disbelief.

	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ Albanians, including their refugee
brethren from Kosovo, Monday watched NATO warplanes fly over this
impoverished Balkan nation, and many of them said NATO's show of
power was not enough to stop the bloodshed in the Serbian province.
	   In this village some 22 kilometers (14 miles) northeast of the
town of Bajram Curri, Hivzi Hysa, 42, a refugee from Junik in
Kosovo, said the NATO maneuvers ``are only a signal and nothing
else. Signals are not enough to stop the violence in Kosovo.''
	   ``The Serbs are angry because of the NATO maneuvers,'' said Xhem
Shehu, 34, another Junik refugee. ``That's why the Serb infantry
and their helicopters followed us up to the border last night.''
	   Shehu said that about 3,000 people from Junik and other villages
had been camping up in the mountain for the last two weeks. The
Serbs tracked them down last night with lights from the
helicopters. So they had to flee into Albania.
	   Some 400 people arrived in Padesh early Monday after seven hours
of walking across the mountains. They were mostly women with babies
and elderly people.
	   The rest, Shehu and others said, are still in the mountains,
trapped in the middle of nowhere, because the Serbs are now
patrolling some of the paths refugees have taken to cross the
border.
	   Some of the refugees who could hardly see the high-flying
planes, were scared.
	   Halil Voci, 55, said, ``It's really bad to feel the war so close
by. I just saw one plane in the sky, but we don't want to see them
get down on the ground.''
	   He, too, said, ``It will not be enough just to put NATO planes
on Serb radars. They (NATO) have to intervene with force.''
	   Albania has been pressing for weeks for a NATO presence in its
territory. Authorities said Monday that they expect more NATO
actions to follow.
	   ``Other NATO military moves should follow this one,'' said Sokol
Gjoka, the spokesman of the Albanian Foreign Ministry in Tirana,
where, unlike up north, the planes nearly skimmed rooftops.
	   ``What the hell is going on,'' said Vjollca Beja, 37, who ran
with her four-year-old son to take refuge in a Tirana shop, unaware
that the NATO planes were no threat.
	   ``I thought the war started,'' she added.
	   ``All the world against just one crazy man who won't stop,''
said Bashkim Latifi, 67, a retired teacher, evidently referring to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   He pointed at a group of children who were screaming with joy at
the sight of the planes. ``They think it's a movie,'' he said.

Airlines warn of mass layoffs as strike cripples Norway airports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Airlines warned of mass layoffs Monday as a
strike by workers at key airports went into its fourth day,
grounding nearly all flights and leaving thousands of passengers
stranded.
	   The strike could also threaten Norway's 3-million-barrel-per-day
oil production because helicopters needed to bring fresh crews and
spare parts to North Sea oil platforms cannot fly.
	   More than 230 air traffic controllers and aviation workers
walked out on Friday, after their Academics Union ordered them to
support teachers and health workers striking for better pay.
	   The union rejected an employer's offer for wage hikes averaging
6 percent, and has been gradually stepping up industrial action
that began May 28.
	   Three airlines _ SAS, Braathens and Wideroe _ on Monday notified
nearly 5,000 employees of impending layoffs unless the strike is
settled promptly. The walkouts have closed all airports in southern
Norway, where the vast majority of the country's 4.4 million people
live.
	   ``We're urging people not to travel unless they absolutely have
to,'' said Hanne Bugel, of the Scandinavian Airline System.
	   Airlines have maintained part of their international services by
busing passengers more than four hours to Landvetter Airport in
Goteborg, southwest Sweden.
	   An estimated 50,000 people were affected by the strike at the
weekend, including the Simonsen-Nicolaysen family which spent 48
hours on a 1,350-kilometer (840-mile) trek by road, rail and bus
from their home in northern Norway's Bardufoss to Goteborg.
	   ``We had to get up at 4 a.m. Saturday,'' said Ellen Nicolaysen,
a mother of two small children.
	   ``The buses were overfilled and we had to sit the whole time
with two very irate children on our laps,'' she was quoted as
telling the Verdens Gang newspaper.
	   After years of moderate wage demands, unions are now wanting
wage earners to share in the current economic boom in Norway, the
world's second largest oil exporter.
	   The 240,000-strong Academics Union has 6,000 members on strike,
including teachers, health workers, engineers, and ship's pilots.
	   In a separate strike, 930 state telephone company workers walked
out last weekend, which could disrupt telephone services.
	   About 10,000 transport workers returned to work last week after
winning record pay raises of up to 13.7 percent.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United Nations issued an
emergency appeal Monday for dlrs 7 million to help rebuild homes
devastated by a May 30 earthquake that shattered northern
Afghanistan and killed as many as 5,000 people.
	   The money will be used to ``provide emergency rehabilitation
assistance'' to an estimated 50,000 victims of the magnitude-6.9
quake, according to a U.N. statement issued in neighboring
Pakistan.
	   The earthquake triggered landslides and flattened entire
villages. It was the second to hit the area. A February earthquake
killed 2,300 people and left 8,000 people homeless. Many people
were still trying to rebuild their lives when the May earthquake
struck.
	   The U.N. statement said funds were needed to rebuild an
estimated 8,000 traditional sun-baked mud homes before winter's
``sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfalls.''
	   ``The task needs to start in the next few weeks because it take
two months for the mud to dry out properly,'' it said.
	   Aid workers will provide equipment such as beams and shovels and
also will offer advice on how to build the homes to better
withstand earthquakes and landslides.
	   Meanwhile, the United Nations and the International Red Cross
continue to try to relieve some of the hardships, the most
significant being a lack of clean drinking water. The landslides
triggered by the earthquake wiped out wells.
	   According to the Russian Emergencies Ministry on Monday, two
helicopters delivered 9 tons of emergency aid on behalf of the Red
Cross to villages in the area. The aid was airlifted from the
Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe to northern Afghanistan, the
ministry said.
	   Also, two newly arrived U.N. helicopters brought in water and
sanitation equipment Monday to clean up the water supplies.
	   Food convoys are attempting to reach the region overland from
Dushanbe. The United Nations and Red Cross also have recruited
about 1,000 donkeys to aid in the distribution effort.

Mother bears healthy quintuplets in northern Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A 25-year-old Egyptian housewife gave birth
to quintuplets Monday in a normal delivery that lasted one hour,
and all babies were reported healthy, hospital officials said.
	   The two boys and three girls were under observation in
incubators as they were delivered after a 27-week pregnancy, which
is normal for quintuplet births, the officials said.
	   The normal gestation period for a single baby is 40 weeks.
	   Monday's births took place in a hospital in the village of Itai
el-Baroud, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) northwest of Cairo in
the northern Biheira province. Since the hospital there had only
two incubators, three babies were taken to the nearby Kafar
el-Zaiyat town, the officials said.
	   The mother, Fatihya Kemal Mahmoud, was in good condition, said
the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   No other details were immediately available.

Thai soldiers allowed to stay up past bedtime to watch World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai Army has agreed to allow
conscripts to stay up late to watch television broadcasts of World
Cup soccer games.
	   Army Commander Gen. Chettha Thanajaro personally approved the
decision to allow soldiers to stay up past their normal bedtime of
9 p.m. to watch the games, which are popular with all segments of
Thai society, a military spokesman said Monday.
	   The soldiers will not be permitted to stay up all night,
however. Matches being played at 2 a.m. Thai time will be recorded
for viewing at a more appropriate hour.
	   Thai newspaper reports quoted officers as saying that conscripts
were pleased with the late-night viewing policy.
	   They also said that it fostered good relations between enlisted
men and their officers by letting then share their enthusiasm for
the sport.
	   One officer was quoted as saying the army was not worried that
the men would gamble on the games because they had no money to bet.
The military takes care of conscripts' necessities, but pays them a
pittance.

World Cup: unconvincing win sobers Yugoslavs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT GALMIER, France (AP) _ An unconvincing 1-0 victory against
underdogs Iran has sobered up the highly-praised Yugoslav World Cup
team and has given their main group rivals, the United States,
higher hopes of reaching the next round.
	   ``There was nothing good about our play yesterday,'' Yugoslav
coach Slobodan Santrac said Monday. ``If we want to beat the
Germans or even the Americans, we will have to correct a lot of
things.''
	   For Yugoslavia, Iran was the easy team to beat in Group F, which
also includes the United States and Germany. Yugoslavia's match
against the Americans, on June 25, is likely to decide which of the
two teams advances from the preliminary round besides highly
favored Germany.
	   Yugoslavia's star-studded team, with players that have shone in
their top European clubs, struggled both in the midfield and in the
attack against Iran Sunday. In the end, one of Sinisa Mihajlovic's
trademark free kicks gave Yugoslavia the only goal in the opening
match of the group.
	   ``We had a big problem penetrating Iran's well-organized
defense,'' said star midfielder Vladimir Jugovic. ``We have to draw
lesson from our play soonest, or say good bye to the World Cup.''
	   There was no shortage of self-criticism among the Yugoslav
players Monday.
	   ``There are no easy matches at the World Cup as most of the
favorites have struggled against the so-called underdogs in the
first round,'' said Yugoslav team captain Dragan Stojkovic.
	   ``Our next game against Germany could psychologically be easier
for us as we are not considered favorites. But then we have to face
the Americans, again from the position of favorites,'' Stojkovic
added.
	   ``In our opening match against Iran, we had a tremendous desire
to show the world how good we are after eight years of absence from
the World Cup,'' Stojkovic said, referring to the 1992 U.N.
sanctions that banned Yugoslav sportsmen from official competitions
for their government's fomenting of Bosnian and Croatian wars.
	   ``That desire worked against us in the Iranian match.''
	   Stojkovic, considered the architect of Yugoslav midfield play,
was replaced by the 19-year-old rising star Dejan Stankovic in the
second half. Later, another youngster, the 20-year-old Perica
Ognjenovic, went in for former Aston Villa striker Savo Milosevic.
	   The two Red Star Belgrade talents increased the pace of the
game, leading to Mihajlovic's goal in the 73rd minute.
	   ``One positive thing from the Iranian game is that Stankovic and
Ognjenovic have shown there will be tough completion for every
position in the Yugoslav team from now onwards,'' Santrac said.

Two more charged in German kidnapping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia _ Two more suspects were arrested in
connection with the kidnapping of a German businessman's son, a
Slovenian official said Monday.
	   The pair, who are both from Slovenia, was arrested Sunday
evening in the capital, Ljubljana, Interior Ministry spokesman
Miran Koren said.
	   No other details on the arrests were available Monday afternoon.
	   Four other people have been taken into custody since 24-year-old
Bodo Janssen was freed unharmed Sunday after police stormed a house
in Hamburg, Germany.
	   Janssen had been held since June 6, and his kidnappers had
demanded ransom of 10 million marks (dlrs 6 million).
	   Ransom of 3 million marks (1.8 million) was paid Saturday, with
the money transferred to the kidnappers on the Austrian side of the
border with Slovenia, Koren said.
	   Two of the suspects were arrested late Sunday by Austrian police
on a train near the city of Klagenfurt, and part of the ransom was
recovered, the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   Two other suspects were arrested Sunday in Hamburg.

Yeltsin to chair Cabinet meeting on anti-crisis program

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will chair an expanded
Cabinet meeting next week on measures to combat Russia's financial
crisis and stabilize the markets, the presidential press service
said Monday.
	   The June 23 meeting will also be attended by members of both
houses of parliament, the press service said, according to the
Interfax news agency. On Monday, Yeltsin discussed the measures
with the speaker of parliament's upper house, Yegor Stroyev,
Interfax said.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko will present the
government's anti-crisis program at an economic forum in St.
Petersburg on Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted the
speaker of the parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov, as
saying.
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, had earlier been
scheduled to discuss the anti-crisis program on Wednesday, and
Kiriyenko was expected to attend. But the debate has been called
off, Seleznyov said, without providing a new date.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said Monday that the
government is dealing with a ``very difficult situation,''
including the financial crisis, the chronic problems of a
debt-ridden economy and the need for reforming the tax system.
	   ``All these problems have fallen on the government like a
snowball,'' Nemtsov was quoted as saying by Interfax. ``If we don't
solve these problems during the summer, things will get very hot in
the fall.''
	   The collapse of Russia's financial markets late last month
prompted fears of a devaluation of the national currency, the
ruble, which would lead to a sharp rise in prices. Russian
officials worry that inflation, combined with the government's
continuing inability to pay state workers their wages on time,
could lead to mass protests.
	   The stock market fall has been slowed slightly by rumors of an
emergency bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Although the IMF and Russian government officials say the
country is capable of overcoming the crisis on its own, many market
participants believe a substantial aid package involving the IMF is
vital to regain market confidence.
	   The Finance Ministry said Monday that Deputy Finance Minister
Oleg Vyugin, who is in charge of the country's talks with the IMF,
visited the fund's headquarters in Washington last week.
	   ``It was part of the preparation for the (release) of the next
dlrs 670 million,'' said ministry spokesman Oleg Zhukov, adding
that the IMF board will meet Thursday to discuss that installment
on an existing dlrs 9.2 billion loan.
	   Zhukov denied that Vyugin had held talks with IMF officials
about a new loan.
	   The Russian Trading System fell 4.07 percent by midday Monday _
about the average Russian stocks have been falling in the past few
days.

Botha refuses to apologize for apartheid wrongs

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Defiant to the last, ageing
apartheid-era President P.W. Botha refused at the close of his
trial Monday to apologize for human rights abuses committed during
his rule.
	   Botha, 82, issued a statement through his lawyer, Ernst
Penzhorn, that he had nothing to be sorry about.
	   ``He is not aware of anything that he must apologize for,''
Penzhorn told reporters.
	   Botha was on trial for snubbing the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which is probing apartheid crimes. If found guilty,
Botha faces an unspecified fine or two years in jail.
	   In closing arguments, prosecutor Bruce Morrison said Botha,
nicknamed the ``Big Crocodile'' for his stubborn political style,
had deliberately defied the commission.
	   ``His refusal to attend is the result of a willful and
deliberate defiance,'' Morrison said told Judge Victor Lugaju.
	   Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu, chairman of the Truth
Commission, had appealed for Botha to publicly apologize for the
brutalities of his government. Tutu had said on June 5 that such an
act of contrition would help heal racial problems still plaguing
the country.
	   Penzhorn said Botha had been ``astonished'' by Tutu's statement.
	   Botha ignored three subpoenas to appear before Tutu's
commission, which wanted to quiz him about his role as head of the
State Security Council, a body that coordinated a security
crackdown on anti-apartheid groups.
	   The trial itself often resembled a commission hearing, as
witnesses provided evidence the State Security Council sanctioned,
by using words like ``eliminate,'' the killings of opponents of
white rule.
	   Some of the most powerful testimony came from Col. Eugene de
Kock, a former police death squad commander serving 212 years on
jail, who said he never doubted his killing spree was approved by
the rulers of the apartheid governments.
	   Botha was head of state for 11 years through some of the worst
violence of the apartheid struggle. He was replaced in 1989, after
suffering a stroke, by F.W. de Klerk, who began reforms that
culminated in 1994's first all-race elections.

Top Romanian politician admits working for Securitate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A leading politician on Monday
admitted working for the Securitate, the oppressive secret police
of former communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, but claimed he
never harmed anyone.
	   Democratic Party deputy Adrian Vilau said that as a student he
collaborated with the Securitate for three years in the 1980s,
informing on anyone who ``would have prejudiced the state's
interests.''
	   As an informer he would have had to snitch on friends, family or
fellow students. However, Vilau told the private news agency
Mediafax that he was not ashamed of what he did, saying he never
harmed anyone's life of career.
	   The Democratic Party, a member in the ruling coalition, said
Sunday that because Vilau had hidden his past it would no longer
allow him to head a commission which controls foreign intelligence.
He remains a party member.
	   Nine years after the fall of communism, Romanians are still
obsessed by the Securitate which controlled people's lives before
1989.
	   The Securitate files are under lock and key and only a handful
of people have admitted working for the organization. One fourth of
the adult population was said to have collaborated with the
Securitate.
	   Vilau's admission, which came after a journalist brought
evidence to the party, is the first time any politician has been
punished by his party for working for the secret police.
	   Romania, Russia, Albania and Yugoslavia are the only countries
in the former Soviet bloc which did have not opened their communist
secret service archives.
	   Parliament is debating a draft law which would make public
officials' names who had worked for the secret police, but would
not punish them.

Colorful lawmaker given suspended sentence, barred from office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUGANO, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swiss state lawmaker was given a
15-month suspended sentence Monday after being found guilty on
charges related to drug-dealing, forging money and abetting armed
robbery.
	   Alessandra Balestra, a former star of Italian pornographic films
popularly known as ``Porno Sandy,'' was also barred from holding
political office for five years.
	   Appearing before a judge in Lugano, she admitted to dealing with
360 grams (12.7 ounces)of cocaine and 90 ecstasy pills. She said
she had acted ``out of love.''
	   Balestra, 22, elected to the Ticino canton (state) parliament in
early 1996 as a representative of the right-wing Lega dei Ticinesi
party, is registered as having no official residence and had not
appeared in public for almost two years.
	   She said she now leaves a ``respectable life'' in neighboring
Italy and has given up drugs.
	   In mid-1996, she was held in preventive detention for several
weeks after being arrested in possession of cocaine near Zurich.
	   She was also accused of putting into circulation a forged 1,000
Swiss franc (dlrs 690) bill.
	   On her return to Lugano, she was arrested for abetting an armed
attack committed by a friend. She had kept the pistol used for the
crime at her home.
	   State Prosecutor Luca Marcellini told the judge Balestra had
been used by drug dealers, porn producers and politicians, and
should never have been put forward for the local legislature.
	   Citing her ``limited capacity of criminal responsibility,'' he
called for a 16-month suspended sentence.
	   Balestra has ignored repeated pleas from her party to give up
her seat in the parliament.
	   She claimed she had left Lugano because Lega president Giuliano
Bignasca had demanded sexual favors for providing her with an
apartment to make pornographic films and other services.

	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ Albanians, including refugees from
neighboring Kosovo province, watched Monday as NATO warplanes flew
over Albania where many said the show of power was not enough to
stop the bloodshed in the southern Serbian province.
	   In this village some 22 kilometers (14 miles) northeast of the
town of Bajram Curri, Hivzi Hysa, 42, a Kosovo refugee, said the
NATO maneuvers ``are only a signal and nothing else. Signals are
not enough to stop the violence in Kosovo.''
	   ``The Serbs are angry because of the NATO maneuvers,'' said Xhem
Shehu, 34, another refugee. ``That's why the Serb infantry and
their helicopters followed us up to the border last night.''
	   Much of the world has been aghast as the Serb-led army and
police cracked down on dissent in Kosovo, inhabited mostly by
ethnic Albanians. More than 300 people have been killed and
thousands have fled across the border into northern Albania.
	   Shehu said about 3,000 refugees camped in the mountain for the
last two weeks until Serbs tracked them down Sunday night with
lights from the helicopters. So they had to flee into Albania.
	   Some 400 people arrived in Padesh early Monday after seven hours
of walking across the mountains. They were mostly women with babies
and elderly people.
	   The rest, Shehu and others said, are trapped in the mountains
because the Serbs are now patrolling some of the paths refugees
have taken to cross the border.
	   Some of the refugees who could hardly see the high-flying planes
were pensive.
	   ``It's really bad to feel the war so close by,'' said Halil
Voci, 55.`` I just saw one plane in the sky, but we don't want to
see them get down on the ground.''
	   Albania has been pressing for weeks for a NATO presence in its
territory. Authorities said Monday that they expect more NATO
action to follow.
	   ``Other NATO military moves should follow this one,'' said Sokol
Gjoka, the spokesman of the Albanian Foreign Ministry in Tirana,
where, unlike up north, the planes nearly skimmed rooftops.
	   ``What ... is going on,'' said Vjollca Beja, 37, who ran with
her 4-year-old son to take refuge in a Tirana shop, unaware that
the NATO planes were no threat. ``I thought the war started.''
	   ``All the world against just one crazy man who won't stop,''
said Bashkim Latifi, 67, a retired teacher, evidently referring to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   He pointed at a group of children who were screaming with joy at
the sight of the planes. ``They think it's a movie,'' he said.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO jets streaking through the skies
over Macedonia in a show of force designed to stop fighting in
neighboring Kosovo province were seen Monday as a sign of stability
and security.
	   ``The exercise will contribute to regional stability and could
stop the Kosovo conflict from spreading to Macedonia,'' government
spokesman Zoran Ivanov said.
	   For Macedonia, which has no air force, the 85 jets were the
first clear sign that the West wants to halt fighting in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, bordering this nation of 2.2 million.
	   Much of the world has been aghast as the Serb-led army and
police cracked down on dissent in Kosovo, inhabited mostly by
ethnic Albanians. More than 300 people have been killed and
thousands have fled across the border into northern Albania.
	   ``This fighting is very scary, but NATO reacted at the right
time and in the right place to show some stubborn politicians that
no ideology is more valuable than people,'' said Liliana Hristovam,
45, an unemployed economist.
	   For about three hours Monday, NATO planes crossed the skies,
passing within a few kilometers of Kosovo. The airplanes were not
visible from the capital, Skopje, but local media carried regular
updates on the airplanes' progress.
	   Skopje residents said the flights helped calm fears. But they
said Macedonia's own ethnic Albanians, who make up 23 percent of
the population, may now push for separation.
	   ``There is a 50-50 chance that the ethnic Albanians here will
try for independence,'' said waiter Sash Andonovski, 28.
	   He said local Albanians may interpret the NATO flights as
backing for the Kosovo Liberation Army, formed last year to fight
for independence from Yugoslavia.
	   Rizan Sulejmani, a member of parliament for the ethnic Albanian
Party for Democracy and Prosperity, rejected fears of separatism.
	   A senior western diplomat also downplayed ethnic tensions.
Albanians in Macedonia, ``hold one protest every three months in
solidarity with their brethren in Kosovo. At that rate, the tension
certainly isn't bubbling over.''

UNHCR says helicopters may be used to help Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Helicopters may be used to airlift aid to refugees
fleeing fighting between Serbs and Albanian independence seekers in
the explosive Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency
said Monday.
	   UNHCR may also ask NATO to step in to move supplies by air from
the Albanian capital Tirana to the refugees in the remote north of
the country, agency spokesman Kris Janowski said.
	   The moves are being considered by UNHCR to overcome serious
difficulties being encountered in moving supplies to the region by
land.
	   Aid workers battling to help the thousands of refugees from
fighting between Serb government forces and the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army have complained that the aid transports are too
slow.
	   The drive from Tirana to the northern districts of Tropoje and
Bajram Curri, where some 13,000 people have taken refuge, takes a
full day and sometimes even longer, Janowski said.
	   The journey by trucks carrying plastic sheeting, food and other
supplies is made hazardous by bad-quality roads and armed bandits
further north.
	   Three aid lorries have already been looted and no journeys are
being made Monday because of fears they could be attacked, Janowski
said. ``There are a lot of people around there with guns,'' he
said. ``It's an unsafe area.''
	   UNHCR is trying to get police escorts to accompany future
convoys. The lack of lorries is also causing problems, said the
spokesman.
	   Details of the operations involving helicopters and NATO are
still being worked out, said Janowski. UNHCR will continue to rely
on road transport for the ``next few days'' at least. ``It's not
going to happen immediately,'' he said.
	   NATO is already involved in an operation to fly supplies to
Tirana from the Bosnian city of Sarajevo, which began Saturday.
	   On Monday, eighty-four aircraft from 13 of NATO's 16 member
countries conducted several hours of exercises to demonstrate to
Yugoslavia how quickly and powerfully the Western alliance can
deploy its forces.

	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ NATO fighter jets and
reconnaissance aircraft roared into the sky early Monday, hoping to
intimidate Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by showing him how
quickly and powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces
if needed.
	   Eighty-five aircraft from the United States and 12 other of
NATO's 16 member countries staged fours hours of aerial exercises
over Albania and Macedonia, which border Yugoslavia.
	   ``This is an exercise intended to demonstrate the alliance's
commitment to peace and stability in the region and the alliance's
ability to project power into the region,'' said Lt. Gen. Michael
Short, commander of NATO air forces in the alliance's southern
Europe division.
	   After the aircraft finished their mission, Short said:
``Everything went as it was expected to.''
	   Much of the world has been aghast as Milosevic's Serb-led army
and police cracked down on dissent in Kosovo province, inhabited
mostly by ethnic Albanians. More than 300 people have been killed
and thousands have fled across the border into northern Albania.
	   Western leaders want to halt the violence. But they do not want
to be seen giving comfort to the Kosovo Liberation Army, a group
that is fighting for independence of the province and which the
alliance does not support.
	   The planes began departing just before 8 a.m. (about (0550 GMT)
Monday, leaving from bases in Italy, Greece, France, Germany,
Britain, the Netherlands, as well as from ships in the Adriatic
Sea. Support planes, including refueling tankers, already were in
the air.
	   First of the 24 aircraft departing from Aviano were two American
F-16s, followed by four Spanish F-18s, a tanker and another
half-dozen American F-16s.
	   NATO's air power exercise shows alliance unity on halting the
Kosovo crisis and the ability to act with ``significant lethal
capability'' should that be necessary, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said Monday.
	   The fighting in Kosovo has sparked alarm that the violence could
spread south to Albania and Macedonia, which agreed to let their
territory be used for the exercises.
	   Short would not say just how close the allied planes will come
to the Yugoslav border. But Col. Emerson Gardner, aboard the USS
Wasp in the Adriatic, said: ``We will be close enough that the
Serbs will know NATO will be there.''
	   Said Short: ``We will do nothing in this exercise to provoke a
response from the federal republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   All NATO members sent aircraft except Iceland and Luxembourg,
which have no air forces, and Canada, which could not deploy planes
to Europe on such short notice.
	   Exercise Determined Falcon was ordered Thursday by NATO defense
ministers, who also ordered a study of a wide range of options,
including direct intervention in Yugoslavia with air and ground
forces.
	   On Monday, as reporters watched, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev publicly rebuked U.S. Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, accusing NATO of failing to consult with
Moscow on holding air exercises over the Balkans.
	   But Cohen insisted that he and other NATO ministers had ``a
number of'' meetings last week with Sergeyev at NATO headquarters
in Brussels.
	   ``It was very clear NATO expected the air exercises to take
place,'' Cohen said.
	   The rare public clash came as the Russian foreign ministry said
Milosevic's meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow
would be ``potentially decisive'' in defusing the explosive
conflict in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic is in Moscow on Monday and Tuesday, and Yeltsin has
promised to use what influence he has to defuse the situation in
Kosovo.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed any direct intervention in
Yugoslavia, saying all diplomatic options have yet to be exhausted.
	   Russia's defense ministry, without elaborating, said Monday that
Moscow recalled its military envoy to NATO.
	   The Russian foreign ministry urged the Western alliance to take
care that its exercises ``not provoke either the Albanian community
of Kosovo or Belgrade into escalating (tension), and to give
diplomats the possibility to work on regulating the Kosovo
conflict,'' Vladimir Rakhmanin, a high-ranking ministry official,
was quoted as saying.

World Cup: France guards against concentration lapse ahead of Saudi
</HEADLINE>
game &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ The brief respite from the World
Cup, spending time with the wife and family, is over, and the
French know they must be wary of a motivated Saudi Arabia on
Thursday.
	   ``We have to be on guard. It's like this that the worst
accidents happen,'' coach Aime Jacquet said Monday.
	   On top of that, starting striker Stephane Guivarc'h is certain
to miss the game with a knee injury.
	   France is coming off a comfortable and confidence-building 3-0
victory over South Africa while Saudi Arabia already has its back
against the wall following an opening 1-0 loss to Denmark. Two of
four teams advance from Group C.
	   ``We shouldn't have the idea that the match against the Saudis
is already won,'' defender Laurent Blanc said.
	   The Saudis know about coming back. Four years ago at the World
Cup in the United States _ after allowing two second-half goals in
a 2-1 loss to the Netherlands, they surprised the world and Belgium
with a 1-0 victory that allowed them to reach the second round in
their World Cup debut.
	   So France has to stay at its physical peak throughout the first
round, said Jacquet.
	   ``If you're below your best, you can get a slap in the face from
anyone,'' said the coach.
	   So it's up to Jacquet to keep the team alert _ and insisting on
running in the driving rain and cold at their training camp
certainly has kept everybody awake.
	   ``The value of training can make the difference here. This
weather is good for us,'' he said.
	   Tactical preparations for the Saudi game will start Tuesday, two
days ahead of the clash at the 80,000-seat Stade de France.
	   While Jacquet considered the two days since Friday's victory
over South Africa a nice break to meet up with family and friends,
his players begged to disagree.
	   ``We were training the next day. That's no break, we hardly had
time to catch our breath,'' Blanc said.
	   Guivarc'h didn't train with the squad Monday, nursing his left
knee with some bicycle exercises and will come back at the earliest
for the Denmark game on June 24. Fellow striker David Trezeguet was
still out with a hurt left ankle but would be available for the
Saudi match, Jacquet said.

	   EDARAN Otomobil Nasional Bhd's (EON) non-motoring activities
have now caught up with its Proton sales to contribute almost
equally to profits as car sales continue to drop.
	   Its chairman Tan Sri Mohd Saleh Sulong said the national car
distributor is maintaining its outlook of a 60 per cent drop in
sales volume this year.
	   ``As much as ours is a motor company, we cannot be solely
dependent on the motor activities. But profits for the 1998
financial year are likely to be lower than 1997,'' he said after
EON's annual general meeting in Petaling Jaya yesterday.
	   The group's 4.9 per cent drop in pre-tax profit for the 1997
financial year to RM669.7 million was attributed mainly to a
decline in earnings from its motor operations, which at that time
accounted for 84.5 per cent of the group's earnings.
	   ``It's quite evident now that our involvement in the financial
services sector has helped prop up our group results,'' said Saleh.
	   EON's banking and financial services sector contributed 10.8 per
cent to earnings during 1997.
	   With demand dropping and customers switching to cars without
accessories, both EON and its vendors' earnings are affected, but
it's a trade-off that Saleh is resigned to.
	   ``We decided that since people are switching to cheaper cars
then one way is to delete the accessories,'' he said.
	   Its best selling variant is now the basic Proton Iswara Aeroback
that comes without most accessories and there is a backlog of about
6,000 orders.
	   ``It's either this or that. If we insist they buy our
accessories, then the volume may suffer. Prices are unlikely to be
reduced any further.
	   ``We have come to a stage where we have run out of things to
delete,'' he said.
	   Saleh said EON and Proton, which manufactures the cars, will
continue to support their vendors to ensure their survival.
	   He also said the situation is still ``not that bad'' as feedback
shows that many customers still want the optional accessories.

	   BEIJING and Washington are expected to announce their commitment
to ending the regional economic crisis at the Sino-US summit later
this month.
	   United States President Bill Clinton will once again praise the
mainland for its role in helping to ease the economic crisis, and
affirm that Beijing has acted as a responsible regional economic
powerhouse, diplomatic sources say.
	   In a joint statement to be released after the summit, the US
will recognise China as a ``strategic partner'' in the sense that
they will have joined hands to safeguard regional financial
security.
	   It is expected that US intervention in stabilising regional
financial security will help raise the mainland's international
credibility, which will in the long run improve major international
ratings pertaining to Beijing's performance and reliability.
	   Furthermore, Washington will grant more export quotas to a
number of key manufacturing industries, the sources say.
	   Mr Clinton is expected to lift an embargo on key computer
technology.
	   In return, China will announce after the summit that it will
lower its tariffs this year.
	   The reductions will be in line with a three-year schedule for
lowering tariffs to levels of 15 and 20 per cent.
	   Beijing is expected to sign contracts worth billions of yuan for
planes, bio-medicine, cars and digital cameras.
	   China has been under pressure not to devalue the yuan in the
fear that it may set off further economic turmoil.
	   Beijing is seeking an assurance from Washington that it will
intervene to stabilise the yen should the Japanese currency
continue to fall.
	   Beijing is worried by the lack of concrete measures taken by to
Tokyo to arrest its currency crisis.
	   President Jiang Zemin will ask Mr Clinton for the US to offer a
helping hand in such emergency situations, sources say.
	   US participation is essential if Japan is going to be persuaded
to take more forceful measures to stabilise the yen.
	   There are fears that should it fall further it may trigger
another round of regional currency devaluations.
	   According to sources, although Beijing has tried to work out a
timetable for entry to the World Trade Organisation, this has not
materialised.
	   The New York Times confirmed on Sunday that Washington and
Beijing ware negotiating an agreement to refrain from targeting
each other with their nuclear weapons.
	   Citing senior US officials, the newspaper said earlier attempts
on retargeting the missiles failed when China insisted on a mutual
pledge that neither side would resort to nuclear weapons first in
the event of a crisis.

	   BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Sunday reiterated the
demand for scrapping the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) agreement
saying the government should act considering the spontaneous
participation of the lakhs of people' in the long march to the CHT.
	   Briefing newsmen at a city hotel, Deputy Leader of the
Opposition in Parliament Prof AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury and the BNP
Secretary General said the spontaneous participation of the lakhs
of people' in the long march from across the country was the first
such biggest gathering of people since the liberation of
Bangladesh.
	   The news briefing was arranged to explain the background of the
long march and to thank the journalists for their painful journey'
to cover the long march.

Noman, Selima Rahman, Ashraf Hossain, Sadek Hossain Khoka, MP,
Mirza Abbas, Amanullah Aman, MP, and Nazimuddin Alam, MP were among
those present at the news briefing
	   Mannan Bhuiyan said if the government failed to accept the
demand of the people, tough programmes would be announced one after
another until the beginning of a mass upsurge ``to unseat the
government and save the country and the people from its clutches''.
	   Replying to a question about when a mass upsurge will begin, the
BNP leader said: ``Mass upsurge can never be created at a fixed
time or date. It's a continuous process.'' He said they were
working to unite the people against of the government and build up
the mass upsurge.
	   He also said that as part of the movement, the opposition has
called a country-wide dawn-to-dusk hartal on June 18 to protest
against the CHT accord and the laws passed in parliament for
implementation of the agreement.
	   He said, the hartal has been called also to protest the
governments ``failure in improving the national economy and solving
the gas, electricity and water crises.'' He said demonstration day
would be observed on June 22 adding the BNP did not give any
programme on the inaugural day of the Jamuna Bridge on June 23.
	   Mannan Bhuiyan thanked the people and all concerned for making
the long march a success despite the provocation and obstacles. He
also alleged that many people from the CHT who joined the long
march came under attack. He criticised the government for putting
up barricades in Kanchpur bridge and attacking long marchers at
various places.

	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ A representative of Russian
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky was in critical condition
Wednesday after surgery for gunshot wounds.
	   Alexander Saydakov was shot in the chest, neck and head Friday
in the breakaway region of Trans-Dniestr.
	   Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party said the shooting was
politically motivated, but police said it was connected to
Saydakov's real estate businesses.
	   Saydakov underwent surgery on Monday, said government officials
in Trans-Dniestr.
	   Saydakov, who was a deputy and a transportation minister for in
Trans-Dniestr, is one of the best known businessman in the region
with prosperous building and real estate investments. He is a local
Liberal Democratic Party leader.
	   Trans-Dniestr broke away in 1990, fearing Moldova planned to
unite with Romania. Moldova was part of Romania before World War
II.

Pakistan wants probe into death in India of militant leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's Foreign Ministry called
for an investigation Monday into the death of a Kashmiri leader in
Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Mohammed Ramzan Wani, 68, died Sunday. India says Wani died in a
shootout with police, according to the foreign ministry statement.
	   Pakistan, however, accused India of killing Wani, who led
Kashmir's Jamaat-e-Islami party, an orthodox Muslim organization
often accused of backing Muslim militants fighting Indian soldiers
in Kashmir.
	   The Jamaat-e-Islamic party also operates in Pakistan. It is a
strong supporter of Kashmiri militants and is believed to be
providing them with money and weapons.
	   Since 1989, a bloody secessionist uprising has been raging in
Indian-held Kashmir. Militants are demanding either outright
independence or union with Islamic Pakistan.
	   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training militants, an
accusation Islamabad routinely denies.
	   Kashmir has been a traditional trouble spot on the Asian
subcontinent. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir
and a third war over Bangladesh or what was then East Pakistan.
	   The dispute over Kashmir has topped the agenda of international
forums since both Pakistan and India tested nuclear devices last
month and declared themselves nuclear weapons states.
	   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub earlier warned that
another conflagration on the subcontinent could escalate into a
nuclear war.
	   The foreign ministry in its statement issued Monday flayed
accused India's Hindu nationalist government of a ``campaign of
repression against the innocent people of Jammu and Kashmir.''

	   The leaders of Sramik Karmachary Oikyo Parishad Sunday at a
meeting said the proposed new budget would create negative impact
on the low income group because of the extension of the VAT net on
more consumer items.
	   The central leaders of the Sramik Karmachary Oikyo Parishad
(SKOP), the apex body of 17 national trade union federations
including labour fronts of the ruling Awami League and the
opposition BNP and Jatiya Party, made this observation after
evaluating the proposed new budget.
	   Held at its Topkhana office last evening, the meeting was
presided over by Majibur Rahman Bhuiyan, said a statement signed by
its coordinator Dr Wazedul Islam Khan.
	   The SKOP leaders were critical of the budget for its omission of
fresh allocation to the public sector industries for wages and
salary, which is likely to be increased after the implementation of
the new Wages and Productivity Commission (WPC) Awards this year.
	   ``The omission of budgetary allocation for wages and salary in
the public sector has created uncertainty about the future of the
proposed WPC,'' the meeting said.
	   ``The budgetary direction for sale of the loss-incurring state
owned enterprises would not solve the problems, rather it will
reduce industrial production on the one hand and create
unemployment on the other,'' it said and suggested the government
for initiative in making these factories profitable.
	   The meeting also recommended for a higher import duty on foreign
commodities for the sake of domestic industry.

Japanese lower house approves supplemental budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The lower house of Parliament approved a 4.65
trillion yen (dlrs 32 billion) supplemental budget Monday to help
pay for tax cuts and public spending intended to lift Japan out of
recession.
	   The budget cleared the lower house with wide support. In
addition to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic
Party, which holds a majority there, the Social Democratic Party
and the New Party Sakigake voted in favor.
	   The money will be used to pay for part of the government's 16
trillion yen (dlrs 110 billion) economic stimulus package.
	   The budget was sent to the upper house for deliberation, but
Monday's passage in the more-powerful lower house effectively meant
the bill has already become law.
	   The upper house was expected to approve the budget later this
week but even if that chamber rejected the budget, it would
automatically be enacted in 20 days under laws giving the lower
house the final say on budget legislation.
	   The budget plan will fund a wide range of projects, including
826.5 billion yen (dlrs 5.7 billion) to build telecommunications
infrastructure and promote technology.
	   According to government estimates, the spending plan would boost
the country's combined regional and national budget deficit to 6.7
percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year.
	   Originally, the ministry had forecast that the country's
combined fiscal deficit would come to 4.7 percent of GDP. The
deficit last year was estimated at 5.9 percent.
	   Legislators hope the extra government spending will kick start
the sputtering economy.
	   Gross domestic product figures released Friday showed that Japan
is in the midst of its deepest recession in more than 50 years.
	   In 1997, the world's second-largest economy recorded its worst
year since the end of World War II, contracting 0.7 percent, the
Economic Planning Agency said.

Burundi's political leaders begin peace talks in Tanzania

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ For the first time in five years,
leaders of Burundi's antagonistic political parties met Monday to
discuss ways of ending violence that has claimed hundreds of
thousands of lives in their homeland.
	   ``This is a historic chance for the people of Burundi,'' said
Tanzania's President Benjamin Mkapa in his keynote address.
	   The meeting was convened by former Tanzania President Julius
Nyerere, who has been mandated by the Organization of African Unity
to mediate.
	   Mkapa said the meeting is testimony to the need to end violence
that has plagued the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority since
Burundi's independence from Belgium in 1962.
	   At least 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
since the latest round of bloodletting began in October 1993 with
the assassination by Tutsi paratroopers of the country's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu.
	   Former Burundian President Jean-Batiste Bagaza, who was ousted
in President Pierre Buyoya's first coup of 1987, summed up the
optimistic mood of most participants.
	   ``Burundi should be united,'' said Bagaza, a Tutsi. ``Those who
were enemies should be friends of tomorrow and sit together and
search for a lasting solution.''
	   But Leonard Nyangoma, a Hutu and leader of the Council for the
Defense of Democracy, a group waging war against Burundi's army,
was still saber-rattling.
	   ``If peace fails, we are going to war,'' Nyangoma declared.
	   He had earlier rejected Nyerere's request for a cease-fire
before the talks, a Nairobi weekly newspaper, The East African,
reported Monday.
	   Buyoya, a Tutsi and former army major who ousted a civilian
president in a second coup in 1996, said he is determined to enact
reforms aimed at ending the violence.
	   The reforms he initiated after ousting Bagaza led to the
country's first democratic elections in 1993. He lost to a Hutu,
who was assassinated three months later.
	   On Saturday, Buyoya named a 22-member Cabinet, which includes 12
Hutus. He also named two vice-presidents, one of them a Hutu.
	   Although they make only 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6
million, the Tutsi dominate the government, economy, academia and
the military.
	   Buyoya hopes the new political arrangement will this time
convince regional leaders to lift sanctions they imposed after he
staged the coup.
	   Burundi's five main political parties plus civic and religious
groups are participating.
	   Nyerere cautioned regional leaders can only help Burundians
solve their problems. The talks will be conducted behind closed
doors.

Northern League defeated in regional election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The autonomy-minded Northern League suffered a blow
in local elections in its heartland -- Italy's wealthy northeast.
	   Final results from Sunday's voting showed Umberto Bossi's party
took 17 percent of the vote, down 9 points from the last regional
elections in 1993, when it emerged as the No. 1 party in the Friuli
Venezia Giulia region.
	   In the past, Bossi capitalized on the discontent in the area
with high taxes and heavy bureaucracy centered in Rome.
Commentators say his voters may have been turned off by the
League's push for secession, rather than just regional autonomy.
	   ``This should teach (the League) that extremism doesn't pay,''
said centrist politician Rocco Buttiglione.
	   Opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, which did
not exist in 1993, overtook the League as the region's No. 1 party,
winning 21 percent of the vote.
	   A coalition of former Christian Democrats, running together for
the first time since their split the early '90s, captured 11
percent of the vote.
	   The Democrat Left, the main party in Premier Romano Prodi's
government, were up almost 4 points, winning 15 percent of the
vote. The party had suffered losses in several other recent local
elections.
	   Some 1.1 million people were eligible to vote. Voter turnout was
sharply down, dropping to 64 percent from 80 percent in the 1993
elections.

	   Bangladesh Awami League Sunday hailed the proposed national
budget for financial year 1998-99, describing it as an
''exceptional budget'' with a clear directions for development.
	   In a statement, the Awami League said this year's budget was
formulated for ensuring rapid development of the country,
facilitating the poverty alleviation programme and creating
employment opportunities.
	   The proposed budget, it said, reflected the rationalisation of
duty rates and income tax structure, and encouraged agriculture and
education sectors.
	   The Awami League described the showing of revenue surplus of
Taka 4839 crore as a very significant in the field of national
development. The party said necessary budgetary allocations were
made this year to make the reforms of police administration and
modernise it to build a society free from terrorism.
	   Hailing the withdrawal of duties from computer and its
accessories, the Awami League said this would pave the way for
technological development in the country.
	   It said the government had taken three types of programmes for
poverty-alleviation. The Employment Bank was established for the
first time in Bangladesh. The Awami League said that the government
had also given importance to the preservation and development of
environment by making adequate budgetary allocation.
	   It further said the budget would contribute largely to meeting
the hopes and aspirations of the people and building a society free
from the curse of illiteracy and poverty.

World Cup: England leads Tunisia 1-0 at halftime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Alan Shearer's header in the 42nd
minute gave England a 1-0 halftime lead over Tunisia on Monday in
World Cup Group G, a game that took place peacefully in brilliant
sunshine compared to the three days of fan violence that preceded
it.
	   With England awarded a free kick to the right of the penalty
box, Graeme Le Saux chipped the ball to Shearer, who headed his
shot behind goalkeeper Chokri El Ouaer and off the left post.
	   England dominated play, and would have led by several goals had
El Ouaer not made two superb one-handed saves shortly before
Shearer's strike. The first came on Teddy Sheringham's 30-yard
volley in the 36th minute, and another came on Paul Scholes'
bouncing close-range header two minutes later.
	   Tunisia used a very conservative attack, passing the ball around
midfield as if trying to run out the clock. Occasionally, there
would be a long pass upfield to either Adel Sellimi or Ben Slimane,
but England's defense prevented any real scoring threat.
	   The game followed three days of the skirmishes involving England
and Tunisian fans, local youth and riot police in the streets of
Marseille. The melees led to 50 arrests, and 37 people were
injured, according to local officials.

	   The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(FBCCI) yesterday hailed the national budget for 1998-99 on many
counts while urging the government to review proposals on other
aspects.
	   The Board of Directors of the FBCCI reviewed the budget in a
meeting held on June 13 with its President, Yusuf Abdullah Harun in
the chair. It later issued a statement explaining its position on
the budget.
	   The FBCCI complimented the Finance Minister for presenting a
budget having many good things that would boost the economy.
	   But, it said, the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) at
retailers' level in certain sectors needed to be implemented after
holding discussions with the business community, and with the FBCCI
in particular.
	   It expressed doubt whether the modus operandi suggested in the
budget for the settlement of the sick industries would prove
effective pointing to the need for more thought on it.
	   The FBCCI said that the exempted income limit for taxation
should be raised from Tk 60,000. The increase in tax at source for
transfer of immovable property from 6 per cent to 9 per cent needed
to be reconsidered.
	   The extension of VAT to cover CI sheet, MS rod and cement would
hit the common people. The FBCCI felt that the reduction of duty on
built trucks and buses from 22.5 per cent to 15 per cent would
destroy the domestic body building and assembling industries of CKD
trucks and buses.
	   Different treatment of income tax for private and public
employees was not acceptable, said the FBCCI adding the taxing of
tax paid by employer on account of their employees would have a
negative impact.
	   The FBCCI viewed critically the reduction of duty on import of
finished automobile leaf springs to 40 per cent from 42.5 per cent
keeping the duty on the import of raw material for the same intact
at 30 per cent against a request for lowering it to 7.5 per cent.
	   The FBCCI said that the tax exemption on dividend income up to
Tk 30,000 should be continued and supplementary duty imposed on
motor cars, jeeps, station wagons as also the reducing of
depreciation from reconditioned vehicles needed to be rationalised.
	   The FBCCI said the budget claimed to have simplified certain tax
procedures, but in reality these would give rise to a lot of grey
areas thereby jeopardising the tax collection.
	   The FBCCI felt that the macroeconomic management needed to be
steady to achieve the goals set in the budget proposals. It
stressed the need for containing the inflation within sustainable
limit and keeping the foreign exchange reserves at sufficiently
high level to meet repayment obligations in the gas and power
sectors.
	   It also felt the need for creating an enabling situation for the
development of business and industry and said that the
privatisation of the state owned enterprises should be made
speedier while sufficient power supply and improvement of port
facilities should be ensured.
	   Reforms in banking sector, as also the administrative reforms,
should be expedited. The provision for industrial finance,
maintenance of appropriate exchange rate to ensure adequate
competitiveness for the country's exports needed to be properly
addressed.
	   The FBCCI praised the government for a number of steps that
according to it, would boost the economy.

	   IT WAS just like the real thing. Jumbo jets landed and thousands
of passengers and welcomers swamped Chek Lap Kok _ but this was
just a dress rehearsal for next month's opening of the Hong Kong
International Airport.
	   About 15,000 people _ 12,000 volunteers and 3,000 regular
airport staff _ went into action at Sunday's dummy run of a normal
day at the airport.
	   The test run simulated many of the new airport's first-day
operations scheduled to start on 6 July, such as check-in and
luggage-handling procedures.
	   Three huge, but empty, planes from two airlines and one from an
express transport company carrying fake cargo, touched down on the
3,800-metre runway.
	   Another 32 airlines joined in the practice run of ground
operations, such as manning check-in counters.
	   The exercise revolved around the 55,000-square metre Ground
Transportation Centre (GTC) where passengers will catch trains,
taxis and buses to take them from the airport.
	   The airport security system and transport routes were also in
place.
	   Clinton Leeks, corporate development director of the Airport
Authority, said results of the trial were satisfactory and all
systems operated well.
	   He said the cost of the trial was included in the $49.8 billion
pre-opening preparation budget.
	   Mr Leeks reiterated that the airport would be ready for full
operation on 6 July, saying that work still in progress was not
critical.
	   Ng Ki-sing, general manager for terminal operations, said most
of the improvement work could be completed within the next three
weeks, including building more toilets, putting more direction
signs in the Passenger Terminal and making the floor less slippery.
	   He said at least 90 per cent of the shops in the Passenger
Terminal would start business as soon as the airport opened. He
added that the economic crisis had not forced any shop owners to
pull out.
	   Yesterday also saw the MTRC's Airport Express Line in action for
the first time. It carried about 800 volunteer passengers to the
new airport.
	   Others travelled in via the Tung Chung Line railway, buses, tour
coaches, hotel limousines and private cars.
	   Airport Express commuters also tried out the In-town Check-in
facilities at Hong Kong Station across from Exchange Square in
Central and Kowloon Station in Jordan Road.
	   One pretend passenger said she would choose to check-in at Hong
Kong Station to save time.
	   Another fake flyer, Jason Woo, felt that the check-in facilities
in the urban area were convenient for him.
	   ``It would possibly create a fresh image for visitors to Hong
Kong,'' he said.

World Cup: Scottish fans feat on curry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ Take 10 hungry Scotland World Cup
soccer fans. Put them in France, which boasts one of the world's
greatest cuisines. And what do they want to eat?
	   Indian curry _ but not just any curry.
	   The fans are spending 800 pounds (dlrs 1,300) to hire a private
jet to fly a 600 pound (dlrs 980) meal from their favorite Indian
restaurant in this resort and port city on England's south coast to
Bordeaux, where Scotland plays Norway on Tuesday afternoon.
	   The Eye of The Tiger, which features traditional Indian and
Bengali cuisine, said it got a phone call last week ordering the
meal and a case of Indian lager to wash it down. The fans, who did
not want to be identified, arranged for a check to be delivered to
the restaurant.
	   Chef Shokat Ali will personally fly to Bordeaux Tuesday with the
meal which includes smoked salmon samosas, chicken tikka, goat meat
cooked in saffron and marinated in Tia Maria liquour, and hot
vindaloo curry.
	   ``The Scottish fans come to Bournemouth for business, and every
time they come to the restaurant,'' co-owner Ramzan Ali said
Monday. ``Normally, they have similar dishes.''
	   The restaurant recently won a British curry award, and has
previously catered meals for celebrities and rock groups but it has
no soccer connections, he said.
	   ``We're not much into football,'' said Mustafa Aolad, 30, who
works at the restaurant. ``But we support Scotland now.''

	   The annual growth rate as cited now in the budget does not
reflect the country's real economic situation. The present practice
of estimating growth rate gives only a partial view of the economy
as it is based on the indicators gathered from economically
privileged classes leaving the economic condition of the common
people unaccounted. So, the accounting of the annual growth rate in
the budget needs to be broadbased to make it a credible figure.
	   Noted economist Dr Atiar Rahman made this comment yesterday at a
post-budget press conference in the city. Jointly organised by the
Institute for Development Policy Analysis and Advocacy (IDPAA) and
Association of Development Agencies in Bangladesh (ADAB), Proshika
- an NGO and Shamannay, the press conference was also attended by
Dr Kazi Farook Ahmed, Mahbubul Kabir and Shamsul Huda.
	   A budget analysis was read out in the press conference and Dr
Atiar Rahman and Dr Farook Ahmed replied to questions.
	   Dr Atiar Rahman said the government should ensure subsidy to
fertiliser and other essential agricultural inputs. It should be
targeted to benefit the farmers, he said and added that as
pesticides were imported it should not be covered under financial
support.
	   He said that it should not always be imperative to listen to all
the advice given by the donors and the government should device its
policy independently as to what is good for the farmers and what is
not.
	   Dr Atiar said the inflation figure accounted in the budget was
not accurate and an increase in inflation and unemployment could
create a critical situation in the country. The budget did not show
ways how to fight these problems, he added.
	   The joint analysis of the budget said the Finance Minister's
discussions with the stake-holders prior to the preparation of the
budget was worthwhile. It should be extended to reflect the
interest of the common people by discussion with the people at the
grassroots level and organisations representing them. The budget
should be made participatory to all people, they said.
	   The joint analysis lauded various steps taken by the Finance
Minister to free the environment from pollution to give tax
exemption to computer and software industry, to continue subsidy to
agriculture. The raising of duty on refrigerator, air conditioner
and some other luxury items were also appreciable, they said.
	   Contrary to it, they criticised the budget for its failure in
presenting an integrated document comprising development and the
revenue expenditure. It was also not clear on allocations relating
to poverty alleviation.
	   They demanded sectoral identification of allocations which have
direct bearing on poverty alleviation and also urged the government
to increase allocations to these sectors.
	   They said that the allocations to education and health sectors
had increased only nominally taking into consideration the rise in
inflation. They praised the steps directed to build a safety net
for the poor and the disadvantaged.
	   They felt that increased allocations to the defence sector was
unproductive and the budget should provide more fund to social
sector instead of increasing cost in the defence sector.

Netanyahu and chief of staff clash in Cabinet meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After taking on the Arab world and the United
States, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu locked horns with his own
military chief, silencing the officer as he briefed the Cabinet.
	   The popular and charismatic armed forces chief of staff, Lt.
Gen. Amnon Shahak, is near the end of his term and is expected to
become a major player in Israeli politics after he leaves the army.
	   Shahak, who played a role in negotiating the interim peace
accords with the Palestinians, might join either the center-left
opposition Labor Party or a possible new centrist party.
	   Shahak has made a strong showing in the polls and political
commentators said Monday that Netanyahu considered Shahak a threat
in the 2000 general elections. There was speculation that Netanyahu
deliberately tried to undermine Shahak's standing.
	   During Sunday's Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu reportedly cut short
Shahak's military intelligence briefing on the Palestinians, saying
the armed forces chief had overstepped his role by reporting on
political matters.
	   Several versions of the exchange were reported by radio stations
and newspapers Monday. According to one account, Netanyahu cut
Shahak off sharply, declaring that he was only authorized to
deliver military reports.
	   Netanyahu aides told Israeli media that the prime minister was
only trying to prevent Shahak from revealing classified information
and not to silence him.
	   However, two former prime ministers, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak
Shamir, said Netanyahu had erred in his treatment of Shahak.
	   The army commands great respect in Israel, and it is considered
bad form to disregard the views of the security establishment.
	   Netanyahu has been criticized in the past for shutting out those
whose views differ from his own, especially regarding the peace
talks with the Palestinians.

	   THE structure of the first Legislative Council to be elected
since the handover, is consistent with the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), according to Secretary for
Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie.
	   Speaking at a human rights conference organised by the
International Bar Association, Ms Leung recalled that when Britain
ratified the covenant in 1976 it did so subject to some
reservations with regard to Hong Kong.
	   ``One of these was in respect of Article 25, which provides for
periodic elections to be conducted by universal and equal
suffrage,'' she said.
	   ``The reservation was to the effect that the Article did not
require the establishment of an elected Executive or Legislative
Council in Hong Kong.'' The structure of the first SAR Legco has
been criticised by pro-democracy groups as ``undemocratic''. This
is because only 20 of the 60 deputies are directly elected.
	   Article 25 of the ICCPR states: ``Every citizen shall have the
right and the opportunity . . . to vote and to be elected at
genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal
suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free
expression of the will of the electors.'' Ms Leung said the opt-out
clause still applied to the SAR and was reflected in the Bill of
Rights Ordinance.
	   ``Neither the Provisional Legislative Council nor the first SAR
Legislative Council is therefore inconsistent with international
obligations or domestic laws applying in Hong Kong,'' she said.
	   United Nations Human Rights Committee member Elizabeth Evatt who
also attended the conference said the committee had previously
expressed its concern over the structure of the first Legco.
	   Li Pang-kwong, lecturer at the social science department of
Lingnan College, said it was wrong to invoke the reservation clause
to justify the delay in the introduction of universal suffrage in
Hong Kong.
	   ``That reservation clause was valid when Hong Kong was still a
colony of Britain, but after the handover, the situation is
different,'' he said.
	   But Mr Li said introducing universal suffrage should not be a
current priority of the SAR Government because the public was now
more concerned with economic issues because of the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, former Bar Association chairman Gladys Li Chi-hei
urged solicitors to move out of Central and to relocate closer to
places where ordinary people lived.
	   She said this was one way to make legal services more
accessible.

	   The proposed national budget for 1998-99 will little help the
poverty alleviation process, the centre-point of the Fifth Five
Year Plan (FFYP), said Proshika President Farook Ahmed.
	   He said this while giving his reaction on behalf of the
Institute for Development Policy Analysis and Advocacy (IDPAA) and
Association of Development Agencies in Bangladesh (ADAB), on the
budget at a press conference at the National Press Club yesterday.
	   ``Poverty alleviation is at the centre of the Fifth Five Year
Plan... but the proposed budget does not seem to be in compliance
with the FFYP' said the Proshika President.
	   He however, lauded some measures proposed in the budget.
Exemption of duties on generator and wind generator will be
conducive to solar power generation and levying duties on old cars
and autorickhsaws will help keep the environment clean.
	   He further appreciate the proposals of imposing duties on
refrigerators, air-coolers, ceramic ware, tiles and luxurious
materials.
	   In a written speech, Farook said the government had pledged to
alleviate poverty and some plans have already been taken in this
regard.
	   ``But budget lacks the allocation required to implement the
plans'' he said adding, it is not clear in the proposed budget how
much was given to which sectors for poverty alleviation.
	   He proposed to identify the sectors directly involved in the
poverty alleviation programmes and increase the sector-wise
allocation in this regard.
	   Referring to the pre-budget discussion with the Finance
Minister, Farook Ahmed said the government should allocate at least
50 per cent of the total budget for education, health, local
government and credit programmes for poor.
	   The press conference was also attended, among others, by Atiur
Rahman, Mahbubul Karim and Shamsul Huda.

	   Foreign Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI)
yesterday criticised the government for not taking effective
measures in the proposed budget to downsize the existing government
machinery.
	   ``We have been disheartened that there is no meaningful measure
in this budget to downsize the government,'' the FICCI said in a
reaction to the proposed budget (1998-99) placed by Finance
Minister Shah AMS Kibria in the Parliament on June 11.
	   It said the existing government machinery is too large and too
bureaucratic to be conducive to making the private sector, the
engine of growth of the economy.
	   The government machinery reflects the set up of a command
economy although the role of the government in managing the economy
has decreased substantially, it added.
	   ``Several studies have shown that about 30 per cent of the
government employees do not have any work and yet they continue to
burden the economy which ultimately befalls on the private
sector,'' the FICCI said and urged the government to take
administrative measures in the 1998-99 fiscal to start the
downsizing process.
	   It observed that Bangladesh could grow at an even higher rate if
the economic management was better.
	   About the enabling environment for FDI, the Chamber said
corruption, bureaucratic high-handedness, inadequate
infrastructure, lack of modern telecommunications, port congestion
and law and order situation are often cited as disincentives to
attract foreign investment.
	   ``Although the budget speaks of road building, but there is no
indication of crash programme for power generation, no mention of
improvement of satellite telecommunications, and above all there is
no measure to eliminate corruption and extortion,'' it said.
	   On the other hand, the Foreign Chamber observed, the budget
seeks to take away two hard earned facilities -- tax return based
certification on certification by Chartered Accounting firms and
waiver of tax on tax -- for the foreign investors. It called for
restoration of the two facilities.
	   The FICCI, however, felt that in many respects the 1998-99
budget proposal is better than the previous two budgets of the
present government and welcomed many of the measures aimed at
fostering the development of certain sectors.
	   It described the reduction of duties on computers and
agro-industry input as good initiatives.
	   ``Our members are supportive to the government in its efforts to
ensure a better economic management that will take the country to a
higher path of growth in a competitive global economy.''
	   The FICCI said many of the measures undertaken by the government
to increase revenue will be counter productive and these will
eventually be detrimental to revenue collection.
	   ``These measures are not transparent .. .. these are
inconsistent with good governance.''
	   It said the biggest challenge for the government is to collect
the full and correct revenue that is equitable and fair.
	   ``The government is unable to get its full share of revenue
because of leakage and weakness of the tax administration,'' it
added.
	   The FICCI observed that the budget did not mention any measures
about the overhauling and reorganisation of the tax administration
to make it more effective. Many of the proposed measures are harsh
on the private sectors, seeking to compensate the tax
administration for its weaknesses.
	   However, the FICCI praised the Finance Minister for mentioning
about reduction of discretionary authority of tax officials and
dealing with corruption.
	   ``We feel that no other issue is more important than these.
Discretion and corruption increase the cost of business and hamper
economic growth.''
	   The net effect of a weak tax administration is a higher
transaction cost on the business community making Bangladeshi
products and services less competitive in the global economy.
	   The FICCI said the budget not only aims at revenues or
expenditure, but also at creating higher disposable incomes,
savings investments which will lead to higher economic growth.
	   It hoped that the government will exempt foreign consultant and
technical services from the provision of compulsory deduction of 10
per cent tax at sources and withdraw the compulsory provision of
income tax registration for the liaison offices of a the foreign
companies.

	   PLANS for the first anniversary celebrations of the handover
came too late to pull in tourists, say industry groups.
	   Tourist Industry Council chairman Joseph Tung Yao-ching said the
government announced its plans too late to have any benefit for
falling tourist arrivals.
	   The one consolation is that events are likely to bring in more
mainlanders and Taiwanese, Mr Tung added.
	   The $10 million anniversary celebration was announced on Friday,
although Secretary for Home Affairs David Lan Hong-tsung said
festivities would not be extravagant because of the economic gloom.
	   ``There is no time to promote anything. It seems they didn't
expect a lot of tourists to come,'' Mr Tung said.
	   He said the government is probably keeping events low-key as
many tourists remained worried about how Hong Kong would fare in
the first couple of years after the handover.
	   He said the industry was working hard to convince visitors that
Hong Kong was safe and that ``the PLA is not patrolling the
streets''.
	   The Hong Kong Hotels Association said hotel bookings had so far
not increased as a result of the anniversary, and it did not expect
a rise in tourist numbers.
	   Chairman Ivan Lee Wan-hay said while prices had fallen from last
year, occupancy rates were not likely to increase until mid-July
and August due to campaigns targeting families and visitors from
Japan and Southeast Asia.
	   The J W Marriott Hotel said its occupancy rate stood at 60-70
per cent, and there had been no increase in bookings for the 1 July
period. But it was not ruling out a last-minute rush. The New Astor
Hotel said bookings had risen slightly and it thought the
anniversary would attract some tourists, mainly from Asia.
	   The Hong Kong Tourist Association said it was bringing in more
than 200 foreign journalists and tourist trade representatives from
places including Canada, Britain and Taiwan, mainly for the opening
of the new airport at Chek Lap Kok.
	   Public relations manager Peter Randall said the idea behind the
trips was to encourage people to return to Hong Kong, free of any
post-handover jitters.
	   He said the new airport was more likely to encourage tourism
than the anniversary of the handover.
	   The Information Services Department is bringing five foreign
journalists to the SAR for the 1 July celebrations and to cover the
opening of the airport.
	   It said 140 foreign correspondents had registered to cover the
events, but most were based here.

	   ONBOARD THE USS WASP (AP) _ As NATO aircraft cruised over
Albania and Macedonia, tiny yellow lights blipped across a screen
in the command and control rooms of the amphibious assault carrier
USS Wasp.
	   Minutes earlier, four Harrier attack jets took off from the ship
to join a formation of about 80 aircraft from 13 nations
participating in the show of force along Serbia's borders.
	   ``We prepared for the worst possible scenario -- for the
launching of a missile by the Serbs -- but that didn't happen,''
said Capt. Brian Annichiarico, a 31-year-old Harrier pilot from New
York City, after returning safely.
	   During the hour or more the jets were in the air, Col. Emerson
Gardner, the commanding officer of the Marine force aboard the
Wasp, kept close watch on the gauges and screens documenting the
mission's progress.
	   A live video feed from the AWACS aircraft, which hovered over
Albania, showed the planes speeding at over 400 knots (460 mph, 740
kph) along a narrow corridor as close as 16 kilometers 10 miles)
from Serbia's southern border.
	   A map of the Balkans, hung on the back wall of the command room,
pinpointed various landmarks, including a soccer stadium in the
Albanian capital of Tirana.
	   ``We flew over the soccer stadium at about 2,000 feet (650
meters) and saw people waving at us,'' said Harrier pilot Maj.
Michael Butters, 38, of Newburn, North Carolina.
	   ``Everything went perfectly from our point of view. It was a
perfect operation,'' said Butters.
	   Awaiting the return of the Harriers, the Wasp moved in a
rectangular pattern about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the
southern Albanian town of Durres.
	   Gardner said a report documenting exercise ``Determined Falcon''
would be compiled at the NATO base in Vicenza, northern Italy,
based on pilot accounts as well as radar and other data.
	   ``One of the biggest challenges today is the quantity of
information,'' said Gardner as he was handed a yellow slip of paper
describing what was happening in Kosovo Monday.

	   Motor vehicle dealers yesterday shut down their showrooms
throughout the country indefinitely in protest against the proposed
increase in import duty on the vehicles in the new budget.
	   Under the new tax structure the prices of motor vehicles would
increase from 40 to 80 per cent depending on the category of the
vehicles, the motor vehicles dealers said.
	   The President of the Bangladesh Reconditioned Vehicles Importers
and Dealers Association (BRVIDA), Abdul Haq, in a statement
yesterday said that the dealers and importers had lodged a strong
protest against the proposed raise of duty.
	   He said, in the new budget, the supplementary tax would be
significantly increased.
	   The Association leaders in a meeting yesterday demanded that the
government should withdraw the proposed increased in duty and
decided to shut down their business until the demand was met.
	   They had also decided to postpone the clearance of imported
vehicles from the port, Abdul Haq said

	   FOUR teenagers allegedly killed a 13-year-old schoolmate whom
they were planning to hold hostage for ransom, Macau police said on
Sunday.
	   Investigators said the suspects, aged 13 to 16, had lured their
victim, Cheong Wai-kit, to a flat on 5 June and strangled him when
he refused a soft drink that contained white powder.
	   Police said the alleged killers had mixed sleeping pills with
the drink. The boy's body has not been found, but police believe it
ended up in the enclave's central incineration plant.
	   The suspects then allegedly went ahead with their ransom demand,
telling the parents of the victim to hand over 300,000 patacas
(HK$300,000) for his release.
	   Last Tuesday, the victim's family _ described as overseas
Chinese with manufacturing interests in Indonesia _ left only
180,000 patacas at a location named by the suspects.
	   Soon after the four boys went on a spending spree buying two
cash boxes in which to allegedly keep the bulk of their money, a
motorcycle, two mobile phones and fashionable clothes. The boys
were arrested on Saturday and police said the suspects confessed to
disposing of the body by first hiding it in a wardrobe at the home
of two of their number whose parents were often away on business in
the mainland.
	   A day later they allegedly put the body in the boot of their
parents' car and then drove to the incinerator where they left it
stuffed in a plastic bag in a rubbish skip.
	   One police source blamed Hong Kong movies that glorified triads
for influencing the alleged killers.
	   ``By watching all those Hong Kong movies, those teenagers think
that money justifies everything, even murder,'' the source said.
	   The kidnapping was allegedly planned by the elder of two
brothers, surnamed Ng, 15, and his best friend, a boy, 16, surnamed
Cheong.
	   Cheong has been taken into pre-trial detention at Coloane island
prison, and the three other boys have been taken to a reformatory
on the same island.
	   Sources said the two Ng brothers were from a wealthy family of
``hardworking Fujianese immigrants'' who had a business in China.
	   The elder Ng allegedly took 100,000 patacas as his share and
gave 40,000 each to Luk and Cheong. He then allegedly ``paid off''
his younger brother with 700 patacas. Police say they have
recovered the bulk of the money.

German group won't bid for Britain's Mirror newspapers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The big German publisher Axel Springer Verlag AG
said Monday it has ruled out a bid for Britain's Mirror Group PLC.
Disappointed investors pushed Mirror Group's stock down by nearly
10 percent.
	   Axel Springer had announced last month it was taking a look at
Mirror Group, whose flagship newspaper is the tabloid Daily Mirror.
But after carefully reviewing Mirror Group's operations, Axel
Springer said it decided not to bid.
	   Analysts had suggested Axel Springer might have to bid as high
as 275 pence (dlrs 4.48) per share, valuing Mirror Group at around
1.25 billion pounds (dlrs 2.04 billion).
	   Mirror Group was off by 22.5 pence (37 U.S. cents), or 9.7
percent, at 210.5 pence (dlrs 3.43) per share in midafternoon
dealings on the London Stock Exchange.

Moroccans hope for a little divine help against Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ If their prayers are answered, the Atlas
Lions of Morocco may get a little divine help Tuesday when they
play their World Cup match against defending champion Brazil.
	   ``I pray that God will be with us,'' forward Salaheddine Bassir
said.
	   Faced with a Brazilian team determined to prove that it is still
No. 1, the Moroccans are going to need all the help they can get.
	   ``This is going to be a very difficult match. But Insha'allah
(with God's will), we will have the desire, dedication and skill to
win,'' he said, using the Arabic phrase that implies that
everything is determined by God.
	   Bassir is among the most religious members of the team, often
reading verses from the Koran, the Muslim holy book, before
matches, never missing one of the five daily prayers required of
Muslims and bowing in thanks after scoring a goal during matches he
plays for Spain's Deportivo la Coruna.
	   He is not, however, the only devout player on the team. Others
interviewed by The Associated Press also said that spiritual
convictions guide them in sports and daily life.
	   ``You have to thank God for what you have, for what you
accomplish on and off the field,'' defender Youssef Rossi said.
	   The thanks can come in many forms, ranging from prayer or zika,
the giving of charity.
	   Midfielder Youssef Chippo, who plays for Portugal's FC Porto,
bought a carpet for a mosque in Burkina Faso during the last
African Nations Cup as a gesture of charity and piety.
	   Even during the matches, for members of this Muslim team _ one
of four competing in the World Cup _ God is in their minds and
hearts, if not actually on the field.
	   Team captain Noureddine Naybet is known to touch his forehead,
his mouth and his chest before each match _ a habit which, because
of its resemblance to crossing oneself, had Moroccan fans
erroneously wondering years ago if he had converted to
Christianity.
	   ``I do it as a way of praying that God give me a clear mind to
focus on the game, the voice to praise him and the heart to be
brave in the face of challenge,'' said Naybet who, like star
midfielder El-Moustafa Hadji and Bassir, plays for Deportivo la
Coruna.
	   But what if these prayers fall short of the mark?
	   ``I feel confident, thank God, and with His permission, we will
do well,'' said goalie Driss Benzekri. ``But whatever, the outcome,
it will be God's will. All we can do is our best.''

Three dead, 800 hospitalized during Egyptian heat wave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ At least three people died and 800 were
taken to hospital during a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring
above 45 degrees Celsius (114 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past few
days, police officials said Monday.
	   Three students at a police academy suffered heat stroke and were
taken to hospital on Saturday in the southern province of Sohag.
They died the following day.
	   Some 800 people were taken to hospitals throughout the country
in the past two days after suffering from dehydration, said the
police officials, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity,
	   In the capital, Cairo, temperatures reached 40 degrees Celsius
(104 Fahrenheit) on Saturday.
	   The heat wave began breaking Monday, when temperatures in Cairo
reached 32 Celsius (90 Fahrenheit).

	   HONG Kong's ``bubble economy'' which has been blamed on the
``British colonialists'' was also created by the current political
rulers of the Special Administrative Region, a top politician
charged on Sunday.
	   Frontier legislator-elect Emily Lau Wai-hing said Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa was also responsible for the high prices
and the present economic difficulties.
	   She warned that since the handover on 30 June nearly a year ago
people had become increasingly dissatisfied with the way the
government was handling the economy.
	   ``Mr Tung said the SAR had inherited a `bubble' economy from the
British colonialists in which asset prices were too high and needed
to be corrected.
	   ``Mr Tung is of course not blameless. As a member of Goverom their
high horses and start listening to people the scene is set for
tension.'' Ms Lau blasted Mr Tung's administration for not
addressing the problem of high costs in Hong Kong which she said
made it one of the most expensive cities in the world.
	   And Ms Lau said the government's failure to detect the sharp
economic downturn quickly enough had undermined its credibility
internationally.
	   ``Once held in high esteem, officials in charge of financial and
monetary affairs are now regarded as a laughing stock by the local
and international community.'' In a Letter to Hong Kong, broadcast
on RTHK, Ms Lau predicted that the seven political parties, who
recently joined together to try to enforce their views on the
economy through the new Legislative Council, would be defeated.
	   The parties which hold 42 of the 60 seats in the new Legislative
Council served notice on 3 June that they want the administration
to adopt their plans to stimulate the economy.

World Cup: McCarthy says he is ready to go for Denmark
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Star striker Benni McCarthy said Monday his
injured left ankle had healed and he was ready to play in South
Africa's crucial encounter against Denmark.
	   ``It's 100 percent, no problem,'' the 20-year-old Ajax Amsterdam
player said after running, dribbling and shooting on his own during
a two-hour training session amid scattered rain showers.
	   McCarthy turned the ankle near the end of South Africa's 3-0
loss to France in its World Cup debut on Friday. Team doctor Victor
Ramathesele at first said McCarthy would definitely miss the
Denmark match on Thursday in Toulouse, but then upgraded McCarthy
to doubtful on Sunday.
	   The other starting striker, Phil Masinga of Bari, didn't train
on Monday but said he was able to put weight on his injured ankle
and might be ready for Denmark.
	   But South Africa appeared to lose another substitute goalkeeper
when Paul Evans, called in last week to replace the injured Andre
Arendse, went down with an injured right knee during training and
was carried off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance.
	   Evans, who plays for local club Supersport United, only arrived
in France on Thursday. He was considered the third-string
goalkeeper and only likely to suit up if either of the top two _
Hans Vonk of Heerenveen F.C. and Brian Baloyi of local club Kaizer
Chiefs _ got hurt.
	   After the humiliating loss to France, South Africa has little
chance of advancing to the second round unless it defeats the
favored Danes, who beat Saudi Arabia 1-0 in their opening Group C
match.
	   Masinga said Monday the team should forget about the loss to
France and the World Cup pressure, and instead play how it knows
best.
	   ``We were waiting for France to come to us, and that's not our
typical style of play,'' he said. ``I think we just have to go into
the next game and try to enjoy the experience.''
	   Midfielder John Mosheou agreed, saying the defensive posture
against France stifled the South African creativity.
	   ``Guys have to do better, express themselves, enjoy it,'' said
Moshoeu, who plays for Fenerbahce in Turkey. ``You have to go out
there and attack.''

	   ABOUT 15 per cent of families have at least one unemployed
member, a Caritas Community Centre survey has found, and 44 per
cent of families have reduced expenses.
	   The centre questioned 150 families on how the financial slump
had affected them and what they thought of government measures to
reduce unemployment.
	   Results of the poll were revealed on Sunday on the eve of the
announcement of the new unemployment rate by the government.
	   Almost 40 per cent said their income had been reduced since the
economic crisis. Areas for most cuts by families were on leisure
and entertainment.
	   Education and spending on children were also among expenses
slashed, according to 16 per cent of respondents.
	   ``Most of the polls that have been conducted are asking how the
crisis has affected businesses, but we're focusing on its impact on
the families,'' Bill Lay Yan-piau, who supervises social work at
the Caritas Kowloon centre, said.
	   ``An average of 38 per cent of families have said they're not
satisfied with the 12 measures that the government proposed to
reduce unemployment,'' Mr Lay said.
	   Of the 12 measures, people were most happy with the extension of
tertiary student loan schemes, with 48 per cent in favour.
	   And 64 per cent thought that proposals by seven political
parties could boost the economy.
	   ``More than 75 per cent felt that rental cuts to markets run by
the Housing Department would help,'' Mak Hon-kai, chairman of the
Caritas advisory board, said.
	   ``And 68 per cent thought that there should be more
opportunities in social service sectors and that infrastructure
projects should be speeded up.'' The poll findings, which will be
sent to the government, suggested that more than half of the
families would attend proposed employee skill training courses.
	   Almost half said they would use information support to seek
jobs.

	   THE Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council on Sunday called
on the government to take more positive action to stimulate the
economy and stop the rise in unemployment.
	   In a petition to Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa on the eve of the
announcement of the latest unemployment figures, the council urged
the creation of an interest-free business starter fund.
	   ``Although people want to start their business, they fear that
they may lose their savings under present sluggish market
conditions _ the government should do something to encourage
them,'' council chairman Lee Kwok-keung said.
	   They urged the government to use its reserve fund to provide
low-interest loans to small and medium-size enterprises to ease the
credit crunch.
	   The council also proposed an unemployment fund to replace the
Comprehensive Social Security Assistance which in their view is
unable to help relieve the hardships facing the jobless.
	   They said this should be jointly funded by the government,
employers and employees and should help the jobless cope with the
crisis.
	   ``The money collected will be sufficient to cater for a large
number of recipients, without imposing a heavy burden on
taxpayers,'' Mr Lee said.

	   Exporters' associations and trade bodies yesterday hailed the
government for placing a pro-people and business-oriented budget
for the 1998-99 fiscal.
	   The appreciation came from a meeting of the ``National Task
Force on Export'' with Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail
Ahmed in the chair.
	   Presidents of all exporters' associations and chambers are the
members of the Task Force.
	   Praising the suggestions put forward by the business leaders at
different Task Force meetings, the minister said the frozen food
sector is gaining momentum following implementation of the package
programmes recommended by the expert committee.
	   As a result, he said, 10 more shrimp processing plants succeeded
the quality bar in export in addition to the six which succeeded it
earlier as they set up HACCP quality control system.
	   The meeting asked the Land Ministry to allot 100 acres of khas
land to each recognised processing plant based in Chittagong and
Cox's Bazar areas so that they can set up pilot plants.
	   It will help provide technological and expertise supports to the
small processing plants and will be able to generate new
entrepreneurs in this sector.
	   The meeting urged the Land Ministry to lease out lands for 99
years to the tea garden owners for bringing back confidence among
the owners, money lenders and the donors.
	   It also asked the Land Ministry to stop any lease to the traders
for sand-heap inside the tea garden areas.
	   Highlighting the efforts made by the private sector in
maintaining export growth at the rate of 16.75 per cent in dollar
terms, the minister said the proposed budget has opened up new
avenues for creating more employment, diversified products, more
export and healthier economy.
	   He said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina advised the Bangladesh
Embassies abroad to pursue the trade promotional activities as
their main job.
	   Tofail called on the entrepreneurs and businessmen for full
utilisation of the incentives and facilities provided by the
government for early emancipation of the national economy.
	   Initiating the remarks on the proposed budget, BGMEA President
Mostafa Golam Quddus said allowing green channel facility for the
clearance of imported goods is ``wonderful'' and a very positive
step for the exporters.
	   The Commerce Minister said allowing duty free import of
computers will help modernise the factories and expedite the export
process.
	   Commenting on the proposed budget, MCCI President Laila Rahman
Kabir said the government has been able to place such an excellent
budget due to its close consultation with the business community.
	   She said this pro-people and business-oriented budget is the
outcome of the prompt cessation of the ideas of private sector by
the government as it picked up the good suggestions.
	   President of Frozen Food Exporters Association Md Golam Mostafa
and the representatives of FBCCI and other trade bodies also
expressed the same view.
	   They hoped that the facilities provided in the budget for
expanding production and export would come out with a tangible
benefit to the national economy.
	   The meeting also discussed the cash incentive to the exporters
of hand-sewing patch work (kantha) and distribution of export quota
on some categories of ready-made garments.
	   Commerce Secretary Sayed Alamgir Farrouk Chowdhury, Land
Secretary Md Omar Farrouk, additional foreign secretary Mohiuddin
Ahmed and representatives from Home, Finance and Fisheries
Ministries and other trade associations were present.

investment.

World Cup: Nigeria can't wait to get back to attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ Nigeria has built its success to date
with an attacking, wide-open brand of play and is not about to
change now, no matter how vulnerable their defense may be.
	   ``If we attack, we kill your defense. You can score 15 goals if
you want,'' striker Daniel Amokachi said Monday, ``but we'll get
16.''
	   They may need to approach that total if the backline continues
to have problems. One of the pillars, hulking center back Taribo
West, was hobbled at practice Tuesday by a stiff right ankle.
	   The Inter Milan player worked alone for much of the training
session, kicking a ball against a fence with his left foot. His
loss would be a huge blow, especially with starting right back Jero
Shakpore already sent home with a broken collarbone. But West said
he'll be ready to play Friday, when the Olympic champions take on
Bulgaria in Paris.
	   Despite the problems Nigeria has had containing opponents _ the
squad has allowed 11 goals in its last four outings, including a
come-from-behind 3-2 escape against Spain to start its World Cup
campaign Saturday _ neither coach Bora Milutinovic nor his players
seem to think a more cautious approach is in order.
	   ``If we play defensively, we get hammered,'' said Amokachi, who
appears fully recovered from a twisted right knee suffered last
week. ``Coach Bora tried to make us more conservative at first, but
it didn't work. Maybe we should apologize to him for not adapting.
But now he lets us play our style.''
	   Milutinovic has said he did not have enough time to apply a new
system. He was hired in December but because the players are spread
around the world _ none of the 22 on the roster plays
professionally in Nigeria _ the Yugoslav was not able to begin
World Cup preparations with the group until April.
	   That brings some unpredictability to the team's play, which the
only coach to win a World Cup game with four different countries
says can be a positive.
	   ``With some teams you know what is coming, but not with us. This
is sometimes worrying but this is also good,'' said Milutinovic,
who guided Mexico in 1986, Costa Rica in 1990 and the United States
four years ago.
	   Nigeria, which changed its nickname from the Green Eagles to the
Super Eagles after winning the 1980 African Cup of Nations, routed
Bulgaria 3-0 at the 1994 World Cup.
	   ``Once bitten twice shy. At the last World Cup we beat them,''
West said, ``and now they know we beat Spain. (Bulgaria) will have
to be cautious.''

	   FOOTBALL fans have been warned not to wager on World Cup matches
via the Internet not only because such betting is illegal but
because they could be cheated of their winnings.
	   Secretary for Home Affairs David Lan Hong-tsung sounded the
warning at the launch of Solar Project 98 on Sunday.
	   Mr Lan reminded would-be Internet punters that ``there is no law
to protect them'' and there was no guarantee they could collect if
they won.
	   Saying that although illegal gambling on the Internet was not a
very serious problem, the senior official admitted it was difficult
to prevent.
	   ``Though soccer betting on the Internet is illegal, it is
difficult to establish an effective and workable policy to cope
with this problem.
	   ``But the soccer betting gamblers should bear in mind that there
is no law to protect them and they are not guaranteed to get what
they won.'' He admitted the police were virtually powerless to
arrest Internet punters and appealed to them to ``discontinue these
activities'' by exercising self-restraint.
	   He praised the recent police swoop on illegal gambling
activities sparked by the ongoing World Cup soon after the opening
match in Wan Chai pubs and bars.
	   The secretary officiated at the launch of Solar Project 98 under
the three-year Family and Sports Campaign, which began in 1996.
	   The project ends in March next year.

	   THE Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Standby Facility is
essentially designed to alleviate systemic risk within the
stockbroking industry and should not be perceived as a bailout.
	   KLSE executive chairman Mohd Azlan Hashim said the facility
which currently stands at RM500 million was established to reduce
systemic risk in the stock market arising from the failure of any
stockbroking company in meeting its trading obligations.
	   ``The SCANS Standby Facility is not to provide assistance,
whether financial or otherwise, to the stockbroking companies but
to ensure that the integral strength of the system is preserved,
ultimately ensuring the overall interest of investors is
protected,'' said Azlan at a media briefing last Friday.
	   He said with the facility in place, untoward circumstances are
confined to the stockbroking company concerned without affecting
the rest of the stockbroking companies which might be parties to
the transaction.
	   The facility fulfils obligations arising from permitted trades
executed through the Exchange's automated trading system.
	   Thus far, the facility has been utilised in the case of Halim
Securities which had defaulted in its payment to SCANS for an
amount just under RM10 million.
	   Azlan said the amount in the facility is more than adequate as a
situation in which there will be an amount exceeding RM500 million
in default payment is unlikely to occur.
	   And given the trading volume in the market for the time being,
the amount in the facility is ``fairly sizeable'', he said.
	   In addition, the Exchange has imposed trading restrictions on
the stockbroking companies as a pre-emptive measure and as such, if
they follow these conditions, they are not likely to default in
payment, he added.
	   KLSE general manager of Securities Clearing Automated Network
Services Sdn Bhd (SCANS) Ungku Razak Ungku Rahman, in his briefing,
stressed that the facility is not meant for payment to a
stockbroking company's end clients.
	   The contribution to the facility comes from the income and
property of the KLSE and internal reserves.

	   THE importance of the two municipal councils was ``fading out''
in terms of political participation, Acting Chief Secretary for
Administration Michael Suen Ming-yeung said on Sunday.
	   But he told the Hong Kong Standard that the significance of the
Urban and Regional Councils had not declined in terms of their
functions.
	   And the government was not planning to dissolve the two bodies
just because of their declining political role, Mr Suen added.
	   He reiterated that the government had no preference for any of
the four models proposed in the consultation paper.
	   Mr Suen, who is also Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, said
the political role of the two bodies had diminished in light of the
developments over the past decade.
	   Before 1982, when some of the district board seats became
elective, the Urban Council was the only institution whose members
were chosen by direct election. But this was only by a limited
number of people who were eligible to vote.
	   After the introduction of elections to the district boards in
1982, their political role became much greater than that of the
council, Mr Suen said.
	   The diminution of the municipal body's role continued when the
Legislative Council started having indirect elections in 1985 and
direct elections in 1991.
	   ``Therefore, you can use the word `fading out' to describe the
importance of the municipal councils in terms of political
participation,'' Mr Suen said.
	   But he said the councils' functions had not diminished in
importance and the four models proposed in the consultation paper
were only meant to solve the problems of overlapping duties.
	   But Provisional Urban Council Ronald Leung Ding-bong slammed the
government's proposal to take back the councils' work on food
safety and environmental hygiene as unfair.
	   Dr Leung said the councils did not have much power to cope with
the bird flu crisis.
	   ``That was not our fault when we could just pick up the dead
hens being killed according to our power,'' Dr Leung said yesterday
in the City Forum.
	   But Mr Suen said the government did not blame the councils for
not doing a good job, but what aroused concern was the problem of
structure.
	   Stressing that the government did not have any preferences, Mr
Suen said dissolving the two councils might solve the problem of
overlapping functions.
	   Dr Leung told the Hong Kong Standard that he felt the government
would eventually abolish the councils. He said half of their
workload would be reduced once food safety and environmental
hygiene were removed from their area of responsibility.

	   KUALA Lumpur Stock Exchange executive chairman Mohd Azlan Hashim
expressed ``great concern'' over the heavily qualified accounts in
companies' accounts which have emerged in recent months.
	   He said the Exchange is concerned over the numerous audit
reports that have ``no opinion'' inserted in these reports as
``...we want full disclosure of information.''
	   The Exchange requires public-listed companies to submit their
preliminary as well as audited set of accounts over a certain
period of time.
	   If there is any problem with the accounts, he said, it falls
under the Companies Act 1965 and as such should be pursued by the
Registrar of Companies which also works in hand with the Exchange.
	   ``We do have coordination with them and they (ROC) have their
own investigating team,'' he said.
	   Azlan also suggested that on the other hand, auditors should
bring the matter up with the respective authorities.
	   Recently, a number of have had their accounts heavily qualified
by their auditors.
	   The auditors, in their respective reports, stated that they were
unable to form an opinion on whether the companies' accounts have
been properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 1965 so as to give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the companies.
	   Meanwhile, Mentor Centre for Business Research senior adviser
Professor Salleh Buang said a heavily qualified statement of
accounts means that one cannot really be sure about the financial
position of the company.
	   Salleh, who is also a legal expert, said this actually means
that one cannot ascertain whether the company is doing well, able
to pay its creditors, has been making any profits or even has the
ability to pay dividends.
	   In addition, he said, this also means that one cannot know
whether the directors in control have been ``milking'' the company
or whether its assets have been wrongfully depleted by the
directors.
	   A merchant banker urged relevant authorities to act on companies
with qualified accounts to deter others from abusing their
authorities in managing their companies.
	   ``The authorities need to show that action will or has been
taken, or else others would feel that it is alright to have
qualified accounts as they think they can get away with it,'' he
added.
	   Shareholders, he said, should also demand explanation from the
directors on why the company's accounts are heavily qualified, and
if necessary, not approve the accounts at the company's annual
general meeting if the given explanation is unsatisfactory.
	   On the same issue, Salleh said if shareholders are fully aware
of their rights, they would realise that the directors in control
of the company had not properly discharged their duties as required
by the law.
	   This is especially so given in the provision under Section
132(1) of the Companies Act which accords a director the duty to
act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the
duties of his office.
	   Depending on the facts of each case and assuming that evidence
can be marshalled, he added, there might be a basis for an action
under Section 181 or Section 218 of the same act.
	   Section 181 provides for remedy in cases of oppression and
Section 218 deals with circumstances in which a company may be
wound up by court.
	   The very least, he noted, there would be grounds for a civil and
criminal action under Section 132 and other provisions of the Act
which relates to account.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels in Guinea-Bissau have said they
will end their weeklong revolt in the former Portuguese colony if
the government enters into talks and the president of the West
African nation steps down.
	   A rebel spokesman said late Sunday that the soldiers mutinied
because President Joao Bernardo Vieira covered up the findings of
an investigation into the trafficking of arms to separatist forces
in Casamance region in neighboring Senegal.
	   The leader of the rebels, Brig. Ansumane Mane, was implicated in
the trafficking scandal, according to Vieira. The investigation's
findings were never published, but Mane was removed from his post
as chief of the Guinea-Bissau armed forces on June 6, the day
before the revolt broke out.
	   Rebel spokesman Maj. Gomes Fernandes said Vieira ``cannot remain
as president.''
	   Fernandes told Portuguese state television RTP that Mane had
been ``set up'' by Vieira.
	   Vieira and other top-ranking army officers were running the arms
scam, Fernandes alleged.
	   Fernandes did not specify the agenda for negotiations to end
hostilities. But he said the rebels did not aim to seize power.
	   ``This is no military coup. It was done to re-establish justice
in the country ... we never intended to seize power,'' he said.
	   He said the rebels, who have been pinned in a military garrison
in a suburb of the capital Bissau since they mutinied June 7, were
heavily armed. No information was provided about the strength of
the rebel force.
	   Government forces are being supported by troops from nearby
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea.
	   A spokeswoman for the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said there was
``some fighting'' Monday in Bissau where loyalist troops in
downtown areas exchanged sporadic artillery and machine-gun fire
with the rebels.
	   Portuguese Secretary of State Jose Lello said the military
situation remained deadlocked.
	   ``The conflict is conventional, with the sides using heavy
artillery and mortars, and it may drag on a while longer,'' Lello
was quoted as saying by Lusa, the Portuguese news agency.
	   Lusa quoted an unidentified Bissau inhabitant as saying there
were more than a hundred dead bodies on the streets of the capital.
	   Thousands of people were fleeing Bissau where abandoned shops
and houses were being looted, the source said.
	   Lusa reported Sunday that 200 people drowned as they fled Bissau
by boat two days before. The refugees were on their way to the
Bissagos archipelago, 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast, when
the boat sank, Lusa said.
	   Portuguese radio station RDP-Africa cited a Red Cross source as
saying that some 20,000 refugees had arrived in Gabu, 200
kilometers (124 miles) east of the capital, and required emergency
food aid.
	   A group of 84 children evacuated from a Bissau mission were also
in Gabu.
	   A spokesman for the Portuguese Defense Ministry said
intelligence from Bissau indicated that the rebels enjoyed some
support among local people.
	   ``The people were dissatisfied with Vieira long before this
started,'' the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Locals, who view Vieira as corrupt, were also angered by the
deployment of Senegalese troops, he said. The Casamance separatists
enjoy broad support in Guinea-Bissau.
	   A Portuguese Navy frigate, accompanied by marines, was due to
arrive Monday in Guinea-Bissau. Lello told Lusa it would anchor off
the coast and would be used for ``logistic support and as a
communications hub.''
	   The Portuguese Foreign Ministry said the vessels are intended to
evacuate foreigners.

	   GOVERNMENT officials have cast doubts on the efficiency of the
two municipal councils to oversee food safety and environmental
hygiene, especially in matters relating to the mainland.
	   The government's position was revealed by Secretary for
Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen Ming-yeung and his principal
assistant secretary, John Leung Chi-yan.
	   Mr Leung questioned the ability of the councils to take charge
of food safety and environmental hygiene at the City Forum
yesterday.
	   He was responding to a proposal by Provisional Urban Council
chairman Dr Ronald Leung Ding-bong that all work relating to food
safety and environmental hygiene be the responsibility of a body
formed by the merged municipal councils.
	   Dr Leung said doctors should implement policies proposed by the
new body and government officials should be seconded to the
authority.
	   He said his proposal would enable elected councillors to oversee
the work in both food safety and environmental hygiene.
	   In reply, Mr Leung said he would doubt the efficiency of the
municipal councils if Dr Leung's proposal was implemented.
	   ``Issues concerning people's health sometimes need speedy
decisions and it will be more efficient for the government to do
so. Councils may spend more time in discussions before decisions
are made,'' he said after attending the forum.
	   Mr Leung said the government's plan would not be undemocratic
because the Legislative Council and the District Boards could still
monitor the government's performance.
	   Mr Suen questioned Dr Leung's proposal and the council's ability
to represent the Special Administrative Region in discussions with
the relevant mainland health authorities.
	   He denied that the most suitable body to conduct such
negotiations was the SAR Government.
	   ``They (the councillors) should give their comprehensive
proposals to us, including their arrangements for such a
dialogue.'' Mr Suen said he would consider such a proposal because
the government was now listening to the views of the public on the
issue.
	   At the forum, legislator-elect Tang Siu-tong criticised as a
``democratic regression'' the government's proposal to take back
some of the municipal councils' work.
	   Dr Leung said the government was to blame for the fragmentation
of duties.
	   Decades ago the Urban Council was responsible for such work, he
said.

	   WE ARE fast approaching the half-year mark of 1998. It is going
to be almost a year now since the regional currency crisis started.
We are back to RM4 to a US dollar. Those who were beneficiaries of
International Monetary Fund help have new leaders, but their
economies are in no better shape than they were in July last year.
	   In fact, the latest round of currency depreciation occurred only
last week when the Japanese unit dropped to the 144 yen to US$1
mark. With the weakening yen comes new concerns, one of which is
the possibility of another round of attacks on regional currencies
by speculators.
	   Some think we can defend the currency using high interest rates.
We can see what happened to Indonesia which adopted a high interest
rate regime and the Latin American countries during their crises
when rates were 10 per cent a day. Indonesia is back at 13,500
rupiah per US dollar and the Latin American countries had to change
their currencies a few times a year.
	   ``Look East'', a cliche which was very relevant to the economic
development of Malaysia in the 1980s, is probably still apt in
today's economic crisis.
	   For Malaysia, we registered negative 18 per cent growth in the
first quarter of 1998, the first shrinkage in 13 years. Consumer
spending is very weak, capital expenditure has slowed to a trickle,
new loans are taboo, properties are not selling and confidence has
been badly affected.
	   Clearly, some action needs to be taken fast - certainly not the
policies fit for an overheating economy.
	   Faced with the financial crisis, governments all over Asia
appear obsessed with the objective of maintaining stable
currencies. To achieve this, some governments used high interest
rates to attract portfolio funds or short-term capital. On the
surface, it appears to make economic sense.
	   However, countries which adopted this strategy have seen clearly
how it failed miserably. As long as prospects of economic recovery
are not within sight, investors will not be tempted by high
interest rates.
	   The argument that a strong or stable ringgit is needed to
contain inflation is not a strong one, not when the economy is
crashing. Would negative 3 per cent GDP growth and 6 per cent CPI
be considered better than positive 3 per cent GDP growth and 10 per
cent CPI?
	   As we can see, the choice should be quite straightforward.
	   Fear of monetary easing leading to excesses is unnecessary, not
when the plane has crashed. Before it can take off, major repairs
need not to be done. Austerity, as (former US secretary of state)
Dr Henry Kissinger stated, is not the solution out of a crisis -
growth is.
	   How can growth be accomplished when liquidity is being choked.
Companies cannot turn to banks for loans now, they cannot turn to
the market to raise capital too. If consumers are not spending, is
not just the shops which will be closing but also the manufacturers
who supply goods to the shops.
	   Even if interest rates were reduced by 5 per cent overnight,
would consumers go on a spending spree, would banks be keen to even
look at loan applications, would companies be keen to increase
capital spending? There would probably be some spending, lending or
investing if we are lucky.
	   Already, we have seen the victims of budget cuts by companies,
especially in terms of promotion and advertising - no programmes on
public discourse and a popular radio channel was pulled off the
air.
	   What will be achieved by a reduction in interest rates is that
it will give corporations and individuals breathing space to help
them tide over the current economic difficulties.
	   Meanwhile, the stock market should respond positively. As it is
now, not only has the KLSE Composite Index gone into 400s
territory, the possibility of retail investors staying on the
sidelines is very high.
	   Like it or not, retail investors have been a special
characteristic of the Malaysian stock market.
	   In these times they cannot get anymore facilities from the banks
or the stockbrokers. Margins are very restrictive. Institutions are
not that enthusiastic about bargain prices and foreigners seem to
prefer the Latin American markets than those in this region.
	   For us in particular, where external debt is modest, a weak
ringgit, on balance, should be good for Malaysia's overall growth,
particularly export growth.
	   Let us look east again, at the Japanese economy today. After
eight years of economic stagnation, the prospect of a recovery is
still dim. Why? This is because the Bank of Japan, being too
enthusiastic in controlling economic growth and asset inflation,
guided interest rates north and took draconian measures in choking
liquidity from the economic system in 1990 and 1991. When it
realised that the economy was very sick, it panicked and did a
U-turn on monetary policies.
	   Unfortunately, it was done too late to stimulate the economy.
Whatever the Bank of Japan is doing to resuscitate the economy, it
just isn't responding. Isn't this a lesson for all of us?

Thousands of Canadian paper-mill workers go on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ About 5,000 employees of Abitibi-Consolidated,
Canada's largest pulp and paper company, went on strike Monday at
11 paper mills in eastern and central Canada.
	   Issues in the walkout are wages, benefits and pension plan
improvements.
	   Affected by the strike are four paper mills in Ontario, five in
Quebec and two in Newfoundland. Seven other mills in Canada, the
United States and Britain remained in operation, the company said.
	   The Communication, Energy and Paperworkers Union is seeking a
wage increase of dlrs 1.50 (dlrs 1.02 U.S.) an hour in each year of
a three-year contract. An average worker makes about dlrs 25 (dlrs
17 U.S) an hour.

	   THE government should streamline district organisations and
grant them greater autonomy, an academic suggested on Sunday.
	   Under the proposal put forward by Dr Robert Chung Ting-yiu,
research officer of the University of Hong Kong's Social Science
Research Centre, both municipal councils should be merged with the
district boards.
	   The single-tier structure would then be divided into several
units, each to take charge of a geographical division of the
Special Administrative Region.
	   Dr Chung told the City Forum that the SAR government should
increase, not decrease, local autonomy by ``releasing power'' to
the district bodies.
	   The new, single tier structure should play a full role in
governing the districts.
	   In stressing the importance of local autonomy, Dr Chung
criticised the government's consultation paper proposals to take
away the municipal councils' supervisory powers over food safety
and environmental hygiene.
	   He said the government only laid stress on the restoration of
its power from the regional organisations but neglected to release
some of its own power, which he said was essential to political
development.
	   ``Consolidating the participation of the lower hierarchy is very
important to political development and the paper fails to address
this while only emphasising administrative efficiency.
	   ``It also lacks the vision on the link between district
organisations and the higher-level council,'' he said.
	   Then he spelt out his model for the re-organisation: dissolving
the two municipal councils first before 2000, and then transferring
their powers to the district boards.
	   He said the present total number of district board members _ 568
_ was ideal, but the district organisations must be streamlined.
	   After the forum, Principal Assistant Secretary for
Constitutional Affairs John Leung Chi-yan said the government was
not planning to cut the power of the district organisations and
that the consultation paper had suggested increasing the power of
the district boards.
	   Mr Leung revealed that most of the 30 letters received from the
public so far had endorsed the government's proposal to restore its
power over food safety and environmental hygiene works.

	   Sunday's market comment
	   The Union Bangladesh Index lost 0.92% (2.76 points) to close the
day at 296.22. Daily turnover declined slightly by 18%. Profit
taking by the investors was the contributory factor to the fall in
the index. Overall market sentiment was negative as the losers
outnumbered the gainers by 19 to 9. Two issues remained unchanged.
Apex Tannery, being the top loser of the day, dipped 7.16% on
retail selling pressure. Other notable losers of the day were
Eastern Cables (-5.68%), Confidence Cement (-3.95%), and Meghna
Cement (-3.49%). Prime Textile was the top gainer of the day which
added 5.44% on institutional buying pressure. Padma Textile and
Beximco Textile were the other remarkable winners of the day which
appreciated by 1.12% and 0.92% respectively.

	   DIAOYU activists expect a direct confrontation with the Japanese
coastal defence force when they try to land on the disputed island
chain next week.
	   Twenty members of the Action Committee for Defending Diaoyu
Islands will sail there aboard their boat the Diao Yu Tai on 21
June on an annual trip to promote China's claim to the islands.
	   Tsang Kin-shing, the group's deputy commander and a pre-handover
Democratic Party legislator, said they were bracing for the worst
and might lose their ship, which was acquired by the committee last
year for $550,000.
	   ``From past experience, the Japanese guards will not be
well-mannered, they are likely to wreck our ships,'' he said.
	   Members of the expedition yesterday went on a practice cruise
aboard the Diao Yu Tai to Sai Kung.
	   They practised abandoning ship and simulated a landing on a
coastal boulder from a speed boat.
	   The expedition needs $400,000, but so far they have only been
able to raise a quarter of that.
	   Mr Tsang admitted that donations had dropped off.
	   But he maintained that shortage of funds would not stop their
trip.
	   ``We can spend less on food,'' he said, adding that they could
still raise money on their return.
	   Mr Tsang was confident that even if there were a confrontation,
they could still manage to return to Hong Kong _ even if their ship
was rammed or sunk.
	   He would not reveal their contingency plans.
	   Amy Kwan, who is on her fourth trip to the islands, said she
insisted on joining each year despite the harshness of the
expedition.
	   ``In the past, I vomited all the time and could not help much.
	   ``But all these trials are easily forgotten every year when I
start another trip,'' said Ms Kwan, the only female on board.
	   Mr Tsang said their team would include members from Taiwan and
North America. The Diao Yu Tai is expected to take three days to
reach the islands.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Riot police lobbed tear gas to break up
new clashes Monday between English and Tunisian supporters locked
in their third melee in less than 24 hours, as their teams met at
the stadium for a World Cup match.
	   It was the second such clash in less than than three hours.
Police intervened outside the soccer stadium ahead of the 2:30 p.m.
(1230 GMT) game when English hooligans threw bottles at Tunisian
fans.
	   It followed street violence Monday night that cut a path of
destruction through downtown Marseille.
	   Police were seen beating some of the English with sticks before
carting them off. An estimated 10 arrests were made.
	   At about 3 p.m. (1300 GMT), hundreds of drinking troublemakers
clashed, briefly but violently, on the Prado beach where a huge
screen was transmitting the match.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas to separate the two sides. About 300
English jumped barricades used by police to hold them back,
throwing stones and bottles at about 150 Tunisians, eye witnesses
said.
	   Police put a lock on Marseille earlier Monday, bringing in
reinforcements, putting a partial ban on alcohol and searching and
escorting arriving English soccer fans.
	   The measures failed to thwart a flare up.
	   Police arrested 50 people in Monday night's melee that left 37
people injured, local officials said.

	   WHEN the ``Konsep Payung'' or the umbrella concept for the award
of small rural road projects was introduced last year, it was
intended to satisfy all parties connected with such projects.
	   Through it the Government hoped to ensure speedy implementaion
of rural road projects while at the same time encouraging small
Bumiputera contractors to improve their skills through a mentoring
scheme.
	   It was, in part, introduced following complaints from
contractors that district offices were slow in giving out contracts
and were even slower in making payments.
	   The concept was also intended to satisfy the comment by the
Public Account Committee of the Parliament regarding weaknesses in
the open tender system when it come to handling small Government
projects.
	   Under the concept, each state has an established and reputable
contractor, normally in Class A, to handle government contracts of
up to RM15 million in value under rural road projects of the
National and Rural Development Ministry.
	   The principal contractor, being the umbrella holder, is expected
to sub- contract such projects as roads, bridges and related works
to small contractors under their patronage who are usually in the F
Class category.
	   These small contractors are qualified to undertake projects
worth up to RM100,000.
	   It was supposed to produce a win-win situation for the Finance
Ministry, which finances these projects; the National and Rural
Development Ministry as the implementing agency; and the Ministry
of Entrepreneur Development is responsible for helping small
Bumiputera contractors.
	   But on Thursday, proving yet again, that he who holds the
purse-strings usually has the last say, Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Finance Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim announced that the
awarding of contracts under the concept had been stopped.
	   Anwar attributed the decision to complaints of unfair
distribution. He said that feedback from state governments,
district offices and Members of Parliament indicated that there
were problems in the implementation of the scheme.
	   But National and Rural Development Minister Datuk Annuar Musa
and Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed had a
somewhat different view of the situation.
	   Reacting to Anwar's decision, they said they believed that the
complaints came about as a result of a lack of understanding of the
concept.
	   Annuar said the concept was introduced following comments by the
Public Accounts Committee on various weaknesses relating to the
awarding of contracts to build rural roads under the open tender
system.
	   It appears that the demise of the concept is due as much to
bureaucratic expediency as it is to any fundamental reason, unless
of course this is not apparent.
	   As stated by Annuar, it was not true that the main contractors
could give jobs to any Class F contractor as they chose.
	   The selection of successful contractors, according to Annuar,
was determined not by the umbrella holder but by the Treasury.
There we are - the purse-strings holder again.
	   Annuar said contrary to the claims that the concept benefitted
only a small number of Class F contractors, some 700 of them were
expected to secure contracts this year - had it been continued -
compared to 400 under the open tender system.
	   If the complaints that spelt the demise of the concept were
about some small contractors in the districts being left out, the
answer is to ensure that they are included and not to end the
scheme.
	   What guarantee is there that the selection of successful
contractors, which would from now on be handled by district
offices, would be more efficient and fairer than under the umbrella
concept?
	   Or is there another reason for stopping the concept? Could it be
that the cost of projects under the concept is more expensive than
if awarded through the open tender system?
	   It may even be that there is nothing wrong with the ``payung'',
as insisted by Annuar, but with the companies or personalities
appointed to hold it.
	   So an equally appropriate response to the complaints is to
change the umbrella holder and not to fold it up.

	   Bangladesh Rubber Garden Owners Association (BRGOA) has demanded
imposition of 30 per cent duty on the import of raw rubber and
formation of a rubber board to help make the country self reliant
in rubber production.
	   Addressing a post-budget press conference at the National Press
Club yesterday, President of the BRGOA Md Tofazzal Hussain Malik
also proposed that the import of eva, a kind of synthetic used in
making poli-bag and other environment polluting materials, be
discouraged and tariff value on imported raw rubber be re-fixed.
	   Other leaders of the Association, Kazi Shahadat Hussain, Dr Md
Nazim Uddin, Md Salimul Haq and Mirza Anowar were present at the
press conference.
	   Tofazzal Hussain said that the private rubber gardens of the
country would be able to contribute 25 per cent to the total
production which might stand at 6,000 tons this year.
	   He said the import duty on raw rubber had been brought down to
15 per cent from the previous 60 per cent in the last four years
and the tariff value was kept static at US $ 850 per ton.
	   Meanwhile, Raising the demands the planters said this industry
would go into ruins if necessary protection was not provided by the
government.
	   Replying a question, BRGOA President said production of one kg
rubber cost Tk 52 against its market price at Tk 32 to Tk 35 only.
	   They also drew the attention of the Forest and Environment
Minister about the formation of a Rubber Board for proper guidance
and lawful management of rubber cultivation.
	   He said rubber cultivation in private sector began in 1979-80
under the supervision of a standing committee headed by the then
Chittagong Divisional Commissioner.
	   ``The committee did not work as its chairman remained busy with
his official work and did not pay heed to the problems of the
planters,'' alleged the BRGOA President.
	   He, however, said there are 1360 gardens under the standing
committee, of these, 250 are in production while 300 others ready
to produce the agri-product.
	   Some 20,000 workers, including 8,000 casual ones, work in the
private sector, the BRGOA claimed.

	   A COUNTRY as massive as India seldom fails to attract media
attention.
	   Whether it is a general election or a nuclear test, India always
receives extensive coverage in the international news.
	   Many may not know this but cooking oil is also a favourite
subject among many in India. Whenever there is a shortage, cooking
oil can even serve as a platform for politicians to gain public
support. They say, there were time when elections were won or lost
on account of cooking oil.
	   This is also the reason why, irrespective of which government is
in power, problems concerning the supply or price of cooking oil
are always given high priority. They are never treated lighly.
	   Any government which does not give the necessary attention to
such issues may even live to regret it.
	   Since India is such a big country, there are also regional
variations in the eating habits and food preferences among the
populace.
	   Biriyani, for example, is more popular in the north than in the
south.
	   So is the famous tandoori chicken.
	   While in the south, because coconut is abundantly available,
most of the recipes there would have some inclusion of either
coconut oil or the cream. But in the north, use of milk fats is
more prevalent. Even the oil they use for cooking varies from
region to region.
	   In some parts of India, groundnut oil is prefered. Whilst in
other parts, the traditional cooking oil can be mustard or rapeseed
oil.
	   Mustard's pungent odour appeals to some in India. In the south,
coconut oil is more widely consumed than other edible oils.
	   But not everybody in India takes cooking oil in the liquid form.
There are some in the north who would always prefer the solid dairy
ghee, especially when cooking biriyani. They believe biriyani will
not taste the same unless cooked on solid cooking fat like dairy
ghee.
	   However, lately, mainly because of price consideration, ghee
made from vegetable oils, also known as vanaspati, has emerged as a
good substitute for the traditional ghee.
	   Vanaspati can be made either by hardening liquid oils such as
soyabean oil through a process called hydrogenation or they can be
produced straight from semi-solid palm oil.
	   But because vanaspati is so convenient from palm oil, the
hardening route has lost much of its appeal in recent years.
	   Understandably, India has always been striving to grow enough of
its own oil to feed its massive population. The latest population
count suggest India may now have close to one billion people. It is
growing at about 1.8 per cent per year. Almost 17 million people,
equivalent to that in Malaysia, are added every year. The aim
therefore is to always minimise import.
	   This policy of course makes a lot of sense because by so doing
the country is able to save on foreign exchange. The only problem
is that, thre are always limits as to how much one can produce
domestically. For example, it would not make sense to produce
locally at exorbitant cost when there are cheaper imports
available. Fortunately for India, labour is no constraint.
	   But arable land is. Furthermore, only about a quarter of India's
arabvle land is irrigated. In the case of oilseeds, India now has
about 26-27 million ha under oilseeds. But almost 65 per cent are
under rain-fed conditions. Only 35 per cent are irrigated.
	   Land which does not have access to irrigation would always be at
the mercy of the weather. Crops grown on such rain-fed areas are
know to suffer from highly uncertain yiled. Sometimes even the
whole crop can be wiped out because of too little or too much rain.
And the rain must also come at the right time. On many occassions,
weather calamitites have been known to play havoc on crop success.
And this inadvertently affects supply.
	   Not surprisingly, though India is the world's fourth largest
producer of oilseeds, it does not produce enough to meet the ever
expanding local demand for edible oils. And the supply-demand gap
is widening.
	   It has been estimated that India's edible oil demand is rising
at between 5 and 6 per cent per year, on account of increasing
population and per capita income. But growth in the output of the
major oilseeds has been a mere 3.1 per cent in the 1993-1998
period. It used to be higher at about 11 per cent in the period
1988-1993.
	   This was when India actively pursued their special countrywide
programme called the Technology Mission on Oilseeds which strived
to expand oilseed cultivation and production. Admittedly, the
programme was quite successful. But unfortunately, the expansion
was achieved more through adding new land areas rather than through
improved yield.
	   Indian yields have averaged around 800-850kgs per ha and is way
below international norms. In the US and Canada, for example,
yields of the order of 1.5-2 tons per ha are fairly agnant at about
7.5 million tons a year. Import has therefore become inevitable.
	   Fortunately for India, Malaysian palm oil is readily available
close by.
	   The journey from Malaysia to India is so short that in no time
consumers in India are able to replenish their stock. This is also
the basic reason why India prefers to fall back on palm oil from
Malaysia whenever it experiences a shortage rather than to wait for
3 to 4 weeks for an edible oil cargo coming from South America or
even the US.
	   There are other reasons as well. Over the years, vanaspati
manufacturers in India have also come to recognise the technical
advantages of using palm oil rather than resorting to the more
expensive hydrogenation process to make vanaspati.
	   In the south, consumers in India have also come to appreciate
the nutritional merits of using palm oil, especially the liquid
olein fraction in their cooking, not to mention palm olein's
excellent frying characteristics. But most of all, edible oil
traders in India have grown accustomed to the profitable business
possible with palm oil.
	   Admittedly the trade in edible oils between India and Malaysia
has benefitted both parties. Otherwise, the trade would not have
grown the way it did. In fact in the early 80s, India was already a
major market for palm oil buying up to 1 million tons a year.
	   However, between 1988 and 1993 when India managed to expand its
local oilseed production, import demand was reduced. Palm oil
export then witnessed a sizeable drop. This was made worse by the
fact that importation was licensed.
	   Only agencies approved by the Government such as STC and NDDB
were allowed to import. Things changed in 1994 when palm oil import
was placed under the so-called Open General License (OGL). A duty
of 65 per cent as applicable then.
	   But when import was liberalised in 1994, the true market forces
of private enterprise came into play. Palm oil quickly made an
impressive come back. It was not long before import volumes of 1
million tons became commonplace. Of course, the fact that import
duties were further reduced helped. In 1997, the duty came down to
25 per cent.
	   While in the 80s the bulk of India's palm oil import was handled
by STC and NDDB, lately the private sector has assumed a more
dominant role. In fact the private sector may even be credited with
about 85 per cent of the country's edible oil purchase in 1997.
	   Will India continue to count on palm oil to make up for its
shortfall?
	   Admittedly, there are many interest groups in India which can
influence the future position of palm oil.
	   The solvent extractors, for example, have been lobbying the
Government to free oilseed import to help them reduce their
under-utilized crushing capacity. They have also asked the
Government to increase the import duty on edible oils to enjoy some
protection.
	   And recently, the Government did allow the import of one million
tons of soyabeans. But there are as yet no serious takers. The
reasons are obvious. The economies do not favour such an approach.
	   Furthermore, the Government is also concerned about how such
policies will affect the welfare of farmers and consumers. The
solutions are not easy. But the fact that India is also seriously
looking at growing the oil palm is further testimony to the belief
that India may always look to palm oil to supplement its edible oil
shortfall.

Dutch papillon grabs best among 15,600 at largest World Dog Show

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A papillon from Huis ter Heide,
Netherlands, won the Best in Show title at the World Dog Show,
which featured a record 15,628 canines from about 300 breeds.
	   More than 5,000 people packed the Helsinki Fair Center through
Sunday evening, the end of the four-day event, to see the selection
of the immaculate toy spaniel with its silky, black-and-white coat
and drooping ears.
	   Loteki Supernatural Being, owned by John Oulton and Lou Ann
King, competed in the companions and toys class.
	   A deerhound, Kilbourne Quebee, from Someren, Netherlands, was
runner-up in the Best in Show contest. A Finnish wire fox terrier,
Starring Xina, from Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle, was judged
third.
	   ``We were very pleased with the event,'' said Kaija Unhola from
the show committee. ``We broke all records, and attracted more than
50,000 dog owners and enthusiasts. Not a single dog was hurt.''
	   The previous record was in Bern, Switzerland, in 1994, when
15,500 dogs competed.
	   The competitors scratched, barked and wag tails in a hall with
36,000 square meters (43,200 sq. yards) of floor space, and in
tents outside.
	   In addition to the breed competitions, there were agility and
obedience contests, sheep herding, and performing dogs that
belonged to army, police and frontier guards.
	   Draco, an Australian kelpie from Karlskoga, Sweden, won the
obedience test for a second time since clinching the title at an
international dog show in Stockholm in 1995.
	   For many fans, Gira, a Finnish golden retriever stole the show.
She rolled over, walked on her back legs, jumped through hoops,
skipped and counted _ well, barked _ to five on command.
	   ``She's a very intelligent dog, and even knows left from
right,'' said owner Eija Granfelt. ``But she hasn't learned to read
yet.''
	   The event sold out Helsinki hotels, which posted special rates
for dogs of about 25 markaa (dlrs 4.60). Their owners paid about
900 markaa (dlrs 166) a night.
	   Next year, the World Dog Show will be held in Mexico City. In
1997, 1,300 dogs participated in the event held in Puerto Rico.

	   A clash between the members of Khulna District Bar Association
and the employees and staff of the Khulna Collectorate building
housing the magistrates' courts and different government offices
left about 30 injured here this afternoon.
	   The injured persons included about 13 lawyers and nine
government employees. Advocate Kismet Ali who received head
injuries has been admitted to the Khulna General Hospital where at
least 16 others were given first aid.
	   Both the sides are blaming each other for triggering violence.
	   According to Additional Deputy Commissioner (General), ATM
Mohiuddin Ahmed, lawyers aided by some outsiders armed with sticks
and sharp weapons attacked several offices and court rooms. They
caused extensive damages to the doors, windows, furniture,
telephone sets and other fittings on the ground floor, the ADC
said.
	   Five office rooms of the Assistant Commissioner (Land) of Khulna
Sadar, four office rooms of the District Accounts Office, the
office chamber of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, two court
rooms of metropolitan magistrates, Nezarat section of the DC's
office and the court room of the Additional District Magistrate
were ransacked the ADC added.
	   The employees and staff of the Collectorate building have been
accused of hurling brick-bats at the newly constructed office
building of the Khulna Bar Association, shattering most of the
windowpanes on the first floor facing the Collectorate building.
	   According to sources, the relations between the lawyers and the
district administration became strained after the latter took
measures to close the two openings on the eastern boundary wall of
the Collectorate building premises by masonry brickwork's last
month. The openings served as short-cut routes between the two
buildings.
	   Today's clash was the outcome of the disputes centering on the
short-cut routes through the boundary wall, sources said.
	   The newly constructed masonry works closing the openings were
demolished during today's clash, allegedly by the lawyers and some
outsiders.
	   Meanwhile, the lawyers in a meeting held this afternoon at the
Bar Association building with their president Advocate Abdus Salam
in the chair, demanded the removal of Deputy Commissioner Iftekhar
Ahmed and ADC (General) Mohiuddin Ahmed from Khulna within 48
hours.
	   The lawyers also took a decision to boycott all the courts
tomorrow in protest against the attack on the Bar Association
building.

PLO Convenant, scope of third pullback, remain sticking points

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quote &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Disagreement over who will annul the PLO
founding charter and determine the scope of a final West Bank troop
withdrawal are holding up Israeli acceptance of the U.S. peace
initiative, a senior Israeli official said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with key Cabinet ministers
for three hours Monday to discuss the U.S. plan, which calls for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged Netanyahu
to make a decision soon, but informal U.S. deadlines have passed
without U.S. action against Israel. The United States presented its
plan in January, and the Palestinians have accepted it.
	   Israel TV reported Sunday that Netanyahu had agreed to a 13
percent pullback after initially saying he could hand over only 9
percent. Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the
Americans had not informed the Palestinians of any such agreement.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, would not comment
Monday on the report, but suggested that the size of that
withdrawal, the second of three promised by Israel, was no longer
an issue.
	   Netanyahu said that despite the delays, he still expected to
wrap up a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians by May
1999, as scheduled. ``This morning, we weren't just talking about
the second redeployment, but about the whole package which will
hopefully lead to a permanent peace agreement by next year,
provided the Palestinians stick to their commitments,'' he said.

Reform, Conservative Jews accept alternative prayer site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to prevent clashes with ultra-Orthodox
Jews, leaders of the more liberal streams of Judaism agreed Monday
in principle to hold co-ed prayer services in an area of the
Western Wall not normally used for worship.
	   The Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, is a remnant of the
second Jewish Temple that was destroyed in 70 A.D. by the Romans.
	   Israel's religious establishment, which is exclusively Orthodox,
insists that men and women should pray separately at the Wall, with
a partition dividing the sexes.
	   Leaders of the Reform and Conservative streams of Judaism on
Monday toured four sites near the Wall, accompanied by Finance
Minister Yaacov Neeman, who heads a government committee trying to
mediate between the religious establishment and non-Orthodox Jews.
	   Ultra-Orthodox Jews have repeatedly assaulted Reform and
Conservative Jews in the Western Wall with blows, stones and
garbage because men and women were praying together.
	   Reform leader Rabbi Uri Regev and Conservative leader Rabbi Ehud
Bandel said one of the proposed sites, the Herodian Street, could
be an acceptable compromise. The Herodian Street is an extension of
the Wall, but the view is obscured by a ramp and by large boulders
left behind after the destruction of the Temple.
	   Regev rejected the other three sites because they are adjacent
to the Southern Wall of the Temple Mount.
	   ``We would prefer that a section of the traditional site be set
aside for egalitarian (co-ed) prayers, but the Herodian Street
offers a basis for compromise,'' Regev told The Associated Press.
	   The Israel Antiquities Authority is opposed to any of the
alternative sites being used for prayers because they are part of
an archeological park.
	   The Religious Affairs Ministry boycotted Monday's tour. Ministry
spokesman Yair Wolf said the Herodian Street and the Southern Wall
``are just as holy as the Western Wall.'' Wolf said he did not know
whether the ministry would oppose a compromise.
	   No immediate reaction was available from the Chief Rabbinate.
	   Reform and Conservative Jews take a less strict interpretation
of Jewish law than the Orthodox. In Israel, the Reform and
Conservative movements are small, but in the United States they
have more followers than the Orthodox.

	   HARVARD: June in Cambridge is time for celebrations, merrymaking
and parties. Hotel rooms are booked well in advance and the traffic
jams in the city are legendary at this time of the year.
	   It is after all, graduation or commencement, for students at
Harvard.
	   After a year or two of hard work, it is time for the
administration of one of the world's oldest universities to hand
over hard-earned degrees to its students.
	   The relief of having finished the academic work and the joy of
walking on stage to receive the trophy should be the best time for
students - with no more ``problem sets'', no more memos to write,
no more case studies. And yet, this time it is tempered with
dissapointment, frustration and anger for some.
	   This year was particulary difficult for many students from East
Asia, but not exclusively. The currency crisis took its toll on not
only on students from South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and the
Philippines but some some Latin American countries as well.
	   Those from East Asia were suddenly poorer because of the
devaluation of their national currencies due to the currency
crisis. The work of international organisations, some developed
countries, fund managers, rating agencies and currency speculators,
made life for these students even more difficult.
	   In addition to the currency crisis, other students were affected
by the change in governments in their home countries, including
those from Latin America. They found the promise of funds and
financial assistance for their education unfulfilled. For others,
the promise made by their sponsors and corporations were not
forthcoming in time for the deadline.
	   Thus many students found themselves faced with a dilemma of not
graduating. It was not because of their academic performances and
grades, not because of their lack of pleasant personalities, not
because of their extra curricular activities, but because of
finance.
	   It was not because they did not have the funds as in some
instances they were promised but the amounts promised by
organisations and sponsors did not come on time.
	   These students had been assured of prompt funds before they left
home to make their journey to this seat of higher learning, in
search of an education and to widen their horizons. This was
probably the biggest blow and disappointthat anyone can be dealt.
It is akin to a hurdle suddenly being thrown in the way of a 100
metre sprinter and that too in the last 10 meters.
	   The competition is fierce and every one - students, academic
specialists, faculty - agrees that the pressure for graduates and
undergraduates at Harvard is exceptionally high.
	   The students come to Harvard ``electrically charged'' according
to Harvard's President Neil Rudensteine in a recent interview. But
for some the electric plug was pulled out in the end.
	   Students at Harvard do not graduate if they owe the University
money and do not settle all their dues by a predetermined deadline.
Therefore some of them found themselves faced with a dilemma -
having fulfilled the academic requirements, and in some cases doing
very well, but having the degree ``robbed'' from them at the last
minute.
	   Fortunately for some, where their organisations and sponsors
failed them, their new found friends and fellow students stepped in
to help. It is a sad commentary that people whom the students have
only known for a year or two are willing to help whereas the
corporations with which some of these ``students'' had worked with
for several years, would let them down despite the promises made
earlier.
	   Harvard also pitched in. With an endowment of US$13 billion
(US$1  &QC;  RM4.10), making it one of the richest universities, it
gives loans and grants to needy students. Direct grants average
US$14,500 and all grant recipients also receive loans which average
US$4,500.
	   In some cases, the bureaucracy is to be blamed for the
unnecessary anxiety and stress, while in others it was sheer
incompetence. It is a situation which lends itself to a case study
at the Kennedy School of Government and perhaps even at the Harvard
Business School.

	   CAPTAIN Greg Gibbins, the first commercial airline pilot to land
at both Kai Tak and Chek Lap Kok, looks forward to the
``challenges'' at Hong Kong's new airport, but admits he'll miss
the thrill of touchdown at Kai Tak.
	   Capt Gibbins, 45, Cathay Pacific's Chief Pilot, flew the 747-200
Spirit of Hong Kong into Chek Lap Kok last month and was the first
pilot to land a jumbo jet on the new runway.
	   Smaller aircraft had landed at the new international airport in
the past, but the Spirit of Hong Kong, Cathay's handover
commemoration jet with Hong Kong's skyline painted on its side,
marked the first major landing there.
	   ``It was exciting, thrilling. It's not often in your aviation
career you get to do something that no one else has done. I guess I
think of it as Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame,'' Capt Gibbins
fondly reminisces his historic landing.
	   Describing Kai Tak as being ``more like a country flying club
that happens to be an international airport'', he says he and
fellow pilots will miss it and its unusual landing strip.
	   Cited on some listings as one of the world's most hazardous
international airports to land at, Kai Tak demands the greatest
care and skill, and pilots around the world have to pass a test
before being allowed to land there _ a requirement that lends a
certain aura to those who can.
	   ``With aircraft getting more modern and technologically quite
advanced, there are fewer and fewer challenges on your actual
flying abilities, your skills.
	   ``You have to develop other skills with the technology, but for
pure flying skills, there are very few airports these days that
test out your flying skills and Kai Tak is one of them,'' Capt
Gibbins said as he prepares to move his team of 1,400 pilots and
flight engineers to Chek Lap Kok.
	   ``There will still be challenges at CLK _ any landing or
takeoff, anything to do with aviation, is a challenge. It's not
just a matter of not having to do the `turn'.'' For passengers, Kai
Tak's celebrated ``turn'', skims passengers just feet above Kowloon
City before lining up for touchdown.
	   But pilots take a different view of why the airport has a
notorious tag.
	   ``The reason Kai Tak gets that black rating is because of the
proximity of the runway and taxiway. It has little to do with the
approach into Kai Tak,'' Capt Gibbins said.
	   At Chek Lap Kok, the biggest challenge will be wind, as the
airport is exposed to the elements and has little shelter at its
Lantau Island location.
	   To land there, pilots will need to be briefed only on the
landing technique.
	   ``It's very easy (for Cathay Pacific pilots) because this is our
home base. You have to brief it yourself plus do a physical entry.
Being our home base, the physical entry is quite easy, we do it
during our training, but with other operators, they have to fit it
in with the requirements in their own way,'' Capt Gibbins said.
	   He first landed at Kai Tak in 1981, when he flew a Boeing 707
into Hong Kong as a Royal Australian Airforce pilot.
	   He admits, though, that his first landing at Kai Tak has not
been burnt into his memory.
	   ``It was different. I think you are concentrating so hard on
trying to do everything correctly, you forget about what else is
happening and all the dangers. You're more intent on doing the job
rather than other things.''

World Cup: Dutch coach writes organizers about Kluivert incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ Guus Hiddink has written to FIFA ``explaining the
circumstances'' leading up to Dutch foward Patrick Kluivert's
sending off Saturday against Belgium, the Netherlands coach said
Monday.
	   Kluivert was ejected from Saturday's World Cup Group E match
with lowlands rival Belgium with nine minutes remaining in the 0-0
draw after elbowing Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens in the chest.
	   He was suspended for the remainder of the first round by FIFA on
Sunday.
	   Hiddink did not say when he faxed his letter to organizers and
added he was not trying to appeal the suspension.
	   ``I just wanted to explain the circumstances,'' he told
reporters following the Dutch team's first training session in this
tiny principality on France's Cote D'Azure.
	   Kluivert said he has accepted his suspension and was
concentrating on staying sharp for the second round.
	   ``I just hope that the team goes through and that I can rejoin
the team,'' he said.
	   The AC Milan striker claims Staelens taunted him with personal
insults, but he refused to elaborate.
	   ``It was extraordinarily mean and rude,'' Kluivert said Sunday.
``It had to do with situations that I have known in my private
life. His remarks were below the belt, but I should have controlled
myself.''
	   In May 1996, the 21-year-old Kluivert was convicted of vehicular
homicide after slamming a borrowed BMW into another car, killing
its driver. Kluivert was ordered to perform 240 hours community
service.
	   And earlier this year, Kluivert was not charged after being
accused of being involved in a gang rape by a woman he picked up
outside an Amsterdam nightclub. Prosecutors dropped the case for
insufficient evidence.
	   Kluivert said Hiddink knows what Staelens said in the exchange
that preceded the sending off, but did not know whether he had
included the comments in his letter to FIFA.
	   Hiddink also declined to provide details of his letter.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The battered Serbian province of
Kosovo held its breath Monday in what appeared a brief respite in
violence as NATO warplanes roamed the skies of neighboring Albania
and Macedonia.
	   Eighty-four aircraft from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries were
conducting several hours of exercises in the two Balkan countries
in hopes of intimidating the Yugoslav president by showing how
quickly and powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces
if needed.
	   The governments of Albania and Macedonia agreed late last week
to allow their territory to be used for the exercise ordered by
Allied defense ministers Thursday.
	   Fearing the conflict could spill over into neighboring Albania
and Macedonia, Western nations warned Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic last week to change his hard-line policy or face the
threat of force.
	   Speaking to reporters in Rome at a U.N. conference for an
international criminal court, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said he hoped that the ``pressures that are being put on the
parties, particularly President Milosevic, will be successful.
...''
	   ``It is important that we remain firm and resolute in the face
of what is happening in Kosovo and Serbia. We know what happened in
Bosnia and we cannot sit back and let it be repeated.''
	   In Skopje, Macedonia, a senior western diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said any attack by Serbian security forces
on the Kosovo town of Djakovica would act as ``a tripwire'' to
increase the chance of NATO intervention in Kosovo.
	   He said refugees from other parts of Kosovo have swollen the
population of Djakovica to as much as 80,000 or 100,000 now from
about 60,000 before fighting began.

	   BNP abstains, demands implementation of four-point accord
	   Parliament Sunday began discussion on the supplementary budget
for 1997-98 fiscal year without the main opposition BNP in the
House.
	   Initiating the discussion on the supplementary budget, Jatiya
Party members strongly criticised the government for raising prices
of electricity, gas etc through executive orders (SROs)
side-tracking Parliament.
	   Defending the supplementary budget, Treasury Bench members said
the government succeeded in saving money of the original budget
through good economic management.
	   Akhtaruzzaman, Whip Abdus Shahid, Whip Mizanur Rahman Manu and
Prof Panna Kaiser of Awami League and GM Qader of Jatiya Party took
part in the discussion before the House was adjourned to meet at 2
pm today (Monday).
	   Akhtaruzzaman said unlike the previous regimes, the present
government has saved nearly Tk 44 crore from the original budget of
Tk 14,544 crore in 1997-98 because of its efficient management.
	   He referred to the economic turmoil in Asian countries like
Indonesia, Philippines and even in Japan and said Bangladesh has
been able to keep its economy stable.
	   Whip Abdus Shahid said there is not enough points for discussion
on the supplementary budget which was required because of
enhancement of salary of the government officials and employees and
increase in the prices of fuel.
	   Whip Mizanur Rahman Manu termed the budget for the outgoing year
a surplus budget. The revised budget of 1997-98 stood at Tk 14,500
crore from original budget of Tk 14,544 crore.
	   He said despite deficit in Aman production, the rate of GDP has
been maintained at an acceptable level following industrial
production.
	   GM Qader of Jatiya Party questioned the wisdom of discussion on
the budget when the government side-tracked Parliament in raising
the prices of essential services through SROs.
	   He suggested that elected representatives be taken into
confidence and discuss in Parliament before raising the prices of
any commodities.
	   Meanwhile, The Bangladesh Nationalist Party wants the
implementation of the four-point accord signed by it and the ruling
Bangladesh Awami League for the creation of a congenial atmosphere
in Parliament.
	   A four-member delegation of the BNP led by Prof. Badruddoza
Chowdhury, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, conveyed this to
Speaker Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury when it called on him at his
chamber yesterday. The BNP lawmakers continued to stay away from
the House yesterday.
	   The BNP Parliamentary Party adjourned its meeting for the second
consecutive day yesterday without deciding whether the party would
join the session today. The meeting held with its leader Begum
Khaleda Zia in the chair would resume at 3 P.M. today, one hour
after the resumption of the session of Parliament.
	   Chief Whip of the Opposition Khondker Delwar Hossain told
newsmen that a majority of the members wanted the implementation of
the four-point accord. He, however, hastened to add that they had
put no precondition to their going back to the House.
	   The Speaker said that he would communicate the demands made by
the BNP leaders to the treasury bench and might invite leaders of
the two parties to a meeting to resolve the issue.
	   Khondker Delwar Hossain said they told the Speaker that the
government did not implement the four-point accord and did not make
the Manik Mian Avenue available for public meetings. Instead of
withdrawing political cases, the government had filed new cases, he
alleged.
	   The BNP delegation protested against the stoppage of live
broadcast of proceedings of Parliament.
	   It said that four committees constituted by the Speaker and 12
standing committees on ministries were not reconstituted in keeping
with their demand. He said that the government had nominated BNP
members to those committees disregarding the nominations made by
the party.
	   The BNP leaders demanded a fresh meeting of the Business
Advisory Committee because its last meeting was held on June 9
during the BNP's programme of long march. The meeting had not been
deferred although a written request had been made for this,
Khondker Delwar Hossain said.
	   The BNP delegation requested the Speaker to fix the half-an-hour
time for unscheduled discussion after the question hour everyday
instead of allowing it after completing the day's business because
the House might not have quorum at late hours.
	   Humayun Rasheed told newsmen that he would reconstitute four
committees as demanded by the BNP leaders. He would pass on the
demand for the reconstitution of the 12 standing committees on
ministries to the government. ``I have no power to implement this
demand even though I may have influence on the treasury bench,''
the Speaker said.
	   He told a questioner that he might call a fresh meeting of the
Business Advisory Committee of Parliament for the allocation of
time for business. The discussion on the budget would last 40
hours, he said.
	   The Speaker said he would have discussion with the treasury
bench before fixing the time for the half-an-hour unscheduled
discussion in the House.
	   Yesterday's meeting of the BNP Parliamentary Party began with
Khondker Delwar Hossain briefing it on the outcome of the meeting
with the Speaker. The meeting was addressed by KM Obaidur Rahman,
Fazlur Rahman Patal, Ruhul Quddus Talukdar Dulu, Ziaul Huq Zia,
Mashiur Rahman, and Nazimuddin Alam among others.

	   AT A time when most travel agencies are bereft of new ideas, Mr
Chew Ling Ping, in the effort to cope with the economic problems
besetting the region, has come up with a new innovative marketing
tool guaranteed to draw more travellers to stay in local hotels.
	   The managing director of Johor-based EZZ Travel Sdn Bhd has
produced a book full of vouchers that entitles purchasers to
special room rates at about 100 hotels and resorts throughout the
country.
	   ``If you look at the vouchers, you will find that there are some
hotels offering up to 70 per cent off their tariff room rates,'' he
told Business Times.
	   However, Chew said, there will be periods when the room rates
published in the vouchers appear to be slightly higher than that
quoted in newspapers, especially when the hotels themselves are
offering special promotions.
	   ``But we have the hotels' commitment that the special offer and
promotions will be for a short period of time, between one month
and two months, to avoid a conflict of interest,'' he said.
	   Priced at RM29 per book, the book of vouchers titled
``Malaysia's Greatest Bargain'' is currently only available through
EZZ Travel which is in Segamat, Johor.
	   ``We are negotiating with several retailers to have the book
vouchers distributed for sale in book stores, duty-free shops,
petrol kiosks and convenience stores throughout the country.
	   ``In fact, we are also planning to sell the book vouchers in
Singapore in two weeks and Hong Kong in July,'' he said, adding
that he is currently in discussions with some retailers in these
two countries.
	   Apart from hotels and resorts, Chew said he also managed to
attract a few restaurants and retail shops in Cameron Highland to
participate in the programme this time around.
	   Chew conceptualised the plan to create book vouchers in December
last year. It took three months to complete.
	   ``Most of that time were spent negotiating with local hoteliers
and resort owners, whose business has been lackluster in recent
months, to participate in this programme,'' he said.
	   Chew came up with the idea as the economic turmoil had adversely
affected Ezz Travel's overall sales.
	   ``We wanted to create something which will boost our sales in
the domestic tourism market, in particular,'' he said.
	   The travel agency had experienced a 60 per cent drop in its
overall sales in the past six months.
	   ``Our target market is the middle-income group and we aim to
publish about 50,000 book vouchers,'' he said.
	   Since its launch two weeks ago, the travel agency has sold
nearly 500 book vouchers, mainly to its Johor-based clients.
	   Chew feels that the book vouchers will start to pay off mightily
in the months ahead.
	   Most of the vouchers are valid up to March 31 1999.
	   ``We are looking at bulk purchases from big corporations and
government agencies such as the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board,''
he added.
	   The travel agency is also producing its second edition of
``Malaysia's Greatest Bargain'', which is expected to have some 300
hotels and resorts participation.
	   ``I hope to include retail outlets, shopping arcades, eateries,
duty-free shops and theme parks in the second edition,'' he said.
	   The vouchers in the second edition will be valid from April 1
1999 to the year 2000.

	   THE opening of Chek Lap Kok will likely be delayed for a week if
a black rainstorm like that of last Tuesday strikes the day before
the 6 July opening.
	   The Airport Authority, which had earlier announced a contingency
plan should a typhoon hit Hong Kong on 6 July, said other bad
weather conditions which could pose a safety threat would also lead
to the airport's delayed opening.
	   ``Any weather conditions that could lead to safety implications
will be taken into account. Our primary concern is safety,'' a
spokesman for the authority said.
	   Black rainstorms, flooding, typhoons and other hazardous
conditions could lead to a disruption of the carefully orchestrated
changeover of Hong Kong's international airport from Kai Tak to
Chek Lap Kok.

South Korea's richest man to herd 500 cows into hungry North Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Sixty-five years ago, a 17-year-old
boy sold one of his impoverished family's cows, stole the money,
fled home and went on to become the richest man in South Korea.
	   On Tuesday, Chung Ju-yung, 82, founder and owner of the giant
Hyundai group, was to return to his hometown in North Korea,
herding 500 cows as a gift across the world's most heavily guarded
border.
	   ``I always feel sorry for my father for that,'' Chung said in a
recently published autobiography, recalling the day he fled his
home in 1933. ``My heart is always filled with longing for my
father.''
	   After stealing the money from the sale of the family cow, Chung
fled to the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with the thought
of studying to become a lawyer.
	   Instead, he went into business and built Hyundai, South Korea's
largest conglomerate, with more than 50 subsidiaries producing
everything from cars and computer chips to ships and steel.
	   The cows are part of a gift Chung has offered in exchange for an
eight-day visit to North Korea. He already has shipped 10,000 tons
of corn and is committed to provide an additional 500 cows and
40,000 tons of corn.
	   The total value of Chung's gift is estimated at 12 billion won
(dlrs 8.5 million).
	   A convoy of 50 Hyundai trucks loaded with the cows was to leave
Chung's farm on the west coast shortly after midnight on a
nine-hour journey to the border village of Panmunjom, where the
transfer was to be made.
	   Each truck flew the Red Cross and Hyundai flags and carried huge
placards showing that the cows were donations from Chung.
	   Although the cows will do very little to ease chronic food
shortages in North Korea, their cross-border trip was seen as a
symbolic effort to open the reclusive nation to the rest of the
world.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945 and they fought a devastating, three-year
war that ended in 1953 without a peace treaty. Their sealed border
is guarded by nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   It will be Chung's second trip to North Korea. When he visited
in 1989, his father had already died years earlier. During that
trip, he agreed to several joint venture projects with the North,
including a tourist resort.
	   Chung will be the first South Korean civilian to cross the
border into North Korea unaccompanied by government officials.
North Korea usually insists that visitors enter via Beijing, almost
never from South Korea.
	   Even former U.S. President Jimmy Carter had to enter North Korea
via Beijing when he traveled to the Stalinist state to meet with
its late president, Kim Il Sung, in 1994.
	   Chung will be accompanied by nine family members. Six other
members of his entourage, mostly Hyundai executives, flew to North
Korea via Beijing Monday to join the Chung family later.
	   Chung's trip comes as South Korea's new government of President
Kim Dae-jung is trying to induce its northern rival toward
reconciliation and peace.
	   Under its ``sunshine policy,'' the Kim government has pledged to
promote non-governmental exchanges between the two sides. It has
lifted virtually all restrictions on civilian business exchanges.
	   In North Korea, Chung plans to discuss, among other things, a
project to develop scenic Diamond Mount on the east coast as
another tourist destination, Hyundai officials said.

	   THE government will begin accepting tender bids at the end of
the month from contractors willing to carry out decontamination and
demolition work at the soon-to-be-closed Kai Tak airport.
	   The tender invitation is to be gazetted on 26 June, or within a
week of that date, officials said.
	   The contract is expected to be worth between $200 million and
$250 million, with about $60 million earmarked for the
decontamination project.
	   Work on the project is due to begin in September and continue
for two and a half years.
	   This contract will concentrate on the decontamination of the
soil in the northern apron of the airport and demolition of
buildings in that area.
	   Another contract for work in cleaning, draining and refilling
the heavily polluted Kai Tak nullah will begin next year.
	   James Chan Shiu-on, chief engineer, Kowloon development office,
Territory Development Department, said: ``We will try to clean up
the area of the north apron of Kai Tak airport, an area of more
than 150 hectares.
	   ``The contract is two-fold. One is decontamination of the area
and, second, to prepare the site for future development.'' Many of
the existing buildings on the north apron will be demolished and
the apron flap will be dug up.
	   Work on the nullah is expected to begin in the middle of next
year, to allow time for cargo handlers at Kwun Tong to move out and
to divert storm water outlets.
	   The government is seeking contractors with experience not only
in demolition work, but also in decontamination.
	   Examinations of the site have revealed leakage of aviation fuel
and other contaminants under the north apron.
	   Among the toxins found in the soil and water were petroleum,
benzine and methane. The more volatile pollutants will be extracted
by blowing air into the soil. Less dangerous ones will be injected
with oxygen to remove toxicity.
	   Exposure to the contaminants could lead to risks including
cancer, Mr Chan said.
	   The Environmental Protection Department will monitor the removal
of toxins and the various clean-up operations required to make the
Southeast Kowloon Development site habitable.
	   The government expects about 10 years will be needed to
redevelop the entire site, but expects people to begin moving in
before 2006. Kai Tak and the associated redevelopment will
accommodate more than 300,000 people.
	   Building height restrictions enforced in the area, because of
its proximity to the airport, will be lifted.

Space officials say they lack money to change Mir's orbit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with space officials saying they lack money
for the maneuver, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hours after announcing that the Mir space station
will start a slow descent this week in preparation for being
discarded, space officials said Monday they lacked money for the
maneuver.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency initially quoted Viktor Blagov, deputy
head of Mission Control Center, as saying that a cargo ship
attached to Mir will fire its engines on Thursday to lower the
station's orbit by about six kilometers (four miles).
	   Several hours later ITAR-Tass quoted Blagov as saying the cargo
ship must remain linked to Mir for longer than expected because the
space agency cannot afford to send a replacement. That will use up
all the cargo ship's fuel, leaving none for the descent maneuver.
	   Even without the maneuver, Mir will likely lower its orbit to
the same degree early next month, Blagov said. The cargo ship would
provide more control over the descent.
	   Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin confirmed that the
maneuver scheduled for Thursday was canceled, but would not comment
on the reasons behind the decision.
	   Several cargo ships, docked to Mir one at a time, are supposed
to push the space station down from 400 kilometers (250 miles)
above Earth to 120 kilometers (75 miles), before it burns up in the
atmosphere in December 1999. A few large fragments are likely to
fall into the ocean.
	   The next cargo ship is now scheduled to be launched in
September, instead of August.
	   Yuri Semyonov, head of the state-run RKK Energiya corporation
that built Mir and has been running it since it was put in orbit in
1986, has said Russia might be forced to discard the station as
early as this fall because of the space industry's desperate cash
shortage.
	   Semyonov said last week that the government owes Energiya 440
million rubles (dlrs 70 million) from last year and hasn't paid any
bills so far this year.
	   According to Blagov, Russia will need four regular cargo ships
to gradually lower Mir's orbit and a fifth one, with a larger
amount of fuel, to give the station a final farewell push.
	   If Mir's orbit isn't controlled, the 130-ton station will fall
back to Earth within two years on its own and some big pieces could
hit populated areas, space officials warned.
	   Russia hopes to keep Mir in orbit until 1999, when it will be
replaced by the international space station.

	   FIVE people were knocked down outside a Wan Chai showroom by a
new Mazda saloon taken on a test run by a salesman.
	   The accident occurred outside a Mazda dealership at Gloucester
Road, police said.
	   A police spokesman said: ``The driver attempted to park the
vehicle on the pavement, but the vehicle rushed forward and hit the
embankment and then hit the pedestrians.'' The vehicle had just
been returned to the dealer's premises after a test by a
prospective buyer when the salesman, Chow Chun-ming, 30, took the
driver's seat and tried to drive it back into the showroom.
	   As he attempted to reverse the car along the pavement, the
vehicle sped forward, hit the outer wall of the Luk Kwok Hotel and
rebounded, hitting the victims who were then on their way from a
buffet lunch at a nearby restaurant.
	   Those injured included a 66-year-old woman Cheng Chi-fai, and
her two daughters, and two boys aged 8 and 16, the sons of the
Cheng family's friends.
	   Mrs Cheng, who suffered leg and hand injuries, was on Sunday
transferred to Pamela Nethersole Eastern Hospital, while the young
boy, was transferred to Queen Mary Hospital. Both remained in
stable condition last night.
	   The other three were discharged after receiving medical
treatment at Tang Shiu Kin Hospital.
	   An employee at the dealership said on Sunday night the vehicle
had been towed away to be examined by police experts.

	   Dr Nabi Alam Khan, Professor Emeritus has expressed his
gratitude to the government for restoring his job.
	   Dr Khan was given forced retirement in August in 1993 during the
BNP regime. The present government appointed him a Professor
Emeritus this year after restoring his service at the Suhrawardi
Hospital.
	   With the return of Prof Nabi Alam Khan much enthusiasm has been
created among the doctors, patients and the employees of the
Suhrawardi Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Disease.
	   Nabi Alam Khan, a renowned heart surgeon in the country is one
of the pioneers of heart surgery in Bangladesh after the
independence, has been given the responsibility to lead the Unit-4
of the surgery Wing of the hospital under which open heart, by-pass
and close heart operations are done regularly.
	   ``I am really happy with the chance of serving the patients who
have long been suffering from acute heart ailment,'' Prof Nabi Alam
Khan said while talking to The Independent. ``This government has
honoured me and I am working with high satisfaction,'' he said.
	   The hospital sources said the open heart surgery became
impossible in absence of Nabi Alam Khan and with his restoration of
his service in the hospital a full-scale operation started again.
	   ``There is a frequent visit programmes by foreign experts to the
hospital and the doctors and nurses of the hospitals were getting a
unique opportunity to exchange views, ideas and experience which
will certainly help our doctors and nurses,'' Nabi Alam Khan said.

	   CHIEF executive officers (CEOs) of local manufacturing companies
must start addressing the Year 2000 problem or ``Millennium Bug''
before it is too late, Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM)
president Paul Low Seng Kuan said.
	   ``We cannot wait anymore. We have less than two years to solve
this problem and it will get worse,'' he told Business Times.
	   He urged CEOs not to treat the Y2K problem as an issue which can
be simply referred to the information technology (IT) people.
	   ``It requires the CEOs' full-hearted involvement as they are
accountable for their business and its survival,'' he said.
	   He said manufacturers' action on the subject has been dismally
poor.
	   ``This is worrying. Although numerous articles on the Y2K issue
have been written, the reason why many CEOs have not taken action
to solve the problem is that they still do not understand the
serious implications this would have.
	   ``Another problem is that articles on Y2K are published in the
computer section of a newspaper which is mainly read by the IT
people,'' he added.
	   Low said many CEOs are still unable to recognise the seriousness
of the Y2K problem which, if left unattended, may give rise to
severe disruptions to their business.
	   ``If you use the number of members who have surfed into FMM's
Internet home page as a yardstick, you will find that only about 15
per cent of the total members are aware of this problem.
	   ``Of this total, we have yet to take into consideration the
number of them who are actually doing something to tackle the
issue,'' he said.
	   The Y2K problem arises from the use of electronic equipment and
computerised systems, databases and applications that need to know
the date to operate and store or use those dates as two digits (for
example, 00) rather than four (for example, 1900, 2000).
	   As the year 2000 approaches, many computerised systems may well
respond as if it was 1900 again. This may expose users to the risks
of system failures, potentially at a catastrophic level.
	   ``Failure to fix the Y2K problem would lead to the failure of
the companies' business systems, computer systems and programmes,
and electronically controlled equipment.
	   ``Ultimately your customers may take their business elsewhere,
your suppliers may refuse to supply you on the basis that they are
unsure if they will be paid, your bank may refuse to provide
financial support and the Government may bar you from tendering if
you are not compliant,'' he said.
	   Low said he believes forcing the CEOs to address the Y2K problem
is necessary to overcome their lackadaisical attitude.
	   ``If not, they will continue to think they have ample time to do
so and will not appreciate how serious this problem is. Before
long, you'll see everyone rushing to fix the problem at the
eleventh hour,'' he said.
	   Low therefore believed that it is now the time for the
Government to play a more active role in raising awareness among
the CEOs by launching a nationwide publicity campaign, similar to
that of road safety campaigns.
	   ``The Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Ministry, for
example, can ask the companies whether they are Y2K compliant or
not. I believe that would get everyone to talk seriously about it,
at least for the next six months,'' he said.
	   He said banks can also help in raising awareness by ensuring
that a company is Y2K compliant before a loan is approved. ``I
think this would help give the CEOs a jolt.''
	   Unlike the quality issue, he added, the Y2K problem is much more
complex because it has a deadline. ``We can't afford to mull over
the issue with the clock ticking.''
	   Low foresaw the consequences emerging from the problem if
everyone were to leave it to the last minute.
	   ``This causes two problems. First, there might not be enough
resources to cope with a sudden surge in demand. The experts would
either be too occupied or fully-booked.
	   ``The second problem is that you might not have a lead time to
order and change the hardware configuration at the last minute,''
he added.
	   Low said he will be writing letters to CEOs of local
manufacturing companies to bring the matter to their attention.
	   ``I will also go on a roadshow and speak to all FMM branch heads
to fan interest among members over the next one to two months,'' he
said.
	   Meanwhile, FMM is already seeking the expertise of the
Government of Western Australia to set up a consortium ``dedicated
to solving the Y2K problem in the manufacturing sector''.
	   ``The proposed consortium will comprise about six to seven IT-
and legal- based companies from both Malaysia and Western
Australia. This will include FMM,'' he said.
	   ``So far, we have yet to identify the local companies for the
consortium, but we hope to get the involvement of as many local
companies as possible,'' he said, adding that he expects to set up
the proposed consortium in the next one to two months.
	   Why Western Australia? ``We believe it is one of the two
countries in the world which are actively doing something to
resolve the Y2K problem. The other country is the US.''
	   Low said one of the key tasks of the proposed consortium is to
ensure that the fees to fix the Y2K problem will remain at a
reasonable level, especially for FMM members.

	   Institute of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh (IDEB) has expressed
deep concern over the collapse of gas pipeline at Bangabandhu
Jamuna bridge.
	   The IDEB has raised some questions regarding the collapse
following an instant investigation.
	   The IDEB raised questions as to whether the original design and
specification for installation of the 30' diameter pipeline was
followed properly, whether the contracting firm Hyundai was
pre-qualified for the installation of gas pipeline and whether the
bridge authority was convinced of the prior experience and
qualification of the consultant CSC of consultancy in gas pipeline
installation.
	   Meanwhile, Bangladesh Truck Malik Samity has called a 48 hour
truck strike on June 17 and 18 to press home its 11 point demands.
	   The demands of the Samity include lowering of the toll rate in
Jamuna bridge to the level of the ferry fare at Bhuapur, bringing
back the insurance rate of the commercial vehicles to the previous
level, fitness and route permit to all registered mini trucks,
stoppage of overload carrying in truck and carrying commercial
goods on the roof of the buses and cancellation of the new system
of inspection of vehicle for renewal of route permit.

	   SELFISH attitudes among Hong Kong people were even more rife now
than before the handover last year, a religious leader said on
Sunday.
	   Reverend Kwok Nai-wang, director of the Hong Kong Christian
Institute, said factors like the increasing gap between the rich
and poor and the public's apparent lack of interest in democracy
were breeding an uncaring society.
	   He blamed the current political leaders for not addressing the
problems but also said a culture of selfishness was fostered under
British colonial rule.
	   ``Too many people now just think life is about every man for
himself rather than realising we live in a society and should look
after one another.
	   ``These attitudes definitely seem to be getting worse since the
handover on 30 June last year.'' In the Hong Kong Christian
Institute's annual report 1996-7, Rev Kwok blasted the government
for not listening to the views of the population.
	   He also blamed them for trying to curb civil, political and
academic liberties.
	   ``The HKSAR Government has shown itself eager to second guess
what the mainland leaders may wish to accomplish in Hong Kong.
	   ``Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and his close advisers are quick
to silence people who hold different views,'' he said.

Chinese leader calls on Japan to stimulate economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's top legislator urged Japan Monday to
stabilize its economy, saying the weakening Japanese yen was
putting increased pressure on Asia's already battered economies.
	   The call for action from Li Peng, the ruling Communist Party's
most senior leader after President Jiang Zemin, reflected Chinese
government nervousness about the sliding yen, which fell below 146
yen to the U.S. dollar Monday.
	   Japan is a major Chinese trading partner. The weaker yen is
making it tougher for China to export to Japan and attract Japanese
investment. Chinese exports to Japan fell 1.7 percent in the first
quarter of 1998, while imports climbed 4 percent.
	   Li, who heads China's parliament, the National People's
Congress, called for ``effective measures'' to shore up the
Japanese economy, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The yen's slide ``has imposed a new pressure on the economies in
Asia'' that already have suffered ``a big impact'' from the
region's financial crisis, Li said.
	   The Xinhua report did not say whether Li repeated earlier
Chinese government pledges not to devalue the yuan. Beijing's
decision not to devalue has been widely credited with having helped
prevent further slides in Asian economies.
	   China's central bank governor, Dai Xianglong, has criticized
Japan for not stabilizing the yen's value against the dollar.
	   On Monday, the central bank's newspaper, the Financial News,
blamed both the United States and Japan for allowing ``the yen to
depreciate without making any efforts'' to bolster it.
	   Their inaction has sent a signal to financial markets and
hastened the yen's tumble, the newspaper said.

Turkey uncovers missile carriers aboard Maltese ship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Turkey finding missile carriers, TV images of
cargo, ADDs background, CORRECTS in 2nd graf ship stopped Sunday,
sted Monday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GELIBOLU, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities on Monday found seven mobile
missile launching pads aboard a Maltese-flagged cargo ship that was
stopped on suspicion of carrying missile parts to Cyprus, the
semi-official Anatolia news agency said.
	   The Natasha-1 was stopped at the mouth of Dardanelles Strait,
linking the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, on Sunday evening by
the Turkish coast guard. Officials suspected it was carrying parts
of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Turkey has vowed to take military action if the missiles are
installed by the Greek Cypriots, claiming they are a threat to
Turkish Cypriots in the north and Turkey itself. Cyprus claims the
missiles are merely defensive.
	   It was not clear if the missile pads were destined for Cyprus.
The ship, coming from Russia, had declared its cargo as tractors
and cars for Egypt.
	   In a similar incident last year, Turkey found missile parts
aboard an Egyptian ship but released it after Cairo confirmed that
the arms belonged to Egypt.
	   Private TGRT television showed images of olive-green military
trucks in the lower cargo section of the Natasha-1.
	   Turkey stepped up its surveillance in its waters to prevent the
shipment of the Russian made anti-aircraft missile parts to Cyprus
after reports last week that radars and control panels for five
S-300 missile systems had reached Cyprus by sea.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkey sent in troops in 1974
after an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. Only
Turkey recognizes the Turkish Cypriot state.

	   THE current regional economic crisis will not hinder the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation's (Apec) move towards transparent and
paperless customs procedures among its member countries.
	   United Parcel Service (UPS) vice president for Customhouse
Brokerage Philip W. Hughes said as the economic problem is seen as
a ``temporary phenomenon'', it will be a matter of time before the
move towards transparency of customs procedure accelerates.
	   He said when regional economies stabilise, all issues addressed
at the Apec Customs-industry forums will be more relevant and
pertinent.
	   He was speaking to Business Times at the sidelines of the Apec
Custom- Industry Dialogue (Acid) in Kuala Lumpur recently.
	   UPS regional director for global facilitation and Customs
operations (Asia Pacific region) James Goh said the economic
problem may affect only the technological side of the customs
procedures.
	   ``The simplication of the customs procedures will move forward
...
	   customs officials in Apec countries are determined to accelerate
trading processes,'' he said.
	   Goh said most East Asian countries are now setting their
priority to revive economies rather than investing heavily in the
automation of customs procedures.
	   Yet, he said the move towards the transparency and simplication
of customs procedures will not be affected by the regional crisis
at all.
	   In fact, Goh said Apec Sub-Committee on Customs Procedures
(SCCP) has been recognised as the most active group within Apec in
its efforts towards trade liberalisation and facilitation.
	   The dialogue was held to identify specific customs industry
issues and formulate recommendations to achive greater transparency
and better facilitation of trade in support of the Apec economic
leaders' aims on trade liberalisation and facilitation.
	   Hughes said while the regional economy is recovering, all
relevant parties - the express carriers, the customs and trading
community - will form smart partnerships to work out ways to handle
the increasing volume of businesses.
	   He said electronic-commerce (e-commerce) and the Internet have
been identified as ways to assist the express carriers, the customs
and trading community in handling the rising growth of
international businesses.
	   He said UPS experiences 25 per cent growth of business in the
Asia Pacific region, and the company needs to employ latest
technology to cope with the growth.
	   ``Everybody now share the same vision to work together to
develop new means of technology and develop human resource in the
new area of e- commerce,'' he said.
	   On another question, he said smart parnerships among those in
the industry will be formed through on-going dialogues, memorandum
of understandings as well as the use of pilot projects.
	   On Malaysia, Hughes said with its Multimedia Super Corridor, the
country has been outstanding among Apec members for supporting the
works towards e-commerce and IT.
	   Hughes said UPS has worked with customs administrations in
countries such as the US, Canada, the UK and Singapore, to install
system and data transmission system as well as develop technology
and operational solutions.
	   ``What we hope to do is to take best practices and create a
model of perfect Customs practice and then go country to country
and use the model by adapting it to the requirement of Customs
admninistration in each country,'' he said.
	   UPS is said to be the world's largest package distribution
service, providing door-to-door services to more than 200 countries
across the globe.
	   With head-quarters in Atlanta, the US, the company now employs
331,500 people worldwide, owns 216 jet aircrafts and charters
additional 302.
	   Last year, UPS recorded a volume of 3.04 billion packages and
documents, and posted revenues of US$22.5 billion (US$1  &QC;  RM4.10).
	   Over the last 10 years, UPS has gained 15 to 20 per cent share
of the air express market in the Asia Pacific region, with average
annual growth of between 25 to 30 per cent.
	   The success of UPS's worldwide expansion is attributed to
technological advancements and the development of international
partnerships - which the company sees as fundamentals for
conducting business overseas.

	   A HELICOPTER was called in on Sunday night as 100 tactical unit
police carried out a fruitless search for a rapist who attacked a
woman on a Tsuen Wan hill.
	   Police said the 39-year-old victim was attacked at 6 pm while
feeding her dogs by a hut near Tsuen Kam Road, Ha Kiu Chuen.
	   Brandishing a pistol-like object, the man grabbed her from
behind and dragged her into the hut, where he raped her for an hour
and then left with $300 cash and the victim's gold necklace.
	   After being released, the victim called police but the steepness
of the terrain and darkness caused police to ask for assistance
from a Government Flying Services helicopter.
	   Police used its spotlight and the wind generated by its rotor
blades to blow at the bushes to ease the hunt. But after three
hours the search was called off with no trace of the man.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Riot police lobbed tear gas to break up
new clashes Monday between English and Tunisian supporters locked
in their third melee in less than 24 hours, as their teams met at
the stadium for a World Cup match.
	   It was the second such clash in less than than three hours.
Police intervened outside the soccer stadium ahead of the 2:30 p.m.
(1230 GMT) game when English hooligans threw bottles at Tunisian
fans.
	   It followed street violence Sunday night that cut a path of
destruction through downtown Marseille and left two people
seriously injured -- one with a slit throat.
	   Police were seen beating some of the English with sticks before
carting them off. An estimated 10 arrests were made.
	   At about 3 p.m. (1300 GMT), hundreds of drinking troublemakers
clashed, briefly but violently, on the Prado beach where a huge
screen was transmitting the match.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas to separate the two sides. About 300
English jumped barricades used by police to hold them back,
throwing stones and bottles at about 150 Tunisians, eye witnesses
said.
	   It was not immediately clear whether there were injuries.
	   Police put a lock on Marseille earlier Monday, bringing in
reinforcements, putting a partial ban on alcohol and searching and
escorting arriving English soccer fans.
	   The measures failed to thwart a flare up.
	   Police arrested 50 people in Sunday's night's melee that left 37
people injured, local officials said.
	   The Interior Ministry blamed Sunday's violence on some 200
drunken English hooligans who taunted Tunisia supporters at
Marseille's Old Port area. A mix of youths from north Marseille
suburbs then joined in the clashes against the English, a ministry
statement said.

	   DEMAND for residential property is expected to improve if the
quota for the Home Purchase Loan Scheme is doubled as proposed by
the Housing Department.
	   The loan quota would be raised from 4,500 to 10,000 recipients
with the amount of loan unchanged _ $400,000 to $600,000.
	   ``It is expected that the sales of small to medium sized
household flats can be boosted if the proposal will be approved,''
said Raymond Tse Wai-man, chairman of the Hong Kong Real Estate
Agencies Association.
	   He estimated the price of the these residential flats would
ranged from $1 million to $3 million.
	   ``The effect of the double quota is very significant since the
number of these flats which changed hands last year in that price
range was just 8,000.'' Society for Community Organisation director
Ho Hei-wah welcomed the increase in the quota as it would give the
property market a ``healthy'' status.
	   ``In the past three years, only 20,000 flats were placed on the
market every year.
	   The property market has remained in an ``unhealthy'' status as
the supply cannot meet demand,'' he said.
	   Mr Tse said the scheme would stimulate prices.
	   ``The public housing tenants will benefit the most in this
scheme,'' he said.
	   Provisional Regional Councillor Lee Wing-tat said the pace of
increasing the quota was too brisk.
	   ``The Housing Department should increase the quota from 6,000 to
7,000 in successive stages within this year, and the result should
be examined carefully at the end of this year.
	   ``There could be an adverse effect as the increase in demand
would come too suddenly.'' He remained pessimistic on whether the
proposed scheme would stabilise the property market or not.
	   ``Poverty is not the reason why people don't buy property
nowadays, there are a number of other factors involved like
expectation of future and the economic prospects.''

	   MALAYSIA welcomes foreign investors but will not allow them to
use their economic power to exert political influence in this
country, Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said yesterday.
	   The Prime Minister said it is not the business of the foreign
investors to determine the country's leadership and political
direction.
	   ``We do not want foreign investors to come to gain benefits only
for themselves and play a role in determining who should be the
leader and so on ... That is not their responsibility.
	   ``They are welcome to make honest profits in the country and
they should not try to use their economic power to exert political
influence.
	   ``The people in the country are capable of determining their own
leaders.
	   We are capable of managing our country politically,'' Dr
Mahathir said when launching the Barisan Nasional (BN) Youth's
carnival in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The one-day carnival, attended by leaders from the 14 BN
component parties, was organised to raise money for the National
Special Fund.
	   Dr Mahathir said some people who called themselves believers of
the freedom of speech have made threats when the country voiced out
its views on the economic problems.
	   ``When we say it, they said foreign investors do not want to
come. This is a kind of threat to our freedom of speech.
	   ``This means that they are threatening us ... they actually
don't believe in the freedom of speech,'' he said.
	   Malaysia, he said, has not closed its doors to foreign investors
who are only here to make quick gains and as such, they should
``not tell us that we have to set certain conditions if we want
foreign investments''.
	   He said Malaysia is peaceful and prosperous not because of
foreign investors but due to the participation and contribution of
the rakyat in the country's development.
	   This can be seen through the rakyat's response to the
Government's call to free the country from the pressure from
imports by producing local goods and not purchase foreign goods or
travel overseas, he said.
	   He added it is the responsibility of all Malaysians to maintain
the country's sovereignty and independence.
	   ``We will manage our economy, God-willing, so that we can
continue to be free and our independence will not be affected,'' he
said.
	   Thanking those who have contributed to the National Special
Fund, Dr Mahathir said the spirit to help the country is more
important than the amount contributed.
	   The fund raised more than RM3 million yesterday, mainly from
local corporations as well as BN component parties.
	   ``I am confident that with the attitude of Malaysians today, we
can maintain our independence and prosperity and will be able to
revive the economy and thus achieve the developed status nation by
the year 2020,'' he said.
	   The Prime Minister said the economic problems facing the country
have not succeeded in undermining the solidarity of multi-racial
Malaysians.
	   Unlike other countries such as Northern Ireland and the former
Yugoslavia, the strong unity and the absence of envy among various
races in Malaysia have prevented riots, he said.
	   ``After the 1969 riot, the Government elected by the majority
has created policies to distribute wealth equally among the
population ... policies also targeting to erase the causes of that
riot.
	   Reminding everybody to be alert against parties out to undermine
the unity in the wake of the economic crisis, he said: ``We have
achieved independence and we do not wish to be dominated again.''

	   Terrorists are allegedly dominating the Faridpur Medical College
Hospital and the Faridpur General Hospital depriving the people of
the district of proper medicare facilities. Both the hospitals,
have become virtually hostage in the hands of some terrorists who
regularly extort money from patients, doctors, nurses and other
employees working there.
	   The terrorists have established their authority at these two
hospitals and there is non to challenge their unlawful activities.
Poor patients coming from far flung areas of the district fall
victim to the malpractice of these terrorists and sometimes they
are to go back home shorn of all their money without receiving any
medical treatment.
	   Even the doctors are not spared of their wanton behaviour. The
doctors are made to admit and release patients, under duress by
these terrorists. When this correspondent visited the hospital he
saw the authority of the terrorists everywhere. Besides, scarcity
of medicine, shortage of doctors and nurses in both the hospitals
are hindering the proper treatment of the patients.
	   So, to say, no medicine is supplied from either of the two
hospitals to the patients. Patients have to buy medicines in case
of emergency from the adjoining medicine shops at exorbitant
prices. Even gauges, cotton, bandage and saline are not supplied
from the hospitals.If the authority concerned does not take any
stern measure against these elements and remove the existing
problems, the patients will remain even deprived of the service of
the hospitals.

	   LEGISLATOR-elect Leung Yiu-chung on Sunday accused the Housing
Authority of failing to offer a helping hand to home buyers under
the Home Ownership Scheme.
	   The unionist, who belongs to the Frontier but is allied with the
Neighbourhood and Workers' Service Centre, said he was ``upset by
the Housing Authority's decision and its policy''.
	   ``On the one hand, it forces the HOS buyers to forfeit their
deposits if they fail to make the deal.
	   ``But at the same time, it is going to re-sell these HOS units
at a 10-20 per cent discount rate from the present price. It is
very unfair,'' Mr Leung said.
	   He added that Secretary for Housing Dominic Wong Sing-wah shared
the same view.
	   ``Wong Sing-wah told me on one occasion that personally he was
dissatisfied with the HA's decision. But he could not overrule it
because the decision was made by the Housing Authority,'' Mr Leung
said.
	   Mr Leung urged the government to also help buyers of private
housing.
	   ``Property prices have fallen dramatically over the past few
months.
	   ``I am not saying that it is wrong but I think the drop in price
is too drastic. Many of the little unit owners suffered greatly
from it,'' Mr Leung said.
	   He said some of these buyers might be forced to become jobless
as they would have to close their shops in order to repay the
instalments.
	   Mr Leung urged the government to review its policy on land sales
and make stabilising property market prices its first priority.
	   In order to achieve this, the government should stop selling
land, he said.

	   Stealing of transformer and wire of Jamalpur Palli Biddut Samity
(PBS) has become rampant. According to a reliable source, a total
of 235 transformers and 44,000 metres of wire worth about Taka
61,53,00 have been stolen by organised gangs of thugs during the
last seven years. It may be mentioned here that Jamalpur PBS was
set up in 1986 on the basis of no loss no profit basis.
	   The samity has brought 11 thanas of Jamalpur, Sherpur, Kurigram
and Sirajgonj districts under its network so far. About 26,000
consumers have been registered as members of the samity. Power has
been extended to residential, commercial, industrial and irrigation
sectors. But rampant theft of transformer and wire has caused
substantial damage to the PBS. Farmers are the worst sufferers as
they cannot irrigate their lands in absence of electricity.
	   The stolen transformers included 100 kva, 25 kva, 15 kva, 10 kva
and 5 kva. According to the instruction of the Rural
Electrification Board (REB) consumers have to pay 50 per cent of
cost if a transformer is stolen. It is learnt the price of a 15 kva
transformer is about Taka 28,000 while the prices of 10 kva and 5
kva transformers are Taka 23,000 and Taka 22,000 respectively.
	   Meanwhile, Jamalpur PBS has incurred a heavy less due to alleged
irregularities and mismanagement. The loss has stood at Taka one
crore in last eleven months. On the other hand the samity is yet to
realise outstanding power bills to the tune of Taka 2 crore 10
lakh.

Russia considering evacuating last diplomats from Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is considering evacuating its ambassador
and seven remaining nationals from Guinea-Bissau because of the
deteriorating situation in the West African country.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said the Russians
remain in their embassy and ``constant communication is being
maintained with them.''
	   Soldiers mutinied against the president of the former Portuguese
colony a week ago and fighting continues. Most foreigners have
already left the country.

	   FOREIGN companies are eyeing stakes in Tenaga Nasional Bhd's
wholly-owned power-producing subsidiary TNB Janamanjung managing
the 2,000MW plant in Manjung, Perak.
	   And with Janamanjung expecting a sizeable cost overrun in
getting the plant ready by 2002, it may have to turn to one or more
of the foreign suitors.

	   NEARLY a year after the handover, Hong Kong's media have
remained free and are freer than those of their Asian neighbours, a
survey of business executives has shown.
	   The Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (Perc) survey said
the press in the SAR was, for example, freer than that in Taiwan.
	   ``Hong Kong's press and broadcast media have weathered the
transition to Chinese sovereignty much better than sceptics were
anticipating a year ago.
	   ``The hand of the government is not particularly obvious. One
year ago, there were fears this would not be the case,'' the Perc
reported.
	   But it said that this was in contrast to the mainland where
journalists were monitored and restricted.
	   It surveyed businessmen in 10 Asian countries and Hong Kong on
their views of the level of censorship and quality of the local
media.
	   The businessmen were also asked to rate accessibility to foreign
media in their countries.
	   The report added that Asia's media were still subject to a
relatively high degree of censorship, which has curbed their
ability to analyse and forecast the depth of the region's economic
problems.
	   It said only four areas in Asia _ Hong Kong, the Philippines,
Taiwan and Thailand _ enjoyed any degree of ``freedom of the
press''.
	   Censorship had impaired the ability of the media in many Asian
countries to identify and analyse the potential pitfalls that
contributed to the region's economic slump, the report said.
	   Weak regulatory institutions and bureaucracies shared part of
the blame for a lack of openness.
	   ``Theoretically, the media should be a check and balance to the
systematic shortcomings. In most countries in Asia, however, it
does not play such a role very effectively,'' the report said.
	   ``In some cases it is due to intimidation from above, censorship
is still widely practised in Asia.''

	   With the depletion of valuable trees of forest under Sylhet Zone
Indian timbers are being smuggled into the country through the
border points of Sylhet, Habiganj and Moulvibazar districts. It is
alleged that an organised group of timber traders in collaboration
with a section of forest officials and allegedly backed by some
political leaders are cutting trees of west Bhangugach, Rajkandi,
Patheira, Longa hill, Kalachera and Adampur forests in Moulvibazar
district and Kalenga, Satucharia and Faizabad hill forests in
Habiganj district.
	   The persons engaged by the wood traffickers fell trees
indiscriminately without considering their maturity and importance.
They cut the trees at day time and traffic those at dead of night
to the saw mills at Chunarughat, Bahubal and sadar thanas in
Habiganj district and Sirajganj, Kamalganj, Kulaura and Baralekha
thanas in Moulvibazar district for sizing. The forest guards who
are in league with the traffickers cover the roots of the felled
trees with earth and rubbishes to conceal the stealing from the
public sight. After sizing woods are sent to different parts of the
country for sale.
	   It is alleged that the trees that are cut for trafficking are
not matured enough to supply wood of a special size demanded by the
furnishers and people. The wood of 12''-14'' size which are in
great demand for making furniture and other purposes can not be
supplied by the traffickers as they cut trees before achieving
maturity, necessary for providing the wood of the said size. The
gap is filled in by the Indian timbers which can provide the
demanded size.
	   As a result, timbers providing the special size are coming here
from India through the bordering points of Teliapara, Amurad and
Manik Bandar in Habiganj district and Shamber Nagar, Fultala,
Chultapur and Baralekha in Moulvibazar district. The trade of
smuggling Indian wood timber is rampant at the expense of the trees
of forests under Sylhet zone.

	   THE government is postponing the introduction of a controversial
anti-sedition law for at least a year amid mounting opposition from
various sectors.
	   Deputy law officer Bob Allcock, from the Office of Secretary for
Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie, said the bill would not be introduced
during the present Legislative Council session but probably next
year.
	   ``We are not rushing with the drafting of the legislation as
some people have indicated before,'' Mr Allcock said. ``In fact we
have not even started drafting it.'' Mr Allcock said the government
understood there should be consultation on the controversial
legislation.
	   While visiting Germany in March, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
confirmed the anti-subversion law would be introduced after the 24
May elections.
	   Mr Tung was speaking a day after he warned that he would not
allow Hong Kong to be used as a base for subversives.
	   Article 23 of the Basic Law requires the Special Administrative
Region (SAR) government to introduce laws on its own to prohibit
any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against the
Central Government.
	   Director of Human Rights Monitor Law Yuk-kai welcomed the
government's decision.
	   ``I think this is a wise decision,'' he said.
	   ``If I were to advise the government, I would not advise them to
introduce controversial legislation at a time of economic crisis.''
Mr Law warned that since many people were now frustrated and
dissatisfied because of the economic downturn, the introduction of
controversial laws might further erode their confidence in the
administration.
	   ``I won't be surprised if some people stage a riot _ similar to
those in Indonesia _ if they lose their economic and political
confidence in the government,'' he said.
	   Li Pang-kwong, a lecturer at the social science department of
Lingnan College, agreed.
	   ``There will be a lot of dissatisfaction among the people and
the government will be under tremendous pressure,'' Mr Li said.
	   But he did not foresee any social unrest if the government went
ahead with the introduction of the controversial law this year.
	   ``Hong Kong people are not that violent.'' Former chairman of
the Bar Association Gladys Li Chi-hei said the delay would give the
government more time for public consultation.
	   ``The reality is there is no seditious activity going on in Hong
Kong. It is not a matter of burning urgency,'' Ms Li said.
	   She hoped the government would go through several drafts before
finalising the legislation.

	   LAST week's rather strong selling pressure especially on
blue-chip stocks saw market capitalisations of only three companies
on the Top 20 list increased. The companies were Nestle, Kumpulan
Guthrie and Leisure Management.
	   The remaining 17 companies saw decreases in their respective
market worth. The combined market worth of the top three companies
on the list - Telekom, Tenaga and Petronas Gas - as at June 12 1998
stood at RM51.39 billion, RM3.3 billion lesser than their market
worth of RM54.89 billion as at June 5 1998.
	   Last Friday, Telekom's closing price was RM6.65, down by 85 sen
from the previous Friday's closing while Tenaga fell 25 sen to
RM5.55 and Petronas Gas was down by only 10 sen to RM7.85.
	   In terms of positions, besides the top three companies, 10 other
companies also remained at their previous Friday's spots. MISC,
Nestle and Guthrie each moved up one spot on the list while
Genting, Berjaya Sports Toto and Magnum Corp went down to the 8th,
15th and 19th places respectively.
	   Leisure Management moved into the Top 20 while Oriental fell out
of the list.

New Clashes Monday in Marseille overshadow World Cup action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new figures on casualties, arrests &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ New clashes erupted around the heavily policed
England-Tunisia soccer match Monday as violence in Marseille marred
the World Cup for a second straight day.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas to break up new clashes between
English and Tunisian supporters watching the afternoon match on a
huge TV screen set up for people who lacked tickets to the game.
	   It followed another clash outside Velodrome stadium when English
hooligans threw bottles at Tunisian supporters. Police beat some of
the English with riot sticks before arresting about 10.
	   At about 3 p.m. (1300 GMT), hundreds of drinking troublemakers
clashed, briefly but violently, at Prado beach on the Mediterranean
after England scored a first-half goal to go ahead 1-0.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas to separate the two sides. About 300
English jumped barricades used by police to hold them back,
throwing stones and bottles at about 150 Tunisians, eye witnesses
said.
	   In outbreaks of fan violence Sunday night and early Monday in
Marseille, police arrested 50 people and 37 were injured, including
two English in serious condition with knife wounds. Earlier figures
spoke of more arrests but authorities revised the figures downward.
	   FIFA warned Monday that some of England's most hardened
hooligans may be headed to France to stir up more violence.
	   ``What can we do to combat these individuals?'' said Sepp
Blatter, the newly elected president of world soccer's governing
body, FIFA. ``We must get rid of them, stop them from entering
stadiums and return them to their countries. Football is a game,
and must bring joy to the whole world.''
	   In England, Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday condemned as a
``complete disgrace'' the English soccer fans who rampaged in
Marseille.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and they have just go to put a stop to it.''
	   In other games Monday, Romania plays Colombia at 5:30 p.m. (1530
GMT) in Lyon and Germany takes on the United States at 9 p.m. (1900
GMT) in Parc de Prince Stadium in Paris.
	   Meanwhile, on-field violence was punished as Dutch striker
Patrick Kluivert was banned for two games for elbowing Belgium's
Lorenzo Staelens in the chest in an off-the-ball incident during
Saturday's 0-0 tie at Saint-Denis. Kluivert, who received a red
card for the foul, will miss the Netherlands' other Group E
first-round games against South Korea and Mexico.
	   Kluivert said he elbowed Staelens after being ``deeply hurt'' by
what he said were offensive comments made by the Belgian defender.
	   ``I pushed him,'' Kluivert said. ``I couldn't control my
emotions.''
	   In Sunday's games, the well of goals that had been so prevalent
through the tournament's first four days began to dry up. Argentina
beat Japan and Yugoslavia downed Iran, both by the score of 1-0.
	   Japan, co-host of the 2002 finals and playing its first-ever
World Cup game, gave a valiant effort before falling on Gabriel
Batistuta's 28th minute goal in rainswept conditions at Toulouse.
	   ``It is very unfortunate that we could not score a goal. I
believe results count at the World Cup,'' said Japanese coach
Takeshi Okada, choked with emotion.
	   At Saint-Etienne, Sinisa Mihajlovic's 25-meter free kick in the
73rd minute was enough to give Yugoslavia three points.
	   The unconvincing victory sobered up the highly-praised Yugoslav
World Cup team and has given group rivals the United States higher
hopes of reaching the next round.
	   ``There was nothing good about our play,'' Yugoslav coach
Slobodan Santrac said Monday. ``If we want to beat the Germans or
even the Americans, we will have to correct a lot of things.''
	   There was no shortage of self-criticism among the Yugoslav
players.
	   ``There are no easy matches at the World Cup as most of the
favorites have struggled against the so-called underdogs in the
first round,'' said Yugoslav team captain Dragan Stojkovic.
	   ``In our opening match against Iran, we had a tremendous desire
to show the world how good we are after eight years of absence from
the World Cup,'' Stojkovic said, referring to the 1992 U.N.
sanctions that banned ugoslav sportsmen from official competitions
for their government's fomenting of Bosnian and Croatian wars.
	   ``That desire worked against us in the Iranian match.''
	   Iran was happier with its perfromance.
	   ``I'm pleased with our performance as we played one of the best
and most experienced teams in Europe,'' Iranian coach Jalal Talebi
said. ``Our mission at the World Cup is not over with this loss. We
will fight on.''
	   Iran's play was less intense in the second half, perhaps because
its players held a three-hour religious mourning ceremony at the
time many teams would be getting a good night's sleep. Players beat
their chests and wept as a religious teacher recounted the death of
a 7th century Shiite Muslim.

	   HONG KONG: The unemployment rate jumped sharply to 4.2 per cent
in the three-month March-to-May period, the highest level in 15
years, a government spokeswoman said on Monday.
	   ``The market is still adjusting to the regional situation which
is relatively volatile and unstable,'' said Elley Mao, acting
government economist.
	   It was the highest unemployment figure since 4.4 per cent in the
April-to-June period in 1983 and compared with 3.9 per cent in the
February-to-April 1998 period.
	   The Hong Kong government said it could not rule out a further
rise in the unemployment rate but said it hoped to announce more
measures next month to tackle the rising jobless numbers.
	   ``I certainly do not exclude the possibility that the
unemployment rate could get higher in the coming month,'' said
Joseph Wong, Secretary for Education and Manpower.

	   HIGHLANDS &AMP; Lowlands Bhd, taking advantage of the surge in crude
palm oil prices due to ringgit depreciation, will continue to focus
on strengthening its core activities in plantation operations, says
its chairman Datuk Abdul Khalid Ibrahim.
	   The group will also continue to expand oil palm areas to raise
plantations profitability, he says in the company's annual report.
	   For the current year, the ringgit depreciation is expected to
sustain higher crude palm oil (CPO) prices and therefore higher
profit from plantation.
	   Contribution from its property division, however, is expected to
remain depressed, Khalid says, adding that group earnings is
expected to be sustained for the year ended December 31 1998.
	   For the financial year ended December 31 1997, the group
recorded a pre- tax profit of RM227.6 million compared with RM247.6
million for the previous year. This was posted on the back of a
turnover of RM370.89 million against RM365.66 million the year
before.
	   For the year under review, the group achieved an operating
profit of RM143.9 million which is 4 per cent higher than that
recorded in 1996.
	   Core activities - plantation and agricultural services -
contributed RM117.3 million or 82 per cent of the group operating
profit, compared with RM99.2 million for the preceding year.
	   Profit from plantation was RM113.5 million compared with RM96.6
million for 1996. Palm products contributed RM108.5 million while
rubber contributed the balance of RM5 million.
	   Reviewing the group's operations last year, Khalid says although
the ringgit depreciation worked to the advantage of the group, the
accompanying meltdown of the stock market worked against the
group's investment dealing operations, which incurred a loss.
	   Touching on its associate property company, he says the slowdown
in the property sector brought about a lower contribution from the
group's associated property development activity.
	   Its associate company, Guthrie Property Development Holding Sdn
Bhd, launched 26 units of shop offices and 598 units of
double-storey link houses in Bukit Jelutong, Shah Alam, last year.
	   Despite the slowdown, notes Khalid, 100 per cent of the shop
offices and 90 per cent of the link houses have been sold.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A papillon from Huis ter Heide,
Netherlands, won the Best in Show title at the World Dog Show,
which featured a record 15,628 canines from about 300 breeds.
	   More than 5,000 people packed the Helsinki Fair Center through
Sunday evening, the end of the four-day event, to see the selection
of the immaculate toy spaniel with its silky, black-and-white coat
and drooping ears.
	   Loteki Supernatural Being, owned by John Oulton and Lou Ann
King, competed in the companions and toys class.
	   A deerhound, Kilbourne Quebee, from Someren, Netherlands, was
runner-up in the Best in Show contest. A Finnish wire fox terrier,
Starring Xina, from Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle, was judged
third.
	   ``We were very pleased with the event,'' said Kaija Unhola from
the show committee. ``We broke all records, and attracted more than
50,000 dog owners and enthusiasts. Not a single dog was hurt.''
	   The previous record was in Bern, Switzerland, in 1994, when
15,500 dogs competed.
	   The competitors scratched, barked and wag tails in a hall with
36,000 square meters (43,200 sq. yards) of floor space, and in
tents outside.
	   In addition to the breed competitions, there were agility and
obedience contests, sheep herding, and performing dogs that
belonged to army, police and frontier guards.
	   Draco, an Australian kelpie from Karlskoga, Sweden, won the
obedience test for a second time since clinching the title at an
international dog show in Stockholm in 1995.
	   For many fans, Gira, a Finnish golden retriever stole the show.
She rolled over, walked on her back legs, jumped through hoops,
skipped and counted _ well, barked _ to five on command.
	   ``She's a very intelligent dog, and even knows left from
right,'' said owner Eija Granfelt. ``But she hasn't learned to read
yet.''
	   The event sold out Helsinki hotels, which posted special rates
for dogs of 25 markaa (dlrs 4.60). Their owners paid about 900
markaa (dlrs 166) a night.
	   The next World Dog Show will be held in Mexico City. About 1,300
dogs competed in the 1997 event held in Puerto Rico.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The battered Serbian province of
Kosovo appeared to have a brief respite from violence Monday as
NATO warplanes roamed the skies of neighboring Albania and
Macedonia.
	   Eighty-four aircraft from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries were
conducting several hours of exercises in hopes of intimidating
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by showing how quickly and
powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces.
	   The governments of Albania and Macedonia agreed late last week
to allow their territory to be used for the exercise. Much of the
world has been aghast as Milosevic's Serb-led army and police
cracked down on dissent in Kosovo, inhabited mostly by ethnic
Albanians. More than 300 people have been killed and thousands have
fled across the border into northern Albania.
	   Fearing the conflict could spill over in the Balkans, Western
nations warned Milosevic last week to change his hard-line policy
or face the threat of force.
	   In Rome at a United Nations conference for an international
criminal court, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he hoped the
``pressures that are being put on the parties, particularly
President Milosevic, will be successful. ...''
	   ``It is important that we remain firm and resolute in the face
of what is happening in Kosovo and Serbia. We know what happened in
Bosnia and we cannot sit back and let it be repeated.''
	   In Skopje, Macedonia, a senior western diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said any attack by Serbian security forces
on the Kosovo town of Djakovica would act as ``a tripwire'' to
increase the chance of NATO intervention in Kosovo.
	   He said refugees from other parts of Kosovo have swollen the
population of Djakovica to as much as 80,000 or 100,000 now from
about 60,000 before fighting began.

	   IN A time where many companies have dipped into the red,
Autoindustries Ventures Bhd is confident of surpassing last year's
performance to post RM80 million in turnover for the current
financial year ending December 31 1998.
	   According to its chairman Sarip Hamid, the group's growth
dynamism will be based on synergy, that is, strategic investments
and re-positioning of core businesses based on its network to
provide for the full integration of operations.
	   This will involve its manufacturing process systems, Research
and Development (R and D) sector, product design and also
marketing.
	   ``We are also intensifying our investment in R and D to have a
constant stream of new products available in order to tap new
markets in Malaysia, the region and also the world,'' he said in
his latest annual statement.
	   Investments in R and D would also bring greater flexibility to
adapt to changing market needs, brought about by the variance of
economic fortunes, Sarip added.
	   Autoindustries recorded a slightly increased pre-tax profit of
RM9.34 million for the year ended December 31 1997 as against
RM9.12 million previously.
	   This was achieved on the back of RM37 million in turnover for
the 1997 financial year compared to RM33.84 million for 1996.
	   Profit after taxation dropped to RM7.72 million for the year
under review, down from RM8.30 million before.
	   This was due to the higher cost on raw materials and component
imports, arising from the unfavourable foreign exchange rate.
	   Earnings per share meanwhile, declined to 36.69 sen from 112.39
sen previously.
	   For the financial year under review, the directors have proposed
a final tax exempt dividend of 5 per cent.
	   The current financial year will see an increased investment by
RM33.20 million to be deployed in the acquisition of an Australian
company manufacturing electric motors and an increase in in-house
manufacturing activities.
	   In-house manufacturing operations are namely sheet metal
processing and the manufacturing of plastic and rubber products.
	   The additional investment will also be for the design and
manufacture of special purpose vehicles which include communication
shelters, ambulances and body work for commercial vehicles.
	   In addition, the group will invest in the design and manufacture
of factory automation equipment and distribution of personal
computers.

	   THE Hong Kong stock market is braced for a harsh pounding on
Monday as the shock of Japan's descent into recession takes its
toll on investor confidence.
	   Analysts said Hong Kong was expected to take its cue from Tokyo,
which is forecast to nosedive in the wake of Friday's grim Japanese
economic data.
	   Continued yen weakness is likely to further impact on local
shares.
	   Tokyo announced on Friday that the Japanese economy shrank for
the second consecutive quarter, meaning the country is now
technically in a recession.
	   The announcement was made after the Tokyo stock market closed.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell by nearly 8 per cent last week,
as the Japanese yen's fall to near eight-year lows against the US
dollar battered sentiment and pushed short-term interest rates
sharply higher.
	   The overnight interbank rate soared to 10 per cent to 11 per
cent on Friday afternoon trade against 7.5 per cent to 9 per cent
earlier.
	   ``People are worried about job security. Their spending habits
will change, they'll spend less and save more because they're
uncertain about the future,'' said Kennedy Liu, partner of
accounting firm Arthur Andersen.
	   Despite the market uncertainty, Beijing-backed petrochemical
products trader Sinopec Kantons Holdings is expected to push ahead
with its listing plans in Hong Kong, analysts said.
	   ``It is not surprising to see it proceeding with its listing
plan,'' said Lawrence Ang of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. ``It could
secure a listing first with just a small offer of new shares, then
raise more funds later when the market stabilises.'' Analysts said
the uncertain outlook for the stock market might also encourage
other companies to seek listings sooner rather than later.
	   ``I believe this listing candidate will proceed with its float
as planned, because it may become more difficult to tap the market
if the weak sentiment continues,'' said Dharmala Securities
research analyst Patrick Yiu.
	   Sinopec Kantons Holdings, a spinoff of state-owned China
National Petroleum Corp (Sinopec), is expected to come to the
market later in June or July, market sources said.

	   KIAN Joo Can Factory Bhd expects to maintain its previous year's
profitability level for the current financial year, Tunku
Nadzaruddin Tuanku Jaafar in his latest chairman's statement says.
	   Nevertheless, he adds, the economic turmoil and the currency
volatility will continue to put pressure on the group's profit
margin for the financial year ending December 31 1998.
	   For the financial year ended December 31 1997, the group
registered a pre tax profit of RM85.36 million on the back of a
turnover of RM438.15 million, while after tax profit for the year
stood at RM59.22 million.
	   In the previous financial year, Kian Joo Can posted a pre tax
profit of RM95.19 million, while turnover and after tax profit for
the year was at RM445.39 million and RM72.49 million respectively.
	   The slightly weaker financial performance for the year under
review, was attributed to the weaker selling price of aluminium
cans and also due to higher cost of raw materials arising from the
depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar in the second
half of the year.
	   The group's earnings per share for 1997 meanwhile fell to 48 sen
from 61 sen the last time around.
	   Tunku Nadzaruddin said net earnings for 1997 declined by 21 per
cent from the previous year, but earnings for the previous year
included an extraordinary income of RM1.78 million for partial
disposal of equity interest in a subsidiary company.
	   He added if this profit is excluded, the group's net earnings
declined by only 19 per cent.
	   During the year under review, the group entered into a joint
venture agreement with Mitsubishi Materials Corp and Mitsubishi
Corp and formed a joint venture company called KJM Aluminium Can
Sdn Bhd to produce and manufacture two piece aluminium SLIM
retortable cans.
	   Kian Joo Can will hold 60 per cent of the share capital while
Mitsubishi Materials and Mitsubishi Corp will control 25 per cent
and 15 per cent each respectively.
	   Tunku Nadzaruddin also disclosed that the group have purchased
several parcels of land in the Seremban area (Negeri Sembilan) as
it expects future expansion will be headed in that direction as
most of its customers had already relocated their establishments
there.
	   Directors have recommended a second and final tax exempt
dividend of 10 per cent and a special tax exempt dividend of 20 per
cent to be paid on June 22 1998.
	   Earlier the group had declared a tax exempt interim dividend of
10 per cent.

U.S. repatriates another 100 Haitian boat people
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A U.S. Coast Guard cutter returned
105 Haitian boat people Monday, the latest in a steady stream of
refugees, this time found on an overcrowded sailboat in the
Bahamas.
	   The Haitians were jammed into a 30-foot (10-meter) boat when the
cutter sighted them Friday near Grand Anagua Island. They sailed
from Haiti's northern port of Port-de-Paix, a popular departure
point for boat people.
	   A 1981 U.S.-Haiti treaty permitting the United States to
repatriate Haitians found in international waters expired in 1996,
but the repatriations have continued.
	   Every month, about 200 Haitians fleeing their poverty-plagued
country set out in unseaworthy craft, U.S. Coast Guard officials
say. Thousands have ended up in the British Turks and Caicos
islands. Some pay as much as dlrs 1,000, selling homes and prized
livestock, to try to escape Haiti.
	   It is unknown how many drown or reach the shores of Florida.
	   On June 8, a sloop crowded with Haitians sank 15 miles (25
kilometers) off the Turk island of Providenciales. Six bodies were
recovered. Officials are investigating claims among the 70
survivors that there were more than 100 people aboard.
	   On May 12, a 51-foot (17-meter) wooden freighter slipped
undetected from Biscayne Bay into downtown Miami on the Miami
River.
	   Some passengers jumped into the river, some escaped in waiting
cars and others tried to hide in riverside neighborhoods. In a wild
chase, officials captured 89 of the illegal immigrants.
	   The flow of Haitian boat people has slowed considerably since
tens of thousands fled a repressive military regime that ousted
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991.
	   In September 1994, the United States invaded to halt the
repression and the exodus of Haitians. That year alone, the U.S.
Coast Guard said it had intercepted nearly 25,000 Haitians trying
to reach Florida.
	   Aristide was succeeded by President Rene Preval in February
1996. But Haiti's chronically depressed economy continues to slump
amid political infighting and insecurity.
	   ``In spite of grinding poverty, Haitians are not fleeing,'' said
Carol Joseph, who heads the Haitian National Migration Office.
``Most now realize they can't attain the shores of El Dorado in
Florida.''

	   The handloom industry in greater Pabna district is almost on the
verge of collapse due to shortage of necessary funds, scarcity of
yarn and other raw materials. The situation has aggravated due to
smuggling of saris, lungis and other cloths from the neighbouring
country. There are about one lakh handlooms in the districts under
greater Pabna. At present only 30,000 of those looms are in
operation, a local weavers society leader told this correspondent
recently. Rest of the handlooms have been closed down due to lack
of funds and other factors. As a result, 70,000 weavers have become
jobless . In greater Pabna district a vast area of the loom belt
covers Belkuchi, Rajgonj,Chowhala, Shahjadpur, Santhia, Sujanagar
and Pabna sadar thanas.
	   The rattling of the looms has been replaced by total silence.
The looms have become a curse for a large number of families that
had been dependent on this profession for generations. A good
number of people are earning their livelihood by selling various
weaving materials. The weavers of these areas are now passing their
days in utter distress in absence of any income generating
activity. Having no other alternative, some of them have turned
into day-labourers and rickshawpullers . Hounded by extreme poverty
some even have resorted to begging. Many left their ancestral homes
for survival. It may be mentioned here that these weavers used to
weave lungi, napkin, wrapper and saree according to orders they
received from the 'mahajans' on contract basis. Few of them are
still surviving any how while the others have become almost
bankrupt.
	   They borrow money from the local money-lenders at high rate of
interest to keep their business running. The weavers alleged that
some dishonest businessmen are adulterating dyes by mixing dust of
coal, brick and black salt. Besides , reserved quotas of yarn for
the local weavers are purchased from the spinning mills by another
group of businessmen directly and then they sell those in the open
markets. They are compelled to purchase those yarns at high rate
and sustain losses in running their looms .On the other hand, the
few, who received loans are facing hardships in repaying the same
due to price-hike of necessary inputs and decline in production.
Moreover, the bank authorities are filing certificate cases against
the defaulters.

New Clashes Monday in Marseille overshadow World Cup action

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ New clashes erupted around the heavily policed
England-Tunisia soccer match Monday as violence in Marseille marred
the World Cup for a third straight day.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas to break up new clashes between
English and Tunisian supporters watching the afternoon match on a
huge TV screen set up for people who lacked tickets to the game.
	   It followed another clash outside Velodrome stadium when English
hooligans threw bottles at Tunisian supporters. Police beat some of
the English with riot sticks before arresting about 10.
	   At about 3 p.m. (1300 GMT), hundreds of drinking troublemakers
clashed, briefly but violently, at Prado beach on the Mediterranean
after England scored a first-half goal to go ahead 1-0.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas to separate the two sides. About 300
English jumped barricades used by police to hold them back,
throwing stones and bottles at about 150 Tunisians, eye witnesses
said.
	   In outbreaks of fan violence Sunday night and early Monday in
Marseille, police arrested 50 people and 37 were injured, including
two English in serious condition with knife wounds. Earlier figures
spoke of more arrests but authorities revised the figures downward.
	   Violence first erupted Saturday night in the Old Port
entertainment district of Marseille, when fans clashed with police
and Tunisian supporters. Several English fans were arrested in the
melees.
	   FIFA warned, 7th graf pvs.

World Cup widows receive sympathy from French chefs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In France, ``les veuves du foot'' or soccer widows
_ women abandoned by the men in their lives for the World Cup _ are
receiving plenty of sympathy from country's top chefs who also are
feeling neglected.
	   Despite the huge number of tourists, business is down at many of
France's eateries, with people either attending the matches or
staying at home to watch them on television.
	   About 300 restaurants across France, including several with
Michelin star ratings, are offering special World Cup deals for
women. Four ladies can dine for the price of three, with just one
stipulation: no men allowed.
	   Many of these restaurants are aggressively trying to attact the
women, additionally offering a gift for all four women as well _
everything from recipe books to vouchers for the local pool.
	   Some hotels are also offering solace, inviting women to drown
their sorrows.
	   The Queen Astrid Hotel, where German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
likes to hang his hat when he is in Lyon, is promoting a World Cup
happy hour from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., again for women only.
	   The story of women left in the lurch during soccer's showcase
tournament is pretty much the same across Europe.
	   In Italy, latin lovers have turned their passions away from
beautiful women to ``the beautiful game.''
	   Italy's national broadcaster RAI, which will show 500 hours of
World Cup action, is advising men to dump their girlfriends, ignore
their moms, and be one of the guys.
	   According to one study, over 30 percent of women watch football
only because their husbands or boyfriends made them.
	   But the attitude could backfire, according to magazine surveys.
	   One such poll shows that one in four women are prepared to cheat
on their hubbies as a form of revenge for four weeks of neglect.
	   But not all women are left cold by France '98.
	   Seventeen percent of Italian women said they would happily trade
in their mate for one night with Paolo Maldini, the heart-throb
captain of their country's national team.

	   STEEL and aluminium product manufacturer Chin Foh Bhd is taking
prudent measures to minimise business risks and exposure by not
placing reliance on any one industry or any country's economy.
	   Therefore, the group will be looking at improving its efficiency
as well as controlling production costs to maintain profitability,
says executive chairman Kuan Shin  &LR;  Kuan Nyong Hin in the company's
latest annual report.
	   Chin Foh posted a group pre-tax profit of RM18.65 million for
the financial year ended December 31 1997, on the back of RM205.91
million in turnover.
	   Profit before minority interest was RM13.49 million while its
net profit for the year stood at RM11.47 million. Earnings per
share was 32.4 sen.
	   At company level, Chin Foh registered a pre-tax profit of RM2.54
million with turnover of RM2.79 million. Net profit was RM1.76
million.
	   Reviewing the group activities last year Kuan says Chin Foh had
acquired a 51 per cent equity stake in Australia-based Horne
Australia (Pty) Ltd during the third quarter of 1997.
	   The acquistion complements the group's overseas activities which
is currently based in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong office is expected
to expand the existing market in China, Taiwan and Japan.
	   The group has also established Horne Asia, which is a subsidiary
of Horne Australia. Horne Asia manufactures aluminium ventilators
for domestic, China and Hong Kong markets.
	   The group, which has established sales offices in Shanghai,
Beijing and Guangzhou is currently evaluating the possibilities of
venturing into manufacturing activities in China.

	   With the sudden rise in the water level of the river Ganges
during the last one week low-lying areas and crops of Daulatpur
thana in the district have submerged . Farmers of the area are
harvesting the boro paddy which were cultivated within the river
bed as well as in areas near river bank. Meanwhile erosion of the
river has started in many places affecting more and more areas .
	   The erosion of the river Ganges is going on unabated and has
separated two villages namely Mohammadpur and Talpatti in Daulatpur
thana from the mainland . The Union Parishad buildings of
Ramkrisnapur and Chilmari are on the verge of collapse.
	   Land office, Family Planning Centre, five mosques and five
educational institutions of Chilmari union were devoured by the
river Ganges last year. Vast tracts of cultivable land of 10
villages including Bazumara, Jotashahi, Chakrampur, Udaynagar and
Bahirmadi have gone under the river bed. About 20,000 acres of
cultivable land and houses situated in 12 villages of Ramkrisnapur
union have also been eroded.
	   Two thousand families of these two unions are living on high
land of the flood protection embankment under the open sky.
Government has not taken any step to mitigate the sufferings of the
affected people so far. They have not yet received any relief
materials either from the government or the Red Crescent Society.

	   Severe heatwave has made life miserable here with further rise
of temperature along with high humidity for the last three weeks.
Temperature at Kushtia and its adjoining districts rose at 40
degrees Celsius on June 9. Acute loadshedding for about 8 to 12
hours a day have been disrupting water supply. Scorching heat
confined people indoors.
	   The roads and highways look deserted. Doctors have warned
against exposure to the sun and advised to stay indoors. Such
severe hotspell which has been persisting for the last three weeks
was never experienced before , elderly people commented. In rural
areas hundreds of people have been attacked with diseases like
fever, asthma and diarrhoea.
	   The hotspell has burnt standing jute plants in many places. On
the other hand, production in mills and factories has been
seriously affected due to frequent power disruption. Power failure
has also caused disruption in the irrigation. About 500 poultry
died of heatstroke in several poultry farms of the town. Abu Musa
(5) of Kushtia was killed by sunstroke. Besides, 15 day-labourers
while harvesting Boro paddy fell sick in different places of the
district. Attendance in primary schools in rural areas has dropped
sharply.

	   PAUL Y-ITC Construction Holdings is planning to raise $540
million under a three-for-one rights issue to help refinance a
wholly-independent company and the group's major infrastructure
projects.
	   Under the plan, which remains provisional, the firm will issue
5.39 billion rights shares at a price of $0.1 per share.
	   The subscription price represents a discount of about 75 per
cent to the closing price of $0.4 per share quoted last Thursday.
	   The rights shares will be issued with warrants in proportion of
one warrant for every four rights shares.
	   Each warrant will carry subscription rights amounting to $0.1
entitling the holder to subscribe for up to $134.8 million.
	   The net proceeds of the rights issue are expected to total about
$530 million and will be used to fund the group's participation in
the proposed refinancing of Daido, a company wholly-independent of
Paul Y-ITC; to assist the financing of a number of the group's
major infrastructure and construction projects; and to provide
additional working capital for the group.
	   Company secretary Sylvia Leung said the group had been in talks
with the board of Daido on the terms of the possible refinancing.
	   ``These discussions are continuing and no fixed terms have yet
been agreed,'' Ms Leung said.
	   Paul Y-ITC is also proposing giving a general mandate to the
board to issue shares up to a maximum of 20 per cent of the
aggregate nominal amount of the issued share capital to assist in
the future expansion of the group.
	   The group's controlling shareholder, ITC, indirectly holds about
634 million shares in the firm, representing 35.3 per cent of the
total issued share capital.

	   THE admission that several stocbroking companies have violated
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's rules regarding exposure to a
single client and a single security is not surprising but a bit
scary.
	   Omega Securities, which is now under receivership, is the first
casualty of the stock market turmoil. With a dozen other
stockbroking companies placed under trading restrictions and some
given show-cause letters, more may head the way of Omega.
	   We are still not out of the woods yet. The aftermath of the
Pan-Electric debacle in 1985 looks so much milder compared to the
current problems.
	   Many stockbroking companies then appeared on the verge of going
under and a lifeboat fund was hastily set up.
	   Eventually, not a single stockbroking company went under and no
drawdown was made on the lifeboat fund. With Omega Securities'
demise, clients can start making claims today. They can claim on
the KLSE's Compensation Fund and Hwang-DBS' Reimbursement Scheme.
	   Sensing that things were getting out of hand, the KLSE earlier
this year asked stockbroking companies to disclose their exposure
to Datuk Soh Chee Wen. Shortly after the verification exercise, the
KLSE said none of the stockbroking companies had breached any of
the KLSE rules with regards to their dealings with Soh. To date,
the KLSE is still keeping mum on whether any of the stockbroking
companies have exceeded their trading limits on single-client
exposure to Soh.
	   Nevertheless, the KLSE is seeking information from the
stockbroking companies on their exposures to several other
businessmen as well. It was also pointed out that Soh was not being
singled out.
	   This information-gathering exercise is part of the KLSE's
emphasis on prudential management of stockbroking companies. In
July more parameters will need to be disclosed by stockbroking
companies.
	   It was reported that Soh had filed a report with the Kuala
Lumpur police naming several Malaysian businessmen involved in the
Omega deal. Soh also said the Securities Commission had subjected
him to some 70 hours of questioning over the past two weeks.
	   With this revelation, the investing public will be interested to
know who are the other businessmen named and whether the Securities
Commission will go after them. Apart from these ``other
businessmen'', the investing public will also like to see other
wrongdoers, such as those involved in insider trading, brought to
book.
	   The Securities Commission has been the subject of brickbats that
it is only going after the ``small fish'' while the so-called ``big
fish'' go scot- free. With confidence at such a low ebb and
investors reluctant to commit fresh funds, the reeling in of some
big fishes will go a long way to restore the badly battered
confidence of local and foreign investors.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Disagreement over who will annul the PLO
founding charter and determine the scope of a final West Bank troop
withdrawal are holding up Israeli acceptance of the U.S. peace
initiative, a senior Israeli official said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with key Cabinet ministers
for three hours Monday to discuss the U.S. plan, which calls for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged Netanyahu
to make a decision soon, but informal U.S. deadlines have passed
without U.S. action against Israel. The United States presented its
plan in January, and the Palestinians have accepted it.
	   Israel TV reported Sunday that Netanyahu agreed to a 13 percent
pullback after initially saying he could hand over only 9 percent.
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Americans had not
informed the Palestinians of any such agreement.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, would not comment
Monday on the report, but suggested that the size of that
withdrawal, the second of three promised by Israel, was no longer
an issue.
	   Netanyahu said that despite the delays, he still expected to
wrap up a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians by May
1999, as scheduled.
	   ``This morning, we weren't just talking about the second
redeployment, but about the whole package which will hopefully lead
to a permanent peace agreement by next year, provided the
Palestinians stick to their commitments,'' he said.
	   Bar-Illan said, 6th graf pvs

	   'Amrapali', an Indian variety of mango produced from
hybridization of two varieties of mangoes named 'Dasheri' and
'Nilom' is being cultivated here . It is learnt to be the best of
all varieties of mangoes. Amrapali is the only variety which can
yield fruits every year where all other varieties bear fruits every
alternative year. About 60 to 100 saplings of Amrapali can be
planted at 10 to 12 feet distance in one bigha of land.
	   While 10 saplings of other varieties like Fazley, Langra can be
planted in one bigha. As it is a tree of smaller size it can be
planted anywhere. Amrapali yields fruits after a year of
plantation. A three year's Amrapali tree can bear more than one
hundred mangoes and a full grown Amrapali tree yields more than 500
mangoes a year. Amrapali is the sweetest of all mangoes. Of course
a green Amrapali is very sour but the average sweetness of a ripe
Amrapali is 24 per cent , but the percentage of sweetness of langra
and Gopalbhog are 19.7 per cent and 22.5 per cent respectively.
	   Its skin is very thin and its seed is small and flat. It does
not perish immediately after riping. It remains longer than most of
the varieties of mango.At present Kalyanpur Horticulture Centre and
Mango Research Institute at Chapainawabganj are distributing
grafted plants to the farmers to make it popular. Besides,
Chapainawabganj Mango Research Institute is continuing its research
work on Amrapali.

	   The overall flood situation in the Sylhet district has improved
further with the receding of water from the seven affected thanas
Sunday.
	   Experts at the Flood Information Centre of the Water Development
Board (WDB) in the city informed that the water levels of the major
rivers of the district - the Surma and the Kushiyara - had fell
further during the last 24 hours. There was no rain for the last
couple of days in the affected areas. As a result, the flood
situation may improve further, according to the experts.
	   Terming it as flash-flood, they said the onrush of water from
the upper catchment areas (the hilly regions of Assam and Meghalaya
states of India) and incessant rainfall for the last few days in
the greater Sylhet region caused the flood. The experts said it was
nothing unusual at this time of the year. The flash-flood occurred
rather late this year in the region, they added. Usually the
flash-flood occurs in May and that there was no possibility of any
major flood in the region till the end of June the experts
predicted.
	   Sadar, Kanaighat, Jakiganj, Beanibazar, Golapganj, Gowainghat
and Jaintapur thanas of the district have been affected by the
flood.

	   THE Asian economic crisis may have caused freight company
BALtrans Holdings to sail into stormy waters but this company is no
Titanic.
	   Net profits fell by 18 per cent in the six months to 31 January,
over the same period the previous year. But that still left the
company raking in over $17 million.
	   The company is fortunate in generating much of its business in
the United States, where the economy is still going strong _ a
successful policy which the company began pursuing shortly after
its inception in February 1982 and which chairman Anthony Lau
Siu-wing intends to continue.
	   ``In the early stages we built up our traffic to the European
market but later we found that it would be easier for us to pick up
additional business to North America,'' he says.
	   He puts this down to the more business-oriented culture of the
US. ``They are price-sensitive, they don't care who you are, they
don't care what colour you are as long as you deliver a service and
offer a price which is acceptable,'' Mr Lau said.
	   Today, about 60 per cent of the company's business is in North
America with 30 per cent in Europe, according to the chairman.
	   BALtrans still sees more scope for growth in its North America
business and intends to expand even further into the US.
	   ``We are still looking to expand our coverage in the United
States. By setting up more offices or acquired companies, we will
strengthen our set-up there so that we can support our operation in
Asia,'' Mr Lau said.
	   After BALtrans was formed in 1982, it quickly began to set up
sales offices in the US and in Asia, initially in Singapore and
Taipei. BALtrans also set up a joint venture with the Swedish
freight company Bilspedition to enhance operations on the
continent.
	   In 1992, the company became the first freight forwarding company
to have an initial public offering on the Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong. Funds from the listing were largely used to finance its
70,000 square foot warehouse and offices in the Sunshine Kowloon
Bay Cargo Centre.
	   Citing property purchases, when many were losing confidence in
Hong Kong, Mr Lau said he always planned to stay here after the
handover.
	   ``A lot of customers asked me if I would stay in Hong Kong after
1997. My answer to them was always `yes' and they asked me why.
Even during the peak of the Cultural Revolution, China still
exported. They need hard currency to support their imports and they
must export. If they export they have external trade and if they
have external trade, they have business.'' The fall in BALtrans
profits have not been solely due to the crisis. Costs have risen,
with airlines raising freight charges.
	   ``Last year, the market was so good that airlines increased
their charges substantially. Unfortunately, we were unable to pass
on all the increases to our customers,'' Mr Lau said.
	   The increase in costs were mostly on North American routes, the
key area of business for BALtrans.
	   Absorbing some of these higher costs ate into its profit
margins.
	   However, the cloud of the economic crisis came with a silver
lining for some of BALtrans business.
	   The depreciation of some of Asia's currencies has reduced costs
incurred locally and boosted business from some of the worst
affected countries including Thailand, whose currency devaluation
last July signalled the beginning of the crisis.
	   ``In Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia we handle more export
shipments from these three countries.
	   Part of our costs, such as operating staff, are paid in local
currency. We save a lot, because of the softening of the
currency,'' the chairman explained.
	   Looking ahead, it sees great potential from the opening of the
new airport at Chek Lap Kok.
	   The number of charter flights allowed at Kai Tak was restrictive
for freight forwarding companies, a problem that the new airport
will rectify.
	   But the new high-tech airport will have cost increases for
freight forwarding companies too.
	   ``Most forwarding agents are located in Kowloon Bay and Kowloon
City. So they have to pay additional warehouse rental costs and
additional expenses associated with the location of Chek Lap Kok.
	   ``And this is happening at a time when the economy is in bad
shape making it very painful for some of our colleagues,'' Mr Lau
said.
	   The company has leased a 30,000 square feet at the new airport
but intends to keep its main operation in its current Kowloon Bay
site.
	   In the longer term, BALtrans seeks to expand into the new growth
area of logistics where multinational companies subcontract to
third parties stock management and distribution for entire regions.
	   But this is an industry where Mr Lau sees Hong Kong lagging far
behind its rival, the Lion City.
	   ``Singapore is ahead of Hong Kong six to seven years,'' Mr Lau
said.

World Cup: England beats Tunisia 2-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MORLEY MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Alan Shearer scored late in the first
half and Paul Scholes late in the second to give England a 2-0
victory over Tunisia on Monday, a game which took place in peaceful
sunshine even as fans from the two countries fought with police and
each other outside the stadium.
	   England dominated the game, but nearly all of its quality shots
on goal came in the final 15 minutes of the first half. Goalkeeper
Chokri El Ouaer stopped the first three, but Shearer connected on
the fourth.
	   On a free kick to the right of the penalty box, Graeme Le Saux
chipped the ball to the Newcastle striker, who headed his shot
behind El Ouaer and off the left post in the 42nd minute.
	   Then, in the 89th minute, following a second half in which play
was largely bogged down in midfield, Paul Ince fed Scholes for a
25-meter strike just inside the right post.
	   England would have won by several goals had El Ouaer not made
two superb one-handed saves shortly before Shearer's strike. The
first came on Teddy Sheringham's 30-yard volley in the 36th minute,
and another came on Scholes' bouncing close-range header two
minutes later.
	   Tunisia used a very conservative attack from the opening
kickoff, passing the ball around midfield as if trying to run out
the clock. Occasionally, there would be a long pass upfield to
either Adel Sellimi or Ben Slimane, but England's defense prevented
any real scoring threat.
	   Tunisia, in its first World Cup game since 1978, brought on
three substitutions to try to pick up the pace in the second half,
but none of its players showed the ability to finish off a goal,
and England keeper David Seaman was never seriously tested.
	   The game followed three days of the skirmishes involving
hundreds of England and Tunisian fans, local youth and riot police
in the streets of Marseille. During the game, riot police lobbed
tear gas to break up more clashes in the city.

	   PERWIRA Affin Bank Bhd recorded a pre-tax profit of RM75.6
million for the first quarter ended March 31 1998, a 17.3 per cent
increase over the previous quarter's result.
	   General manager corporate services Yusof Zain attributted the
higher pre-tax profit to the tighter monetary policy, higher
interest rates and lower overheads.
	   Non-interest income remained relatively stable, helped by a 28.5
per cent increase in foreign exchange trading profit, he said when
opening the bank's 74th branch at Seri Kembangan, Selangor, on
Saturday.
	   In a statement, Yusof said the bank's SPTF (interest-free
banking) operations performed creditably, achieving RM4.1 million
in profit before tax in the quarter to March against RM4.9 million
recorded for the whole of last year.
	   The bank's net non-performing loans ratio increased from 2.46
per cent to 5.11 per cent during the quarter, reflecting the
unfavourable economic climate, he said.
	   The bank recorded an annualised return on equity of 17.7 per
cent, marginally lower than the 19.9 per cent achieved at the end
of 1997. The bank's cost-to-income ratio dropped from 27.5 per cent
in December to 25.7 per cent in March.
	   Last month, Perwira Affin Bank announced a pre-tax profit of
RM250 million for the year ended December 31 1997, a 17 per cent
drop from 1996's profit of RM301 million.
	   Yusof said the bank has been granted approval to open five
branches this year, which will bring the number of branches to 76.
Its 75th branch will be in Bintulu and the 76th in Bandar Perda,
Bukit Mertajam.
	   He said the bank is carrying out a nationwide
personal-identification- number change exercise following Bank
Negara's recommendations to curb unauthorised cash withdrawals.
	   All Perwira Affin Bank customers holding Cinta ATM cards are
advised to change their PIN immediately.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Riot police lobbed tear gas on a
Marseille beach to break up new clashes Monday between English and
Tunisian supporters locked in their third melee in less than 24
hours, as their teams met at the stadium for a World Cup match.
	   It was the second such clash in less than than three hours.
Police intervened outside the soccer stadium ahead of the 2:30 p.m.
(1230 GMT) game when English hooligans threw bottles at Tunisian
fans.
	   It followed street violence Sunday night that cut a path of
destruction through downtown Marseille and left two people
seriously injured -- one with a slit throat.
	   Police were seen beating some of the English with sticks before
carting them off at the clash outside the stadium. An estimated 10
arrests were made.
	   At about 3 p.m. (1300 GMT), hundreds of drinking troublemakers
clashed, briefly but violently, on the Prado beach where a huge
screen was transmitting the match.
	   The violence started after England's first goal in a 2-0
victory.

Netanyahu and chief of staff clash in Cabinet meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu comment, reaction to reports in grafs
9, 10 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After taking on the Arab world and the United
States, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu locked horns with his own
military chief, silencing the officer as he briefed the Cabinet.
	   The popular and charismatic armed forces chief of staff, Lt.
Gen. Amnon Shahak, is near the end of his term and is expected to
become a major player in Israeli politics after he leaves the army.
	   Shahak, who played a role in negotiating the interim peace
accords with the Palestinians, might join either the center-left
opposition Labor Party or a possible new centrist party.
	   Shahak has made a strong showing in the polls and political
commentators said Monday that Netanyahu considered Shahak a threat
in the 2000 general elections. There was speculation that Netanyahu
deliberately tried to undermine Shahak's standing.
	   During Sunday's Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu reportedly cut short
Shahak's military intelligence briefing on the Palestinians, saying
the armed forces chief had overstepped his role by reporting on
political matters.
	   Several versions of the exchange were reported by radio stations
and newspapers Monday. According to one account, Netanyahu cut
Shahak off sharply, declaring that he was only authorized to
deliver military reports.
	   Netanyahu aides told Israeli media that the prime minister was
only trying to prevent Shahak from revealing classified information
and not to silence him.
	   Netanyahu later offered his own version of events, telling
reporters that the incident had nothing to do with the Palestinians
but regarded a matter of international relations.
	   ``I asked the chief of staff to leave the reporting of the issue
to me, and he agreed. I was amazed to read about this incident, and
the twisting of this simple incident,'' Netanyahu said, adding that
political rivals may have been behind the media leaks. ``Maybe the
media had nothing else to cover, or this is another example of
certain people using politics for their own interests,'' netanyahu
said.
	   Earlier, two former prime ministers, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak
Shamir, said Netanyahu had erred in his treatment of Shahak.
	   The army commands great respect in Israel, and it is considered
bad form to disregard the views of the security establishment.
	   Netanyahu has been criticized in the past for shutting out those
whose views differ from his own, especially regarding the peace
talks with the Palestinians.

Dutch papillon grabs best among 15,600 at largest World Dog Show

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A papillon from Huis ter Heide,
Netherlands, has won the Best in Show title at the World Dog Show,
which featured a record 15,628 canines from about 300 breeds.
	   More than 5,000 people packed the Helsinki Fair Center through
Sunday evening, the end of the four-day event, to see the
immaculate toy spaniel with its silky, black-and-white coat and
drooping ears be chosen as top dog.
	   Loteki Supernatural Being, owned by John Oulton and Lou Ann
King, competed in the companions and toys class.
	   A deerhound, Kilbourne Quebee, from Someren, Netherlands, was
runner-up in the Best in Show contest. A Finnish wire fox terrier,
Starring Xina, from Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle, was judged
third.
	   ``We were very pleased with the event,'' said Kaija Unhola from
the show committee. ``We broke all records, and attracted more than
50,000 dog owners and enthusiasts. Not a single dog was hurt.''
	   The previous record was in Bern, Switzerland, in 1994, when
15,500 dogs competed.
	   The competitors scratched, barked and wag tails in a hall with
36,000 square meters (43,200 sq. yards) of floor space, and in
tents outside.
	   In addition to the breed competitions, there were agility and
obedience contests, sheep herding, and performing dogs that
belonged to army, police and frontier guards.
	   Draco, an Australian kelpie from Karlskoga, Sweden, won the
obedience test for a second time since clinching the title at an
international dog show in Stockholm in 1995.
	   For many fans, Gira, a Finnish golden retriever stole the show.
She rolled over, walked on her back legs, jumped through hoops,
skipped and counted _ well, barked _ to five on command.
	   ``She's a very intelligent dog, and even knows left from
right,'' said owner Eija Granfelt. ``But she hasn't learned to read
yet.''
	   The event sold out Helsinki hotels, which posted special rates
for dogs of 25 markaa (dlrs 4.60). Their owners paid about 900
markaa (dlrs 166) a night.
	   The next World Dog Show will be held in Mexico City. About 1,300
dogs competed in the 1997 event held in Puerto Rico.

	   FOR Anthony Lau Siu-wing, 55, it was the challenge of freight
forwarding, balancing the demands of the producers and customers
and transport companies that attracted him to the business. He
initially started out in the airline business enjoying the travel
opportunities it gave him.
	   ``As a young man, it was a nice business to be in, seeing the
world without paying any fares,'' he said.
	   But before long he was ready for a change.
	   ``Selling for airlines you have limitations because the space is
fixed and the frequencies are fixed,'' he said.
	   The industry which attracted him with its new challenges was
freight.
	   ``In the forwarding industry you are always looking to get more,
and trying to service the customer better. In the forwarding
business the sky is the limit because you try to get business to
every corner of the world,'' Mr Lau said.
	   He was regional managing director for a multinational freight
company for five years before setting up BALtrans with two partners
in 1982.
	   Appointed chairman of BALtrans in 1991, he also chairs the Hong
Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents.

	   CLIENTS of Omega Securities Sdn Bhd who are eligible to claim
from the Reimbursement Scheme are margin clients with no
outstanding balances in the margin accounts but with shares and/or
other form of security held by Omega.
	   Hwang-DBS Securities Bhd, which is participating in the
Reimbursement Scheme by contributing RM70 million, said the others
who are eligible are margin clients of Omega with net credit (after
netting-off shares and/or other forms of security in their margin
account against amount owing by them to Omega).
	   Non-margin clients with net credit can also claim from the
scheme, Hwang-DBS said in a notice.
	   The SC on June 5 revoked the dealer's licence of Omega
Securities to deal in securities and announced a reimbursement
scheme for Omega's clients.
	   Meanwhile, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) said notice
calling for claims against the Compensation Fund on Omega
Securities will be published today.
	   The KLSE in a statement last Friday advised investors wishing to
claim on the Compensation Fund to take utmost care in their
submissions to ensure that full information and documentation are
provided, with all deadlines meticulously observed.
	   The Reimbursement Scheme involves a willing stockbroking company
deemed fit by the SC in contributing a certain sum of money to the
scheme. So far, only Hwang-DBS has agreed to participate in it.
	   By undertaking to participate in the Reimbursement Scheme, the
willing stockbroking company will be allowed to open a branch or
branches depending on the amount it commits to the scheme.
	   The KLSE has appointed KPMG Peat Marwick special auditor to
independently verify accounts and balances of all Omega's clients
who are eligible for the reimbursement, and Hwang-DBS has been
instructed by the SC and the KLSE to effect payment to eligible
clients based on a formula approved by the SC.
	   In its notice, Hwang-DBS said eligible clients who opt to accept
payment under the Reimbursment Scheme are required to return the
acknowledgement portion of the letter to Hwang-DBS on or before
June 30 1998.
	   Any eligible client who disputes the net amount due to him
should clarify in person with the KLSE's staff at the office of
Omega on or before June 30.
	   Payment will be made at the KLSE office from July 13 to July 17
between 9am and 5pm.
	   Clients are required to produce their original identity card or
passport or other documents as stipulated in the letter.
	   Eligible clients who fail to submit their acknowledgment portion
of the letter to Hwang-DBS on or before June 30 will no longer be
eligible to the payment under the Reimbursement Scheme and will
have to claim against the KLSE's Compensation Fund.

	   Vitamin A, an essential nutrient in our diets, is associated
with many functions in our body. It is most well-known for its role
in night vision. Nightblindness, which is related to Vitamin A
deficiency, is so common that colloquial terms (raat kaanaa, kukri
kaanaa, naaiten, aalo aandhaari etc.) for it exist throughout
Bangladesh.
	   Slight modifications in the diet can ensure the virtual
elimination of this nutritional deficiency in Bangladesh. Vitamin A
has an important role in disease mediation and the immune system
and is associated with reduced mortality of infants and pregnant
women.Vitamin A can be found in a variety of dark green leafy
vegetables, orange and yellow fruit and in animal products such as
small fish, eggs, liver.

Germany puts new wheels on dozens of high-speed trains after crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German railroad on Monday began
replacing wheels on all 59 high-speed trains of the type that
derailed and crashed early this month after breaks were found in
the same wheels on local trains.
	   Investigators are focusing on wheel failure as the likely cause
of the June 3 accident near Eschede in northern Germany that killed
100 passengers, prompting rail officials to order ultrasound checks
of wheels on the first-generation InterCity Express trains as well
as local trains using the same wheel design.
	   No problems were found during checks on the high-speed train
wheels and many had been returned to service, railway spokesman
Martin Katz said.
	   However, defects showed up on the wheels used on local trains,
Katz said. He did not say where.
	   As a result, all 59 first-generation InterCity Express trains
either with new wheels of the same type, or with the all-steel
construction used on its second-generation high-speed trains.
	   The first-generation wheels are a three-part design: a steel
wheel disc fitted with rubber shocks and encircled by a steel tire
that helps keep the train on the rails. Investigators say that the
steel tire broke off a wheel on the first car of InterCity Express
884, causing it to derail.
	   Two of the first-generation InterCity Express trains were
expected to return to service Monday. The remaining trains were to
refitted in coming days. The railroad also was sending out 120
slower trains to compensate for ICEs still out of service, although
delays of up to 30 minutes were still expected on many lines.
	   The investigation into postwar Germany's worst rail accident
could take several months.
	   It remains unclear whether the wheel failed under normal
operation or because of some outside factor, such as the wheel
hitting something on the tracks.

	   DESPITE last week's bearish stock market sentiment, Paliburg
Group's Park Royale property development received a solid response
to a sales initiative at the weekend.
	   Due to what was described as strong interest in the project, the
group offered to sell all the remaining units at favourable prices
on Saturday.
	   The Yuen Long project was eight times over-subscribed, with a
majority of buyers wanting the homes for themselves.
	   Park Royale is scheduled for completion by early 1999. It
consists of 10 12-storey towers with 632 flats between 652 and 912
square feet and 48 duplex units and penthouses from 1,600 to 2,000
sq ft.
	   According to a report from Centaline Property Agency, the
secondary market remained under pressure.
	   As a result of a large amount of flats being sold in the primary
market by major developers, residential units in low-priced
category were affected the most.
	   In May, 20.04 per cent of the transactions were at prices lower
than the initial buying price.
	   In March, according to Centaline data, it was 14.93 per cent.
	   The agency expected the situation in the secondary market to
continue on the same track this month, with many new homes
available at bargain prices from those who had bought at peak
prices in 1997.

	   THE Youth wing of Barisan Nasional yesterday raised RM3 million
for the fund it initiated to help the Government tide over the
economic slowdown.
	   Yesterday's contribution, according to BN Youth chief Datuk
Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, will be channeled to the National Special Fund,
which was launched on March 6 to enable the public to donate cash
and kind to help stimulate the country's economy.
	   The National Special Fund, managed by the Treasury, has to date
raised about RM3 million from contributions in the form of cash,
jewellery and foreign currencies.
	   Zahid, speaking to reporters after Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
launched the BN Carnival in Kuala Lumpur yesterday, said there is
no specific target for the BN Youth-initiated fund. The fund is
open for contribution until July 15.
	   ``We initiated the fund as our contribution ... we will also
collect contributions from the states,'' he said.
	   The response from the public, including the corporate community
and artistes in the country, is very encouraging.
	   Citing an example, he said some local singers are contributing
the proceeds from the sales of their albums to the fund.
	   Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN) is contributing RM2 to the fund for
every coin box sold.
	   Among the companies which donated to the fund are Bandaraya
Development Corp (RM1 million), DRB Hicom Group (RM500,000), United
Engineers Malaysia and PLUS (RM300,000), HVD (RM100,000), Telekom
Malaysia (RM100,000), Permodalan Nasional Bhd (RM100,000) and
Golden Hope Group (RM50,000).
	   More than 3,000 people attended the one-day carnival.

	   Vitamin A deficiency is a recognised public health problem in
Bangladesh. To address this chronic problem, the Government of
Bangladesh initiated a bi-annual supplementation with high potency
Vitamin A capsules (200,000 IU) to all children aged 6-71 months.
	   Initially the supplementation service took place twice a year
from April to May and October to November through house-to-house
visits. It is worth mentioning that Bangladesh was the first
country worldwide to undertake such a programme to combat Vitamin A
deficiency.
	   A national survey conducted jointly by the Institute of Public
Health Nutrition (IPHN) and Helen Keller International (HKI) in
1982, revealed that the programme had reached only 45 per cent of
the targeted population. In some areas, the coverage was 25 per
cent or less.
	   In 1990, HKI in collaboration with IPHN undertook a bi-monthly
surveillance project on nutrition, the Nutritional Surveillance
Project. From the project it was routinely found that the coverage
of Vitamin A capsules (VAC) rarely exceeded 50 per cent.

	   A REPORTING authority for suspicious transactions and statutory
requirements for due diligence are set to form the latest building
blocks in the British Virgin Islands' increasingly tough defence
against money laundering.
	   The moves follow the passage in January 1998 of the island's
Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act, which expands the scope of
anti-money laundering legislation to cover the proceeds of all
serious crime.
	   The Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act is closely modelled on
British law and has created four types of offences: -- Assisting
another to retain the benefit of the proceeds of criminal conduct.
	   -- Acquisition, possession or use of the proceeds of criminal
conduct.
	   -- Concealing or transferring the proceeds of criminal conduct.
	   -- Tipping off.
	   Under the act, suspicious transactions have to be reported to a
Reporting Authority that will shortly be appointed, with the
director of the regulator, the Financial Services Department (FSD),
being chairman.
	   Reinforcing the message that the islands' financial service
providers will be under new legal obligations and will have to
undertake business according to international standards, the FSD,
recently held its first Due Diligence and Compliance Conference on
Tortola, the main island in the British Virgin Islands.
	   Heightened attention on the problem of money laundering by both
the international community and Britain has forced the islands'
government and regulators to tread a difficult line between the
tight standards required internationally and the light touch that
attracts business.
	   The brainchild of Robert Mathavious, director of financial
services at the FSD, the conference took place over two and a half
days at the beginning of March.
	   Experts from Britain, Switzerland and the US spoke to delegates
from local British Virgin Island firms as well as those who made
the trip from other countries in the Caribbean and Central America.
	   Retired and serving law enforcement officers stressed the need
for a joint approach by the government, regulators, law enforcement
bodies and the financial services industry to combat money
laundering.
	   Law enforcers admitted they did not have the necessary financial
expertise to deal with the problem on their own, while other
speakers emphasised that a lack of due diligence would damage the
jurisdiction's reputation.
	   Stanley Morris, former director of Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network, department of the treasury in the US state of Virginia,
warned that the island would have to work hard to distinguish
itself from its neighbours.
	   Numerous presentations highlighted what needed to be achieved.
The mantra went out _ know your customer and put a compliance
program in place.
	   Michael Levi, professor of criminology at Cardiff University,
Wales, said compliance measures would cost firms a lot of time and
money, but there were sound business reasons for taking action.
	   Mr Mathavious believes that additional compliance costs are
inevitable if you are trying to achieve world-class standards and
you can't water this down.
	   High standards will also be needed to meet the concerns of
Britain and international organisations.
	   Nick Westcott, head of Britain's Economic Regulations Department
at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said progress on
establishing a checklist of the financial sector's regulatory
measures outlined by Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in
February would be reviewed at the end of this year.

Norway's minority government to fight lawmakers over budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's minority government was struggling
to find parliamentary backing for budget revisions Monday, in a
battle that could end in a vote of confidence later this week.
	   Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik's three-party coalition has
42 seats in the 165-member Parliament, and needs support from the
opposition to tighten spending in hopes of cooling down an economic
boom.
	   On Monday, the opposition Conservative Party said its 23
lawmakers would vote for the Christian Democrat-led coalition's new
national budget package presented during the weekend.
	   However, that still leaves Bondevik's government 18 votes short
of the minimum needed to pass the proposal. A vote on the proposals
is scheduled for Friday, the last day of the legislature's spring
session.
	   ``Since we don't have a majority for the package, the situation
is tangled and unclear,'' said Einar Steensnaes, parliamentary
leader for the Christian Democrats.
	   Bondevik can seek to force the package through by staking his
government on it being passed, since there seems to be little will
in Parliament to topple the coalition.
	   Per-Kristian Foss, a Conservative Party lawmaker, said it was
unlikely that the government would be brought down over relatively
minor budget issues.
	   Bondevik's popularity has soared since he took over as prime
minister from Labor Party leader Thorbjoern Jagland in October.
	   In an survey of 1,741 voters published Monday by the Aftenposten
newspaper, 48 percent said they wanted Bondevik as prime minister.
Just 19 percent said they wanted Jagland, who leads Norway's
largest party with 65 lawmakers.

	   In 1995, the Government of Bangladesh initiated a campaign for
eradication of polio which involved the holding of a National
Immunisation Day (NID) for all children under five years of age.
Two days were selected a month apart (April 16 and May 16) to
provide oral dose of polio. On the second date, May 16, children in
addition to the polio dose, were supplemented with Vitamin A. A
total of 700,000 volunteers from NGOs, student bodies, city
corporation, and media were recruited and trained to mobilise the
community. Nearly 200,000 temporary centres were set up from which
the polio vaccine and Vitamin A supplementation was administered.
	   The total number of children targeted was 20 million and
according to the survey done by HKI, 87.9 per cent of the children
were covered. This was a major achievement given that in the past
coverage rarely exceeded 50 per cent.The success of the NID led to
a reconsideration of the Vitamin A Capsule supplementation
strategy. Instead of the house-to-house visit, which was practised
until 1994, it was planned that Vitamin A capsules would be
administered to children over a period of one week throughout the
country. The principles were simple - organise fixed out-reach
centres and inform the public through various media.
	   The cadre of the Health and Family Planning wings as well as
NGOs and other organisers of the civil society would be recruited
for social mobilisation and acceptance of the Vitamin A capsule
services on the specified day and time from the out-reach centres.
The first Vitamin A week was observed from October 28 to November 5
in 1995. Due to extensive flooding, this was postponed in Rajshahi
division until November 25 -December 2, 1995. The cost and
mobilisation compared to the NID was much less and the coverage
achieved was 83.6 per cent. It was thus felt that delivery of
Vitamin A capsules through out-reach centres was a successful
strategy.
	   In 1996, Vitamin A was supplemented twice through the National
Immunisation Day. NID was observed on May 16, 1996 and according to
the HKI survey, resulted in a coverage of 83.8 per cent. However,
it was found that the distribution was not uniform. In certain
remote areas, the coverage was less than 50 per cent. A second NID
was held on December 8, 1996 and the coverage was constant at 83.8
per cent. In 1997, the National Vitamin A Week took place from June
7 - 15, 1997. The average VAC coverage was 80.7 per cent excluding
Chittagong Division where the week was postponed till July due to
the cyclone. A third Vitamin A Week was observed in December 1997,
which was not monitored by the surveillance system of HKI. The
fourth national Vitamin A week is being celebrated currently from
June 8 - 15, 1998.
	   The impact of the Vitamin A programme through the celebration of
the ``week'' has resulted in a dramatic increase in coverage. There
has been a concurrent decline in nightblindness which averaged
between 1.1 to 1.3 per cent as reported in the Nutritional
Surveillance Project (NSP), to 0.5 per cent in June 1997. While the
capsule supplementation programme has been successful in reducing
the level of Vitamin A deficiency in pre-schoolers, the challenge
remains for the older children who are beyond the purview of the
national programme. The NSP has also documented the prevalence of
nightblindness in mothers which is found to be unacceptably high
ranging between 1.7 to 2.5 per cent.
	   While the success of the programme is laudable, we must keep in
mind the gaps - the geographical locations, where capsule coverage
lags behind, needs special attention. In addition, measures are
required to address the problem in older children and women.
Finally, while recognising the importance of the capsule programme,
it is important to work on the food-based strategies such as home
gardening, fisheries and eggs and poultry.

	   AT a time when many people have lost money in the stock market,
and as a result of the Asian economic crisis, some people may start
thinking about investing in financial products that guarantee
returns.
	   Conservative or older investors saving for retirement in
particular, may opt for these products because they meet their
investment objectives of security and stability.
	   The Mandatory Provident Fund Ordinance requires at least one of
the funds which employees can select for their investment savings
to be a Capital Preservation Fund. How does a Capital Preservation
Fund work? The purpose of the Capital Preservation Fund is to
protect the returns from being eroded by the investment or
management fee if the investment return rate is lower than the
average savings deposit rate.
	   A Capital Preservation Fund also has the following
characteristics: -- It must be 100 per cent invested in Hong Kong
dollar investments.
	   -- It is invested only in deposits and debt securities.
	   -- It is operated as a unit trust or as a unitised policy.
	   -- Investment income or profits must be credited to members at
least monthly.
	   -- The administrative expenses can be deducted from the fund
only if the investment return exceeds the average deposit rate of a
Hong Kong dollar savings account. (As different authorised
financial institutions pay different interest on Hong Kong dollar
savings accounts, the average of these rates will be used).
	   -- Any outstanding administrative expenses can be carried
forward and deducted in any of the following 12 months from the
return that exceeds the average deposit rate after taking into
account the administration expenses of that month.
	   In an attempt to preserve the value of its investment and in
order to comply with all of the stringent investment rules, the
Capital Preservation Fund manager must place your funds in low-risk
investments such as term deposits and government bonds.
	   That means the fund's return will be low on a relative basis to
other funds that are not constrained to these risk parameters.
	   And no investment is entirely risk free. A government bond can
become more risky in times of financial upheaval as we have seen in
other parts of Asia; an interest-bearing bank deposit can stop
yielding interest if the bank goes under.
	   Granted, these are extraordinary circumstances, but they do
happen.
	   In order to achieve a stable return so that the fund manager can
receive a reasonable management fee, this translates into lower
long-term returns than do non-guaranteed funds.
	   Finally, the nominal rate of return of the Capital Preservation
Fund may be 5 per cent or 6 per cent.
	   But in an inflationary environment of 8 per cent or 10 per cent,
the real rate of return can be negative.
	   Besides the special requirements for Capital Preservation Funds,
the MPF also has other investment restrictions that are designed to
protect your MPF investments.
	   -- At least 30 per cent of any investment fund for an MPF scheme
must be held in Hong Kong dollar currency investments (except
Capital Preservation Fund, which be 100 per cent).
	   -- The total amount invested in any securities issued by a
single issuer must not exceed 10 per cent of the total assets of
any investment fund.
	   -- The total amount acquired for any particular class of
securities issued by a single issuer must not exceed 10 per cent of
that class.
	   -- You cannot borrow against your fund for investment purposes.
	   As you can see, the MPF regulations are designed to help you
minimise the risk of your MPF investments. Now it's up to the
investor, or his fund manager, to come up with ways to maximise the
return _ at an accepted risk level.
	   But how? Diversification is a good way. Adopting a long-term
philosophy is another. Avoiding market-timing is yet another way.
	   Next time, we'll look at how diversifying is key to investing
successfully.
	   Christopher Reddy is director of marketing for Principal
Insurance Company.

Alleged Palestinian terrorist jailed pending trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A Palestinian labeled by U.S. authorities as
one of the wiliest Mideast terrorists will be jailed pending his
trial in the midair bombing of an American jetliner 16 years ago.
	   Defense attorneys for Mohammed Rashid did not dispute a federal
prosecutor who argued during a brief court hearing Monday that
Rashid is a violent, dangerous terrorist who would likely flee
overseas if released.
	   ``He has no ties to this country, he has no ties to the United
States,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Walutes said.
	   Rashid was whisked out of Egypt earlier this month and brought
to Washington to face terrorism charges. He pleaded innocent June 3
in a bombing that killed a 16-year-old Japanese boy and injured 15
other passengers on an international Pan Am flight.
	   Rashid and his wife allegedly planted a bomb under a seat
cushion on a Boeing 747 in August 1982. The couple, with their
young child in tow, set the timer to explode on a flight from Japan
to Hawaii and then got off the plane in Tokyo, an 11-year-old U.S.
indictment charges.
	   Walutes said today that the explosion, which tore a 3-foot hole
in the jet's cabin, could have been far worse.
	   ``But for the placement of that bomb, the entire plane could
have come down over the Pacific,'' Walutes said.
	   Rashid has been in jail since his arrival in the United States,
and U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson ordered him to remain there
until a trial on nine charges including bombing, sabotage and
murder. Rashid, 51, faces a possible life term in prison if
convicted. i

	   AMSTEEL Securities Sdn Bhd has made significant improvements in
its capital position since it recorded a deficit in its minimum
liquid fund (MLF) and is thus not under trading restrictions.
	   Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange executive chairman Mohd Azlan Hashim
said Amsteel was not under restricted trading although it had a
deficit in its MLF position, because the stockbroking company has
managed to improved its financial position.

	   THE meetings held last week for the creditors and shareholders
of the many entities of the Peregrine group at times verged on the
farcical.
	   At least it seemed that way from the viewpoint of a
disinterested third party.
	   Under the rules, venue capacity must reflect the maximum turnout
expected by the liquidators, while not making a large dent in
creditors' funds.
	   The first meeting for Peregrine Derivatives then seems to have
warranted a grubby little theatre in Wan Chai.
	   Things improved through the week, culminating in the meeting for
shareholders of Peregrine Investment at the cavernous Convention
Hall of Hong Kong's Convention Centre, with seating reserved for
7,000.
	   However, it drew only about 200 investors who thought the
provisional liquidator was being too extravagant with the money
they were unlikely to see, and they said so.
	   Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the meetings was
Peregrine's ex-chairman Philip Tose's ability to make things
disappear.
	   Not content with making investors' share value vanish, Mr Tose
had a crack at the shareholders themselves.
	   When presented with a question by one disgruntled shareholder,
Mr Tose's recital in a monotone of the sequences leading up to his
company's collapse, he had investors streaming for the exits.
	   He was barely a third of the way through his recital before he
had cleared at least a third of the gathered throng.
	   His finale in terms of vanishing acts was perhaps his finest
moment.
	   Having sat through a barrage of investors' questions and with
the meeting coming to a less than satisfactory conclusion, Mr Tose,
several ex-Peregrine investors, and a rather ``burly'' entourage,
melted away through a back exit to avoid the baying mob.
	   His sudden disappearance could have given top magician David
Copperfield a run for his money.
	   Peregrine shareholders got a raw deal on Friday.
	   Not only were they left holding shares whose value could only be
improved upon by soaking them in water and selling them as waste
paper, but every question put to the provisional liquidator had to
go through several translations before reaching its destination and
vice versa with the answers.
	   The truth is that many small investors haven't a clue as to the
procedures and jargon involved in a liquidation and this is made
doubly difficult by the language barrier.
	   Why then do so many of Hong Kong's large organisations insist on
doggedly repeating and retranslating information to the frustration
of everyone involved, when the simple answer would be to brief an
employee who has a knowledge of the local language and can answer
investors' queries directly.

	   Don't stop beating, I am coming - could be a message to the
thousands of heart patients of the country going abroad every year
in search of proper and better treatment.The other day, I had the
opportunity of visiting a newly-built specialised heart centre - a
noble venture - first of its kind in the country in the private
sector. The 106-bed, well-equipped hospital is located at Konia,
Gazipur, by the side of the Dhaka-Mymensingh Road. The sole sponsor
of the 30-crore-Taka project, M.S. Haque, a businessman from
Balaganj, Sylhet, has dedicated the hospital to the memory of his
mother late Tairunnessa, who died of heart attack in 1986.
	   The bereaved son couldn't find proper treatment for his ailing
mother in the country at that time and had to take her abroad for
treatment. Going abroad for treatment pained the son of Tairunnessa
very much and he vowed to establish an advanced and well-equipped
heart centre for screening and treatment of all sorts of heart
ailments. This is precisely how the Tairunnessa Memorial Medical
Centre has become a reality today.The Tairunnessa Memorial Medical
Centre (TMMC) is housed in a 52,000-square-feet four-storied
building and a surrounding area with a parking lot, a decorated
mini-pond and a lawn with flower bed and lush green trees.
	   The building itself is not very eye-catching or attractive from
outside. However, once you go inside and look around, you can very
well read the message of the TMMC - the beautifully decorated and
designed with most advanced sophisticated equipment, as available
in any advanced heart centre anywhere in the developing and even
the developed countries. The TMMC is as it were assuring the heart
patients of the country: ``Don't stop beating, I am coming''. Yes,
the noble venture goes into operations on Monday, the 15th June,
1998, i.e. today.As told by the sponsor, the preliminary work such
as procurement of land etc. started in 1994. About 50 per cent of
the project has been funded by the Sonali Bank and the remaining
equity has been made available by the sponsor.
	   The hospital has two well-equipped operation theatres (OT) where
four operations such as Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) and
Valboctomy or Valboplasty could be performed daily.These OT's are
equipped with sophisticated machines such as heart-lung machine,
pressure ventilator etc. There is a cath (catheter lab) equipped
with an angiomat - an angiogram machine of Siemens, Germany. A
total of eight angiogram or angioplasty could be done daily in the
cath-lab.The hospital is fully air-conditioned with centrally piped
in oxygen and ventilation system. It is also equipped with
sophisticated blood bank, pathological and biochemistry laboratory
along with all the invasive and non-invasive screening facilities
like ECG, Echocardiogram, Doppler echo, Holter monitor, stress test
machine, angiography etc.
	   The X-ray department is equipped with a 800 MA X-ray machine
with televised system. The emergency CCU (Coronary Care Unit), ICU
(Intensive Care Unit) and the cabins are all fitted with monitors,
ventilators and cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) units. There
is also a well-equipped ambulance service.The tariff for different
screening test and package treatment and surgery are almost
equivalent to the rates in the different advanced cardiac centres
in the neighbouring countries minus the problem of travel and daily
expenses abroad and administrative problems.To top everything, the
TMMC is manned, along with Bangladeshi cardiologists, cardiac
surgeons and health and biomedical technicians, by as many as four
expatriate cardiologist-surgeons and seven highly experienced
foreign technicians and nurses.
	   The most assuring news is that the centre will be run and
administered by internationally famed cardiologist and
interventionist, Dr. Wahidur Rahman, a Bangladeshi-origin French
cardiologist having more than 6,000 angiogram and more than 3,000
angioplasty with stenting to his credit. Dr. Wahidur Rahman's team
also includes internationally famed cardiac surgeon, Dr. Cantle,
who has more than 3,000 bypass and other cardiac surgery to his
credit.We spend around Tk. 200 crore every year in the neighbouring
countries like India and Singapore for treatment purposes and along
with a lot of sufferings and difficulties. There is a big vacuum in
the field of specialised treatment, particularly with regard to
heart and kidney diseases in the private sector.
	   The sole institute of the country, NICVD (National Institute for
Cardio-vascular Diseases), is yet to achieve total confidence in
the field of interventions like angioplasty and CABG though
rendering praiseworthy services.Such ventures will also help saving
foreign currency for the country.

Man upset over inheritance share scatters money from overpass
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A man who told police he was upset over his share
of an inheritance scattered 6.7 million yen (dlrs 46,200) worth of
bills from an overpass Monday, causing a brief traffic jam, a
Japanese news agency reported.
	   Kyodo News said the 53-year-old taxi driver, who was not
identified, told police investigators, ``I thought it would be good
if underprivileged children could pick (the money) up.''
	   Police asked passers-by, including some motorists who stopped
their cars to scoop up the 10,000-yen (dlrs 69) bills, to return
the money to authorities. By evening, eight hours after the man
scattered the money, 88 bills, amounting to 880,000 yen (dlrs
6,070), had been recovered, Kyodo said.
	   The man scattered the bills over a busy intersection in Kokura,
about 830 kilometers (520 miles) southwest of Tokyo.

Thai soldiers allowed to stay up past bedtime to watch World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Showing its kind and gentle face, the
Thai Army has agreed to allow conscripts to stay up late to watch
television broadcasts of World Cup soccer games.
	   Army Commander Gen. Chettha Thanajaro personally approved the
decision to allow soldiers to stay up past their normal bedtime of
9 p.m. to watch the games, which are popular with all segments of
Thai society, a military spokesman said Monday.
	   The soldiers will not be permitted to stay up all night,
however. Matches being played at 2 a.m. Thai time will be recorded
for viewing at a more appropriate hour.
	   Thai newspaper reports quoted officers as saying that conscripts
were pleased with the late-night viewing policy.
	   They also said that it fostered good relations between enlisted
men and their officers by letting them share their enthusiasm for
the sport.
	   One officer was quoted as saying the army was not worried that
the men would gamble on the games, because they had no money to
bet. Conscripts have their necessities taken care by the military,
but are paid a pittance.

Bangladesh leader to urge Indian nuclear restraint on visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will fly
to neighboring India for a day's visit Tuesday as part of her
mission to defuse tension in the South Asian region over nuclear
explosions by India and Pakistan last month, officials said Monday.
	   Hasina, the first head of state to visit New Delhi since the
multiple nuclear tests, will fly to Pakistan on June 24 on a
similar mission.
	   ``Bangladesh wants India and Pakistan to talk to each other to
settle their disputes peacefully,'' said a senior foreign ministry
official, who declined to be named. But the official added that his
government did not intend to mediate in the dialogue.
	   In New Delhi, a Foreign Office spokesman said Hasina's visit was
``taking place purely in the context of India-Bangladesh
relations,'' United News of India reported.
	   India has rejected intervention from a third country in its
disputes with Islamabad, revolving around the disputed Himalayan
territory of Kashmir over which India and Pakistan have fought
three wars since gaining independence from colonial British rule in
1947.
	   Hasina will hold discussions with her counterpart Atal Bihari
Vajpayee in their first meeting since the Indian leader assumed
power two months ago.
	   They are expected to discuss bilateral issues and the upcoming
summit of the seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation or SAARC in Colombo in July, officials said.

Floods, landslides kill 46 in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Floods and landslides have killed 46 people in
southern China, state media said Monday, bringing the nationwide
death toll from the annual flood season to around 350.
	   Floods triggered by torrential rains that started Friday killed
40 people and destroyed more than 100,000 homes in Hunan province,
the Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The floods affected more than 4 million people, Xinhua said.
Rains caused rivers to rise sharply, cutting communications,
traffic and power supplies, and forcing some businesses to shut, it
said.
	   Six people were killed and another was missing in a landslide
caused by torrential rains that lashed Nanping city in southeast
Fujian province, Xinhua said.
	   Prior to the latest reports, state media had said more than 300
people had died in floods that have struck 10 provinces, including
usually arid Ningxia in the northwest and Hunan, the worst-hit
region.
	   Floods from torrential summer rains are an annual scourge for
much of southern China. But this year, unusually heavy rainfall
means that floods that usually peak in July and August are expected
to hit earlier and harder.

EU to oppose planned MCI, WorldCom merger failing concessions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union said Monday it will
oppose a planned merger between U.S. telecommunications companies
WorldCom Inc. and MCI Communications Corp. unless they make
concessions.
	   EU spokesman Stefan Rating confirmed reports Monday in the Wall
Street Journal Europe that the EU executive Commission wants MCI to
shed all its Internet holdings as a condition for approving the
merger.
	   ``I can confirm what was in the Wall Street Journal today,'' he
said.
	   WorldCom Inc. announced last November it agreed to buy MCI
Communications Inc. for stock valued at about dlrs 37 billion.
	   MCI has already agreed to sell some of its Internet assets to
Cable and Wireless, but the EU's competition chief Karel Van Miert
says more concessions are needed.
	   The EU Commission is entitled to block mergers and alliances it
judges hinder fair competition in the 15-nation bloc.
	   The merger is also subject to approval by the U.S. Justice
Department. The deadline for a Commission decision on the
MCI-WorldCom merger is July 15. The U.S. Justice Department has no
deadline for a decision.

	   In the decade since AIDS was first described and named, medical
science has made great progress against it. Doctors have identified
its cause, the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) that infects and
destroys the T cells that are a key component of the immune system.
They have devised reliable tests for the presence of HIV, thereby
minimising the risk of contracting it through contaminated blood
transfusions. They have come up with drugs to slow the growth of
the virus in the body and delay the onset of symptoms and drugs to
treat the complications of AIDS that actually kill.
	   They have also devised rules which if every one followed them,
would virtually halt the spread of the virus among people who are
not yet infected. But there is one thing they have not been able to
do even once: they have never cured it. Although there are reports
of a few cases of spontaneous recovery (still a highly
controversial assertion, to be sure), for all practical purposes a
person who has been infected with HIV, is infected for life. In
most cases, HIV infected persons like Magic Johnson, the great
Basket ball hero of America or artist Lesnick showed no external
symptoms except for a brief flue like illness shortly after
contracting the infection.
	   True, people with AIDS virus may feel completely healthy - as
Johnson does - and exhibit no medical symptoms at all. They can
continue like that indefinitely, while the virus erodes the immune
system. Over time symptoms may appear such as weight loss or the
night sweats that have been likened to a dousing with a bucket of
cold water. Eventually a threshold is crossed. The immune system
breaks down, the person gets sick with one of the distinctive
infections that are markers for AIDS and his case is added to
8,50,000 Americans who have been diagnosed with AIDS. Although some
people get sick after infection, the median interval is between 10
and 11 years and that includes statistics from the years before
such drugs such as AZT were available.
	   The upper limit, if there is any, doctors say, is unknown.
That's the good news. The bad news is that once AIDS itself is
diagnosed - the full blown disease, not just the infection - the
chance of surviving is around one in 10. Sadly, shortly after
someone is infected until the day he dies, he can pass the virus on
to someone else. It is certainly the long latency of the virus that
has enabled it to spread so widely. Despite its lethality, AIDS is
actually a very difficult disease to catch. The virus can not
survive for more than a than minutes outside the human body and has
been transmitted as far as is known, only by infected blood, semen
or vaginal secretions.
	   Hemophiliacs and surgery patients can get HIV via a contaminated
transfusion of whole blood or blood products although that is rare
now in developed countries since the blood is routinely tested.
Infants can get it from infected mothers, either in utter across
the placenta or by contact in passing through the birth canal. More
striking, the virus has also been found in breast milk and studies
have shown that it can be transmitted that way. Case studies
revealed that several hundred health workers have acquired the
virus from the blood of patients but transmission in other
direction almost never occurs. (The case of Florida dentist who
infected Kimberly Bengalis and four others of his patients was the
only reported instance of this kind). And the virus can spread
among drug users who share needles, accounting for the second
largest number of total AIDS cases in America.
	   It can spread via unprotected sexual contact - usually, but not
always, when the infected partner is a male. This is partly because
more men than women have the virus in the first place. The early
victims of the AIDS infection in America were mostly homosexual men
and although women are catching up, the rate of infection among men
are still six times as great. Medical studies reveal that men are
more efficient at infecting their partners. Coming back to
Johnson's case, if he indeed contracted the virus from a woman, he
was very unlucky: only 2.2 per cent of all AIDS cases in America
were contracted that way. ``AIDS will be with us for a long time to
come. Till the end of 1997, there would be more than 15 million
people infected with AIDS'', so said Dr. James Chin, one time head
of the World Health Organisation AIDS surveillance unit and more
than half of those are in Sub-Saharan Africa. By 1997, says Chin,
newly diagnosed cases would have reached a plateau in the
industrialised world but transmission would explode in the
developing nations.
	   In Asia, AIDS is spreading fastest in Thailand (where an
estimated 15 per cent of female prostitutes are infected) and in
India. During the next couple of decades in the Third World, Chin
predicts, ``AIDS will become the leading cause of death for adults
in their most productive years''. Hence the need for a vaccine that
can combat the disease at the root, at least in the developing
countries grappling with financial stress. But despite over a
decade of intensive efforts, an HIV vaccine remains elusive. Every
known strategy for making such a vaccine has been evaluated, but
even the most promising candidate formulations to emerge are at
best years from human use. Yet these investigation will continue,
for there is no other way to block or at least slow the relentless
spread of HIV throughout the world. Vaccines are biological frauds.
By mimicking infections by viruses, bacteria or other pathogens
they trigger the body's immune defenses to mount a counter attack,
even though the vaccines present little or no danger.
	   Vaccines are extraordinary tools for combating infectious
disease. There is possibly no better way to fight an illness, after
all. than to prevent it from occurring. In short, every vaccine is
a custom production, determined by the biology of the pathogen,
what needs to be done and what is possible. Developing a vaccine or
vaccines that are safe and effective in preventing HIV infection in
exposed individuals is a major public health priority in the
national and international effort to combat this pandemic. HIV
disease continues to be a major impact on public health worldwide,
and its spread is projected to increase through the year 2,000, and
beyond. The United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) has
estimated that about 8,500 people become infected with HIV daily,
of which 90 percent are in the developing world. If present trends
persist, the rate of new infections will remain relatively stable
in Europe and North America but will expand and devastate parts of
Latin America, Africa and Asia.
	   Until now, the creation of new HIV vaccines or the development
of a vaccine to prevent HIV infection or even, for that matter, to
delay or temper the devastating impact of AIDS has proven
especially difficult. First, any strategy for a HIV vaccine must
take into account the astonishing variability of the virus. HIV
mutates rapidly as the infection spreads, and the virus can
literally change the shape of the antigenic structures faster than
the immune system - both cellular and humoral (antibody) responses
- can mount responses to these new elements. Thus vaccines based on
some or all the components from a single strain or isolate of HIV,
as experts see. is almost sure to fail. Second. there is still
uncertainty about how and in what form HIV is transmitted from one
individual to another.
	   It is known that the virus can be passed either by direct
infusion into the bloodstream (e.g, injected drugs or contaminated
blood or blood products) or sexually by crossing the mucus
membranes of the genital organs. But, it is not known whether the
viruses that actually infect the new body that find their way into
are free, that is, as individual particulars in blood or other
fluids, or within cells. There is evidence that HIV can be
transmitted directly from one cell to another when the cells come
into contact, and if such is the case, antibodies would be useless
regardless of what parts of the virus they were targeted to. Third,
it is simply unknown at this point in the AIDS pandemic what kind
of immune response or responses might actually afford protection
against HIV. On infection, HIV evokes both humoral and cellular
immune responses.
	   However, which of these responses is the more important in
containing the spread of the infection, and, even more importantly,
which could actually prevent or clear an infection if an effective
vaccine could be made'? Could antibodies do it? Could killer T
cells? Or would it take both? The answers to these questions are
critical. If it were known, say, that a vigorous cellular response
against certain structures within HIV could afford protection,
there would be little value in pursuing the development of'
antibody vaccines. And the opposite is true cellular vaccines might
have little value. Finally, there is a facet of the HIV/AIDS story
that perhaps more than any single actor hinders progress toward a
vaccine: an animal model.
	   If laboratory animals could be infected by HIV, scientist could
quickly find answers to the questions of how HIV is transmitted and
what kinds of immunity are most effective against the virus. At
present, only Chimpanzees, human's closest relative, can be
infected with HIV, and only after years do some of the animals show
any sign of illness as a result. But even if they were abundant and
inexpensive, these creatures are hardly suitable as a model for HIV
disease. Against the backdrop of all such skepticism and prolonged
debate, a biotechnology firm, bankrolled by private investors will
begin the world's first large-scale trials of an AIDS vaccine from
this month of June as reported in San Francisco Chronicle on June 4
last. South San Francisco-based VaxGen Inc, headed by legendary
AIDS pioneer, Dr. Donald Francis, said on June 4 last that it has
received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration to test
its ``AIDSVAX'' vaccine on 5,000 American volunteers.
	   The company also plans to test its vaccine on 2,500 volunteers
in Thailand. The company expects that results should come to light
in two to four years. Dr. Marcus Conant, a prominent San Francisco
Aids physician said, ``I've been waiting to see this happen for the
last five years, so I am delighted.''Testing will begin Chicago,
Los Angeles, Denver, Philadelphia and St. Louis, but not in New
York and San Francisco-centres of the AIDS epidemic where
skepticism of Francis' vaccine runs deep. Seventeen years after the
emergence of AIDS, the planned test of VaxGen's vaccine is
generating cautious hope. But there is also widespread skepticism
that the immunisations will work. Also, many researchers are
uncomfortable with the ethical dilemma posed by the vaccine trials.
One out of three volunteers vaccinated will get a placebo,
conferring absolutely no protection against the AIDS virus.
	   The only way researchers will know that the vaccine is working
is if a percentage of the placebo group abandons safe sex practices
and becomes infected while a comparable group of vaccinated
subjects also takes risks but remains virusfree. There is
additional fear that the promise of a vaccine could induce even
some of the general population to cast aside sexual caution. ``It
is evident that (current AIDS vaccine) have not yet yielded
antibodies that neutralise most natural strains of HIV'', said Or.
Baltimore, Chairman of the AIDS Vaccine Research Committee, in a
laundry article in the journal Science. There has been a lot of
optimism in many quarters about Francis' testing. ``This is a
watershed event in the AIDS crisis'', said Dr. Seth Berkely,
president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a New
York-based organisation advocating aggressive testing of AIDS
vaccine.
	   So far about 25 potential AIDS vaccines have been tested in
humans but until now none has inspired enough confidence to attempt
the costly large-scale trials needed to prove the vaccine works. On
the financial front, Dr. Francis is quite happy. Francis said he
had no trouble, however, lining up private investors willing to
take chance this time. The VaxGen vaccine is genetically engineered
protein almost identical to one found on the surface of AIDS virus.
In theory, the vaccine trains white blood cells to produce
antibodies that recognise and attack the same protein, killing the
virus. An early version of the vaccine was safely tested on 1200
humans. A new version, which is made from protein found on two
different strains of the virus, has been tested on 120 humans and
this is the one that will be used in large-scale trials. ``What's
driven us'', said Francis, ``is the success we have had in
chimpanzees''. Early versions of the vaccine protected chimps that
were deliberately infected with the AIDS virus.
	   Human subjects nevertheless have produced more antibodies after
vaccination than the chimps. But as scientists piece together the
AIDS puzzle, there is a mounting consensus that antibodies are not
sufficient to stop the virus. A second defence system consisting of
blood cells, programmed, to kill other cells infected by the virus,
may be needed. ``It's nonsense'', counters Francis. ``We know this
vaccine is more than sufficient to induce protection''. Francis
till now is quite optimistic. He said it is only a matter of time
before this vaccine is tested in New York and San Francisco and up
to 40 clinics in North America should be participating by the end
of the year. San Francisco AIDS doctor, Dr. Canant said, the tests
will be valuable even if the VaxGen vaccine proves a failure. ``No
matter how these trials come out, (they) will get very important
answers to basic questions'', he said.
	   The skepticism that is there is based on speculation, rather
than experience. Francis said that failure to practise safe sex,
whether in a vaccine trial or not, is part of the cold reality of
AIDS. ``If people were following all the rules we made on safe
activity we wouldn't need a vaccine'', he said. As it happens in
all cases leading to new trials and scientific pursuits, not all
AIDS experts are equally excited. In fact, some think that the
AIDSVAX, which has continued in development using $ 27.5 million in
finds from private investors, is unlikely to protect against HIV.
``I personally believe people should be able to try what they want
to try, but it's a very, very long shot to expect anything,
commented Dr. David Baltimore, Head of the US National Institute of
Health (NIH)-sponsored AIDS Vaccine Research Committee. Dr.
Baltimore believes this trial could ``seriously dent the
reservoir'' of potential volunteers for HIV vaccine that hold more
promise.
	   As would be expected in a major medical issue like this, ``there
has been a tremendous amount of opinion in this debate,'' Dr.
Robert C. Nowinski, VaxGen's co-founder, told Reuters. However, Dr.
Nowinski believes the currant FDA decision to approve the phase III
trial of AIDSVAX has effectively ended this debate. ``At this point
we know that the vaccine induces antibody in 100 per cent of people
that we inoculate'', he continued. The issue in the 3-year phase
III trial is to find out to what extent it prevents HIV infection,
he said. and this can only be done in a real-life situation.
Volunteers in the US trial will include those at risk of HIV
infection through sexual transmission - men who have sex with men
and women who have sexual partners who are HIV positive. Volunteers
in the Thai trial will consist primarily of injection drug users.
Dr. Nowinski said they plan to begin inoculating volunteers within
a matter of days.

	   To kick off what promises to be a lengthy judicial process, the
Federal Attorney General's Office (PGR) announced Sunday it has
officially filed two arrest warrants for Angel Isidrio Rodriguez
Saez, also known as ``El Divino.''
	   Rodriguez Saez's lawyers have already filed injunctions, or
amaparos, against the warrants and ``El Divino'' remains free, but
on parole; he must sign in weekly at the Reclusorio Oriente
penitentiary where he may eventually end up following his trial.
	   A Mexico City district judge issued two warrants: One for
violating Article 112, Fraction V of the Credit Institutions Law
when he was president of Banpais. He allegedly issued a bad loans
totaling 34,732,597 pesos to a company called Aerotransportacion
Comercial. The other for violating Article 52, Fraction I of the
Securities Law, also while he was head of Banpais. Being in charge
of the ``purchase and sale of loans'' for the bank, Rodriguez Saez
allegedly violated the nations' banking law, the PGR statement
said, and is being charged with giving an additional 579,094,531
pesos in bad loans to various borrowers. The PGR did not say
whether these loans were issued to ``ghost'' companies, or friends,
but it's likely more details about the borrowers will come to light
once the federal government has built its case against ``El
Divino.''
	   Rodriguez Saez was extradited to Mexico from Spain June 1 and
has remained free under the amaparo law since his arrival.

	   Obesity is the disorder of energy balance, indicating that
energy storage (fat) is too large because energy intake has
exceeded energy expenditure. Successful treatment depends on
creating energy deficit to metabolise excess fat. The excess fat is
not pure fat, but a mixture of 75 per cent fat and 25 per cent
fat-free tissue, having an energy value of 7000 kcal/kg. Thus in
order to lose 1 kg of adipose tissue per week, one should establish
an average energy deficit of 1000 kcal/day. During the first two
weeks of a reducing diet, weight loss is more rapid than the
calculation suggests. The reason is that initially some of the
weight loss is not due to a loss of adipose tissue but a mixture of
glycogen and water which has an energy value of only 1000 kcal/kg.
	   Theoretically, the energy deficit can be achieved by either
increasing energy expenditure or decreasing energy intake. In
practice, increasing energy expenditure is relatively ineffective,
because obese people have a low exercise tolerance. The mainstay of
treatment is a low energy diet, supplying 800-1200 kcal/day
depending upon the energy requirement of the individual. Obese
individuals have more fat and fat-free mass than individuals of
normal weight. Thus fat people have a greater energy expenditure
than lean people. A fat person loses weight faster than a lean
person if they both take the same low energy diet. So, fat people
often find dieting very difficult.Refractory obesity: Patients
attending hospital for obesity almost are refractory to diet.
	   This does not mean that the inexorable laws of thermodynamics do
not apply to them. Either they have been badly advised about the
diet they should take, or have failed to follow the advice, or have
had unrealistic expectations of the rate of weight loss they could
expect to achieve. Such difficulties should be solved with the help
of dietician.Alternative treatments: All the doctors treating obese
patients must be familiar with alternative therapies to dieting,
even if only to explain their limitations.a) Anorectic drugs:
Several drugs reduce hunger and improve compliance with low energy
diets. A weight loss of 11 kg in six months in a group of obese
patients taking D-fenfluramine, compared with eight kg loss in a
control group on placebo was observed.
	   However, during the next six months, there was little further
weight loss. This is probably the best that can be achieved with
anorectic drugs and it is debatable if this modest advantage is
worthwhile.b) Gastric stapling or jaw wiring: These procedures
reduce the amount that a patient can eat. Therefore, these are the
methods of enforcing dieting, rather than alternatives to dieting.
These may be justified under certain circumstances, but abdominal
surgery carries extra risks in obese patients.c) Starvation or very
low calorie diets: The lower the energy intake, the greater the
energy deficit and thus, the more rapid the weight loss of lean
tissue and, therefore, too great a decrease in resting metabolic
rate after weight loss. Unfortunately, starvation causes excessive
loss of lean tissue and therefore, too great a decrease in resting
metabolic rate after weight loss. There is no evidence that short
period of starvation to accelerate weight loss confers any long
term benefit.

	   THE Securities Commission has proposed for an increase in the
ceiling for foreign ownership in local stockbroking companies to a
maximum of 70 per cent from the present 49 per cent, its chairman
Datuk Dr Mohd Munir Majid said.
	   Munir said the decision rests with the Government. Foreign
interest in local stockbroking companies was increased from 30 per
cent to 49 per cent in 1988.

	   Leading opposition parties in the capital criticized Party of
the Democratic Revolution (PRD) Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' decision
to postpone mandatory third-party insurance for capital car owners.
	   The so-called SUVA (Insurance for the Use of Automotive
Vehicles) plan would have gone into effect July 1, but the mayor
said on Wednesday the plan would be postponed for one year.
	   Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Deputy Marcos Bucios
Mujica said Sunday that the capital government is acting in an
authoritative and irresponsible manner by unilaterally deciding to
postpone the plan, Notimex reported.
	   Meanwhile, the National Action Party (PAN) issued a statement
Sunday imploring Cardenas to reconsider his decision. The statement
called the decision a ``flagrant violation of the law'' established
earlier this year along with others (such as the seat belt
requirement) designed to improve the safety of drivers and
pedestrians in Mexico City.
	   Bucios Mujica, who is a PRI National Executive Committee
secretary, said Cardenas' decision is an example of promoting a
culture of unaccountability within capital politics.
	   On behalf if the PRI, the deputy also asked the mayor to
reconsider his decision.
	   Cardenas said Wednesday the plan is being postponed due to
logistical considerations. For example, he said, the city doesn't
know how to make cars from other states comply with the law.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Parliament's financial committee on Sunday
reviewed the budget of national oil company, the official Kuwait
News Agency reported.
	   It said the Kuwait Petroleum Corp.'s budget plan forecast
revenues in the next fiscal year starting July 1, at 3.258 billion
dinars (dlrs 10.61 billion), while overall expenditures are
estimated at 3.258 billion dinars (dlrs 10.61 billion).
	   It said the KPC is therefore expected to post a net profit of
around 674.30 million dinars (dlrs 2.196 billion) in the coming
year.
	   However, the forecast is sharply lower than 1.369 billion dinars
(dlrs 4.45 billion) net profit the company made last year.
	   The lower forecast reflects a slump in oil prices since the
beginning of the year.
	   KPC runs a monopoly in the country covering the entire upstream
and downstream operations.
	   KUNA said the parliament committee is expected to continue to
review KPC's subsidiaries' budgets in the next few days.
 &UR; ___
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) - Bahrain's central bank has recovered
about 30 million dinars (dlrs 113.1) of counterfeit banknotes in
recent days from the local market, newspapers reported Monday.
	   The news of the forged notes hit the market last week after
traders discovered that some fake 20 dinar (dlrs 53) notes were
being circulated.
	   The government then assigned some commercial banks to exchange
the forged notes with genuine ones until Sunday, when the BMA
announced it will no longer accept the counterfeits as a legal
tender.
	   The newspapers said the authorities are now relying on
international cooperation to discover the origin of the fake notes,
which has led to the arrest of suspects in a Latin American
country, which the newspapers did not name.
	   ``An international criminal gang is behind the whole
operation,'' Bahrain Tribune said without elaborating.
 &UR; ___
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria's Chamber of Commerce announced
Monday the establishment of the country's first private company
that would produce and export fruits and vegetables, the official
news agency, SANA, reported.
	   The company will have a capital of 400 million pounds (dlrs 8.8
million), SANA said.
	   It was established by the chambers of commerce and agriculture,
several fruit and vegetable merchants and other individuals, SANA
added.
	   The company will be mainly specialized in producing and
exporting fruits and vegetables to international markets.

Thai government tells monks to halt expensive building projects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government told senior monks
Monday to halt construction of new buildings at Buddhist temples
nationwide so their congregations would be less burdened by
donations during the current economic crisis.
	   The unusual order, conveyed at a meeting at a religious center
in a Bangkok suburb, was a telling indication of the depths of the
crisis as well as the influence the Buddhist church holds over
worshipers. About 90 percent of Thailand's 60 million people are
Buddhists.
	   Although the government's religious affairs department is
supposed to oversee the affairs of the Buddhist hierarchy _ known
as the Sangkha _ it generally allows the church to take care of its
own affairs.
	   At Monday's meeting, however, department Director-General
Samanchit Piromruen said the construction of new buildings on
temple grounds should be halted indefinitely.
	   The construction ban would also deal with the problem of monks
erecting buildings to receive promotions, Samanchit said.
	   Under Sangkha rules, monks can be elevated to a certain rank by
making 1.5 million baht (dlrs 34,000) worth of construction or
renovations of temple buildings, said a report about Samanchit's
order broadcast by ITV television. Money for such work would
normally come from donations.
	   If building projects were necessary, they should conform to a
standard plan issued by the ministry and cost no more than 700,000
baht (dlrs 15,000), Samanchit told the monks.
	   Last month, the government urged the country's supreme Buddhist
council to take action against monks and temples that refuse to
perform funeral rituals for the poor.
	   The action came after a fruit vendor in Bangkok complained
through the news media that her neighborhood temple had refused to
perform funeral rites for her father because she could not pay the
fee.
	   Buddhist temples survive on donations from the public, but
during Thailand's economic boom from 1985 to 1995, many became rich
as donations expanded. Unlike government or most businesses, they
do not have to account for their finances.
	   Many Thais believe that fat donations will reap them greater
spiritual merit, and pay large sums to have their businesses or
homes blessed by monks seen as spiritually powerful.
	   Some monks expressed disagreement with Samanchit's order, saying
the building of big temples is a reflection of people's faith and
such facilities are also convenient for conducting religious
activities, ITV reported.

	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Defiant to the last, ageing
apartheid-era President P.W. Botha refused near the end of his
trial Monday to apologize for human rights abuses committed during
his rule.
	   Botha, 82, issued a statement through his lawyer, Ernst
Penzhorn, that he
	   had nothing to be sorry about.
	   ``He is not aware of anything that he must apologize for,''
Penzhorn told
	   reporters.
	   Botha is on trial for snubbing the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which is probing apartheid crimes. If found guilty,
Botha faces an unspecified fine or two years in jail.
	   The trial resumes Aug. 17 with the defense completing closing
arguments. Judge Victor Lugaju was scheduled to deliver the verdict
the following day.
	   In closing arguments, prosecutor Bruce Morrison said Botha,
nicknamed the ``Big Crocodile'' for his stubborn political style,
had deliberately defied the commission.
	   ``His refusal to attend is the result of a willful and
deliberate defiance,'' Morrison said. Botha sat in the courtroom
Monday without making any comments.

	   PrivatiZation is now a global phenomenon which has been proved
to be the need of the day world over. Starting from a hesitant and
unacceptable beginning, privatization over a decade has gained
respectability as a process of thinking afresh whole experimenting
with innovative Government policies and market instruments.
Privatiza-tion as an aggressive policy when successfully carried
out has a significant role on investors' confidence. Besides
achieving the primary goals of improving efficiency and
effectiveness in the production process it also attracts investment
both form home &AMP; abroad. During the last 12 (twelve) years more
than 8500 (eight thousand &AMP; five hundred. State Owned Enterprises
(SOE's) have been privatised in over 80 countries both in the
developed and in the developing world. This fact explains why
privatization as a policy instrument is on the rise all over the
world.
	   Privatization in the form of divestiture stepped in mostly from
disenchantment with SOE's. This shift towards private sector has
many causes inherent in the economy in particular. But in general
the trend was due to a rise in unsustainable fiscal burdens. The
large and unsustainable fiscal burdens of the SOE's forced
government in different countries to divest their portfolio of
public corporations to the relatively efficient private ownership.
The failure of communism in Eastern &AMP; Central Europe acted as a
milestone to an international shift against he dominant role of the
state in their economy. The success stories of four little tigers
of East Asia namely Taiwan, Korea, Hong-Kong and Singapore with
export oriented growth strategies also contributed to privatization
being accepted as a policy in many countries. The success with
export oriented growth strategies of these little tigers have been
recognised as economic success stories.
	   This led many countries of the world to follow the foot step of
these countries where the private sector is considered as the
principal force behind this strategy. In Bangladesh, immediately
after the war of liberation in 1971, a large number of abandoned
enterprises had to be taken over by the Government. Jute, textile,
sugar industries, banks, and financial institutions were also
nationalised. The railway, airlines, electricity and Urban water
supply continued to remain in the public sector, as before, along
with distribution of agricultural inputs, such as, fertiliser,
irrigation equipment and improved seeds. In spite of all the
reasons given fro the establishment of state owned enterprises
(SOE's) there has been apart form isolated exceptions, a noticeable
absence both of economic successes by individual SOE and of the
macro-economic development and industrialisation successes as a
result of state control of industry. On the contrary, most of the
SOE's have become prominent recipients of subsidies.
	   A policy reversal began as early as mid-seventies and the
process of allowing the private sector led growth continued ever
since. The issue of privatization and private sector development
has now become a respectable proposition and is playing a central
role in the political and economic reform programmes of the
Government of Bangladesh. The Government of Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina is fully committed to further activate and strengthen the
role of private sector in trade and industry with a view to
accelerating economic development. Reducing the size and presence
of the public sector in the economy has been identified as the
cardinal principle of the Government policy. Our present Government
is fully committed to private sector-led economic growth and
development and is sincerely withdrawing from competing with it.
Since privation is on began in Bangladesh in mid-seventies, many
SOE's have been off-loaded to the private hands.
	   A world Bank study concluded recently looked into thirteen
enterprises that were privatised by the Privatization. Board
between 1994-96. It found only one of the thirteen enterprises
closed. The remaining twelve enterprises have posted significant
improved overall performance. After privatization the buyer of
Chittagong Cement Clinker was able to handle workers resistance
with managerial farsightedness. The financial situation of that
enterprise improved significantly under private ownership. By 1996,
production increased by about 40%, sales revenue jumped by 64%, and
the new management was able to declare higher dividends for its
shareholders. Such successes can be attributed to effective
management, supervision and cost control, healthy labour management
relations, optimum utilisation of machinery and manpower and
continued technological modernisation which was possible by the
entrepreneur in the Prite Sector.
	   The Bangladesh Cycle Industries after privatization started
production late last year (1997). This Government owned factory was
classed in 1992. The factory then used to produce only 130 cycles a
month. But last November they started production 2000 bikes a
month. When the mill was closed there were only 120 workers. But
the factory has now 225 workers. This will increase shortly to 350
early the next year. The factory was a losing concern at the time
of closure with total losses of Tk. 14.65 crores. But within one
year it has turned it no a profitable concern under private
ownership. Privatization in the present context of Bangladesh is a
sensitive and delicate issue for the Government. The organised
labour, a section of the bureaucracy with vested interests and some
local politicians are the main impediments towards privatization.
To overcome these difficulties and to carry forward the
privatization process the Privatization Board ins initiating a mass
Awareness Programme.
	   The Board also feels the necessity of a legal coverage of its
activities. A legal framework has been drafted with a wide rang of
coverage starting from identifying the SOE's to its sale. This
draft law is expected to be placed before the Parliament shortly.
The great fear of losing jobs among the employees of SOE's is
identified to be a major obstacle towards privatization. How ever
the Government has a program of retraining these retrenched workers
for using them in some other sectors of the industry thus creating
new scopes for employment. Government is also encouraging the
participation of the employees in the privatization process by
offering them the SOE's in the form of franchising employee buy-out
etc.In order to share knowledge and expertise the area the Board is
arranging training for its personal and also organising tours for
the group comprising members of parliament the Privatization Board
officials and the labour leaders.
	   It is hoped that this will add more dynamism in the privation
process. In the present day context of free market economy
Privatization is a compelling necessity for a country like
Bangladesh, because Government exchequer could hardly bear any
further losses by the Some'. Privatization is on the political
agenda of the government in-order to achieve its broader goals of
economic development towards a sustainable growth by reducing
poverty in the society. The failure of state led development
signals the private sector led economic growth and development.
Privatization if correctly pressed and implemented will improve
efficiency and productivity, generate funds for investment and
would free public resources for developing infrastructure and
accumulate fund for social betterment programmes. Development of
Bangladesh is not commensurate with its potential.
	   This is why the Govt of Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina has embarked
upon a wide range of reforms that are conductive to the
disengagement of the state from business &AMP; development and security
of both national and foreign private investments. There is a stark
privatization message for Bangladesh a message that says
privatization is not an optional extra in terms of policy choice.
The failure to privatise effectively cannot be measured only in
terms of lost opportunities for growth or in terms of budget costs
through subsidies and blockage in the financial sector through
non-performing loans. The failure to privatise is a burden on the
Government's finances, a burden on the financial system and a
contributor to the perception amongst the business community and
potential investors of deficits in commitment and credibility
surrounding economic reform. A successful privatization policy has
to shift the goal posts from sterile argument son the merits of
disposal of Sate interest to making privatization a positive and
powerful weapon fro creating investment.

Iran's Azizi: From dirt fields and plastic balls to big league

<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ When Iran meets the United States next
Sunday in the most politically charged match of this World Cup, one
of the players the Americans will have to watch is Iran's star
striker Khodadad Azizi.
	   This diminutive attacker, who at 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 meters)
is the shortest player on the team, helped Iran clinch the last
World Cup spot with a goal against Australia in the closing
minutes.
	   Azizi doesn't want to jinx his team by predicting the outcome of
any game. But, he says, even a jinx couldn't stop Iran from winning
against the United States.
	   Despite Iran's 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia at St. Etienne on Sunday,
the Iranians have gained new confidence for their next two games,
with the United States and Germany.
	   Iran was expected to crumble against the supposedly powerful
Yugoslavs. Instead, it put up a fight and went into the second half
tied 0-0. In the end, only one of Sinisa Mihajlovic's trademark
free kicks gave Yugoslavia its narrow win.
	   ``We will definitely play better and stronger against the United
States,'' said Azizi, who plays for Germany's FC Cologne. Two other
Iranian strikers, Ali Daei and Karim Bagheri, also play in the
German Bundesliga and are not to be taken lightly by opponents.
	   Azizi is considered one of the best strikers in the German
premier league, and has scored multiple goals for his club.
	   ``Our whole team is good. But we will make sure that the attack
is the best part of the team,'' said Azizi, 27.
	   He said that back home, people just cared about a good game
against Yugoslavia and Germany. But they want a win against the
United States.
	   For Iran, the United States is the one team it has any chance of
beating in Group F. Given nearly 20 years of hostility between Iran
and the United States, the game in Lyon will be among the most
intriguing at the World Cup.
	   Already, anti-American hard-liners in Iran are urging the
government to order players not to exchange T-shirts with the
Americans after the game.
	   For Azizi, the world of big league soccer, where he is paid more
than dlrs 1 million for the two-year contract with Cologne, is a
far cry from the dirt grounds where he started to play soccer in
his impoverished neighborhood.
	   Like nearly every Iranian player, Azizi first became intrigued
with soccer by kicking a flimsy plastic ball as a child.
	   Small in stature, Azizi has made speed his asset. On the field,
accelerates like a sprinter, and his fancy footwork allows him to
evade defenders.
	   ``My father was against my playing soccer. We were poor, and he
did not want me to sacrifice my studies for something that would
probably get me nowhere,'' said Azizi.
	   His Asian features are distinct from his teammates', and the
other Iranian players tease him with kung-fu shrieks as he races
across the field during practice sessions.
	   Azizi was born in the town of Fariman in northeastern Iran into
a family of six brothers and one sister. His father was a day
laborer who would work in the fields, joined by his sons during
school holidays.
	   Azizi married four years ago and has an 8-month-old daughter,
Fatemeh.
	   He says he likes his German club. But he loves Spanish soccer
more.
	   ``I've told my team I would never leave Cologne for another
German team, even if I were offered more money. But the one
condition I have had is that my club should let me go if I get an
offer from Spain,'' said Azizi.
	   ``I like Spanish soccer and I believe that any player who has
technique can do well there,'' Azizi said.
	   He said he will think seriously about whether to leave Cologne
only after the World Cup.

Space officials say they lack money to change Mir's orbit

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hours after announcing that the Mir space station
will start a slow descent this week in preparation for being
discarded, space officials said Monday they lacked money to perform
the the maneuver now.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency initially quoted Viktor Blagov, deputy
head of Mission Control Center, as saying that a cargo ship
attached to Mir will fire its engines on Thursday to lower the
station's orbit by about six kilometers (four miles).
	   Several hours later ITAR-Tass quoted Blagov as saying the cargo
ship must remain linked to Mir for longer than expected because the
space agency cannot afford to send a replacement.
	   That will use up all the cargo ship's fuel, leaving none for the
descent maneuver. Even without the maneuver, Mir will likely lower
its orbit to the same degree early next month, Blagov said.
	   However, a cargo ship due to arrive in September will assist Mir
in lowering its orbit. The cargo ship would provide more control
over the descent.
	   If Mir's orbit isn't controlled, the 130-ton station will fall
back to Earth within two years on its own and some big pieces could
hit populated areas, space officials warned.
	   Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin confirmed that the
maneuver scheduled for Thursday was canceled, but would not comment
on the reasons behind the decision.
	   Several cargo ships, docked to Mir one at a time, are supposed
to push the space station down from 400 kilometers (250 miles)
above Earth to 120 kilometers (75 miles), before it burns up in the
atmosphere in December 1999. A few large fragments are likely to
fall into the ocean.
	   Yuri Semyonov, head of the state-run RKK Energiya corporation
that built Mir and has been running it since it was put in orbit in
1986, has said Russia might be forced to discard the station as
early as this fall because of the space industry's desperate cash
shortage.
	   Semyonov said last week that the government owes Energiya 440
million rubles (dlrs 70 million) from last year and hasn't paid any
bills so far this year.
	   According to Blagov, Russia will need four regular cargo ships
to gradually lower Mir's orbit and a fifth one, with a larger
amount of fuel, to give the station a final farewell push.
	   Russia hopes to keep Mir in orbit until 1999, when it will be
replaced by the international space station.

	   THE Federation of Malaysian Port Operating Companies (FMPOC) is
continuously embarking on improving productivity and introducing
cost- saving programmes as shipping lines are attracted to
efficient competitive ports and economies of scale.
	   FMPOC chairman Datuk Zahrain Mohd Hashim said high performance
standards are continuously observed and monitored not only by port
operating companies but also by the port regulatory authorities.
	   ``It is my fervent hope that we will garner support for our
efforts in helping the Government accomplish its vision of making
Port Klang a national and regional gateway.
	   ``The Government's drive to reduce the country's balance of
payments through its encouragement of the shipping fraternity to
utilise local ports will not be successful if only the port
operating companies are serious about it. It urgently needs the
active participation of all the links in the logistics chain from
the manufacturer to the shipping line,'' he said.
	   He added that the capacity of FMPOC ports are more than
sufficient to handle the anticipated increased exports as a result
of the depreciating ringgit, which has made Malaysian goods and
services more competitive in the international market.
	   ``This is because FMPOC ports have adopted a supply driven
approach in port development whereby capacity is kept ahead of
demand.
	   On electronic commerce, Zahrain said there is a pressing need
for all ports to be linked through Electronic Data Interchange
(EDI).
	   ``EDI has been successfully implemented in Port Klang and FMPOC
requests the Government to give urgent attention for EDI to be
expanded to cover all ports in the country.
	   ``With EDI networking, information and documentation flow among
port users will be greatly enhanced and expedited, communications
improved and cost savings achieved,'' he said.

World Cup: Belgium seeking to change style ahead of vital Mexico
</HEADLINE>
game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTHIEUX, France (AP) _ Belgium showed its dreariest side
against the Dutch and was rewarded with an opening draw. For a
badly needed victory against Mexico Saturday, the Red Devils will
have to show any flair they still possess.
	   ``We will have to prove we can do it another way too,'' Belgian
coach Georges Leekens said Monday.
	   Mexico leads Group E after its opening 3-1 victory over South
Korea with Belgium and the Netherlands two behind following their
goalless draw.
	   Against their Dutch rivals, the Red Devils never showed any
intention to press forward and only seemed determined to keep the
Netherlands from scoring. It worked.
	   ``That was then. Now comes the really important test,'' said
Leekens, figuring the Mexicans will be happy with a draw.
	   Belgium's biggest injury worry, Gordan Vidovic, was to resume
training late Monday but midfield master Marc Wilmots was sidelined
with a painful thigh injury. He should be recovered by Tuesday.
	   To provide the offensive thrust against the Mexicans, many want
to see veteran playmaker Enzo Scifo play in his fourth successive
World Cup campaign in Bordeaux Saturday.
	   Belgium dearly lacked imagination and Scifo has proved in the
past that, if any Red Devil can provide a sparkle, he can. However,
he is coming off a lackluster season and, at 32, his vaunted
creativity has been in decline.
	   So, even Scifo is not insisting he should be fielded by coach
Leekens, with whom he has quarreled long during the spring.
	   ``If I were the coach, I would start out with the same team,''
he said.

	   Globally, privatization is increasingly recognised as an
effective tool of economic transformation and development. It may
be one of the most important trends in economic development in the
coming decade. Privatization transactions have covered a wide
spectrum of geographic and economic sectors in a variety of
countries at vastly different stages of development. Role of
Privatization as part of the country's overall economic programme:
The Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is to carry
out privatization in the context of its broader goals of economic
development and poverty reduction. An efficient private sector
makes essential contribution to the attainment of these goals, and
privatization is one of the means available for promotion of
private sector development Privatization, when correctly conceived
and implemented, fosters efficiency, encourage investment and thus
ensures new growth.
	   It will help economic reform which includes trade deregulation
and liberalisation(removal of monopolies), interest rate
liberalisation, foreign exchange flotation and civil service reform
(downsizing). The Privatization Board -- the development of
institutions and policies to support Privatization. The
Privatization Board is entrusted with the overall responsibility of
privatizing SOEs (State Owned Enterprises) identified for
privatization, whether small, large, profitable or non profitable.
Ministries having SOEs under their control have set-up
Privatization Cells for assisting the Privatization Board in
identifying, preparing, processing, implementing and monitoring
SOEs for privatization. The Privatization Board was composed of
members of the civil servant only.
	   But the Government has now reconstituted the Board by including
the Members of the Parliament (both from the party-in-power and the
opposition), representatives of the private sector and professional
groups as the members of the Board. It is hoped this will give a
positive signal to the business community both at home and abroad
that the Government wants to go ahead with privatization involving
all the stakeholders that will also include the civil servants,
politicians, private sector personalities and representatives of
the professional groups. Policies to support privatization include
deregulation (so that the privatized company competes equally with
other companies in the sector and with imports), possible change in
labour laws to make hiring and firing easier, permitting private
sector competition with State monopolies in area like airlines and
any policy which rolls back the involvement of the state in the
economy.
	   Labour issues, dealing with Unions: retraining: social safety
nets, etc.There are two approaches to the labour issue. One is to
give a reasonable golden handshake and leave it up to the employee
to find new job and another is to take positive steps to find
alliterative work. In France this involves setting up an employment
agency in firms about to be downsized or privatized as it is easier
to find a new job for someone who is employed. In Germany
retraining facilities are established in affected zones. In our
country under the Jute Retraining Scheme the employees had a two
week course in chicken farming/vegetable growing etc. as training
to establish a small business. Govt. assistance for retraining
takes many forms credits to workers, costs of courses shared with
companies, subsistence and travel allowances paid for workers
attending.
	   In (Germany a two year course attempted to retrain factory
workers as office workers. We have a project for training of
affected workers of Jute Mills only. But there is no such
arrangement for the affected workers of Textile Mills and other
Industries. The Privatization Board is planning to introduce a
training program for the affected workers of Textile and other
Industries.The objective of the program will be to develop
marketable skill for alternative Job, and help building up viable
micro enterprise for affected workers. The growth is the best
safety net as there is a direct connection between growth and
poverty reduction The scope of the program will be to asses the
number of interested participations, identity probable areas of
training for alternative employment accordingly. Under the program
affected interested workers will also receive counseling services
and required assistance in building up viable micro - enterprise.
	   The Privatization Board considers this training program very
important as this will create confidence among the labour community
. This will also help the Privatization Board for implementing
privatization program smoothly. Preparation and marketing of state
owned enterprises:Restructuring of capital (usually writing off
loans, which many buyers will take over), assets (scrapping
obsolete assets or selling some separately from the main business
to maximise proceeds), labour (laying off surplus staff before
Privatization), operations (trying to improve efficiency and thus
enhance the price) and marketing (Advertisement through magazines;
newspapers using the internet; using media other than newspapers
etc.) should be initiated for preparing SOEs for
Privatization.Mobilisation of financial resources for
Privatization:Finding cash for buyers is a problem.
	   Solutions include parallel development of financial and capital
markets usually by privatizing the banks, creating Privatization
Funds, companies funded by banks and non-bank financial
institutions specifically to buy minority shareholdings in
privatized companies, public offers of shares, extended credit to
buyers, attracting FDI and phased sale of larger SOEs.
Post-Privatization impact and the role of government in the new
economic environment: Impact will be on the company/enterprise
which should improve in efficiency and attract more investment,
employees and welfare which should improve, customers who should
get better quality products and better quality of service,
regulatory bodies (government will no longer be regulating itself).
Government fiscal deficits will reduce and the overall economy will
improve.
	   The role of Government changes from operator to regulator.
Privatization is all about redefining the role of Government. In
Bangladesh, privatization is an important element of the
Government's overall market-oriented adjustment strategy, with
privatization and pro-market reforms mutually reinforcing one
another. There are three potentially large benefits of
privatization in Bangladesh: stemming the increasing losses of the
SOEs; improving the efficiency and quality of services provided by
SOEs; and signalling to the private sector the Government's
commitment to the irreversibility of the pro-market reforms. With
annual SOEs losses now growing realisation, not only in Government,
but also among labour unions and the public, that privatization
where possible is imperative and inevitable. Arresting these losses
and reducing subsidies will also have potential beneficial effects
on public and private investment and would allow government to
allocate more resources required for poverty alleviation, social
and human resource development.
	   It has been recognised that privatization will help to improve
the public credibility of the government's commitment to stop
interfering with production decisions in the future in which it
would only be substituting for private activity. Evidence suggests
that this effect of privatization is as (if not more) important as
the improvement in production efficiency from privatization.
Raising the confidence of the private sector, by demonstrating the
Government's commitment to increasing the private sectors' role in
the economy is necessary for an increase in private manufacturing
investment in Bangladesh. Privatisation can also mobilise local as
well as foreign funds for investment and develop the capability of
Bangladesh stock market by increasing the number of equities
listed. Privatization will help attract new technology and
management techniques associated with foreign investment and joint
ventures.
	   Finally, privatization of certain parts of the utilities and
infrastructure sector will improve the efficiency of services so
that they become reliably available on a timely, market-priced
basis. Privatization effort - present situation: Privatization and
private development is a difficult job everywhere both in the
developed and in the developing world. Countries that are fully
committed to do privatization have not yet fully succeeded even
with best of its intentions. Initiations of privatization
programmes in the country has become difficult due to inappropriate
privatization policies, coupled with lack of skills for
implementing privatization programs and absence of enabling laws.
It may be pointed out that in the last 3(three) years i.e. 1993-96
Privatization Board could manage to privatise only 12 industries.
But in the last one year it has managed to get decision to handover
18 enterprises (both assets and shares) to the private sector out
of 61 SOE's programmed for privatization for the last fiscal
year(l996/97).
	   The Privatization Board is awaiting decision of the appropriate
authorities for finalising privatization process of another 14
enterprises. In the current fiscal year the Board has identified 54
enterprices for privatization. Transparency of the Privatization
process: The Board has put lot of importance to the transparency of
the privatization process. It has introduced transparency at every
stages of privatization process. There are sets of standard sale
procedures which will be made transparent and as well be a subject
for public scrutiny. Potential investors will get these procedures
from the Board. The accountability at every level of the
privatization process will be ensured.
	   Public awareness of the programme:The Board has initiated a
public awareness programme to mould public opinion in favour of
Privatization in the country. A media campaign explaining the
benefit of privatization is also underway. Recently, a group of
senior politicians, Members of parliament and labor leaders visited
Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan to see for themselves the
Privatization process of those countries. The officials of the
Privatization Board remain in touch with the concerned officials of
the ministries, corporations, enterprises, investors, trade union
leaders and members of various chambers. This helps to create an
appropriate environment for privatization. Besides, we have started
to work on developing awareness about privatization among all
sectors of population and specially among government and public
sector top officials in order to create a frontier of people
concerned with the importance of privatization and the significance
of accelerating the process as part of the reform process.
	   This will protect those responsible for planning and
implementing the privatization programme from attacks by the
opposing powers and rigid minds unable to cope with the development
of the modern world. Legal Frame Work:Efforts are also being made
to formulate a legal framework for privatization to make the
existing privatization process effective, transparent, well
co-ordinated, and fruitful.

Canada's Nortel to pay dlrs 9.1 billion for California-based Bay
</HEADLINE>
Networks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Canadian telecommunications giant Northern
Telecom Ltd. is acquiring California-based Bay Networks in a deal
worth dlrs 9.1 billion, the companies said Monday.
	   The deal, one of the biggest in North America's
telecommunications industry, will create a company designed to
deliver revamped Internet network systems around the world.
	   John Roth, president and chief executive of Northern Telcom,
will remain chief executive of the new company. Dave House,
chairman, chief executive and president of Bay Networks, will
become president of Nortel.
	   Once the merger is complete, Bay Networks will operate as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Nortel, the companies said. Bay Networks
shareholders will get 0.6 Nortel common shares for every share of
the acquired company they hold.
	   ``The Web has changed everything,'' House said. ``The public
network is moving rapidly from voice to data. A new class of
company must emerge to meet the demand for (Internet) technology
and networking expertise.''
	   Nortel, controlled by Bell Canada parent BCE Inc., is Canada's
largest telecommunications company with 73,000 employees around the
world and revenues of about dlrs 15 billion last year.
	   Bay Networks, based in Santa Clara, California, is a leader in
the worldwide networking market, serving corporations, service
providers and telecommunications carriers.
	   Roth told Nortel's annual meeting in April that huge growth is
straining the resources of the global computer network and Nortel
wants to cash in on the booming demand for secure systems.
	   Nortel has been on an acquisition binge and is shifting money
and workers into Internet projects, including its so-called Webtone
system, which is prompted as providing reliable, high-speed, secure
multimedia access to the Internet.
	   Already this year Nortel has paid dlrs 716 million to acquire
two companies _ Winnipeg-based Broadband Networks Inc. and
Boston-based Aptis Communications Inc. _ that will help it develop
Webtone.
	   About 3,000 of Nortel's 18,000 research workers are working on
improving Internet networks.

A West Point graduate says Polish army offers him no perspectives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Polish graduate of the renowned U.S.
West Point military academy says the army at home does not use his
professional skills and wants to leave the service, a tabloid said
Monday.
	   Lt. Piotr Jaskulski, 25, was one of first three Poles admitted
to West Point in 1993, with great hopes of helping to lead the
Polish army into NATO when he graduates, the Super Express said.
	   Jaskulski studied international relations and computer sciences,
but when he returned home last year, they made him a platoon
commander in an infantry division in the small northwestern city of
Stargard Szczecinski, the report said.
	   He does paperwork most of the time and translations after hours,
and earns 1,400 zlotys (dlrs 412) per month.
	   ``At West Point I was taught to be a leader. I see no chance for
development here ... no chance for a career,'' Jaskulski told Super
Express. ``I've decided to leave.''
	   On May 23 he sent a letter asking the Defense Ministry to
discharge him.
	   But ministry officials say Poland's West Point graduates should
first learn the military profession from the bottom before they can
be promoted.
	   ``They return with American diplomas in their backpacks and they
think they are a big deal,'' Lt. Col. Adam Wielechowski of the
defense ministry said.
	   ``We will not send them to Brussels right away. First they must
serve at the lower levels and show what they are worth,''
Wielechowski said.
	   Poland, a former Warsaw Pact country, was invited to join NATO
in April 1999. It has eight West Point graduates and three more
officers are studying there currently.

Norwegian government orders end to airport strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES to LEAD with government ordering binding arbitration
to end strike, reflects throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The government on Monday ordered striking
air traffic controllers to return to work immediately, four days
into a conflict that crippled airports, stranded thousands of
passengers and had airlines set for mass layoffs.
	   Minister of Municipalities Ragnhild Queseth Haarstad said she
ordered binding arbitration because of widespread damage the nearly
three-week strike was doing to the nation. Air traffic was to
resume immediately and was expected to return to normal by
Wednesday.
	   ``The conflict had reached the point of being very deadlocked,
and it would have been irresponsible not to order an end,'' she
said.
	   If the strike had continued this week, it could have threatened
Norway's oil production, which averages 3 million barrels a day,
because service helicopters to North Sea oil platforms had been
grounded.
	   More than 230 air traffic controllers and aviation workers
walked out on Friday, after their Academics Union ordered them to
support teachers and health workers striking for better pay.
	   The union rejected an employer's offer for wage hikes averaging
6 percent, and had been gradually stepping up industrial action
that began May 28.
	   Three airlines _ SAS, Braathens and Wideroe _ on Monday notified
nearly 5,000 employees of impending layoffs unless the strike was
settled promptly. The walkouts closed all airports in southern
Norway, where the vast majority of the country's 4.4 million people
live.
	   Airlines maintained part of their international services by
busing passengers more than four hours to Landvetter Airport in
Goteborg, southwest Sweden.
	   An estimated 50,000 people were affected by the strike at the
weekend, including the Simonsen-Nicolaysen family which spent 48
hours on a 1,350-kilometer (840-mile) trek by road, rail and bus
from their home in northern Norway's Bardufoss to Goteborg.
	   ``We had to get up at 4 a.m. Saturday,'' said Ellen Nicolaysen,
a mother of two small children.
	   ``The buses were overfilled and we had to sit the whole time
with two very irate children on our laps,'' she was quoted as
telling the Verdens Gang newspaper.
	   The 240,000-strong Academics Union had 6,000 members on strike,
including teachers, health workers, engineers, and ship's pilots.
	   In a separate strike, 930 state telephone company workers walked
out last weekend, which could disrupt telephone services.

Swiss cut back aid to Pakistan and India after blasts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland will slash its development
aid to India and Pakistan because of the two countries' nuclear
tests, the Swiss government said Monday.
	   Officials in the capital Bern said the aid would be cut by 4-5
million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.6-3.3 million) for the 1998/99
financial year.
	   The government is to review its development programs in India
and Pakistan and won't approve any new projects or credit in the
meantime, officials said.
	   In view of the ``tension which reigns in the Indian
sub-continent,'' arms exports to the two countries will also be
halted for the time being, officials added.
	   The Swiss authorities have already condemned the two countries'
tests and urged their governments to refrain from further nuclear
testing and adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Queen tells Nelson Mandela secret to looking well - her 97-year-old
</HEADLINE>
mother &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ When South African President Nelson Mandela told
Queen Elizabeth II Monday she was looking very well, the
72-year-old monarch retorted: ``I'm my mother's daughter.''
	   Queen Mother Elizabeth entered the record books Monday as the
oldest royal in British history - 97 years and 315 days - passing
the longevity record held by Queen Victoria's granddaughter
Princess Alice, who died in 1981.
	   When the 79-year-old South African leader asked how the queen
mother was doing, the queen replied: ``She's very well.''
	   Mandela visited the queen at Windsor Castle en route to the
European Union summit in Cardiff, Wales, where he will be guest of
honor at a luncheon Tuesday. The queen received him in the Oak
Room, the royal family's private sitting room which is decorated
with photographs of her children and grandchildren.
	   Mandela apologized to the queen for missing Prince Harry, her
13-year-old grandson, when he was in South Africa late last year
with his father, Prince Charles.
	   Like any proud grandmother, mention of Harry gave the queen an
opportunity to tell Mandela about his recent success in passing the
exams to enter Eton College, near Windsor Castle, where he will
join his older brother, Prince William, who celebrates his 16th
birthday on June 21.
	   ``He's passed his Common Entrance exam _ everybody's very
pleased,'' the queen said.
	   Mandela said he had seen sample questions from an exam paper.
	   ``Some of them are very difficult,'' the queen said, in an
exchange filmed by the British domestic news agency Press
Association.
	   The South African leader started the day at a fund-raising
breakfast at the South African Embassy to raise money for the
Nelson Mandela Children's Home Fund, a charity that provides
education and training for homeless, abused, abandoned and disabled
youngsters.
	   The 60 guests included the Duchess of Kent, entrepreneur Richard
Branson, boxers Lennox Lewis and Chris Eubank, singer Joan
Armatrading and lyricist Sir Tim Rice.

	   Successful privatization of state owned enterprises (SOEs)
remains a major challenge in most developing countries. The problem
is even more severe in many South Asian countries, including
Bangladesh, where state enterprises have been nurtured for decades
and status quo appears to be favoured by the management and labor
employed in the SOEs. Despite the well-recognized political
constraints, rational economic assessment suggests that
privatization is necessary to foster economic efficiency, raise
economic growth and reduce the crippling fiscal burden. In
Bangladesh, the drain on the exchequer of financing the losses of
SOEs was estimated at approximately $ 370 million in FY97.
	   Clearly a poor country like Bangladesh cannot sustain losses of
this magnitude year after year. The issue is all the more important
since the Government's resources are limited and there are more
pressing demands for expenditure in the social sectors like
education, health, housing for the poor and environmental
protection. In 1991, the Government set up an Interministerial
Committee on Privatization for developing a privatization policy
and in particular evaluating, monitoring and approving
privatization proposals. The Committee had little success in part
because it had limited technical capacity and autonomy. To overcome
these problems, a Privatization Board (PB) was set up in March 1993
to formulate the modalities for transferring assets of SOEs to the
private sector.
	   Initial success was modest with only 13 enterprises being
privatized between March 1993 and April 1997. One of the important
reasons for the for the modest results has been weak institutional
arrangements for privatization and restructuring of SOEs. Last
year, the Government sent a strong indication of its commitment to
privatization by appointing Mr. Kazi Zaffarullah, a prominent
businessman, as the Chairman of the Privatization Board. With his
appointment, the profile of the PB has been raised and there are
high expectations that the privatization process would be
accelerated. This paper briefly assesses the current constraints to
privatization in Bangladesh, examines the institutional and legal
changes necessary for fostering privatization and comments on the
consensus that needs to be built up in support of privatization.
	   The paper also notes the assistance that the Asian Development
Bank is providing the Government for facilitating privatization of
SOEs. Constraints to PrivatizationApart from political will and
determination, successful privatization requires an enabling
environment backed by strong institutions and a comprehensive
legislative framework. In attempting privatization in an economy
where a large proportion of industry is public owned, the
Government needs to adopt a focused program to address issues
related to privatization. It needs to adopt a clear strategy to
deal with issues such as compensation package for retrenched
workers, retraining of workers, establishing a regulatory framework
for post privatization monopolies, dealing with accumulated losses
of SOEs etc. Equally important, clear guidelines need to be set out
for the approval procedures of enterprises that are to be
privatized. And there needs to be an enabling legal and regulatory
framework which facilitates privatization.
	   An important constraint to privatization in Bangladesh is that
the PB has limited institutional capacity reflected in shortage of
adequately trained staff, limited opportunities for training, and
deficiencies in organizational set up, policies and procedures. PB
is also hampered by the fact that staff are inadequately trained in
the financial, legal and commercial aspects of managing complex
transactions. In particular PB staff is inadequately trained in
valuation of companies and evaluation of privatization bids and
tenders. Furthermore, if the privatization effort is to make
serious headway it is vital that the autonomy of the PB needs to be
significantly enhanced by giving it statutory status.
	   PB needs to be accorded a proper legal status, and the law
should clearly specify its responsibilities and institutional
position. Steps also need to be taken to ensure that the terms of
appointment of the Chairman and members of the PB are fixed on a
tenure basis and they need to be given specific immunities in
performing their assigned role without outside interference. To
attract staff with adequate caliber and skills, the compensation
package of the PB needs to be delinked from Government pay scales.
	   The Government also needs to launch a public awareness campaign
which explains the benefits of privatization to the public at large
and, more specifically, to the labor unions. A long term program
needs to be adopted, which if implemented effectively, will
significantly decrease the political constraints to privatization.
With the assistance of Department of International Development
(DFID), UK, recently the Adam Smith Institute (ASI) has assisted
the PB in drafting a new Privatization Bill which has been passed
by PB's Board and submitted to the Cabinet. ASI has also prepared a
detailed privatization procedures manual for PB staff and training
has been provided on implementing the procedures. ASI has also
worked closely with PB for raising public awareness in support of
privatization.Donors' ViewsDonors have been strongly supportive of
the privatization initiatives of the Government.
	   They are also acutely concerned of the constraints and have been
forthcoming with assistance to the Government. However, they are
concerned at the slow progress of privatization. At the recent
Donors Meeting held in May 1998 in Dhaka, there was unanimity
amongst donors that the privatization process needs to be
accelerated as the programme appears, at the moment, to be
virtually stalled. The donors emphasized that the Government needs
to set a phased time table for accomplishing the privatization
targets. They also suggested that to encourage more buyers and
better bids for SOEs, PB needs to undertake revaluation of assets
based on market assessment, rather than rely on book
value/replacement costs which are often unrealistic. The Government
also needs to be more specific on the safety-net programs in order
to reduce the fear of workers who could be laid off after
privatization. This would require designing an appropriate
separation package to retrenched workers and to evolve demand
driven retraining programmes.
	   The donors emphasized the importance of public awareness
programs to evoke broad based support for privatization. They also
stressed that the proposed Privatization Act should be widely
discussed before enacting the law.
	   Assistance of the Asian Development BankAs part of the Capital
Market Development Programme (CMDP) Loan, the Asian Development
Bank has extended a technical assistance grant to the Government
for Institutional Strengthening of the Privatization Board. As
noted earlier, the institutional and technical capabilities of the
PB is a major constraint to privatization. In the past, donor
assistance was focused on direct privatization efforts concerning
specific SOEs while the weak institutional capabilities remained
largely unaddressed. The Bank believes that institutional
strengthening of PB and training its staff will facilitate quicker
and more systematic privatization of SOEs. This in turn will
increase the flow of securities to the domestic capital market,
which is one of the major components in the success of the CMDP.
	   The Bank's technical assistance will focus on providing advice
on critical issues involved in privatization such as valuation,
financial restructuring, and evaluation of bids and offers for
state owned companies and assets; streamlining of the tendering
process; eliminating legal constraints to the privatization
process; training of concerned PB staff; preparing a reference
manual on valuation procedures; and developing strategies for the
privatization of the remaining SOEs for which the Government has
yet to define a strategy. The technical assistance will attempt to
provide technical support needed for successful privatization of
224 target companies.Concluding RemarksThe Asian Development Bank
is hopeful that, with adequate will and determination, the
privatization program in Bangladesh will succeed. We are aware of
the hindrances that are likely to be encountered in this difficult
process.
	   The Government will have- to make some hard choices which could
be politically divisive. The challenges are enormous but they have
to be faced in the long term development interests of the country.
The Government should adopt a well reasoned strategy of
privatization and try to build consensus within the society. A
sound technical approach will be critical in ensuring transparency
in the process and the Bank is committed in assisting the
Government overcome the current shortcomings.

	   At a seminar on Tuberculosis and Leprosy Diseases' held last
Saturday, Professor Amanullah, the State Minister for Health and
Family Welfare, announced that the country's 460 Thanas will be
brought under the ambit of the Tuberculosis Control Programme by
the end of June this year. TB, the dreaded disease of the 50s, has
been increasingly brought under control globally with the use of
antibiotics by the 80s. The bad news is that new virus strains,
resistant to the known medicine are beginning a resurgence. In
Bangladesh the good news is that though our detection rate in
January this year was 27 per cent, there is hope that the target of
70 per cent will be attained with TB cure facilities on hand at
every Thana. Another piece of good news is that our cure rate is
over 80 per cent, which is double that of the developed countries.
	   Breakthrough in the cure rate, a development particular to our
country, has been possible because of our health workers who ensure
that unlike patients in the developed world, our TB patients take
their medicine regularly for the stipulated period. The system is
called Directly Observed Treatment (DOT). In fact, in Bangladesh
patients often stop treatment half-way. When relapse occurs, they
take the medicine again only to find that resistance has grown and
a new group of antibiotics is needed. Till December 1997, the
achievement, as recorded, is 80,468 patients cured through
successful medical diagnosis and treatment. It is a great
consolation that 82 per cent of our country's afflicted people have
already been provided TB treatment facility. Now that the whole
country has been brought within the range of this programme, we
should be able to hope for an equally satisfactory cure rate.
	   However, we cannot afford to relax our vigilance as TB is
showing signs of returning like other diseases which were supposed
to have been practically wiped out. The main victims of the new
strain of TB are AIDS victims and those whose body is weakened from
poverty or any form of debilitating illness. It is clear that sound
health is the way to ensure that TB is both cured and kept from
spreading.

	   The destruction of parks and playgrounds of the city is old
story. Reports indicate that the situation is going from bad to
worse. A Bengali daily of Dhaka relates how the children's parks
have been occupied by drug addicts, illegal shanties, hoodlums and
sex workers. In fact the children and adolescents for whose benefit
the parks are established seldom even visit them. Some interested
quarters, the report says, have constructed shops in the parks in
collusion with a section of corrupt employees of the DCC.Some such
parks in the city are dumping grounds for garbage, some others have
been converted into garages, depots and workshops of autorickshaws,
buses and trucks and motor vehicles.
	   This has happened not in one day but over many years but nothing
effective has been done to rehabilitate the parks. It is further
learnt that the DCC has employed 86 gardeners, besides a number of
other employees, for maintenance of its 90 children's parks in the
city but no one seems to have any accountability.This is not the
end of the story. Many parks and playgrounds have been so walled up
that the very purpose of beautification is defeated and from the
exterior they look more like warehouses. The DCC is found to be
only too eager to recover land off parks and playgrounds to
construct markets.
	   There are other kinds of harassment waiting for visitors to a
park or recreational spots. Hawkers pester visitors in every
possible way. After dark the anti-socials, thugs and muggers take
over. And the police instead of nabbing the muggers harass visitors
when they happen to be married couples or lovers on an innocent
outing.While the city environment is deteriorating due to multiple
reasons, destruction of the parks and deprivation of the city
dwellers of whatever remained of the recreational opportunities,
are building up a civic crisis of great dimension.

	   After a good deal of procrastination like in the Bosnian civil
war, the six nation international contact group over the Balkan
imbroglio gave an ultimatum at long last to President Milosevic of
Yugoslavia to end repression of ethnic Albanian majority in the
Kosovo province of Serbia. Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia
and the United States after a ministerial meet on June 12 told
Milosevic to call back his hounds from Kosovo by June 15, when the
latter is scheduled to meet President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow. They
advised Milosevic to ``take advantage'' of the Moscow meeting to
register his compliance with the demand for ending violence and
allowing international monitoring in Kosovo, and pave the way for
the return of refugees and effective dialogue with Kosovo
resistance leaders.
	   At the same time, the contact group reserved the option of NATO
military intervention, and gave the go-ahead for NATO air-exercises
from neighbouring air-fields with all-out cooperation of Albania
and temporary permission from Macedonia. Earlier in Washington, the
White House Press Secretary told newsmen that the goal of the
planned NATO air-exercises was to remind ``the Belgrade authorities
of how seriously we take the violence that has occurred in
Kosovo.''Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 per cent of Kosovo's
population, used to enjoy substantial autonomy under Tito's
Yugoslavia. In the wake of Serb ethnic pride, Milosevic style,
Serbia cancelled the autonomy of Kosovo and turned Kosovan
Albanians into second class citizens at the mercy of Kosovan Serb
dictates.
	   A fallacious historical justification was given by invoking the
Serb national memory of Serbian resistance in Kosovo against
Turkish invasion under the Caliphs that called for full Kosovan
integration with Serbia. Now Kosovan Albanians are agitating for
secession, with guerilla bands taking to the hills, and the
Serbians are carrying on a brutal military campaign for
annihilation of the slightest signs of dissidence and total
subjugation of the ethnic Albanians. A war of attrition under the
spell of racial hatred is going on right in the heart of Europe. It
is good that the world leaders have taken serious note of it and
are taking action together for a peacefully negotiated solution of
the Kosovan crisis.

aid &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland will slash its development
aid to India and Pakistan because of the two countries' nuclear
tests, the Swiss government said Monday.
	   Officials in the capital Bern said the aid would be cut by 4-5
million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.6-3.3 million) for the 1998/99
financial year.
	   The government is to review its development programs in India
and Pakistan and won't approve any new projects or credit in the
meantime, officials said.
	   In view of the ``tension which reigns in the Indian
sub-continent,'' arms exports to the two countries will be halted
for the time being, officials added.
	   And Switzerland, together with other countries, will review
India and Pakistan's access to credit from the international
development agencies of the World Bank and other development banks.
	   The Swiss authorities have already condemned the two countries'
tests and urged their governments to refrain from further nuclear
testing and adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ A representative of Russian
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky was in critical condition
Monday after surgery for gunshot wounds.
	   Alexander Saydakov was shot in the chest, neck and head Friday
in the breakaway region of Trans-Dniestr.
	   Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party said the shooting was
politically motivated, but police said it was connected to
Saydakov's real estate businesses.
	   An Interior Ministry official said a young man entered
Saydakov's office at midday Friday and fired several shots from a
pistol with a silencer, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The gunman escaped, although the local Security Ministry said a
suspect has been arrested. It was not clear whether the suspect was
the alleged gunman.
	   Saydakov underwent surgery on Monday, said government officials
in Trans-Dniestr.
	   Saydakov, who was a deputy and a transportation minister for in
Trans-Dniestr, is one of the best known businessman in the region
with prosperous building and real estate investments. He is a local
Liberal Democratic Party leader.
	   Trans-Dniestr broke away in 1990, fearing Moldova planned to
unite with Romania. Moldova was part of Romania before World War
II.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Riot police lobbed tear gas on a
Marseille beach to break up a clash Monday between English and
Tunisian supporters as their teams met at the stadium for a World
Cup match.
	   New clashes ensued after England's 2-0 victory over Tunisia on
numerous streets between the stadium and the city center. About 10
people were slightly injured, police said, and another, hit in the
head by a bottle, hospitalized.
	   About a dozen people were arrested in the multiple clashes that
spread through the Mediterranean port city before and after the
match, police said.
	   The clashes followed a night of violence Sunday between drunken
English hooligans and Tunisia supporters, backed by gangs from
north Marseille suburbs, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The Sunday night clashes cut a path of destruction through
downtown Marseille and left two people seriously injured -- one
with a slit throat.
	   Police were seen beating some of the English with sticks before
carting them off in a clash outside the stadium ahead of the match.
	   Shortly after 3 p.m. (1300 GMT), hundreds of drinking
troublemakers clashed, briefly but violently, on the Prado beach,
where a huge screen was transmitting the match. Some seats were
torn from the beach side stand.
	   The violence apparently started after England's first goal. The
acrid smell of tear gas wafted through the stadium, about a mile
from the beach.
	   When the game was over, fresh clashes broke out. Windows were
broken in some areas and two cars -- one with a British license
plate -- were damaged.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The Stade Velodrome in Marseille was the calm eye
of a terrible storm Monday, as England beat Tunisia 2-0 in peaceful
sunshine even as fans fought with police in the southern resort
city for the third straight day.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas on a beach to break up clashes
between English and Tunisian supporters watching the afternoon
match on a huge TV screen set up for people who lacked tickets to
the game. It followed street violence Sunday night that cut a path
of destruction through downtown Marseille and left two people
seriously injured _ one with a slit throat.
	   Shortly before kickoff, there was another skirmish outside Stade
Velodrome when English hooligans threw bottles at Tunisian
supporters. Police beat some of the English with riot sticks and
made several arrests.
	   ``England seems to be intent on being world champion at this,''
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``It is not exclusively an
English problem, but again and again the English are involved.''
	   Cooper said some of England's hardened hooligans appeared to
head to Marseille just to stir up more violence, with little
interest in following the game.
	   ``(It) shows that they are not interested in the football, only
in what comes after,'' Cooper said. ``... We are determined not to
allow a small group of idiots spoil the party.''
	   Inside the stadium, the game took place oblivious to the
troubles outside. Alan Shearer scored late in the 42nd minute and
Paul Scholes in 89th in a game dominated by the heavy favored
English in their first game of the tournament.
	   Later Monday, Romania played Colombia at Lyon, and Germany faced
the United States at Paris.
	   In outbreaks of fan violence Sunday night and early Monday in
Marseille, police arrested 50 people and 37 were injured, including
two English in serious condition with knife wounds. Earlier figures
spoke of more arrests, but authorities revised the figures
downward.
	   Violence first erupted Saturday night in the Old Port
entertainment district of Marseille, when fans clashed with police
and Tunisian supporters. Several English fans were arrested in the
melees.
	   In England, Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday condemned as a
``complete disgrace'' the English soccer fans who rampaged in
Marseille.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and they have just got to put a stop to it.''

	   From Gandhi to Mao Ze-dong to Moulana Bhashani and now onto the
BNP version, the long march has been identified as a strategic
method of highlighting a issue through popular participation in a
walk to the focus of attention. ln the present case this has been a
vehicular parade to Khagrachhari where the participants attended
the gathering addressed by Begum Khaleda Zia and other opposition
leaders. Despite the 2000-strong vehicle march, many of the
participants including the chief protagonist Begum Zia were
extremely tired after the 400-odd kilometre long journey. And it
thus ended with more of a whimper and less of a bang.
	   The whole issue would have been reduced to a mere political
parade and a minor event in the opposition's programme had not the
incident of road blockade occurred at the early morning hours of
the day the march started. Despite the government's and the Prime
Minister's assurance that the march would go on unhindered by any
disturbing elements, it was observed that near the Kanchpur bridge
there were responsible and senior members of the ruling
parliamentary party who were on the scene and actively organising
resistance to the march. The police version of BNP organising a
sham blockade to spite the government machinery and the party in
power is a story too farcical to merit scrutiny. If the police
version is credible then what were the government MPs trying to do
in the area-protecting the passers-by and the innocent bystanders?
And if so what were the police doing or were they also innocent
bystanders?.
	   These are very elementary and crude questions but which every
politically literate person will be asking from now on to the next
general elections. In order to organize a reversal of the damage
caused to the image of the ruling party, the government should
immediately form a judicial commission to probe the circumstances
and the reasons behind the incident. A neutral inquiry would redeem
much of the loss of political face of the Awami League over what
would otherwise have been a carnival. As a fallout of the disturbed
start of the march we are to suffer another dawn-to-dusk hartal on
Thursday. The very day chosen for the hartal itself implies that
three days will be actually lost in the wake of the hartal as many
government functionaries and industrial workers will be going off
to their homes. Political competition is carried on through the
strategies of subversion, confrontation and encounter.
	   The act of subversion that initiated the confrontation of the
long march will now settle down to the politics of confrontation
till the next elections. Maybe the Thursday hartal is a harbinger
of the days to come. Possibly political encounter was in any case
just round the corner as otherwise the mainstream of the BNP
leadership was not finding the high ground for an electoral victory
in the future. But to harp on the point again a non-issue has
ignited the fuse of encounter much earlier. Both the march for
scrapping the treaty and the attempted subversion of the march
itself are non-issues but the politicians have found a good ground
to reap the whirlwind. Unfortunately the whirlwind may leave the
main players unscathed but damage the public at large. In the case
of Pakistan and India the nuclear arms race will affect their
economy and the burden will be borne by a helpless electorate. Here
in Bangladesh disorder and violence in company with political
confrontation and encounter is tantamount to economic subversion of
the nation as a whole.
	   We are poised on the next millennium and hope that this would
usher in a new era of economic advancement for us. In a recent
article Dr. Saadat Husain has shown that compared to the economies
of neighbouring countries the situation of Bangladesh is not one of
pessimism. As Dr. Husain says: In case of Bangladesh all the
indicators are moving in the right directions though some
indicators are not moving as fast as one would like them to do.
With a hopeful scenario like this, it is a shame that the politics
of self-aggrandisement and lust for power may well cause
irremediable damage to the economic progress that has been
forecast. The difficulty that faces all political structures, in
countries advanced or backward, is how to maintain themselves by
finding adjustment with a changed environment. This is the issue
facing the BNP and its allies, as the old issues have changed in
their importance vis-a-vis the electorate. The Hill Tracts issue
also has no particular relevance now, and it seems that the
obstruction to the march has become more of a relevant and current
issue with which the public seems to be concerned.
	   From the viewpoint of the people whose way of life is influenced
by the political structure, the difficulty is how to keep political
competition within bounds so that it does not wreck other
structures of social and economic interaction, on which the
survival of the people depends. In the first instance it is the
duty of the police and magistracy to uphold the laws that uphold
all social and economic interaction. Unfortunately, in recent
times, all these institutions have been somewhat suborned to the
party in power, and we cannot really consider them neutral to the
political environment. Democracy has its compelling requirements.
In a democracy there must be a clear perception of the goals to
which the majority is, or should be committed. And there must be
organisation to mobilise voters and persuade legislators and
leaders of government. In recent times in our country the nature
and magnitude of the goals are clear-all are related to the
economic uplift of our poor people.
	   The issues of political confrontation must therefore be guided
by these compulsions. Money, voice and political activism is now
extensively controlled by the affluent and business interests. But
in a good society, voice and influence cannot be confined to one
part of the population. Practical' politics, as it is called, calls
for policies that appeal to the fortunate . But the poor who vote
have to have the economic policies that shape a more fortunate
future for them. The chances of ,a particular political structure
and the values upon which it is based, surviving can be increased
under certain conditions by commitment: by nailing one's moral flag
to the mast and proclaiming that the position will be defended to
the last man and the last round. The BNP and its allies have taken
the issue of the Hill Tracts Treaty and the implications of
political sovereignty as moral issue.
	   However this does not really embrace, by and large the plight of
the common man across the length and breadth of the country. Such
an issue is effective only when the defiance is backed by command
of adequate resources and when the opponent, in this case the Awami
League, can read the message and be deterred by it. Only defiance
will not stop the tide coming in. However, Awami League seems to
have misread the message, and has been impressed for the wrong
reasons. The immediate reaction of some in the party has been to
ditch principles, and deplore moral enthusiasm. The sudden
introduction of new elements into a political arena may lead to
uncertainty and to crisis. This in turn makes the players on each
side shout defiance and numbs their perceptions of reality with an
overdose of political strategies. But, to echo a phrase, some of
the people can be fanatics all of the time, and all of the people
can be fanatics some of the time, but all of the people do not
behave like fanatics all of the time.
	   If they did there could be no political competition, only
fights, which in the end would leave the field empty of players.
Let there be a moral coalition of the concerned and the
compassionate in all the parties, and those now outside the
political system. The affluent would still be affluent, and the
comfortable still comfortable. But, now, the poor should be part of
the political system. Their needs should be heard, as would the
other goals of the good and compassionate society. With true and
inclusive democracy, the good society would succeed, would even
have an aspect of inevitability.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Seven former top communist officials went
on trial in a provincial court on Monday, charged in the December
1970 deaths of 44 shipyard workers during a riot police action to
quell wage protests.
	   The Provincial Court in the Baltic port city of Gdansk opened
the case on March 28, 1996, but the trial was delayed by constant
absences of some of the defendants or of their lawyers.
	   The former officials were charged with ordering and directing
the police action that killed 44 people and injured more than
1,000.
	   Last year, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, defense minister at the
time of the killings, and four other officials were exempted from
the trial due to ill health and will be tried separately. In 1981,
Jaruzelski was Poland's leader and ordered the martial law
crackdown on the Solidarity democratic movement.
	   The relatives of the workers, killed in Gdansk, Gdynia, Szczecin
and Elblag, gathered in front of the court building holding their
pictures and banners reading: The Crimes of Communism were
Genocide.
	   Among the defendants are two former communist party politburo
members: Stanislaw Kociolek and Wladyslaw Kruczek.
	   If convicted, the seven face up to life in prison.

	   BEARISH and battered by the regional crisis, but the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) says it is now there among the world
bourses to provide the best safeguards for investors.
	   The KLSE Compensation Fund of RM314 million is now the fourth
largest in terms of size after New York, South Korea, and
Australia.
	   In terms of percentage of the fund size to trading value - the
purpose of which is to gauge investors' exposure that needs to be
covered - the KLSE Compensation Fund has the highest ratio.
	   ``This, in itself, is testimony to the extent the Malaysian
authorities, the regulators and the stockbroking companies, have
contributed in ensuring investors are well and truly protected,''
KLSE executive chairman, Encik Mohd Azlan Hashim, said at a media
briefing recently.
	   Azlan said the Compensation Fund is adequate to protect
investors' interests in the current environment where eight
companies have been placed under trading restrictions, one licence
revoked, two suspended and one asked to cease trading operations.
	   The Compensation Fund, initially referred to as the Fidelity
Fund until January last year, consists of contributions from the
KLSE, the Securities Commission and about 60 member companies.
	   A month ago, in a move to enhance investor confidence, the
Securities Commission (SC) and the KLSE boosted the coffers from
RM14 million to RM314 million while annual contribution from each
member company was raised to RM50,000 from RM10,000.
	   In addition to the Compensation Fund, the KLSE has a RM500
million standby facility that has been put in place to prevent
systemic risk in case of default of payment by a stockbroking
company to the Securities Clearing Automated Network Services Sdn
Bhd.
	   The Compensation Fund, Azlan said, aims to swiftly address the
needs of claims without compromise to due process while its size
has strengthened its capability in protecting the investors.
	   According to Ms Chuah Mei Lin, the KLSE legal adviser - market
supervision division, the Compensation Fund enables compensation to
be made to a person suffering monetary loss from dealing in
securities with a stockbroking company.
	   She said claims from this Compensation Fund, which has a ceiling
of RM100,000 per claim, can also be made by remisiers.
	   Under the rules governing the application of the Compensation
Fund (Securities Industry Act 1983 Section 72), any person who has
suffered a loss due to fraudulent misuse of monies or other
property by a director, officer, employee or representative of a
licensed stockbroking company, defalcation by the stockbroking
company or its insolvency is eligible to make a claim.
	   An eligible claimant includes one who has had no bankruptcy
proceedings instituted against him or her. In addition,
beneficiaries can claim on behalf of a deceased client if they
produce a grant of probate or administration to the Exchange's
satisfaction.
	   The claimant needs to file a statement of claim which will be
published with the notice calling for claims for the affected
stockbroking company in all major newspapers (as was done today in
the case of Omega Securities).
	   The notice calling for claims will be valid for three months and
the KLSE will take approximately one to two months to verify the
claims and make payments by cheque, said Chuah.
	   A preliminary inquiry and clarification will be sought on all
claims by a Management Task Force.
	   The claims will then be submitted to a Panel of Inquiry to
determine or make recommendation to the Committee which will
ultimately decide on whether or not to make or withhold the
payment.
	   In the event a claim is not successful, the claimant can submit
an appeal to the SC for consideration within one month.
	   The SC will then inform the KLSE to make the original payment or
reduce or increase it based on its decision on the appeal.

Tea production hits record high in 1997
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Global tea production rose by 1.3 per cent in 1997
to reach its highest level ever, according to preliminary estimates
released Monday by the International Tea Committee.
	   The estimates put 1997 world output at 2.652 million metric
tons, compared with the previous record of 2.617 million hit in
1996.
	   In its latest statistical bulletin, the International Tea
Committee, which represents the tea industry in the main exporting
and importing countries, reported that both India and Sri Lanka
brought in record crops last year.
	   But Kenyan production, which was hit by drought in the first
quarter, was sharply down on 1996's record figure.
	   Indian production in 1997 was 810,613 tons, compared with
780,034 tons in 1996, Sri Lankan production was 277,428 tons
compared with 258,969 tons and Kenyan production was 220,722 tons
compared with 257,162 tons.
	   Other 1997 production figures (in metric tons, with 1996
comparisons in brackets) include China 613,366 (593,386), Indonesia
119,900 (144,000), Turkey 110,000 (114,540), Japan 91,205 (88,709),
Iran 60,000 (58,000), Argentina 55,000 (43,000), Bangladesh 53,495
(53,406), Vietnam 42,000 (40,000), Malawi 43,930 (38,312), Taiwan
24,154 (23,322), Tanzania 22,475 (19,768), Uganda 21,075 (17,418)
and Zimbabwe 17,098 (16,882)
	   World exports of tea in 1997 totalled 1.156 million tons,
compared with 1.115 million in 1996, according to the International
Tea Committee.
	   Its individual 1997 exports figure (in metric tons, with 1996
comparisons in brackets) include Sri Lanka 257,678 (233,573), China
202,464 (169,670), India 200,657 (160,001), Kenya 194,024
(244,226), Indonesia 66,843 (101,532), Argentina 56,409 (41,307),
Malawi 49,244 (36,661), Bangladesh 25,144 (26,146), Tanzania 19,006
(18,443), Uganda 18,260 (14,982), Vietnam 16,000 (15,000) and
Zimbabwe 11,205 (11,570).
	   International Tea Committee figures show that global net tea
imports in 1997 (after excluding re-exports) were 1.135 million
tons (1.117 milllion in 1996).
	   Britain was the biggest importer last year, with 150,538 tons
(148,452 tons in 1996), followed by Russia with 150,000 tons
(111,095 tons).
	   Other 1997 import figures (in metric tons, with 1996 comparisons
in brackets) include Pakistan 86,871 (110,703), the United States
81,216 (89,155), Egypt 77,892 (65,041), Afghanistan 38,000 (48,100)
and Morocco 35,016 (28,400).

	   Adam Smith so perfectly understood the problem of the individual
and the collective problem of the family, society and the nation
that his greatness can be assessed more correctly now than before.
Notwithstanding the various aspirations of man, to Adam Smith man
was an economic man who has an insatiable, but at the same time
natural desire for accumulating wealth. And since man is also a
social being and since society acquires meaning through nationhood,
it is the common wealth of nations and not the individual
accumulation of wealth that satisfies man's desire for accumulating
wealth. The reason is: man is a social being and he cannot fulfil
his individual aspiration at the expense of the national interest.
No nation can accumulate wealth without taking into account this
imperative. Perhaps we in Bangladesh have grossly violated this
imperative.Bangladesh has received massive foreign aid to achieve
economic development.
	   But unfortunately for Bangladesh, it has not been able to
achieve that economic development or growth. Like a golden deer, to
use an oft-quoted usage in Bengali, growth has remained in the
wilderness - not possible to catch. So, Bangladesh is one of the
least developed countries (LDCs) bedevilled with so many problems
which have given the donor agencies all the reasons to attach
strict conditionalities to aid.When they want to give aid to any
country the donor agencies can attach, in all fairness to all, some
conditions to aid, such as the aid should be returned with interest
and within such and such period of time and that the aid should be
used for some specific purposes only. And again, in all fairness to
both parties, the aid receiving countries should have the absolute
freedom to decide on how under those conditions, aid should be used
and managed. Bangladesh in the last two decades has not been able
to make proper use of the aid it has received.
	   In the circumstances the donor agencies cannot only dictate for
which purpose the aid would be given but also how that aid should
be managed if the country wants to receive aid.During the last few
years the donor agencies have been giving aid to Bangladesh for,
among other purposes, poverty alleviation. Unfortunately, poverty
in Bangladesh has not been alleviated. This has given us the scope
as well as the reasons to ask: Is poverty alleviation that good a
strategy to pursue? In this connection it may be said that the word
alleviation' does not match the word poverty'. Eradication' is the
word that goes well with poverty.Without taking the risk of getting
trapped in the ``thesis - antithesis'' way of reasoning, one may
say that poverty alleviation is not the exact answer to poverty.
The answer to poverty is accumulation of wealth - wealth of the
individuals - wealth of the families and finally the increase of
sum total of the common wealth of the nation.
	   The common wealth of a nation may roughly correspond to GDP and
GNP. Both GDP and GNP may become flawed measurements of the common
wealth of a nation if the distribution of the common wealth is not
equitable. But yet then, there is no alternative to accumulation of
the common wealth of a nation to answer poverty. The history of
today's industrialised nations is a testimony to this.But it would
be impossible to have an absolutely equitable distribution of the
commonwealth of a nation. Mao's view in this regard was that there
cannot be absolute equality between man and man. It was not there
even in the former Soviet Russia. So, no nation should make it a
precondition for accumulation of the common wealth of a nation.As a
nation develops there may be concentration of national wealth in a
few hands. But as the nation continues to get richer, diffusion of
national wealth from a few hands to more and more people works as a
simultaneous process.
	   This happens in any achieving industrial nation. And this
happens because the few individual accumulators of wealth sooner or
later find competitors for wealth all around. To produce and sell
more and more of their products they will need efficient managers
and workers and to keep them working for them they must pay them
more liberally, otherwise they (managers and workers) would be
lured by other competitors for wealth.This process of accumulation
of wealth by individuals, families, and the nation has not started
in the right way in Bangladesh. The result is what we are today -
to explain for what reasons will require opening another
chapter.Our economy is tied to our soil - our agriculture. We are
not ashamed of it. Rather, we are thankful to God that our country
is so fertile that it has been nourishing a big and growing
population.
	   And then we have enough gas. And may be we have more precious
resources in reserve for us. With all such resources including
manpower, there is no reason why Bangladesh should not only be an
industrial nation but also a prosperous one for that matter. Our
prosperous agriculture should be a springboard for us from where we
may jump into an industrial economy.

Current account deficit dips, but at 11 percent of GDP, it's still
</HEADLINE>
high &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL TARM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Estonia's current account deficit has
come down slightly at midyear, but remains one of the highest in
eastern Europe, the Bank of Estonia said Monday.
	   The statistic, which is closely tracked as an indicator the
economy might be growing at an unsustainably fast rate, dipped to
11 percent of gross domestic product. It was 12 percent last
January, the central bank said.
	   ``Before today's announcement, many people anticipated that the
figure might even go up to as high as 14 percent,'' said Heikki
Kallu, an analyst at Estonia's Hansapank. ``So the 11 percent
figure is definitely a move in the right direction.''
	   The International Monetary Fund, however, noted the deficit
still is worrisome. High current accounts deficits preceded
financial crises in Asia and elsewhere.
	   A country's current account reflects its trade with other
countries along with financial flows such as tourism and
investment. Ideally, the account would be positive, or at least in
balance.
	   ``In an otherwise strong economy, the main message from these
figures is that the current account deficit remains the No. 1
macro-economic risk of the Estonian economy,'' Dimitri Demekas, the
IMF representative for Estonia, told The Associated Press.
	   In comparison, the corresponding figure for Poland is five
percent, and for the Czech Republic, four percent, according to
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
	   Estonia's economy grew by an annualized rate of more than eight
percent in the first quarter of this year. For all of 1997, it
topped 11 percent _ one of the highest rates in Europe.
	   The IMF's Demekas urged government policy makers to stick to
tight fiscal policies, and to take measures to strengthen the
banking system and slow down the growth of credit.
	   Free market reforms implemented after this Baltic republic's
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 led to a boom.
	   Growing wariness about the economy, however, has been reflected
on the local stock market, where share prices have been plunging
for most of the year.

Possible rule change over let ball stirs controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The prospect of tennis' first major rule change in
25 years is stirring up trouble.
	   The International Tennis Federation is considering abolishing
the let rule beginning with next season, although some top players
oppose the change.
	   The rule change will be debated in July at the ITF's annual
general meeting in Ireland and could be voted on before the years
is over.
	   U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter and others have raised the
possibility of boycotting the Australian Open if the no-let rule is
in place.
	   ``You could have a Grand Slam final decided by a serve that
catches the tape and takes a really weird bounce which gives the
returner no chance of getting to the ball,'' Rafter said.
	   Designed to speed play, the rule would mean no replay of serves
which catch the tape before going over.
	   ``The players will be informed directly of the proposal at a
players' meeting during Wimbledon,'' ITF spokesman Alun James said
Monday. ``At this stage there is little or anything to indicate a
backlash by players against any change.''
	   James noted the rule change would be the first major one in 25
years. He called the let ball ``an anomaly'' since every other ball
in a match is played where it lands.
	   ``The last rule change was the introduction of the tiebreak _
the players objected to that at the time but in the long run it's
proven to be very popular,'' he said.
	   James said the ITF had conducted research for two years on the
impact of the let rule and discovered that lets had little
influence on the outcome of a match.
	   In 715 matches surveyed, there was an average of 4.1 lets per
match. About 25 percent of lets favored the server, while 65
percent favored neither player.
	   ``Part of our role as a regulatory body is to assess the needs
of players and officials at all levels, not just professional
players,'' James said.
	   ``So abolishing the let rule would save interruptions and
increase the speed of matches on the professional circuit and also
alleviate the cost of a net umpire.
	   ``But it would also eliminate disputes between players at an
amateur level _ where the majority of games are played in the
absence of umpires.''

Nader asks government to ensure sale of Windows alternatives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TED BRIDIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. consumer activist Ralph Nader wants the
Justice Department to make sure that Microsoft allows computer
makers to sell machines with system software other than the
company's popular Windows products.
	   Nader contends the company bullies retailers with its market
influence, and signs contracts with computer makers forcing them to
sell Windows even if customers don't want it.
	   In a letter to the Justice Department Monday, Nader, who runs
the Washington-based Consumer Project on Technology, wrote: ``Many
consumers and software developers are appalled at Microsoft's
continued efforts to use the Windows (operating system) as a
weapon.''
	   Microsoft's popular Windows software serves as the central
nervous system of the vast majority of the world's desktop
computers and is sold already installed by nearly all the major
computer makers.
	   Other programs, such as word processors or spreadsheets, work in
conjunction with a computer's system software.
	   There are relatively obscure products that can substitute for
Windows, such as Linux, and many of them are available free on the
Internet for people to download and install themselves. Nader, a
longtime critic of Microsoft, is upset that computer makers won't
sell machines with those products already installed.
	   ``It's impossible to buy a computer without Windows,'' said
James Love, director of Nader's technology group. ``It may be the
case that everybody on earth only wants to use Windows. It may be
possible there's some part of humanity that wants to try something
different.''
	   A spokeswoman for Dell Computer Corp., Neisha Frank, said
individual customers rarely ask for anything other than Windows.
But when they do, Dell suggests they buy the software separately
and install it themselves.
	   ``Windows is the default. That's not to say that if a customer
came to Dell and requested an alternative (operating system), we
wouldn't work with them on a corporate level,'' Frank said Monday.
``But for individual customers, quite frankly, it wouldn't be cost
effective for customer or for Dell.''
	   Microsoft called Nader's letter ``misguided'' and responded that
its sales agreements with computer makers don't prevent those
companies from selling competing operating systems.

	   Two reports circulating in the United States during the past few
days illustrate the tug-of-war that is still going on regarding US
policy toward Cuba. The US Defence Department drew fire from
opponents of rapprochement with Cuban President Fidel Castro when
it described the Caribbean nation's military as an emaciated force
incapable of harming its neighbours. Hard-liners blasted the
Pentagon assessment, even though the report's release had been
delayed since March to give national security officials time to
make revisions that, according to one published account, 'would
harden the report to bring it into line with US policies against
the country.''Then The New York Times' reported that leaders of the
Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), one of the most powerful
lobbying organisations in the United States, have been targeted by
a federal investigation into a 1997 plot to assassinate Castro.
	   Administration officials have said they need a 'new approach''
to relations with Cuba but have had to assure hard-liners that such
an approach would not weaken demands for political reform in the
hemisphere's last Communist state. President Bill Clinton,
following exhortations by Pope John Paul II during his visit to
Havana in January, eased restrictions on charter flights and
shipments of food and medicine to Cuba and permitted
Cuban-Americans to remit money to relatives there. A number of
Cuban-American groups, the US Chamber of Commerce and USA-ENGAGE, a
pro-free trade business coalition, welcomed the moves. But
hard-liners including CANF, now embroiled in the federal
investigation of the apparent assassination plot last October,
denounced them. Clinton, asked if he would consider new goodwill
gestures in light of the Defence Department findings, said Cuban
authorities had not yet shown 'whether they really wish to have a
rapprochement.
	   '' He noted that the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which codified the
long-standing US embargo against Cuba, prevented him from making
gestures. Hard-liners have criticised the Administration for not
applying Title III of the law, which would enable US citizens to
sue third-country companies for investing in properties
expropriated from them after Castro came to power in 1959. Clinton
recently assured those critics that he could never 'accept some of
the anti-democratic and, frankly, clearly anti-human rights
policies of the government'' in Havana. The Pentagon report found
that the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, halved in size and
budget and starved for supplies since Soviet-era aid was cut off in
1989, have been transformed 'from one of the most active militaries
in the Third World into a stay-at-home force that has minimal
conventional fighting ability,'' according to an unclassified
version of the report, submitted to Congress. -IPS/ APB

	   CLIENTS of Omega Securities Sdn Bhd are allowed to claim for
their losses under the Compensation Fund managed by the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) as well as the Reimbursement Scheme
structured by the Securities Commission (SC).
	   However, full facts will be taken into consideration and under
no circumstances would clients be making profits from their claims,
said KLSE legal adviser - market supervision division, Ms Chuah Mei
Lin.
	   Speaking at a media briefing last Friday, Chuah said investors
who had made claims under the Reimbursement Scheme but are still
not satisfied with the amount received may claim under the
Compensation Fund.
	   ``Theoretically, if clients do not receive the full amount
claimed under the Reimbursement Scheme, they can also claim under
the Compensation Fund, provided there is no double jeopardy.
Clients cannot profit from their losses,'' Chuah said.
	   Last week, the SC announced a Reimbursement Scheme, which
effectively allow Hwang-DBS Securities Bhd to open up a branch in
Shah Alam after it agreed to contribute RM70 million to pay
eligible Omega's clients.
	   Omega's clients have a choice on whether to claim under the
Compensation Fund or from Hwang-DBS Securities under the
Reimbursement Scheme.
	   However, claims under the Compensation Fund will be subject to a
limit of RM100,000 per claim.
	   Under the Reimbursement Scheme, no limit has been set, but there
would be a pre-determined and pre-approved value of net amounts
owing to the eligible clients by Hwang-DBS.
	   Meanwhile, KLSE executive chairman Mohd Azlan Hashim said the
RM100,000 ceiling is set by the Compensation Fund Regulations 1997.
	   ``This limit is prescribed by the law. The Fund is aimed at
protecting small investors and is not intended to cover investors
with significant amount of money. The presumption is that big
investors can look after themselves better than the small
investors,'' Azlan noted.
	   Chuah also said that the Compensation Fund is aimed at
addressing a client's claim before it goes to the level of
litigation.
	   Theoretically, she noted, clients can claim under the
Compensation Fund so long as there exists any of these three
elements (under Section 72 of the Securities Industry Act 1983) -
defalcation, fraudulent act or insolvency of stockbroking
companies.
	   Meanwhile, clients of Omega Securities claiming under the Fund
would need to submit statement of claim published together with
Regulation 5 notice.
	   Regulation 5 is a notice calling for claims against the fund
advertised by the Exchange in the newspapers.
	   Meanwhile, under the Reimbursement Scheme, Hwang-DBS would have
sent out letters to eligible clients of Omega by today, informing
them of the detailed terms and procedures of payment.
	   The clients who opt to accept payment under the scheme are
required to return the reply slip on or before June 30 1998.
	   If there is any dispute on the net amount, clients can clarify
with special auditors or the KLSE's staff at Omega's office.
	   Nevertheless, the decision is at the sole discretion of
Hwang-DBS and as such, there is no appeal.
	   Hwang-DBS anticipates payment to be made between July 13 and
July 17.

Industrial accidents kill 17,500 in China in 1997

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Industrial accidents killed 17,558 people in
China last year, mostly in the nation's accident-plagued mines,
state media reported Monday.
	   The mining industry recorded 7,266 accidents that killed a total
of 11,265 miners, a drop of 14.9 percent and 7.7 percent
respectively compared with 1996, the Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The total number of industrial accidents also was down 12.5
percent over 1996, while the total number of deaths was down 9.8
percent, Xinhua said.
	   But the number of fires _ at more than 140,000 _ was 3.8 times
greater than in 1996, Xinhua said.
	   Fires killed 2,722 people, an increase of 22.3 percent compared
with 1996, and injured 4,930, a 43.8 percent increase, it said.
Direct economic losses from fires were valued at 1.54 billion yuan
(dlrs 185 million), up 49.5 percent compared with 1996.
	   Four civilian air accidents last year also killed a total of 42
people, Xinhua said.

	   A NEW national programme for human resource development
specifically for the aerospace industry has been recommended within
the National Aerospace Development Framework drawn up by the
Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology (MIGHT).
	   The National Human Resource Development Programme, as
recommended in the Blueprint for the Aerospace Industry in
Malaysia, ensures the efficiency of personnel development for the
aerospace industry.
	   The blueprint was developed by a special taskforce headed by
Malaysia Airlines chairman Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli, who is also the
joint chairman of MIGHT.
	   It takes into account the various technical categories of labour
required for the aerospace industry, including the toolmakers,
aircraft engineers and system analysts, MIGHT said in the blueprint
which was made available to Business Times.
	   MIGHT also recommended the setting up of a premier educational
centre for aerospace studies, the Aerospace Technology Institute of
Malaysia (Astim), to be strategically located at the KL
International Airport in Sepang.
	   It will serve the training needs of both local and foreign
aerospace players. Astim will be the first institution of its kind
in this region to carry out combined aerospace studies and training
in academic, military and civil applications.
	   It will best serve the interests of the country by allowing for
synergy and the exploitation of opportunities in these three areas
simultaneously.
	   ``It is expected that Astim will save the country a considerable
amount of foreign exchange by catering for local/overseas
students,'' MIGHT said.
	   Under the recommendation, MIGHT also suggested that the
Education Ministry establishes an engineering stream at school
level, incorporating engineering programmes.
	   ``Currently, there are two main streams available, that is, the
science and arts streams. Students, however, can be exposed to the
technical world of engineering, under the engineering stream
programme. They can develop an early interest in engineering and
should be better prepared to venture into engineering-related areas
after their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia.
	   ``The engineering stream will be further strengthened by the
vertical integration of vocational schools, polytechnics and
technical universities. This will ensure the establishment of a
workforce with strong technical inclinations,'' the blueprint said.
	   MIGHT is looking at the German and French education systems as a
model.
	   The two countries retained vocational training throughout the
duration of the education system.
	   ``Malaysia can look at these two systems for ideas in
formulating an engineering stream.
	   ``These educational systems have proved successful in turning
out the `right quality and quantity' of workforce required by their
respective industrial bases.
	   ``The Malaysian education system, which has treated vocational
training as `second class' in the past, should change and accord
vocational training higher priority. Diploma-level courses should
be offered towards further enhancing vocational skills,'' it said.
	   The blueprint also said the aerospace industry will require
manpower at the middle management or supervisory levels to provide
critical inputs for the industry.
	   The diploma graduates is anticipated to be able to inject more
in-depth skills into the aerospace industry compared with the
vocational school leavers.
	   Another additional recommendation in the blueprint is for the
Government to expand and expedite planned programmes for the
recruitment of leading aerospace industry scientists.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Alan Shearer scored late in the first
half and Paul Scholes late in the second to give England a 2-0
victory over Tunisia on Monday, a game which took place in peaceful
sunshine even as fans from the two countries fought with police and
each other outside the stadium.
	   England dominated the game, but nearly all of its quality shots
on goal came in the final 15 minutes of the first half. Goalkeeper
Chokri El Ouaer stopped the first three, but Shearer connected on
the fourth.
	   On a free kick to the right of the penalty box, Graeme Le Saux
chipped the ball to the Newcastle striker, who headed his shot
behind El Ouaer and off the left post in the 42nd minute.
	   Then, in the 89th minute, following a second half in which play
was largely bogged down in midfield, Paul Ince fed Scholes for a
25-meter strike just inside the right post.
	   England would have won by several goals had El Ouaer not made
two superb one-handed saves shortly before Shearer's strike. The
first came on Teddy Sheringham's 30-meter volley in the 36th
minute, and another came on Scholes' bouncing close-range header
two minutes later.
	   ``We could have scored three or four goals,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said. ``We could have taken them to the cleaners. ...
We didn't get too stretched as a side and looked fit and strong at
the end. That's a delight as well. Now it's onto the next game.''
	   Tunisia used a very conservative attack from the opening
kickoff, passing the ball around midfield as if trying to run out
the clock. Occasionally, there would be a long pass upfield to
either Adel Sellimi or Ben Slimane, but England's defense prevented
any real scoring threat.
	   Tunisia, in its first World Cup game since 1978, brought on
three substitutes to try to pick up the pace in the second half,
but none of its players showed the ability to finish off a goal,
and England keeper David Seaman was never seriously tested.
	   ``We came back and played well in the second half,'' Tunisia
coach Henri Kasperczak said. ``But we could not create the
chances.''
	   The game followed three days of the skirmishes involving
hundreds of England and Tunisian fans, local youth and riot police
in the streets of Marseille. During the game, riot police lobbed
tear gas to break up more clashes in the city.

	   IN TIMES of need, a show of support is welcomed and deeply
appreciated.
	   Britain, which has a long-standing relationship with Asia, has
been doing just that and more for the region lately.
	   It is showing to the world that it is not Asia's fair-weather
friends, who turn away at the first sign of difficulty, but is a
partner for the long term, ready to stick by the region through
thick and thin.
	   Its presence may not be as highly visible and audible as the
Americans and the Japanese since the economic and financial turmoil
began last July but its approach - on its own or together with
Europe - has certainly been more pragmatic.
	   Britain, which holds the European Union (EU) presidency and
chairs the Group of 8, had not joined the chorus in urging Malaysia
and the rest of Asia to correct their flaws, end corrupt practices
and open up banks and companies to more foreign equity.
	   Instead, it gave more practical suggestions. At the April
meeting of the Asia-Europe Meeting 2 in London, the British
Government secured Europe's commitment to support and assist the
Asian economies in crisis.
	   It has called for both Asia and Europe to, firstly, open their
markets for trade; secondly, reduce barriers to trade; and thirdly,
increase investments and promote cooperation to help resolve the
financial crisis.
	   As British High Commissioner to Malaysia David Moss pointed out
in an interview with this newspaper, the most important thing that
the EU can do for East Asia, including Malaysia, now is to keep its
markets open to all the exports from East Asia.
	   ``That the European leaders have pledged to do - to keep our
markets open - because you have heard from the Malaysian Government
that Malaysia does need to increase its exports but it cannot
increase its exports if the main markets are closed.
	   ``We have pledged to keep our markets open and I think that is
the most important single step by far,'' he said.
	   Trade is, in fact, the only salvation not only for Malaysia but
also the ailing economies of Asia.
	   In business and trade, EU exports to Asia in 1996 totalled
US$204 billion (US$1  &QC;  RM4.10) and its imports from Asia were
valued at US$238 billion. Malaysia is Britain's 29th largest
trading partner while Britain is Malaysia's eighth largest partner.
Last year, their bilateral trade almost doubled to STG5 billion
(STG1  &QC;  RM6.68) from STG2.6 billion in 1996. Britain has also
rendered assistance to Malaysian students whose education has been
affected by the shortage of funds following the country's economic
problems.
	   The British Government, through its Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, has set up a fund to assist needy Asian students who are
unable to continue their studies in the universities because of the
region's crisis.
	   The financing for the fund comes from the British Government,
the British Council, several universities and private companies in
Britain which have interests in the affected Asian countries.
	   Response from the UK has been tremendous - practically all
British universities have already introduced special measures to
help Malaysian students studying in the UK or those who are about
to commence their studies.
	   In fact, the new scholarships will be in addition to the 70 or
so Chevening Scholarships already offered to Malaysian students by
the British High Commission each year.
	   There are currently some 18,000 Malaysian students in British
schools, technical colleges and universities.
	   It is without a doubt that Britain, which has been a ``blue sea
trader''
	   looking at horizons beyond Europe, has a big role to play in
East Asia. In fact, there is a lot more a country like Britain
could do.
	   It could, for example, consider counter-trading with Malaysia.
The use of the bilateral payment arrangement (BPA) is an avenue
which could be explored by both Malaysia and Britain. The BPA,
which was devised by the Group of 15, enables importers to pay for
the goods in the local currency.
	   So far, Bank Negara Malaysia has signed BPAs with central banks
of 25 countries. The BPAs come in the form of the Aladi model where
each central banks pays its own exporter in the domestic currency
and settles, on a periodic basis (not exceeding 90 days) the net
difference with the other central banks in US dollar; the Iranian
model (each central bank guarantees payments of its own importers);
the Palm Oil Credit and Payments Arrangement (deferred payment
basis); and the revolving credit (the importation of goods is
limited to the credit limit agreed by both parties on a deferred
payment basis.) Britain could also encourage its people to spend
their holidays here as it would be much cheaper now.
	   The UK maintained its position as one of the top five
revenue-generating markets with a total of RM413.2 million in
tourism receipts last year, registering a 20.3 per cent growth
compared with RM343.5 million in 1996.
	   Average per capita expenditure of UK tourists also increased
last year by 23.6 per cent, to RM2,549.10 from RM2,061.7 in 1996.
They ranked fourth in terms of tourist arrivals to Malaysia last
year.

	   Not too long ago, a self-confident Asia stood gazing expectantly
at the dawn of the so-called Pacific Century, its international
standing built on relative peace and healthy economic growth. But
today, Asia is hurtling toward the millennium with steadily
gathering uncertainty, humbled by political and economic woes due
to a regional economic crisis and most recently, by security
worries in the wake of India's nuclear tests. This reversal of
fortunes has taken place in just one year's time. Star economies
like South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia tumbled from their perch
as some of the world's models for the developing world, as a
financial crisis struck in July 1997 and spread through the region.
East Asian countries, many of whom had graduated from being aid
recipients, were forced to go begging to the International Monetary
Fund and swallow unpalatable policies. As a result, economies like
Indonesia are looking at contractions this year of up to 10
percent.
	   There, estimates say that poverty incidence has already risen to
66 percent of the population from 11 percent. In turn, the region's
economic decline has undercut its authority to make the world
listen when it speaks on issues of the day, ranging from poverty
reduction to the needs of the developing world. ``A future of
political strength and cultural assertiveness based on growing
economic power has been replaced by the fear of a new
colonialism,'' that of losing economic sovereignty to outside
forces, said Walden Bello, a political analyst with the
Bangkok-based Focus on the Global South. Pockets of social turmoil
and instability now litter the region. In fact, Bello observed: 'It
is hard to imagine that this is the same region that was being
touted as recently as 10 months ago as the engine of the world
economy' far into the 21st century''. He says a region that was
about to leave behind massive underdevelopment has found itself
collapsing back into it.
	   The situation is akin to that of Asia in the sixties, when it
was the world's prime crisis area, he added. So far, Asia's
economic crisis has claimed its biggest casualty in Indonesia,
leading to the toppling of former President Suharto's 32 year-old
rule on May 21. Indeed, many Indonesians say that if not for the
pain caused by the economic crisis, Suharto would remain well
entrenched in power. Because the early trigger of the crisis was
the fall of the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, after foreign
capital pulled out, it is not uncommon to hear these days that it
was the forces of globalisation that routed Suharto in the end.And
apart from introducing an element of instability in the world's
fourth most populous country, political instability in Indonesia
has deprived the developing world of one of its most influential
spokesmen. Suharto has long been known as the elder statesman in
South-east Asia, in particular the Association of South-east Asian
Nations (ASEAN) of which he was a founding member.
	   Indonesia's turmoil is particularly painful for ASEAN, which
celebrated its 30th year in 1997. It is only the latest in a string
of setbacks to ASEAN's quest to unify the region, starting with the
1996 coup in Cambodia. While conceding that Suharto had been
repressive, Southeast Asian governments view his government as
having been a benign, stabilising force in a region wracked in past
decades by internal tensions and Cold War rivalries. 'Indonesia's
problems will diminish ASEAN's political and economic authority,
and reduce its ability to act as a strategic counterweight to the
region's ascendant power, China,'' argued Alan Dupont of the
Australia-based Asia Pacific Security Programme. Indonesia troubles
'will strike another blow to the pride and confidence of ASEAN'',
he added. And if Asia is suffering through its worst economic
crisis since the Pacific War, it has of late also become the focus
of security worries in the wake of India and Pakistan's detonation
of nuclear devices in May.
	   The Indian tests came on May 11 and 13, just a few days before
Suharto fell from power, when the world was not looking. The tests
have sent nervous reactions rippling across diplomatic capitals.
Outside the sub-continent, the rest of Asia does not yield too
optimistic prospects either. While Thailand and South Korea seem to
have passed the worst of Asia's crisis, aided by changes in
political leadership, and the Philippines has just concluded
presidential polls, there remain huge question marks on the
region's political landscape. Cambodia has virtually been paralysed
since the July 1996 coup by co-premier Hun Sen. General polls
overseen by international observers are scheduled for July 26. To
the north, Asia's giant Japan continues to be mired in recession,
battling financial and corruption crises and hurting from the
region's downturn and in particular, Indonesia's collapse.
	   Japanese banks hold 40 percent of Indonesia's foreign debt,
putting its already hobbled banking sector at further risk. The
Japanese economy -- which has seen the unemployment rate hit a
five-decade high of 3.6 percent in February -will be the main issue
when general polls are held in July. Asia does not seem likely to
pull out its slump soon, in contrast to the positive predictions in
the past of its becoming one of the world's growth poles.

City strike called over power outage during World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) _ Angry at frequent power outage
during the telecast of World Cup matches, angry soccer fans have
called a strike in the Bangladeshi port city of Chittagong
Wednesday.
	   Protesters said they will block road and railroad traffic and
force all shops and offices to shut down from six in the morning
for the next eight hours in the southeastern city.
	   The power crisis in the country has whipped up passions among
youth in this South Asian nation where soccer is the national
sport. On Monday, soccer fans ransacked the office of a
government-run power utility in Chittagong and three other power
stations in the region.
	   Bangladeshi authorities have deployed riot police at 29 power
stations in the area to avert further violence, an official said
Tuesday.
	   Officials say the frequent load shedding has been forced by the
severe shortage of power in Chittagong, located 216 kilometers (135
miles) southeast of the capital city Dhaka, and other parts of the
country.

English, Tunisian fans clash anew, thwarting police measures

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Riot police lobbed tear gas on a
Marseille beach to break up new clashes Monday between English and
Tunisian soccer supporters as their teams met at the stadium for a
World Cup match.
	   It was the second clash in less than than three hours on the
third straight day of street violence in this Mediterranean port.
Clashes broke out Saturday night and resumed again on Sunday
despite heavily police presence to combat troublemaking. Three
dozen people were injured, two seriously, and 50 were arrests in
the brawling.
	   Violence broke out again as fans were heading ot the Velodrome
soccer stadium ahead of the 2:30 p.m. (1230 GMT) game.
	   English hooligans threw bottles at Tunisian fans, and police
intervened to beat some of the English with sticks before carting
them off. An estimated 10 arrests were made.	   
	   During the match, hundreds of drinking troublemakers clashed,
briefly but violently, on the Prado beach where they were watching
the match on a huge TV sceen set up for visitors who couldn't get
tickets to the game.
	   The violence started after England's first goal en route to a
2-0 victory.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas to separate the two sides. About 300
English jumped barricades used by police to hold them back,
throwing stones and bottles at about 150 Tunisians, eye witnesses
said.
	   It was not immediately clear whether there were injuries.
	   Police put a lock on Marseille earlier Monday, bringing in
reinforcements, putting a partial ban on alcohol and searching and
escorting arriving English soccer fans.
	   The measures failed to thwart a flare up.
	   The Interior Ministry blamed Sunday's violence on some 200
drunken English hooligans who taunted Tunisia supporters at
Marseille's Old Port area. A mix of youths from north Marseille
suburbs then joined in the clashes against the English, a ministry
statement said.
	   Among the seriously injured was a young English fan slashed in
the throat.
	   Of the injured and arrested, 30 were British. Tunisians and
French also were injured and arrested.
	   Marseille Police Chief Michel Sappin said police ranks were
reinforced in the city center and around the stadium. Lines of riot
police stood by to sweep in if needed.
	   Authorities had already planned to deploy a total of 1,600
uniformed or plainclothes city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100
elite CRS national police for Monday's match.
	   The prefect of the region, Jean-Paul Proust, said that eight
people were being brought before a Marseille court Monday in an
example of the swift justice aimed at curbing World Cup violence.
	   ``This was a little inevitable,'' Proust said on France Inter
radio, blaming the violence on drinking hooligans.
	   Proust banned the sale of alcohol in the city starting at 4:30
p.m. and ordered all bars closed by 11 p.m.

Deutsche Telekom can charge customers for phone-service switch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's former telephone monopoly is
permitted to charge a one-time fee of 27 marks (dlrs 15) to
customers who switch their long-distance service, regulators
announced Monday.
	   After losing its monopoly Jan. 1, Deutsche Telekom announced a
95-mark (dlrs 52) fee to switch service. It later reduced the fee
to 49 marks (dlrs 27) following protests from start-up companies
who said it would hurt competition.
	   Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of the telecommunications regulatory
agency, blocked the lower fee in early April pending his agency's
decision on what would be a fair fee.
	   Scheurle said Monday that Telekom may charge one-time fees of 27
marks for service switches through the end of the year. Next year,
the company will be able to charge a 20-mark (dlrs 11) fee, and in
2000 a 10-mark (dlrs 6) fee, he said.

World Cup: After 0-0 draw, Dutch practice finishing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ After failing to break down a stubborn Belgian
defense in Saturday's 0-0 draw, the Dutch honed their finishing
skills Monday at their first training in this sun-kissed
principality on France's Cote D'Azure.
	   Striker Dennis Bergkamp, who is still building up his fitness
after a six-week injury layoff, partnered Nottingham Forest
frontman Pierre van Hooijdonk in blasting shot after shot at
reserve goalkeeper Ruud Hesp.
	   At the other end of AS Monaco's training pitch, carved out of a
mountainside above Monaco, Real Madrid's Clarence Seedorf practiced
curling right-foot free kicks with assistant trainer Ronald Koeman
_ himself a freekick past master.
	   Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said the training combination did not
mean Van Hooijdonk would partner Bergkamp in the Netherlands' next
Group E match, against South Korea on Saturday.
	   Bergkamp said he was working hard to be fit enough to start the
South Korea game. On Saturday he joined the action as a substitute
midway through the second half.
	   Speedy left winger Marc Overmars sat out the two-hour session
but Hiddink said he was not seriously injured.
	   ``He is feeling the effects of a few hard Belgian tackles,''
Hiddink said, adding that he believes match officials should be
alert for fouls on players like Overmars.
	   ``Belgium worked hard on him,'' Hiddink told reporters. Referees
``must be careful to protect such good and attractive players.''
	   Soccer's governing body FIFA has mandated red cards for tackles
from behind in this tournament but so far just one player has been
sent off for such a challenge.
	   Defender Arthur Numan also sat out part of the training, but
Hiddink said he was not an injury worry.
	   Keeping his possible starting lineup against South Korea close
to his chest, Hiddink would not say if he planned to partner the
tall, strong Van Hooijdonk with Bergkamp.
	   Not even Van Hooijdonk knows. ``I hope so. Certainly because of
the (Kluivert) suspension my chances are better,'' he said.

U.S. Economist: Ukraine may not meet all IMF conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A prominent American economist said Monday
that Ukraine may not be able to meet all the requirements for a
dlrs 2.5 billion International Monetary Fund loan, and suggested
the IMF ease some of its 87 conditions.
	   An IMF mission arrived in Kiev on Monday to assess Ukraine's
progress.
	   Ukraine took measures earlier this month to meet one of the key
conditions _ slashing the expected budget deficit to 2.3 percent of
gross domestic from 3.3 percent. But the plan still needs to be
approved by largely Communist parliament, which opposes cuts in
subsidies and other spending.
	   Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University economist who advises
Ukraine, suggested that the IMF make only the 10 most important
conditions mandatory, the Interfax news agency reported. The rest
could be recommendations, he said.
	   An IMF decision is expected in August. If the fund refuses the
loan, Ukraine will suffer serious financial troubles, Sachs warned.
	   The IMF refused to approve a loan last year because of Ukraine's
stalled economic reforms. The former Soviet republic is plagued by
frequent strikes and other protests by unpaid workers, even as the
government struggles to get the economy in order.

Flight to freedom a nightmare for weary Guinea-Bissau refugees

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ City-dwellers carrying their life's
belongings on their heads streamed across Senegal's border Monday
after walking for days through crocodile-infested swamps and jungle
to escape fighting in Guinea-Bissau.
	   Each hour, more than 100 refugees from Guinea-Bissau's
battle-torn capital of Bissau passed through this tiny frontier
town about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Ziguinchor, the
capital of Senegal's lush Casamance region.
	   Senegalese officials said the flow of evacuees had been steady
since the start of fighting between renegade and loyalist
government forces in Guinea-Bissau eight days earlier. Thousands of
others were crossing other border posts linking the two countries
on Africa's western tip.
	   The refugees brought with them stories of bitter street fighting
and bombardments in Bissau, separating entire families and causing
an unknown number of deaths and serious injuries.
	   Fatu Djouf, a Senegalese woman who lives in Bissau, walked with
her small toddler for nearly for nearly a week through
crocodile-infested marshes and dense forest to escape the notice of
guerrillas and government troops.
	   ``I left my husband in the scramble to leave,'' Djouf said.
``Until now I don't know what happened to him.''
	   Under the shade of a mango tree at Mpak border, Senegalese
officials and aid workers administered meningitis vaccinations to
each of the emigres, fearing an outbreak of the disease. Many
health workers appeared inexperienced, often breaking off needles
in the arms of their patients.
	   The refugees were then piled into mini-buses and taken to towns
in Senegal's interior, where military officials said they were to
be looked after by the local populace _ many of whom have family
and blood ties to the foreigners.
	   Thousands of people were fleeing Bissau where abandoned shops
and houses were being looted, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said.
	   Most foreigners had been evacuated from the country over the
weekend on the decks of overcrowded Portuguese, Chinese and
Senegalese merchant ships.
	   Lusa reported Sunday that 200 people drowned as they fled Bissau
by boat two days before. The refugees were on their way to the
Bissagos archipelago, 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast, when
the boat sank, Lusa said.
	   Portuguese radio station RDP-Africa cited a Red Cross source as
saying that some 20,000 refugees had arrived in Gabu, 200
kilometers (125 miles) east of the capital, and required emergency
food aid.
	   A group of 84 children evacuated from a Bissau mission were also
in Gabu.
	   Mutineers in Guinea-Bissau have said they will end their
weeklong revolt in the former Portuguese colony if the government
enters into talks and President Joao Bernardo Vieira steps down.

	   DOLLAR depost rates were hardly changed as market players
focused on economic and currency problems in Asia.
	   The US economy continued to show signs of robust growth despite
worries the Asian crises might dampen growth.
	   US shoppers increased as shown by a rise of 0.9 per cent in
Retail Sales for May compared to a 0.7 per cent rise in April. The
Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent for two consecutive months
but this was still considered non-inflationary.
	   This week, the data to watch is the Consumer Price Index for
inflationary pressures but may not have much effect on short-term
interest rates.

	   LACK of offerors and agressive bidding for fresh funds by local
financial institutions pressured interbank rates upward.
	   BNM through its bidding tender system injected RM3.40 billion
into the system, but market liquidity remained tight.
	   The announcement of the new issue 5 year Khazanah bonds of RM1.0
billion next week coupled with sliding ringgit exchange rate
against US dollar, prompted players to cover for the shortfall.
	   Sentiment was strong that interest rates could rise soon to
protect the ringgit.
	   Activities were relatively thin and mostly centred on the
short-term to medium-term for position squaring.
	   The benchmark one, three and six months money closed higher at
11.00/11.30 per cent.
	   The overnight money also was traded higher with the highest and
lowest level were traded at 11.30 percent and 10.50 per cent
respectively.
	   On the local securities and bond market, activities were very
dull due to the tight market together with the volatile movement of
the ringgit in the forex market.
	   The announcement of the new issue 5 year Khazanah Bond failed to
excite the players.
	   The When Issue (WI) closed lower at 11.05/85 against opening
11.30/05 but the volume was very thin.
	   In the NCDs market, three and six months NCDs closed flat at
11.30/11.00 per cent.
	   While for Bankers Acceptance, market was seen traded moderately
for the week to close at 11.30/20 for liquid BAs and non liquid BAs
closed at the range of 12.00/11.80.

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders struggled Monday to
plot a course out of a tangle of disputes that risk delaying their
plan to draw in their eastern neighbors and finally end the
post-war division of Europe.
	   The 15 nations agree the EU's workings must be streamlined
before they bring in Poland, Cyprus, Estonia and up to eight other
new members. But they opened a two-day summit hopelessly split on
how the reforms should adjust the EU's balance of power.
	   The leaders know taking on the poor farmers and declining
industries of the old east bloc will add to the EU's budget burden,
but they can't agree on who should pay.
	   Germany which provides almost one-third of the EU budget wants
to pay less and get more in return. Poorer members _ Greece,
Portugal and Spain _ resist talk of diverting the flow of EU funds
from south to east.
	   ``We want a fairer burden sharing,'' German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel told reporters. ``We have to guard our interests.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair acknowledged the issues would
not be resolved in Cardiff. But he hoped the showpiece summit of
his six-month EU presidency will get the debate on track so the
enlargement can go ahead in the first half of the next decade.
	   ``If we can put economic reform and political reform for the
future right at the top of the agenda, that is a significant
advance,'' he told reporters.
	   Hans van den Broek, the EU commissioner overseeing membership
negotiations with the former communist nations, said key decisions
would have to be taken by December when the European leaders next
meet in Vienna, Austria. If so, he said the first new members could
join by 2004.
	   ``We are on schedule and there is no need for concern,'' Van den
Broek told reporters. But he added ``there is a constantly louder
call ... not to delay too long.''
	   When the EU leaders last sought to overhaul the body a year ago,
they produced the Treaty of Amsterdam, a much watered-down
compromise that most now acknowledge solved none of their problems.
	   They are unlikely to get a breakthrough on Germany's 21 billion
mark (dlrs 11.7 billion) net-contribution to EU coffers until after
the country's legislative elections in September.
	   Away from their internal problems, the EU leaders shared
infomation on how to get Europe's 18 million unemployed back to
work. They were boosted this time by encouraging signs of economic
recovery.
	   EU foreign ministers, also in Cardiff, monitored developments in
the Balkans as NATO launches air exercises over Albania in an
effort to dissuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from
pursuing his military action in Kosovo. They were expected to widen
sanctions against Belgrade by banning commercial flights by
Yugoslav airlines to the 15 EU nations.
	   The 15 finance ministers focused on the latest economic wobbles
in Russia and Japan, where the yen fell to an eight-year low
against the dollar and stock prices tumbled Monday.
	   EU Finance Commissioner Yve-Thibault de Silguy said he expected
the Japanese problems to have only ``a moderate impact'' on the
Europe's economic recovery. ``The recovery in Europe is robust,''
he told reporters.

	   SINGAPORE shares are expected to test new support levels after
the benchmark stock index closed the week 6.6 per cent lower last
Friday on well-founded fears of a Japanese recession and the
specter of a devaluation in China.
	   ``Everybody is expecting the Straits Times Industrials Index
(STI) to test its January low of 1,0131.30 and maybe go lower,
possibly as low as 800 before finding support,'' said one trader.
	   The STI index ended the week 76.59 points down at 1,091.49
points as the local currency sank to 1.7450 per US dollar, from
1.6934 the week before.
	   Average daily turnover fell to 114.6 million shares worth S$235
million, from 130.39 million shares valued at S$206.13 million the
week before.
	   DBS Land Ltd was among the most heavily traded stocks, closing

	   ASIAN markets, including the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE)
were hammered last week as the Japanese yen fell sharply against
the US dollar and amid mounting fears of Japan's economic
recession.
	   The yen last Friday dipped below the 144 level to the greenback,
a new 8-year low and according to analysts, if the weak yen heads
to 150, this could prolong the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``It is all related to the falling yen now and should this
continue, Asian currencies including the ringgit would come under
stiff pressure.
	   The US dollar is stronger now against the regional currencies
and this surely made servicing dollar denominated debts more
expensive,'' said a Petaling Jaya-based analyst.
	   Says another analyst: ``It is like the vicious circle of
pessimism.''
	   Japan's recession, she said, will dampen exports from Asean
countries.
	   Japan is the biggest investor in most South-East Asian countries
and also the largest market for the region's exports.
	   Amid this regional worries which is affecting both the local
stock and money markets, the local bourse's Kuala Lumpur Composite
Index (KLCI) fell 32.68 points or 6.47 per cent to close last
Friday's trade at 472.37. The ringgit meanwhile closed at
RM4.0100/020 per US$1 last Friday.
	   Heavyweight stocks, Telekom and Tenaga, which together account
for 23 per cent of the KLCI ended the week at RM6.65 and RM5.55
respectively.
	   They were among last week's active counters.
	   One analyst said Telekom and Tenaga are among the country's
largest foreign currency borrowers and a weaker ringgit to the
dollar would put more strain on their corporate earnings.
	   Last week's bearish mood was acccompanied by thin trading. In
total, 544.587 million shares were traded valued at RM1.252
billion, slightly lower than the previous week's volume where
562.51 million shares valued at RM1.27 billion changed hands.
	   The week started last Monday on a gloomy note when shares ended
lower across the board with the KLCI breaching the psychological
500-point level to end the day at 497.79.
	   Last Tuesday, there was some slight bargain hunting which pushed
the KLCI up 7.85 points to 505.64 and this was again eroded on
Wednesday as share prices fell sharply due to rampant selling
activities amid the declining ringgit, dragging the index 15.78
points down to 489.86.
	   Selling pressure continued on Thursday on fears that the
battered yen will slow business recovery in the region. After
losing 6.86 points, the Composite Index fell again on Friday, this
time by 10.63 points to end last week's trade at 472.37.
	   One analyst said basically the market is blurred by the regional
currency weakness and ``the only way to go seems to be down''. He
said, given the region's rather bleak scenario, the KLCI's next
target down is 459.
	   Meanwhile other indices on the KLSE were also down with the
broader Emas Index closing the week at 122.02, 8.53 points down
from the previous week's closing of 130.55. The second board index
lost 3.05 points to 106.36.

	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Organizers got in only one match
Monday at the grass-court Nottingham Open before a familiar English
visitor arrived _ rain.
	   On the opening day of this Wimbledon grass-court warmup, Spain's
Jordi Burillo defeated Chris Wilkinson of England 6-2, 6-2 before
heavy showers stopped play at 1300 GMT.
	   With the start of Wimbledon only a week off _ and with last
year's Wimbledon on record as the wettest ever _ much of England
has been blanketed for weeks with wet weather and gray skies.
	   And it's not going to get better soon.
	   The weather forecast calls for more rain in south and central
England into the weekend. That will dampen this tournament and the
women's grass-court event opening Tuesday in Eastbourne.
	   On Monday, officials had to abandon the women's DFS Classic
grass-court tournament in Birmingham with Steffi Graf due to play
in the semifinals.
	   On Sunday, golf's European Grand Prix was called off in
northeast England after only 43 players _ in four days _ managed to
slosh through 36 holes.

Yeltsin won't attend czar's funeral
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will not attend the burial
of Russia's last czar, news agencies reported Monday.
	   No reason for the decision was given. But Russian media had
speculated that Yeltsin would not attend next month's burial for
Nicholas II, his family and servants if the Russian Orthodox Church
patriarch did not.
	   The church said last week that neither Patriarch Alexy II nor
any other member of the church hierarchy would officiate at the
service, but that local priests in St. Petersburg could take part.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said the government will
send a representative to the service in the Peter and Paul
Cathedral, the traditional burial site of the Romanovs. He did not
say who it would be.
	   Nemtsov headed the Russian government commission that was in
charge of determining the identity of nine sets of bones recovered
in 1991 near where Nicholas was executed by the Bolsheviks.
	   Repeated DNA testing has confirmed their identities as Nicholas,
his wife, three of their children and four servants.
	   Nemtsov's aide said last week that he and his family would
attend the burial.

	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders struggled Monday to
plot a course out of a tangle of disputes that risk delaying their
plan to draw in their eastern neighbors and finally end the
post-war division of Europe.
	   The 15 nations agree the EU's workings must be streamlined
before they bring in Poland, Cyprus, Estonia and up to eight other
new members. But they opened a two-day summit hopelessly split on
how the reforms should adjust the EU's balance of power.
	   The leaders know taking on the poor farmers and declining
industries of the old east bloc will add to the EU's budget burden,
but they can't agree on who should pay.
	   Germany which provides almost one-third of the EU budget wants
to pay less and get more in return. Poorer members _ Greece,
Portugal and Spain _ resist talk of diverting the flow of EU funds
from south to east.
	   ``We want a fairer burden sharing,'' German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel told reporters. ``We have to guard our interests.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair acknowledged the issues would
not be resolved in Cardiff. But he hoped the showpiece summit of
his six-month EU presidency will get the debate on track so the
enlargement can go ahead in the first half of the next decade.
	   ``If we can put economic reform and political reform for the
future right at the top of the agenda, that is a significant
advance,'' he told reporters.
	   Hans van den Broek, the EU commissioner overseeing membership
negotiations with the former communist nations, said key decisions
would have to be taken by December when the European leaders next
meet in Vienna, Austria. If so, he said the first new members could
join by 2004.
	   ``We are on schedule and there is no need for concern,'' Van den
Broek told reporters. But he added ``there is a constantly louder
call ... not to delay too long.''
	   When the EU leaders last sought to overhaul the body a year ago,
they produced the Treaty of Amsterdam, a much watered-down
compromise that most now acknowledge solved none of their problems.
	   They are unlikely to get a breakthrough on Germany's 21 billion
mark (dlrs 11.7 billion) net-contribution to EU coffers until after
the country's legislative elections in September.
	   Away from their internal problems, the EU leaders shared
infomation on how to get Europe's 18 million unemployed back to
work. They were boosted this time by encouraging signs of economic
recovery.
	   EU foreign ministers, also in Cardiff, monitored developments in
the Balkans as NATO launches air exercises over Albania in an
effort to dissuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from
pursuing his military action in Kosovo. They were expected to widen
sanctions against Belgrade by banning commercial flights by
Yugoslav airlines to the 15 EU nations.
	   The 15 finance ministers focused on the latest economic wobbles
in Russia and Japan, where the yen fell to an eight-year low
against the dollar and stock prices tumbled Monday.
	   EU Finance Commissioner Yve-Thibault de Silguy said he expected
the Japanese problems to have only ``a moderate impact'' on the
Europe's economic recovery. ``The recovery in Europe is robust,''
he told reporters.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ On its first full day open to car
traffic, the new and long-awaited bridge connecting Copenhagen to
continental Europe had its first traffic jam Monday.
	   The bridge that took 10 years to build and cost about 5.3
billion dollars was beset by confused motorists who lined up in the
wrong payment queues at toll booths.
	   Also, twice as many cars _ about 15,000 by early afternoon _ as
had been projected transited the bridge, the Storebaelt Link
company said.
	   The line of idled vehicles stretched several kilometers (miles)
in both directions along the four-lane highway.
	   The bridge, already open to rail traffic, opened to cars at 10
p.m. (2000 GMT) Sunday night.
	   Inaugural ceremonies included visits by the queen and the prime
minister, and nostalgic last rides on the ferries that, until
Monday, plied the route between the islands of Zealand, where
Copenhagen sits, and Funen, linked by another bridge to the Jutland
peninsula.
	   The 18-kilometer (11-mile) link consists of two connected
bridges, and a tunnel for trains.

	   THE setting up of the National Port Authority (NPA) has been
deferred due to the present economic situation, Federation of
Malaysian Port Operating Companies (FMPOC) and Penang Port Sdn Bhd
chairman Datuk Zahrain Mohd Hashim said.
	   ``There is no need to hurry to set up the authority. We have to
make sure we address the relevant issues properly first before we
set it up,'' he told Business Times.
	   He added that the federation have had fruitful discussions with
the Transport Ministry concerning the proposed NPA.
	   ``It was good that we were able to give our views on the NPA. We
had an opportunity to air our views on the consultant's report on
the proposed formation of the NPA.
	   ``The FMPOC seeks the opportunity to deliberate the issues
further with a view to achieve a more transparent and effective
business relationship,'' he said.
	   He did not elaborate as to the new date for the setting up of
the authority.
	   The FMPOC had, at its launching last July, identified four key
areas for further action, namely, the NPA and its role, tariff
rationalisation, electronic data interchange (EDI) and
strengthening Port Klang as a load centre for Malaysian ports.
	   The NPA which is a Government initiative, is aimed at overseeing
the operations of all federal ports in the country.
	   It was initially supposed to have been set up in March this
year.
	   Speaking at its launching last year, Transport Ministry
Parliamentary Secretary Datuk Chor Chee Heung had said that the NPA
will not push back the national agenda of privatization in the
local port industry.
	   ``It will not be used as a tool to muscle through the
Government's intentions or used as a weapon to downplay operators'
roles in the development of ports,'' Chor had said.
	   The FMPOC, whose objective is to improve the management and
operational efficiency of private ports and promote Malaysian ports
to world markets, comprises eight private port operating companies.
	   They are Penang Port, Johor Port, Bintulu Port, Lumut Terminal,
the three terminal operators in Port Klang (Kelang Container
Terminal, Kelang Multi Terminal and Klang Port Management) and the
latest addition, Kuantan Port Consortium.
	   Kuantan Port Consortium Sdn Bhd was privatised earlier this
year.
	   On other developments, Zahrain said the FMPOC has had a fruitful
first year.
	   ``A lot has happened in the past one year. We meet and hold
discussions on a regular basis, and there is a lot of cooperation
between the members.
	   Although we compete, it is done the Malaysian way,'' he said.
	   Zahrain added that the port industry has good direction now with
the Government realising that ports on the whole must be seen as
one entity.
	   He also added that the FMPOC had participated for the first time
in the National Port Consultative Council meeting in April this
year.
	   This was at the invitation of the Transport Ministry which
Zahrain described as a positive move taken to foster closer ties
between the regulatory bodies and private port operators.
	   ``This is a step in the right direction as it serves as a common
platform to address national issues affecting ports.
	   ``The forum gave all the parties involved, including the
regulators and the operators, an opportunity to put our cards on
the table and brainstorm,'' he said.
	   The council is chaired by the ministry's secretary general Datuk
Othman Rijal. Its last meeting was held in Johor about two months
ago.

Delegates gather in Rome to forge international court

	   ROME (AP) _ Battle lines were drawn Monday at a U.N. conference
on creating an international war crimes tribunal when advocates of
a strong, independent court squared off against the United States.
	   There were appeals for compromise _ and warnings that the court
would go ahead without it, if need be.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened the conference by
calling on the world community to erect a ``bulwark against evil''
with a court ``strong and independent enough to carry out its
task.''
	   Envoys from more than 150 countries and 800 human rights and
other civic organizations will spend the next five weeks
negotiating.
	   The goal is an international criminal court to try the worst of
crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
	   Delegates must wrestle with basic issues, such as the powers of
the prosecutor, the role of the U.N. Security Council and what will
trigger court action.
	   The United States and three other permanent members of the
Security Council _ France, Russia, and China _ have been pushing
for strong council control over the court.
	   Squared off against them is a group of 46 nations _ including
close U.S. allies like Britain and Canada and 14 of the 15 members
of the European Union _ and more than 800 civic organizations,
including the world's most prominent human rights groups.
	   The coalition ``has one hell of a fight on its hands,'' said
Richard Dicker, of Human Rights Watch.
	   Annan and the coalition made it clear Monday the court could go
ahead without American blessing if need be. But there were also
plenty of calls to compromise.
	   ``No one country, I hope, will want to be responsible for the
failure of this conference,''Annan said of the United States.
	   But, he added, if compromise fails, the court can go ahead
without the United States, as did the recent treaty banning
landmines.
	   The Clinton administration says it wants an international
criminal court, but it is under pressure from the Pentagon and
Congress to protect American soldiers abroad.
	   One striking feature of the conference is the pivotal role
independent groups are playing. Annan called it a ``new diplomacy''
that gives ordinary people a greater role in international policy.
	   The network of nations and organizations working for the
strongest and most independent court possible is ``getting
electrified,'' Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said
Monday.
	   The nations which want to water down the court ``to the lowest
common denominator don't have a chance,'' he said.
	   Over and over, Annan spoke of public opinion.
	   ``People all over the world want to know that humanity can
strike back, that wherever and whenever genocide, war crimes or
other such violations are committed, there is a court before which
the criminal can be held to account,'' he said in his opening
speech.
	   The idea of an international criminal court dates back to the
Nuremberg war crimes tribunals of World War II. The idea was
revived a few years ago amid the horrors in Bosnia and Rwanda --
for which ad hoc courts have been formed to prosecute war
criminals.

World Cup: In eye of the storm, England beats Tunisia 2-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The game played at the center of a
hooligan storm became a gentle rout in peaceful sunshine.
	   As its fans fought with police and rival supporters outside the
stadium, England thoroughly dominated Tunisia but settled for a 2-0
victory in the World Cup opener for both teams.
	   ``We could have scored three or four goals,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said. ``We could have taken them to the cleaners.''
	   There were no major incidents reported among the 54,587
spectators inside the Stade Velodrome, and the whole scene on a
perfect day for soccer seemed oblivious to the violent clashes
among English and Tunisian fans, police and local youths that
occurred before, during and after the game.
	   Alan Shearer scored in the 42nd minute, his 19th goal in 40
international appearances, and Paul Scholes netted in the 89th for
England, which are favored to win Group G.
	   Though England controlled play, nearly all of its quality shots
on goal came in the final 15 minutes of the first half. Goalkeeper
Chokri El Ouaer stopped the first three, but the fourth was a
well-rehearsed England set-piece set up for Shearer.
	   After Darren Anderton made a dummy run at a free kick from the
right edge of the penalty box, Graeme Le Saux chipped the ball to
the Newcastle striker, who headed his shot behind El Ouaer and off
the left post.
	   Then, late in the game, following a second half in which play
was largely bogged down in midfield, Paul Ince fed Scholes for a
25-meter strike just inside the right post.
	   England would have won by several goals had El Ouaer not made
two superb one-handed saves shortly before Shearer's strike. The
first came on Teddy Sheringham's 30-meter volley in the 36th
minute, and another came on Scholes' bouncing close-range header
two minutes later.
	   ``We didn't get too stretched as a side and looked fit and
strong at the end,'' Hoddle said. ``... Our lads played really
well. Some of the so-called favorites have found these matches
tricky.''
	   Tunisia, in its first World Cup game since 1978, used a very
conservative attack from the opening kickoff, passing the ball
around midfield as if trying to run out the clock. Occasionally,
there would be a long pass upfield to either Adel Sellimi or Ben
Slimane, but England's defense prevented any real scoring threat.
	   Tunisia's Polish coach, Henry Kasperczak, brought on three
substitutes to try to pick up the pace in the second half, but none
of its players showed the ability to finish off a goal, and England
keeper David Seaman was never seriously tested.
	   ``We came back and played well in the second half,'' Tunisia
coach Henry Kasperczak said. ``But we could not create the chances.
	   ``If we lost, it is because England has a very good midfield
with a strong link with the two strikers. England is also very
dangerous in set pieces.''

	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders struggled Monday to
plot a course out of a tangle of disputes that risk delaying their
plan to draw in their eastern neighbors and finally end the
post-war division of Europe.
	   The 15 nations agree the EU's workings must be streamlined
before they bring in Poland, Cyprus, Estonia and up to eight other
new members. But they opened a two-day summit hopelessly split on
how the reforms should adjust the EU's balance of power.
	   The leaders know taking on the poor farmers and declining
industries of the old east bloc will add to the EU's budget burden,
but they can't agree on who should pay.
	   Germany, which provides almost one-third of the EU budget, wants
to pay less and get more in return. Poorer members Greece, Portugal
and Spain resist talk of diverting the flow of EU funds from south
to east.
	   ``We want a fairer burden sharing,'' German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel told reporters. ``We have to guard our interests.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair acknowledged the issues would
not be resolved in Cardiff. But he hoped the showpiece summit of
his six-month EU presidency will get the debate on track so the
enlargement can go ahead in the first half of the next decade.
	   ``If we can put economic reform and political reform for the
future right at the top of the agenda, that is a significant
advance,'' he told reporters.
	   Hans van den Broek, the EU commissioner overseeing membership
negotiations with the former communist nations, said key decisions
would have to be taken by December when the European leaders next
meet in Vienna, Austria. If so, he said the first new members could
join by 2004.
	   ``We are on schedule and there is no need for concern,'' Van den
Broek told reporters. But he added ``there is a constantly louder
call ... not to delay too long.''
	   When the EU leaders last sought to overhaul the body a year ago,
they produced the Treaty of Amsterdam, a much watered-down
compromise that most now acknowledge solved none of their problems.
	   They are unlikely to get a breakthrough on Germany's 21 billion
mark (dlrs 11.7 billion) net-contribution to EU coffers until after
the country's legislative elections in September.
	   Away from their internal problems, the EU leaders shared
infomation on how to get Europe's 18 million unemployed back to
work. They were boosted this time by encouraging signs of economic
recovery.
	   EU foreign ministers, also in Cardiff, monitored developments in
the Balkans as NATO launched air exercises over Albania and
Macedonia in an effort to dissuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic from pursuing his military action in neighboring Kosovo
province. They were expected to widen sanctions against Belgrade by
banning commercial flights by Yugoslav airlines to the 15 EU
nations.
	   The 15 finance ministers also focused on the latest economic
wobbles in Russia and Japan, where the yen fell to an eight-year
low against the dollar and stock prices tumbled Monday.
	   EU Finance Commissioner Yve-Thibault de Silguy said he expected
the Japanese problems to have only ``a moderate impact'' on the
Europe's economic recovery. ``The recovery in Europe is robust,''
he told reporters.

Government, air traffic controllers settle on new five-year pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GLEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. government and the nation's air
traffic controllers announced tentative agreement Monday on a
five-year contract that will increase the number of controllers,
decrease the number of supervisors and better relate salaries to
the demands of the job.
	   Under terms of the pact, the government for the first time will
be able to offer merit-based incentives to federal employees. For
example, a group of controllers who reduced errors in their
particular tower below a target level would be eligible for
bonuses.
	   In addition, the contract changes the controllers' compensation
system by paying more to those who work in busier airports or
oversee more demanding airspace.
	   ``It is a good deal for controllers, it puts the FAA on a more
businesslike footing and for consumers, it raises the bar on safety
and system performance,'' said Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater.
	   The agreement also marks a change in the relationship between
the government and controllers, which hit a low point in 1981 when
the controllers struck and President Ronald Reagan responded by
firing them.
	   The controllers' contract expired last July and a new one had
not been expected for up to another two years, but representatives
of both sides reached agreement late last week after private
negotiations.
	   The union's executive board and then its members still have to
approve the contract proposal. Congress will weigh in by voting on
an appropriation of up to dlrs 200 million to pay for it.

World Cup: English hooligans back in business
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The front-page headlines said it all.
	   ``A Disgrace for England.''
	   ``Fans Shame England.''
	   ``Shamed Again by the Louts.''
	   The soccer hooligans are back _ causing havoc at the World Cup
in France, bringing shame to their country and reviving a scourge
that some call the ``English disease.''
	   Rioting in Marseille before and during Monday's England-Tunisia
game was the latest example of a bent for violence that has been
associated with English fans for decades.
	   ``England seems to have invented (hooliganism), exported it,''
said Keith Cooper, spokesman for the international soccer
federation FIFA. ``Other people have picked it up and run with it.
But England seem to be intent on remaining world champions at this
sort of problem.''
	   Prime Minster Tony Blair condemned the fans responsible for the
Marseille violence as ``a complete disgrace to England'' and said
their actions could harm the country's bid for the 2006 World Cup.
Sports Minister Tony Banks attacked the troublemakers as ``drunken,
brain-dead louts.''
	   On the streets of London, ordinary fans were ashamed and
appalled.
	   ``They're wrecking the good character of the normal football
fans who pay to go and support our team play,'' said newspaper
vendor Tony Seoparidi, who believes the offenders should receive
mandatory jail terms.
	   Jeremy Langman, wearing a wig in the colors of the England flag
after the 2-0 victory over Tunisia, said the violence was a product
of English society's repressed attitudes.
	   ``There aren't too many outlets for people in England to release
their emotions and this football hooliganism is a product of
that,'' he said. ``I think English people tend to be obsessive
about football _ and about other things like Princess Diana _ and
because of that certain people seem to go to extremes.''
	   Soccer violence has been a problem in many countries, with
Germany, the Netherlands and Argentina among the worst hit. But
what is it about English fans which causes them to booze and brawl
their way into so much trouble whenever they travel abroad for a
soccer game?
	   Experts cite alcohol, xenophobia, extreme nationalism, class and
cultural reasons. Hooligans have also been tied to right-wing
political groups, with evidence of ringleaders coordinating the
violence with military-type precision.
	   In addition, the reputation of English fans precedes them, and
they are often targeted by foreign fans and police.
	   But, mostly, the troublemakers are viewed as drunken thugs just
looking for an excuse to fight.
	   ``I don't want to hear any kind of examination of whether these
people had bad childhoods, or were dropped on their heads when they
were kids,'' Home Secretary Jack Straw said Monday.
	   ``I've seen football hooligans myself. I notice that they always
have a huge amount of money, both to travel and to buy large
amounts of alcohol, get completely drunk and then commit this kind
of act and then offer excuses.''
	   By contrast, Scottish fans, who also like their drink, have a
reputation for merriment rather than mayhem. That's why hooliganism
is considered an ``English'' problem, not a British or Scottish
one.
	   The lowest point came in 1985 when 39 people, mostly Italian
fans, died at Heysel Stadium in Brussels after English fans rioted
before the European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus.
English clubs were subsequently banned from European competition
until the 1990-91 season.
	   Since then, soccer violence has been largely contained at
matches in England, but fans continue to stir up trouble when they
travel abroad.
	   Graham Kelly, chief executive of the English Football
Association, said the problem will continue ``as long as people are
allowed to leave the country, singing and drinking in bars for 24
hours.''
	   But Banks, the sports minister, said it's impossible to impose a
blanket ban.
	   ``We cannot confiscate passports on the grounds of suspicion,''
he said. ``We have to find a way of dealing with them without
curtailing the freedoms of the majority.''
	   Richard Fenton, a sociologist and lecturer at Southamtpon
Institute, described hooliganism as ``a cultural thing _
predominantly the male, working class culture, where the macho
image prevails.''
	   Fenton said there were ``dedicated hooligans'' who come from
political extremes but who fit in under the banner of the Union
Jack and can steer a crowd in a bad direction.
	   ``The flip side of patriotism is an intolerance of foreigners _
a `we need to show them who is best,''' he said.

American named new head of South African Airways
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ An American who helped turn
around a money-losing airline became on Monday chief executive of
South African Airways, which has itself been in a tailspin.
	   Coleman Andrews, a prominent businessman from Virginia, took
over from SAA chief executive Mike Myburgh on Monday, said David
Barritt, a spokesman for the airline's holding company.
	   Andrews maintains a huge investment in World Airways, based in
Herndon, Va., but said he will ``put every ounce of effort'' into
SAA.
	   ``With the men and women of SAA, I am looking forward to
building an airline which customers love and competitors fear,''
Andrews, who arrived in South Africa on Saturday, said in a
statement. He was meeting with airline employees Monday evening.
	   SAA suffered 345 million rand (dlrs 70 million) losses in the
year ended March 31, 1997. Analysts expect bigger losses for the
fiscal year that just ended.
	   Andrews helped steer World Airways, a high-profile and highly
profitable airline during the Vietnam War when it ferried U.S.
troops, from bankruptcy. Damaged by airline deregulation in the
late 1970s and early 1980s, World Airways floundered until Andrews
bought a majority share in 1986.
	   Saki Macozoma, managing director of Transnet which runs SAA, a
wholly government-owned airline, said Andrews was the perfect fit
for the job here.
	   ``Coleman is a professional with an enviable track record and
exactly the right qualities needed to equip SAA to become a
profitable, competitive airline,'' Macozoma said.
	   Macozoma said SAA's board wished Myburgh well in his future
ventures.
	   Andrews' holding company, WorldCorp, holds 46 percent of World
Airways, down from 62 percent previously. Andrews said SAA and
World Airways do not plan to do business together and expected no
conflict of interest, according to Barritt.
	   World Airways' regular passenger flights to Tel Aviv and
Johannesburg contributed to the airline's losses of nearly dlrs 10
million in 1993 and 1994. The company halted passenger flights in
1996 and has returned to its roots as a charter carrier. The
American military is a major client.
	   World Airways had losses of nearly dlrs 15 million in 1996 but
the highest sales in five years at more than dlrs 300 million. SBC
Warburg Dillon Read Inc., a Wall Street firm, recently said World
Airways was in the midst of a significant earnings turnaround.
	   Andrews, 43, and his wife and three children plan to settle in
Johannesburg.
	   Andrews, who has a masters in business administration from
Stanford University in California, was a White House economics
assistant to U.S. President Gerald Ford and managing partner of
Bain Capital, a Boston-based venture capital fund until 1986.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Eighty-nine Indonesian legislators have written to
United States President Bill Clinton demanding that he ensure that
American aid is not used to finance activities which would
interfere in the country's domestic affairs.
	   Six legislators -- Abu Hasan Sazili, Aminullah Ibrahim, Samsul
Bahri, Yasril Baharudin and Zamharir A.R. of the Golkar faction and
Khofifah Indar Parawansa of the United Development Party faction --
delivered two letters, one addressed to Clinton and the other to
Congress, to U.S. Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy at his residence in
Central Jakarta Saturday.
	   The two letters were signed by 89 members of the 500-member
House of Representatives. However none of the 75 members of the
Armed Forces faction signed either letter.
	   Abu told The Jakarta Post that the legislators expressed their
appreciation for the American aid given to non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) to strengthen human rights, the environment
and democratization.
	   But, Abu said, the legislators were concerned over American news
reports that suggested the aid also benefited those whose aims were
not in the national interest.
	   ``We asked that in the future the aid be continued and increased
but with tighter supervision to ensure that it is for the welfare
of the people,'' Abu said.
	   The two identical letters cited a May 21 report in the New York
Times and International Herald Tribune which said that there are
indications that U.S. aid could be used by certain groups to
conduct activities which could disrupt stability.
	   The letter expressed concern that despite knowing that this aid
was being ``misused'', the U.S. government did nothing about it.
	   ``However the U.S. government has so far apparently disregarded
this reality, and even continued to send the aid which reached
US$26 million,'' the letter said.
	   The letter closed with a stern warning that inappropriate action
would only worsen Indonesia's economy and cause the people further
despair.
	   In recent weeks students have protested regularly outside the
U.S. Embassy in Jakarta and Consulate-General in Surabaya, East
Java, complaining what they believe to be Washington's meddling in
Indonesia's domestic affairs.
	   According to Abu, Ambassador Roy maintained that the aid was
merely used to help groups concerned with issues such as the
environment, human rights and improvement of the democratic
processes, not to interfere in domestic politics.
	   U.S. Assistant State Secretary for East Asia and the Pacific
Stanley Roth earlier this month denied that Washington had had a
hand in ousting Soeharto after widespread protests.
	   ``It is absolutely untrue. We have consistently stated that the
political situation in Indonesia is up to the people of Indonesia
to decide,'' Roth said.

Finland ratifies Amsterdam Treaty, Schengen Pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finnish lawmakers on Monday
overwhelmingly approved the latest European Union accord, the
Amsterdam Treaty, and the Schengen Pact on open borders.
	   The 200-member Parliament voted 110-4 to endorse the Amsterdam
Treaty that would regulate visa, asylum and immigration policies
for the EU's 15 countries, and pave the way for the group's
proposed expansion to include members from eastern Europe.
	   Eighty six legislators were absent or abstained.
	   To take effect, the Amsterdam Treaty must be approved by every
EU member country. Germany, Sweden and Italy already had ratified
the accord before Danes did so last month by referendum.
	   Finnish legislators voted 119-3 to approve the Schengen Pact,
which opens borders between EU nations and allows freedom of travel
within the bloc. It also aims to improve cross-border police
cooperation.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Just a day after arriving in Timika, Irian Jaya,
two National Commission on Human Rights members suggested yesterday
that the number of suspected human rights violations may be higher
than originally reported by church groups.
	   Commission member Asmara Nababan said preliminary investigations
indicated an increase in the number of violations that have
occurred.
	   He refused to say how many were initially reported or how many
new cases have been uncovered, saying only that the initial number
of cases reported was in the dozens.
	   ``Maybe two or three more commission members will be added to
look into this matter so we can collect more data,'' he said as
quoted by Antara from Timika.
	   He said visits to Bela and Jila villages already revealed that
more investigating was needed.
	   The commission promised to hold an investigation after receiving
reports last month of killings and vandalism allegedly committed by
the Armed Forces in a number of Irian Jaya villages.
	   The report claimed that between December 1996 and October 1997,
a number of innocent civilians were killed when a military unit was
operating in the Mimika area.
	   The report, compiled by three church groups in Irian Jaya, said
the incidents occurred in the villages of Bela, Alama, Jila and
Mapenduma.
	   Nababan arrived in Timika with fellow commission member
Clementino dos Reis Amaral on Saturday.
	   The two then visited surrounding villages and held dialogs with
tribal heads and dozens of residents from Bela and Jila villages.
	   Benny Mom, a community leader from Bela, claimed that a number
of local people were killed when a group of soldiers swept through
the village during operations to free hostages held by local
separatists in the Mapenduma area in May 1996.
	   ``We demand the government investigate the human rights
violations and take tough action against the soldiers involved,''
Benny asserted.
	   He also said that the government should gradually pull out
soldiers stationed in the villages so that local people could do
their daily activities without fear.
	   Nababan said that the rights body would urge the Armed Forces
leadership to reduce the number of military personnel in the area
and punish those involved.
	   However he pointed out that any withdrawal of troops would have
to be gradual.
	   Local churches have also established their own team to
investigate the human rights violations.
	   The church group has rejected the establishment of a
fact-finding team established by the Trikora Military Command
supervising Maluku and Irian Jaya over fears that it would be
neither independent nor objective.

Iraq rejects resolution stipulating longterm oil-for-food program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq warned the Security Council on Monday
that it would withdraw from the oil-for-food program if council
members approved a resolution stipulating the program was an
ongoing operation.
	   ``We told all council members that this would mean disengaging
Iraq from the program,'' Iraq's U.N. Ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon,
said Monday after delivering the warning to the council president,
Antonio Monteiro of Portugal.
	   Iraq was barred from freely exporting oil in 1990 following its
invasion of Kuwait. In 1996, the council approved the oil-for-food
program, which allows limited exports of Iraqi oil to fund
humanitarian supplies and to compensate Gulf War victims.
	   The United States had hoped to transform the deal, which must be
renewed by the Security Council every six months, into a program
that would continue indefinitely as long as economic sanctions on
Iraq remain in place.
	   Late last month, the United States tried in a draft resolution
to link that proposal to the approval of a dlrs 300 million
shipment of spare parts for Iraq's oil industry. But the proposal
ran into resistance from Britain and other council members.
	   ``Such a resolution which keeps the whole program open ended,
keeps it an ongoing scheme, isn't going to be accepted by Iraq,''
Hamdoon said.
	   There was no indication when the council would take up the
issue.
	   In February, the council increased the amount of oil Iraq can
export through the program from dlrs 2 billion to dlrs 5.26 billion
over six months. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan then asked the
council to approve the dlrs 300 million in spare parts to help
Iraq's poorly maintained oil industry increase output.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Two prominent political observers slammed
Saturday's installation of new members of the Supreme Advisory
Board (DPA) as a ``waste'', saying that it had become an
insignificant institution.
	   Constitutional law expert Harun Al Rasyid and political observer
Arbi Sanit -- both lecturers at the University of Indonesia --
agreed that the body had played no significant role for several
years.
	   According to the 1945 Constitution, the Council is supposed to
advise the president, either on their own initiative or when asked.
	   However in practice, few have either heard or seen the council
at work.
	   ``Frankly speaking, its's a waste... So it's useless to
establish one,'' Harun remarked of the council.
	   He argued that the Council had nothing to do and acknowledged
the perception that it had become a final resting ground for former
high-ranking officials.
	   Harun also pointed out that there was really no need for the
cash-strapped government to finance the body.
	   Expenses allocated for the Council would be better off spent
helping people cope with the worsening economic crisis, Harun said.
	   Arbi told The Jakarta Post yesterday that he agreed with Harun,
pointing out that in earnest the advisory role which should be
played by the council, has been made redundant following the
establishment of other government bodies like the National Defense
and Security Council (Wanhankamnas).
	   In addition to that, public seminars and research groups were
making a greater impact on various issues.
	   ``The DPA's role is redundant,'' he said.
	   Arbi was also critical of the composition of the new council,
saying the choices reflects President B.J. Habibie's reputation for
being ``his predecessor's man''.
	   ``It would be different if Habibie had recruited proreform
individuals into the council instead of just a bunch of supporters
of former president Soeharto,'' he said.
	   Among the 45 new DPA members sworn into for the 1998/2003 tenure
Saturday were former ministers Azwar Anas and Moh. Yogie SM, and
the government-backed chairman of the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI) Soerjadi.
	   ``They are Soeharto's men, not critical of the government... My
conclusion is that Habibie has just shown another sign that he is
Soeharto's man,'' Arbi said.
	   Habibie could have used the opportunity when appointing new
council members to show that he was totally separated from his
predecessor and that he was a ``proactive'' leader, he said.
	   ``But, now it's too late... He is still hegemonized by
Soeharto,'' said.
	   The council members were selected from a list of 90 nominees
which was submitted by the House of Representatives in April and
must include representatives from Golkar, the PDI, the United
Development Party and the Armed Forces and leading sociopolitical
groups.
	   Also sworn in Saturday were A.A. Baramuli, Abdul Hamid Baidowi,
Achmad Tirtosudiro, H. Achmadi, Agus Sudono, Ahmad Bagdja, AMW
Pranarka, A. Sulasikin Murpratomo, Aziddin, Ch. M. Muas, Chalid
Mawardi, Darussamin, Eddie Nalapraya, Fadoli El Muhir, Gafur

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council, concerned about
continued violence in Bosnia-Herzegovina, was poised Monday to
approve the U.N. mission to the Balkan country for another year.
	   Council members were meeting for a formal vote to extend the
mandate.
	   In a report to the council on Friday, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan recommended that the U.N. mission remain in the country until
at least June 21, 1999.
	   Annan said his recommendation was based on the assumption that
NATO-led troops would remain there during that period to provide
security for the U.N. operation.
	   ``Very regrettably, the last three months have seen an increase
in violent incidents aimed at returning refugees and displaced
persons, in particular those belonging to minority groups,'' he
said.
	   The U.N. Mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose current mandate
expires at the end of the month, includes about 2,000 civilian
police sent there to train and advise the newly reconstituted
police forces in parts of the country ruled by Bosnia Serbs and the
Muslim-Croat Federation.

	   YOGYAKARTA: Former Bantul Regent Col. Sri Roso Sudarmo has been
summoned as a suspect in a bribery case by the military police here
and will be questioned today.
	   Local Military Police commander Lt. Col. Unggul Kawistara
Yudoyono said here Saturday that Sri Roso would be interrogated for
allegedly offering the Dharmais charity foundation Rp 1 billion
(US$71,500) to smooth his reappointment as Bantul regent for the
1996/2001 term.
	   The foundation is chaired by former president Soeharto.
	   Unggul said that despite focusing its main attention on the
bribery charges, the military police investigation would also be
open to the possibility of looking for clues which might connect
the regent to the unsolved murder of Bernas daily journalist, Fuad
Muhammad Syafrudin, in 1996.
	   Fuad, also known as Udin, was among a few journalists who first
reported Sri Roso's alleged attempt to offer the ``donation'' to
the foundation.
	   Yesterday, Unggul also said that everybody allegedly linked to
the bribery case would be summoned for questioning.
	   He said this would include the Argomulyo village head in Godean
subdistrict of Bantul, R. Notosuwito, who is also a stepbrother of
former president Soeharto.

	   SAMARINDA, East Kalimantan: Brig. Gen. Suwarna Abdul Fatah, 54,
was elected provincial governor for the 1998/2003 term after
receiving 38 of the 45 votes in an election in the provincial
legislature Saturday.
	   He defeated two other nominees, Chaider Hapidz and Jurnalis
Ngayoh, who received four and three votes respectively.
	   Suwarna will replace HM Ardans who cannot be reelected since he
has served the maximum of two consecutive terms, Antara reported.
	   Born in Bogor, West Java, Suwarna graduated from the military
academy in 1966.
	   He is no stranger to the province having served as deputy
governor in charge of economics and development supervision.
	   The election process was slightly disrupted by a group of
protesters who demanded that the election be canceled because, they
claimed, it did not represent the people's aspirations.
	   Security officers quickly arrived on the scene and forced the
protesters to disperse.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's defense minister publicly rebuked a top
U.S. military commander Monday, accusing NATO of failing to consult
with Moscow on holding air exercises over the Balkans.
	   The rare public clash came as the Russian Foreign Ministry said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's imminent meeting with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow would be ``potentially
decisive'' in defusing the explosive conflict in Kosovo.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev gave visiting Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dressing-down before
reporters. He said that NATO had decided to launch the air
exercises, which are intended to put pressure on Yugoslavia to curb
its forces in Kosovo, only after he had left consultations in
Brussels last week.
	   Shelton insisted that Sergeyev had been informed that the
exercises would take place, but might not have been informed of
their precise timing. He stressed that he and Sergeyev had held
``cordial'' talks and agreed that the situation in Kosovo had to
change.
	   The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that Russia had
recalled its military envoy to NATO, Lt.-Gen. Viktor Zavarzin. The
move was apparently to protest the NATO air patrols.
	   In Warsaw, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen insisted that he
and other NATO ministers had ``a number of meetings'' with the
Russian minister in Brussels.
	   ``It was very clear NATO expected the air exercises to take
place. ... It should come as no surprise to anyone that they took
place today,'' Cohen said.
	   The Russian government has strongly opposed any direct
intervention in Yugoslavia, contending that all of the diplomatic
options have yet to be exhausted.
	   NATO planes began maneuvers Monday over Albania and Macedonia,
both of which border on Kosovo. The exercise included 80 planes
from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries.
	   ``We specifically underlined the need to find a political
solution, and then, all of a sudden, I find out the next morning
that the exercises are being launched,'' Sergeyev complained.
	   ``And that was a consultative council, supposed to bring a joint
solution. As a soldier, most of all, I value honesty in relations
with colleagues. And I cannot understand what they did to me in
Brussels after I left.''
	   At a news conference later Monday, Shelton was asked how he
responded to Sergeyev. He said he told the Russian general, ``I
knew that he did know an exercise was going to take place.''
	   ``I personally do not know whether he was informed or not
informed as the the exact time. He said today he was not aware of
the exact timing of the exercise,'' Shelton said.
	   Milosevic was scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Monday evening
and meet with Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin is expected to deliver a warning to Milosevic that the
crisis facing him is far more serious than he appears to realize,
said a western official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We place greater hopes on this meeting'' than on the NATO
exercises, said Vladimir Rakhmanin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman,
in comments reported by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin was expected to discuss the meeting late Monday in a
phone call to U.S. President Bill Clinton.

	   SURABAYA: Leading opposition figure Amien Rais called off
speeches in Pasuruan and Bangil yesterday as fears grew that his
presence would incite a clash between various local groups.
	   The chairman of the 28-million-strong Muhammadiyah Moslem
organization told journalists in Surabaya, East Java, that his
entourage was stopped on its way to Bangil by police who told him
that a group of people intended to block their way into town.
	   Amien said he was bewildered at the news, especially since East
Java Military Commander Maj. Gen. Djaja Suparman had told him that
personally there would probably be no disruptions during his visit.
	   ``I called the military chief straight away. He then told me to
just cancel my plans and go back to Surabaya,'' Amien recalled.
	   It is still unclear who the people threatening the disruption
were.
	   In Pasuruan, about 50 kms south of here, a group of young men
were seen parading around town at about the time Amien was
scheduled to arrive.
	   Locals told The Jakarta Post the youths were not from Pasuruan.

	   MEDAN, North Sumatra: About 500 supporters of ousted Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) leader Megawati Soekarnoputri, peacefully
took over the provincial party's headquarters from the pro-Soerjadi
faction Saturday.
	   ``Megawati is PDI's legitimate leader. We are the real owners of
this office,'' said Azwir Matondang, the leader of the pro-Megawati
group.
	   They arrived early in the morning at the office on Jl. Raden
Saleh; most were wearing red shorts with a halftone of Megawati.
	   After gathering in the front yard for several minutes, the crowd
strolled into the office where only one or two people were present.
	   Security officers were on hand but kept a distance as they
merely watched the peaceful takeover. A large traffic jam quickly
formed as people gathered to watch the ``men in red'' celebrate the
return of their office which they lost in 1996.
	   ``Soerjadi is a political crook, who was supported by the old
regime,'' Matondang emotionally told the crowd.
	   The gathering quickly became a free-speech forum; it called on
President B.J. Habibie to sack newly appointed State Minister of
Environment Panangian Siregar.
	   Panangian, a pro-Soerjadi supporter, was chairman of PDI's North
Sumatra chapter before his appointment to the cabinet last month.
	   ``Siregar must be sacked because he was one of the main actors
behind the toppling of Megawati in 1996,'' said Matondang.
	   Soerjadi ousted Megawati from the PDI leadership in 1996 in a
government-backed congress here.

	   BANDARLAMPUNG, Lampung: Even the elephant, the largest land
mammal on Earth, has to watch its diet as a prognosis said the
stomach aches suffered by 16 elephants at the Way Kambas elephant
training center was a result of gorging too much grass.
	   Many people initially thought the elephants had consumed some
sort of toxin. However the head of the Way Kambas National Park,
Suherti Reddy, said trainers had been stuffing the elephants with
too much grass.
	   ``The stomach aches that the elephants have been suffering were
from overeating green grass and not (caused by) poison,'' he said
as quoted by Antara.
	   Reddy said the 16 elephants which have been suffering from
stomach aches for more than a week have now been injected with
medicine and vitamin-B complex to aid their recovery.
	   The elephants have also been put back on their original diet of
banana leaves and palm midribs.
	   The Way Kambas elephant training center has 148 trainers and 30
trainer elephants taming about 117 wild elephants.
	   The center, located within the 130,000-hectare Way Kambas
National Park, is one of Lampung's main tourist attractions.
	   Reddy said income from foreign and domestic tourists helped
support the center's operational expenses.

Tiedemanns, House of Prince tobacco companies to merge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Tiedemanns, one of Norway's oldest
family-owned companies, on Monday said it will merge with the
Danish tobacco company House of Prince, in a bid to protect jobs.
	   The J.L. Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik, founded in 1778, has been
owned by the Norwegian Andresen family since 1849. The current
owner, Johan Henrik Andresen Jr., will have a 17.2 percent stake in
Scandinavia's largest tobacco company once the merger is completed.
	   ``This, emotionally, was a very difficult matter,'' Andresen
said in a news release. ``But securing jobs, in the end, was the
most important thing for us.''
	   Tiedemanns has produced the Prince cigarette brand in Norway
under license from House of Prince since 1975. It accounts for 60
percent of the company's tobacco sales. The Prince brand has a
57-percent share of the tobacco market in Norway.
	   Andresen said he decided to merge because the Danish company
would not guarantee a renewal of the Prince brand license when it
runs out in 2000. That would have forced mass layoffs by the
Norwegian company, he said.
	   ``I had hoped to celebrate the 150th anniversary next year as
100 percent owner, but we went along with this because we knew the
alternative was much worse,'' Andresen said.
	   Copenhagen-based House of Prince, called Skandinavisk
Tobakskompani in Denmark, employs about 5,000 people.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Jakarta Military Commander Maj. Gen. Sjafrie
Sjamsoeddin said Saturday the mid-May unrest that claimed thousands
of lives and huge material losses was spontaneous.
	   Speaking to reporters at the Army's Special Force's headquarters
at Cijantung, East Jakarta, Sjafrie said, however, some of the
riots were sporadically organized by small groups in certain areas
in Greater Jakarta.
	   These groups had no direct links to each other, he stressed.
	   ``The members of each group became spontaneously involved in the
riots but we have not ruled out the possibility that the people
were tied by emotional links,'' the two-star general said.
	   Sjafrie admitted that security officers have been investigating
a former hoodlum, who has become a student at a Moslem boarding
school, for allegedly organizing one group of rioters.
	   ``We received reports from people that he was around when a riot
hit an area,'' he said without mentioning the area concerned.
	   Sjafrie refused to name the suspect but a reliable military
source said that the man was Anton Medan, a
convict-turned-preacher.
	   Calls for an immediate government investigation into the May
13-May 15 riots have come from President B.J. Habibie, legislators,
opposition figures and various other groups, including the
Coordinating Body for National Unity (Bakom PKB) and the Indonesian
New Brotherhood Association (Persabi).
	   Official military reports said the death toll from the three
days of unrest was 499 while material losses totaled Rp 2.5
trillion (US$178 million) in Greater Jakarta alone.
	   The National Commission on Human Rights recently came up with a
figure of at least 1,188 people killed during the riots.
	   Last Thursday President Habibie, in his capacity as the Armed
Forces (ABRI) supreme commander, told ABRI's top brass to dig out
the truth over allegations that ``an organized group'' was behind
the recent riot.
	   On the next day, House Speaker Harmoko followed Habibie's move
by appealing to ABRI's top brass to investigate whether there was a
mastermind behind the riot.
	   ``The House warmly welcomes the statement by the defense and
security minister/armed forces commander that ABRI will thoroughly
probe whether there was a mastermind of the riots,'' he said.
	   On the same day, opposition figure Emil Salim urged the
government to establish an independent commission to reveal the
truth about the cause of the riot.
	   ``The commission should be able to inform the people about who
was behind the riots as soon as possible,'' he said, as quoted by
Antara.
	   According to Emil, the body should include members of the
National Commission on Human Rights and other credible experts.
	   The establishment of an independent commission, he said, would
prove to the people that the government was serious about
protecting all sections of society from fear, including
Chinese-Indonesians.
	   According to Sjafrie, many rioters were members of the public
who had been suffering from the country's prolonged social and
economic disparities.
	   Excited passersby, including women and children, reportedly
joined the looting and riots, he said.
	   ``We have detained some of the alleged rioters, but any
detentions should follow legal procedures,'' he said.
	   During the investigation, some of the rioters admitted that they
were outsiders from Tangerang and Lampung in Sumatra.
	   ``The rest of the alleged rioters were from the local
neighborhoods,'' he added.

Eritreans, Ethiopians welcome end to air raids

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ On both sides of the disputed
Ethiopian-Eritrean border, relief at a U.S.-brokered deal stopping
deadly air raids was mixed Monday with concerns over a continuing
ground war.
	   The accord left unresolved the biggest obstacle to peace:
Ethiopia reiterated its demand that Eritrea withdraw from more than
a half-dozen disputed areas before peace talks can begin.
	   ``I cannot rule out an all-out war if Eritrea maintains its
present intransigent attitude, but we will not rush to war,''
Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said in the Ethiopian capital, Addis
Ababa.
	   Eritrea has refused to withdraw, claiming it owns the disputed
territory, based on boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied the
country in 1885.
	   ``There's plenty of troops piled up on both sides of the border.
The chances of fighting boiling up again are great,'' said Patrick
Gilkes, a London-based expert on the Horn of Africa.
	   Nonetheless, Eritrea welcomed the air-strike ban as a first step
towards meeting its call for a total halt to hostilities.
	   ``I think the Ethiopian goverment is beginning to realize that
force is not going to solve this problem,'' government spokesman
Yemane Gebreab said in the Eritrean capital Asmara. ``We do hope
they will not want to fight on the ground anymore either.''
	   While the agreement does not end the border dispute between the
Horn of Africa countries, the White House said it ``can help
restore the mutual confidence necessary to achieve a peaceful
resolution of the conflict as quickly as possible.''
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea, one-time allies who less than a decade ago
were part of the same country, have battled since early May over
several stretches of their common border with the loss of hundreds
of lives.
	   Ethiopian soldiers said Monday that Eritrean forces shelled the
village of Karshifti Damariam, south of the border town of Zala
Ambessa, on Saturday but no injuries were reported and Ethiopia did
not return fire.
	   The White House statement said the moratorium against air
strikes, and threats of air strikes, ``will continue indefinitely
or until such time as either party concludes that any prospect for
a peace process has come to an end and provides formal advance
notice to the U.S. government that it will no longer respect this
moratorium.''
	   The announcement was quickly faxed between airlines, travel
agents and businessman anxious for a resumption of commercial
flights that stopped coming to Asmara on June 5, the first of two
days the capital's military-civilian airport was bombed by
Ethiopian warplanes, killing four.
	   After an idle week, Solomon Abraha of Travel House International
busily booked tickets. ``It's good to be working again, but I'd
rather be working in peace. This moratorium is only a temporary
solution.''
	   Many Eritreans were preoccupied by worries about loved ones on
the war front or living in Ethiopia. Ethiopia's Seyoum said 700
Eritreans have been expelled, including businessmen who had raised
funds for war effort and others who have had military training.
	   Yacob Zewengil, 17, said his street soccer game was off because
he was concerned about his brother, two years younger, who lied
about his age to join the military. ``We want peace, the last war
was enough,'' he said.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991. Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   In Adigrat, Ethiopia, 25 kilometers (18 miles) south of a front
line, life returned to normal Monday after an Eritrean air raid
killed four and wounded 30 on Thursday. Another 44 were killed in a
separate attack the northern town of Meleke on June 5.
	   ``It's good news,'' Johannes, who gave just one name, said of
the moratorium. ``Houses were to be burned and people were to die,
so of course, people were afraid.''
	   Other diplomatic efforts were in the works. Five leaders
appointed by the Organization of African Unity planned to begin a
mission later in the week.
	   To avert a full-scale war that could destabilize the region, the
African delegation is seeking a plan that would let both Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki
back down with honor.
	   One of their greatest incentives to make peace, Gilkes said, is
``neither side can afford it.'' Ethiopia and Eritrea are among the
world's poorest countries.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Protesters took the day off yesterday after two
consecutive days of demonstrations both here and in Dili, East
Timor, to demand a referendum in Indonesia's youngest province.
	   The 1,200 mostly Timorese protesters who held a noisy rally at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here Friday left Jakarta on
Saturday aboard commercial trains bound for Central and East Java
where many live.
	   They had spent the night in Cibubur, on the outskirts of
Jakarta, after being herded away by security officers.
	   More than a dozen buses took the demonstrators from Cibubur to
the Jatinegara train station and Kampung Rambutan bus depot, both
in East Jakarta, where they were dropped off without any overt
security supervision.
	   They looked relaxed, although a few were confused as they said
they had lost their money and possessions after Friday's
demonstrations.
	   They claimed they were well treated while spending the night in
a hall in Cibubur.
	   The protesters, both here and in Dili, were obviously taking
advantage of the more relaxed climate since the resignation of
former president Soeharto last month.
	   Prior to this it would have been difficult to conceive such a
large anti-integration rally being held in Jakarta.
	   The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976.
	   In Dili there was no sign of commotion as residents quietly went
to church yesterday.
	   In his sermon, Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo called for
peace and calm.
	   ``Please don't create situations which might disturb peace among
people,'' Belo said.
	   With the recent riots which hit major cities in the country
apparently weighing on his mind, Belo urged people to ``avoid
violence, respect shops and avoid stealing''.
	   On Saturday more than 1,000 students held a rally at Timor Timur
University demanding independence for the province and the release
of jailed Timorese separatist leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana''
Gusmao.
	   They waved pictures of Xanana and flags of his Fretilin
resistance movement. Some even climbed atop the roofs of campus
buildings to hoist the flags and sing traditional songs.
	   No serious incidents were reported as about 100 soldiers kept a
watchful eye from a distance.
	   The university's rector, Theo T. Balella, was not willing to
take any chances, however, and said he was temporarily suspending
all activity, academic and nonacademic, on campus.
	   ``Since Thursday the university administration has officially
suspended all activities. We saw indications that there is a group
of students aspiring to organize a rally on campus which is
directed toward anti-integration sentiment,'' he was quoted as
saying by Antara Saturday.
	   ``We do not want this campus to be used as a base for the
students' struggle for independence,'' he remarked without saying
how long activities would be suspended.
	   In Jakarta, former East Timor governor Mario Viegas Carrascalao
described the idea of an independent East Timor as absurd.
	   He said the province was too small to be able to survive on its
own.
	   ``Its own revenue is only 7 percent of the province's annual
budget, with the rest provided by the central government,''
Carrascalao said after being sworn in as a member of the 45-strong
Supreme Advisory Council (DPA) at the State Palace Saturday.
	   Carrascalao was East Timor governor for 10 years before being
appointed an ambassador in 1992.
	   While apparently taking a more relaxed approach toward
demonstrators than his predecessor, President B.J. Habibie is
adamant that East Timor will continue to remain an integral part of
Indonesia.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The defense team in the Trisakti court-martial met
with the two police officers on trial at Jakarta Military Police
Headquarters in Guntur, South Jakarta.
	   ``This meeting is very important because we are responsible to
give advice, support and guide the defendants. It is their right to
be protected, and it is our job to do so,'' the leader of the
defense team, Adnan Buyung Nasution, said.
	   After a one-and-a-half-hour briefing at city police
headquarters, the defense lawyers headed to Guntur for their
meeting with the two defendants at about 11 p.m.
	   The lawyers -- Otto Hasibuan, Denny Kailimang, Hotman Paris
Hutapea, Rudhy A. Lontoh and Hotma Sitompul -- were greeted by
Jakarta Military Police Commander Col. Hendardji.
	   Buyung said the meeting touched on significant testimony from
the two police officers -- company commander First Lt. Agus Tri
Heryanto, 29, and platoon leader Second Lt. Pariyo, 38, both from
Jakarta Police Mobile Brigade -- about their whereabouts and what
occurred during the incident.
	   ``We don't have much time to consult with the two defendants. We
have to be ready for Monday's trial session. Hopefully we can
reveal the truth,'' Buyung added.
	   Buyung stood by earlier statements that the trial was being
engineered.
	   ``Why do I say this? Because the prosecutors' indictment letter
stated that the two officers were responsible for their
undisciplined conduct which led to the deaths of four Trisakti
students.
	   ``The fact is we haven't even found the real shooters here. We
don't know for sure whether the shooters are among the two
officers' subordinates. What if the shooters are not members of
their squads?'' Buyung explained.
	   Today's hearing is scheduled to cross-examine 10 witnesses, with
West Jakarta Police chief Lt. Col. Timur Pradopo being the first
witness to appear.
	   ``I'm fine. I just pray to God to give me the strength to go
on,'' Timur told The Jakarta Post at city police headquarters.
	   Before the meeting in Guntur, one of the two defendants, Agus
Tri Heryanto, got a chance to speak to the media to talk about his
feelings concerning the case.
	   ``I was shocked when I was named as one of the suspects. I was
only armed with a shield (when the incident took place) but they
said that my actions caused the death of four people. That's
absurd.
	   ``I did the best I could in my duties. My hope is that I can
walk a free man,'' said the father of a five-day-old baby boy named
Fierlian Rifqi Heriyanto.
	   He revealed that when the incident took place, only 18 of the 98
officers under his command were armed with SS-1 weapons. ``And they
had only three blank bullets and 12 rubber bullets.''
	   Agus said he had not yet been able to meet his wife, Ary
Susiani, since she had their baby. ``My boy is currently in
Bandung. I miss them ... but what can I do?''
	   Pariyo, the other defendant, talked about how he felt with his
lawyers, saying he was ready to face the trial and its
consequences, but could not hide the depressed look on his face.
	   ``They feed me three times a day. I'm OK. I accept this as God's
will,'' he whispered.
	   The two defendants admitted that investigators did not use
violence during questioning and that they were able to communicate
with the other suspects in detention.
	   Investigation
	   Hendardji said that the 21 weapons -- SS-1s and Steyr AUG-Ps --
submitted to the National Police Forensic Laboratory were currently
undergoing ballistic tests.
	   ``The worst possibility is that none of the weapons match with
the live bullet taken from Heri Hartanto's body (one of the four
dead students). We will know that within a week.
	   ``If that's so, it means that I have to order all squads
involved in the incident to submit their weapons, and run ballistic
tests on the more than 100 guns used there,'' Hendardji said,
adding that the investigation was currently leading to the main
suspect of the fatal shootings.
	   When asked about the fact that all the suspects in the Trisakti
case were police officers and that it appeared discriminatory since
military personnel were at the scene, he said that the
investigation was fair.
	   ``I have investigated all commanders in the field from all
squads. There were eight companies involved: four companies from
the police, namely the Mobile Brigade and City Police, and the
other four from the army, namely the Jakarta Military Command and
Army Strategic Reserves Command.
	   ``But none of the army members were involved since they stayed
in their position. It was the police who conducted the shootings
and they went ahead toward Trisakti area,'' he said.
	   Therefore, the investigation is focused on the police, he told
the Post, adding that there was an army squad, the City Infantry
Regiment, which came to the Trisakti area. ``But it was between
noon and 1 p.m. on May 12, way before the clash broke out.''
	   Some 32 students have been questioned to gain more information
about the incident. ``But so far only one will be present as a
witness,'' Hendardji said.

Third day of clashes as England beats Tunisia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATE with England-Tunisia quotes, more on fan violence; WILL

 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Stade Velodrome in Marseille was the calm eye
of a terrible storm Monday, as England beat Tunisia 2-0 in peaceful
sunshine even as fans fought with police in the southern resort
city for the third straight day.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas on a beach to break up clashes
between English and Tunisian supporters watching the afternoon
match on a huge TV screen set up for people who lacked tickets to
the game. It followed street violence Sunday night that cut a path
of destruction through downtown Marseille and left two people
seriously injured _ one with a slit throat.
	   There were other skirmishes immediately before and after the
game. Shortly before kickoff, English hooligans threw bottles at
Tunisian supporters. Police beat some of the English with riot
sticks and made several arrests.
	   Police put a lock on Marseille earlier Monday, bringing in
reinforcements, putting a partial ban on alcohol and searching and
escorting arriving English soccer fans.
	   ``England seems to be intent on being world champion at this,''
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``It is not exclusively an
English problem, but again and again the English are involved.''
	   Cooper said some of England's hardened hooligans appeared to
head to Marseille just to stir up more violence, with little
interest in following the game.
	   ``(It) shows that they are not interested in the football, only
in what comes after,'' Cooper said. ``... We are determined not to
allow a small group of idiots spoil the party.''
	   Inside the stadium, the game took place oblivious to the
troubles outside. Alan Shearer scored late in the 42nd minute and
Paul Scholes in 89th in a game dominated by the heavy favored
English in their first game of the tournament.
	   ``We could have scored three or four goals,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said. ``We could have taken them to the cleaners.''
	   Later Monday, Romania played Colombia at Lyon, and Germany faced
the United States at Paris.
	   In outbreaks of fan violence Sunday night and early Monday in
Marseille, police arrested 50 people and 37 were injured, including
two English in serious condition with knife wounds. Earlier figures
spoke of more arrests, but authorities revised the figures
downward.
	   Violence first erupted Saturday night in the Old Port
entertainment district of Marseille, when fans clashed with police
and Tunisian supporters. Several English fans were arrested in the
melees.
	   The hooliganism was universally condemned.
	   ``What these fans are doing is that they come to a game to
fight, to cause trouble, to make war,'' said former Brazilian star
Pele. ``This is disgusting. The security, the police, should act
quickly to put these people in jail as an example to others.''
	   In England, Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned as a ``complete
disgrace'' the rampaging English fans.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and they have just got to put a stop to it.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday condemned as a
``complete disgrace'' the English soccer fans who rampaged in
Marseille on the eve of England's World Cup opener against Tunisia.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and they have just go to put a stop to it.''
	   Blair conceded the violence could harm England's bid to host the
2006 World Cup.
	   ``None of this helps, does it?'' he said. ``So it is important
that it stops now and that these people realize they undermine the
whole country.''
	   In running street battles shown repeatedly on British
television, English and Tunisian fans clashed with each other and
with French police in Marseille on Sunday night. Fifty people,
including 30 Britons, were arrested, and 37 people injured, local
officials said.
	   More clashes occurred Monday before, during and after England's
2-0 victory over Tunisia.
	   Speaking in the Commons, British Home Secretary Jack Straw
apologized to French police for the ``disgraceful behavior'' of the
English troublemakers and said Britain would consider paying
compensation for the damage they had caused.
	   ``The whole country feels betrayed by the treacherous behavior
of this criminal element who so besmirch the name of English
football and undermine our nation's reputation,'' Straw said.
	   Earlier, Straw said the blame ``lies fairly and squarely on
English football hooligans and criminals.''
	   Straw said soccer violence had been brought under control at
domestic matches in England but lamented that a ``hard core'' group
of hooligans was stirring up trouble abroad.

 &UR; Despite World Cup, `Idle Monday' busier than British bosses
thought &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Much of Britain shut down to watch England defeat
Tunisia in the World Cup, but time lost to ``Idle Monday'' may not
have been as bad as bosses feared.
	   Many Londoners braved a subway strike to get to work, rather
than using the walkout as a convenient excuse to stay home and
watch England win its first match of the tournament, 2-0.
	   Executives at the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry said
their concerns about lost productivity may have been overblown.
They had first predicted the combination of soccer and the strike
would cost London businesses 35 million pounds (dlrs 57 million) on
Monday alone. But more workers than expected were showing up.
	   ``Whilst business has undoubtedly been more sluggish today than
normal, it has been nowhere near as bad as many had feared,'' Simon
Sperryn, chief executive at the London chamber, said in a statement
late Monday.
	   Final estimates for any losses from absenteeism were not
available, but a spokesman for the chamber, Vincent Burke, said:
``I still think we'll be seeing millions of pounds lost today.''
	   Offices throughout the land were emptier than usual during the
afternoon, and pubs with big-screen televisions were considerably
fuller as many people who came to work found the idea of a long
lunch irresistible.
	   World Cup fever even spilled into a summit of European Union
leaders in Cardiff, Wales, although it did not halt their talks.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair had updates on the game delivered
to Europe's top politicians at regular intervals.
	   ``I just wish I had been able to watch the game, but we got the
messages,'' Blair said later. ``Every 15 minutes we were getting an
update.''
	   In Manchester, a northern England city where soccer reigns
supreme, streets were deserted but pubs were packed. Some people
were even peering in from outside, straining to see the action on
televisions inside the crowded bars they could not cram themselves
into.
	   ``It was a brilliant start,'' said Dave Seale, a 29-year-old
insurance worker who watched the game in Manchester's Waldorf pub.
``It's just what we needed. I've grabbed an extra hour for my
lunch.''
	   In Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, another northern town full of soccer
lovers, workers flooded into the pubs in the Bigg Market.
	   ``My boss has been good enough to let me have a couple of hours
off but I'll have to work tonight to make the time up,'' said Jason
Bradley, 26, a trainee lawyer.
	   For Britain's bosses, nervously watching for damage to the
bottom line, things could easily get worse, if the strikes continue
and England keeps winning.
	   The London subway strike is scheduled to end Tuesday evening,
but the dispute over future working conditions and job security
remains unresolved. And union workers who maintain Britain's
railroad tracks have scheduled 11 days of strikes beginning this
weekend.
	   ``We are not out of the woods yet,'' said Sperryn, the chamber
of commerce leader.

	   JAKARTA (JP): A councilor has suggested Governor Sutiyoso
include city councilors and NGO representatives in a reform team
founded recently to clean the administration of corruption,
collusion and nepotism.
	   Ali Imran Husein of Commission D for development affairs said
yesterday the team, called the task force of control and
supervision, would not work effectively if it consisted of only
city administration officials.
	   ``How can the team members properly carry out the tasks if the
offenses are committed by their colleagues?'' asked Ali of the
United Development Party faction.
	   ``Thus, the team should involve councilors and NGO activists so
that it can truly carry out their function.
	   If not, their credibility will be questionable,'' he told The
Jakarta Post.
	   Sutiyoso announced Friday the establishment of the team as part
of his efforts to implement reform of the city administration,
dubbed by many as home to many corrupt officials.
	   The establishment of the team is meant to answer the increasing
public demands to have clean officials, a transparent bureaucracy
and quicker public service, the governor said.
	   The team is led by Deputy Governor for Administrative Affairs
Abdul Kahfi; he will be assisted by other high-ranking officials.
The team is to work on four major issues: the city's public
service, the budget, expenditure and law and organization.
	   According to councilor Ali, the team might face difficulties in
carrying out their missions because corruption, collusion and
nepotism had became so deeply rooted among city administration
officials.
	   ``It's easier to find projects which have links with the dirty
practices than those which do not,'' he said.
	   He cited, for example, the cases of the appointment of city
secretary Fauzi Bowo and the chronic financial problems of
city-owned companies.
	   According to him, the appointment of Fauzi, the former head of
the city tourism agency, was against a regulation which states that
the city secretary should be a former secretary's assistant, mayor
or head of the city's Development Planning Board.
	   ``It's just an example of a nepotistic practice,'' he said.
	   Like other city-owned firms, PT Grafika Jaya printing company,
never paid contributions to the city, he said.
	   ``And they were never investigated,'' Ali said.
	   His idea, however, was rejected by Agus Pambagio, vice chairman
of the Indonesian Consumers Foundation (YLKI).
	   ``It's O.K. questioning the credibility of the team members
because many people have a negative image of them.
	   But it will be wasting time and money if the administration
invites other people,'' he said.
	   He, therefore, urged Jakartans to give the team time to work,
three months for example, before making any judgment.
	   ``For us, we'll watch their work from outside,'' said Agus.

EU adds ban on commercial flights to Serbia sanctions over Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo, BC-NATO-Kosovo
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ The European Union on Monday widened
economic sanctions against Belgrade in punishment for its crackdown
on Kosovo, adding a ban on commercial flights by Yugoslav airlines
to all 15 EU nations.
	   In recent weeks, the EU already had banned new investments in
Serbia, frozen the country's assets abroad, banned all arms exports
and restricted travel visas for Yugoslav officials.
	   Four EU nations _ Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ are
members of the so-called Contact Group on Kosovo, which already has
announced a ban on commercial Yugoslav airline flights.
	   The aim of the ban, announced during the EU leaders' two-day
summit here, is to intensify economic pressure on President
Slobodan Milosevic while NATO steps up military pressure.
	   In their Kosovo statement, the EU leaders left it unclear
whether military intervention _ the next step _ needs United
Nations authorization. The statement referred to ``options ....
which may require an authorization by the U.N. Security Council.''
	   EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said the need
to get U.N. backing pales compared to a ``situation on the ground
where innocent men, women and children are being slaughtered.''
	   More than 300 people have died since the crisis escalated in
March, when Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist ethnic
Albanians in the province.
	   The EU's Kosovo declaration called on Milosevic to stop military
attacks on civilians, withdraw his security forces, allow
international monitors in, facilitate a return of refugees and
start a political dialogue with his opponents.
	   The leaders condemned ``the use of indiscriminate violence'' by
Serbian security forces, adding, ``No state which uses brutal
military repression against its own citizens can expect to find a
place in the modern Europe. President Milosevic bears a heavy
personal responsibility.''
	   But they also made it clear they feel fault falls on both sides.
	   ``An immediate cessation of violence will be required as well
from the Kosovo Albanian side,'' their statement said. ``The EU
will play its part in stopping the flow of money and weapons to
Kosovo Albanian armed groups.''
	   While the West Europeans have sympathy with the demand by Kosovo
Albanians to restore the autonomy they enjoyed until 1989, they
oppose independence for the province.

	   TANGERANG (JP): Ten subdistrict heads and a district secretary
have sent letters to Tangerang Mayor Djakaria Mahmud threatening to
resign if the Tangerang district head is not dismissed.
	   The protesters have accused the Tangerang district head, Mulyadi
Sieska, of being arrogant, very cruel and involved in nepotistic
practices.
	   ``Mulyadi only thinks about money and he always boasts that he
has a close relationship with Mayor Djakaria Mahmud,'' one of the
protesters was quoted by Antara as saying Thursday.
	   The protesters are Subhan Sukanta of Gerendeng subdistrict, Suli
Rosali of Margasari, Sapawi of Bugel, Emma Rahmawati of Pabuaran
Tumpeng, Sentot Alibasya of Babakan, Yusuf Salahudin of Kowang
Jaya,Santoso of Karawaci Baru, Harry Sudibyo of Kelapa Indah,A.M.
Airin of Sumur Pacing, Yoyo Rakhmat of Buaran Indah and Rahmad
Hendrawijaya, the district secretary.
	   Copies of the officials' letters were sent to the Ministry of
Home Affairs, the West Java governor's office, the Tangerang Police
chief, the Tangerang military district chief and the Tangerang
prosecutor's office.
	   ``If the district head is not dismissed, we resign,'' the
protesting official said.
	   Suparman, an assistant to the mayoralty's administrative affairs
office, said such resignations could damage the reputation of all
civil servants.
	   Suparman accused the protesters of having no loyalty to the
civil servants corps.
	   ``If they resign together, it means that they are not sensible.
They are just stupid subdistrict heads,'' Suparman said.
	   Separately, Mulyadi Sieska said that the officials had every
right to resign. ``But it's the governor's authority, through the
mayor, to replace me,'' he added.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell sharply Monday morning, giving back
most of Friday's late rebound, as the outlook for company profits
worsened with a warning from 3M and another day of jittery selling
on Asian markets.
	   At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 95.41 at 8,739.95. On Friday, the Dow rose 23 points as a late
burst of bargain hunting wiped out a 127-point slide and halted a
three-day losing streak.
	   Broader indicators also suffered hefty losses Monday as the
dollar rose to an 8-year high against the Japanese yen, spurring
another series of steep declines on foreign equity markets.
	   Economists are worried that the yen's slide will further
complicate efforts to revive Japan's economy, the second biggest in
the world, by making investments in Japan even less appealing
compared with dollar-denominated assets.
	   A rising dollar also eats away at the currency exchange value of
whatever revenues U.S. companies manage to generate in that
troubled region.
	   The Standard and Poor's 500 index was down 8.66 at 1,090.18, and
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 9.43 at
1,735.62.
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 254.26 million
shares, almost even with Friday's early pace.
	   The NYSE composite index was down 5.45 at 561.22, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 6.90 at 690.50.
	   Key stock indexes in both Hong Kong and Bangkok tumbled nearly 6
percent, while in Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.3. In
Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index fell 2.5 percent and London's FT-SE
100 fell 0.9 percent.
	   Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's main index fell 4.8 percent,
the Philippines' fell 4.5 percent, Malaysian shares fell more than
4 percent, and Singapore's fell 3.5 percent.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The head of a gay rights group denied he
coerced a youth into homosexual sex and said he was the victim of
extortion.
	   Keith Goddard, 38, leader of the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe,
is scheduled to appear in court July 1 charged with sodomy, his
lawyer said Monday.
	   Goddard denies forcing Sipephule Vuma into submission at
gunpoint.
	   Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe, where President Robert
Mugabe has waged an outspoken campaign against same-sex partners.
	   Lawyer Derek Matyszak said Goddard appeared in court Friday and
was released on bail of 1,000 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 55).
	   Goddard maintained Vuma attempted to blackmail him after
consensual relationship and he reported the attempt to the police.
	   Vuma was charged Wednesday with attempted extortion of 7,000
Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 380) from Goddard.
	   Goddard's organization has repeatedly warned gays against
blackmail as economic hardships worsen and advises its members
admit being gay to deter extortion.
	   Zimbabwe's former president Canaan Banana is currently on trial
on 11 charges of sodomy and homosexual assault.
	   ------
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Serial killer Moses Sithole was on
Monday refused an appeal against his conviction and record-breaking
sentence of 2,410 years' imprisonment.
	   Sithole was sentenced in the Pretoria High Court in December
last year for raping 40 young women, murdering 37 of them and the
baby boy of one of them, and robbing six of his victims.
	   Judge David Curlewis said at the time he would have sentenced
Sithole to death if it had not been for the ``terrible mistake'' of
politicians to abolish the death penalty.
	   On Monday, the judge said Sithole was such a danger to the
community that he should not be let out of prison until he was
dead.
	   ``I do not have the slightest doubt that, having been proved to
be a monster and a terrible danger to young women, he would simply
continue to do what he had done in the past if he's ever let out of
jail,''the judge said.
	   ------
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's chemical and
biological weapons programmhas been terminated and all material
which could have been used for offensive purposes destroyed, the
government said on Monday.
	   Government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe said material produced
under the program had been destroyed in cooperation with countries
that had the necessary expertise and in terms of international
conventions.
	   The government was responding to last week's revelations at the
Truth and
	   Reconciliation Commission's hearings into the chemical and
biological weapons programme initiated during the apartheid years.
	   Netshitenzhe said the government had approached the Truth
Commission during the hearings last week to ensure they were not
conducted in a way that led to any proliferation, accidental or
otherwise, of chemical and biological weapons.
	   The hearings are to continue in Cape Town on Thursday when the
former head of the Defense Force's special operations unit and
mastermind behind the chemical weapons programme, Dr. Wouter
Basson, is expected to testify.

	   BOGOR (JP): Five hundred supporters of the ousted Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) leader Megawati Soekarnoputri went to the
Bogor Legislative Council on Saturday to demand the resignation of
councilors from the government-backed faction of the PDI.
	   ``The councilors are not from PDIs Bogor branch office,'' the
protesters' spokesman M. Sahid said.
	   The protesters also urged Bogor police chief Col. Abubakar
Nataprawira to resign for his alleged involvement in the takeover
of the PDI headquarters in Jakarta on July 27, 1996.
	   They accused Abubakar of helping the government-backed PDI
faction to storm the headquarters when he was Central Jakarta
Police chief.
	   The delegation urged councilors who received them to demand that
the Bogor mayor to dismiss corrupt officials and to give more
attention to small traders.
	   As usual, the councilors who received the protesters promised to
channel their complaints to the relevant authorities.
	   Meanwhile, graduates of Bogor Institute of Agriculture held an
pro-reform festival featuring songs and poems on their campus
grounds.
	   ``We want to remind students that reform has not yet finished,''
Agus Priyono, a member of the organizing committee, said.

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders struggled Monday to
plot a course out of a tangle of disputes that risk delaying their
plan to draw in their eastern neighbors and finally end the
post-war division of Europe.
	   The 15 nations agree the EU's workings must be streamlined
before they bring in Poland, Cyprus, Estonia and up to eight other
new members. But they are split on how the reforms should adjust
the EU's balance of power.
	   The leaders know taking on the poor farmers and declining
industries of the old east bloc will add to the EU's budget burden,
but they can't agree on who should pay.
	   Germany which provides almost one-third of the EU budget wants
to pay less and get more in return. Poorer members _ Greece,
Portugal and Spain _ resist talk of diverting the flow of EU funds
from south to east.
	   ``We want a fairer burden sharing,'' German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel told reporters. ``We have to guard our interests.''
	   Recognizing that Chancellor Helmut Kohl won't back down ahead of
the Germany legislative elections looming on Sept. 27, the EU
leaders convened a special summit to tackle the problems early
October in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
	   ``We're launching the debate,'' said Alastair Campbell,
spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the EU's current
president. ``It is the beginning of a process that is going to lead
to change.''
	   Hans van den Broek, the EU commissioner overseeing membership
negotiations with the former communist nations, said success in
Vienna could clear the way for the first new members to join by
2004.
	   ``We are on schedule and there is no need for concern,'' Van den
Broek told reporters. But he added ``there is a constantly louder
call ... not to delay too long.''
	   Away from their internal problems, the leaders banned on
commercial flights by the Yugoslav airlines to the 15 EU nations,
adding to the international pressure to dissuade President Slobodan
Milosevic from pursuing his military campaign in Kosovo.
	   EU finance ministers, also in Cardiff, urged Japan to push on
with reforms to stem the economic wobbles that saw the yen fall to
an eight-year low and Tokyo stock prices tumble Monday.
	   ``Further structural reform and the implementation of measures
to strengthen the financial system are necessary to restore
business and consumer confidence,'' the ministers said in a
statement.
	   Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the EU finance commissioner, said he
expected the Japanese problems to have only ``a moderate impact''
on Europe's economy. ``The recovery in Europe is robust,'' he told
reporters.
	   Signs of new economic vigor boosted the leaders' exchange on
information on ways to get Europe's 18 million unemployed back to
work.

Officials disagree on whether U.N. mandate needed for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
intervention &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS WIEGOLD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ As German military planes flew over Albania
and Macedonia on Monday, a war was brewing in Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition over whether a U.N. mandate is necessary for
German troops to take part should NATO intervene in Kosovo.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his centrist Free Democrats,
the junior party in Kohl's coalition, insist that a U.N. mandate is
needed for German participation.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe says that a U.N. mandate
would be ideal, but that NATO can also legally act on its own.
	   NATO commanders hope the exercises over Albania and Macedonia
will persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosoveic to reconsider
the use of force against the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo
province.
	   NATO has ordered its military planners to study a range of
options for even tougher action, including direct military
intervention in Yugoslavia with air strikes and use of ground
forces.
	   At a hastily called news conference Monday, Ruehe said that
NATO's decision to take military action in the event Serbia
continued to use force in Kosovo has ``a sufficiently legal
basis.''
	   That view conflicted with Foreign Minister Kinkel's earlier
statement that the NATO action could only be legally taken if
approved by the United Nations.
	   Kinkel, who was attending an EU summit in Cardiff, Wales on
Monday, repeated his position.
	   ``In international law, there must also be a supreme
authority,'' Kinkel said. ``This lies with the Security Council.''
	   Other diplomats in the Foreign Ministry went even further. They
said that the government's international law advisor has determined
that there is no legal basis for NATO intervention in the Serbian
province without a U.N. mandate.
	   The main opposition party in parliament has signaled support for
Ruehe's position.
	   Social Democratic faction chief Rudolf Scharping said this
weekend in an interview with Focus magazine that a U.N. mandate
would be ``desirable.'' But to protect the people it could become
necessary ``in an emergency to intervene militarily before.''
	   On Monday Scharping declined to renew his position, instead
pointing out that Russian President Boris Yeltsin was meeting with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in an attempt to reach a
negotiated solution.
	   Chancellor Kohl, who was also at the EU summit, avoided
commenting on the disagreement between his ministers, but advised
waiting on the outcome of the Yeltsin-Milosevic meeting.
	   Only the Greens party left no doubt about their stance: ``Even a
Volker Ruehe must stick to the Constitution and the tenets in
Germany and international law,'' Angelika Beer, the party's
military expert said.

No danger reported in fires at Russian nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The second fire in as many days damaged some
buildings near a Russian nuclear plant Monday, but authorities said
there was no damage to the plant itself, news agencies reported.
	   The fires, apparently sparked by unusually hot, dry weather,
broke out Sunday afternoon and Monday morning near the plant in
Novovornezh, about 475 kilometers (300 miles) south of Moscow,
ITAR-Tass and Interfax said.
	   It took firefighters several hours to extinguish each fire. No
injuries were reported.

NATO allies demonstrate speed and strength to Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with fresh details, quotes
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ Capt. Bryan Johnson stepped out of
his U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter Monday with a smile from
ear-to-ear. Giving Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic a lesson
in speed and power came pretty easy.
	   ``It was outstanding,'' said the exuberant American pilot at the
end of a four-hour demonstration of NATO's ability to project power
far and fast over Albania and Macedonia. The exercise was aimed at
making Milosevic think again about his violent crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
	   ``I don't think anybody in Serbia decided to take off today,''
he said as he climbed down from his sleek, gray fighter. ``We did
have some activity from ground-based radar sites and SAM sites, but
nothing threatening.''
	   Johnson's fighter was one of 85 aircraft - 68 fighters and 17
support planes - from 13 of the 16 NATO nations that participated
in exercise Determined Falcon.
	   ``I think we demonstrated the ability to project power on short
notice,'' he said.
	   Lt. Gen. Michael Short, commander of NATO air forces in the
alliance's southern division, agreed.
	   ``Everything went as it was expected to,'' he said.
	   ``All the preparation, training and discipline comes to bear in
a few short hours like it did today.''
	   ``This is a model for the NATO of the 21st century,'' enthused
Short, saying Monday's maneuvers showed just how fast the alliance
could react to events outside its traditional territory ``to
rapidly mass power where it's needed.''
	   The general said he was proud of his ``young people.''
	   ``You and I are old guys,'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``You know, you send your kids out to play? This
isn't play, but it's kind of like that.''
	   Taking off from this NATO air base snuggled at the foot of the
Dolomite mountains, the aircraft flew down the Adriatic coast, then
into Albanian airspace, turning a clockwise circle into Macedonia
and back across Albania in what Short called a ``wagon train'' 120
miles (200 kilometers) long.
	   The planes began departing about 7:50 a.m. (0550 GMT) Monday,
leaving from air bases in Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Britain,
the Netherlands and from carriers in the Adriatic Sea. Support
planes, including refueling tankers, already were in the air. The
aircraft began returning to base at noon.
	   ``At no time were we closer that 15 miles to the Yugoslav
border,'' Maj. Luis Villar, who flew a Spanish F-18, said of the
Aviano mission.
	   Altitude near the border ranged from 14,000-22,000 feet (more
than 4,000 meters to almost 7,000 meters).
	   Aboard the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault carrier, a live video
feed from AWACS aircraft hovering over Albania showed the planes
speeding at over 400 knots (460 mph, 740 kph) along a narrow
corridor as close as 16 kilometers (10 miles) from Serbia's
southern border.
	   Planes, departing from 15 bases in six nations, were provided by
all NATO members except Iceland and Luxembourg, which have no air
forces, and Canada, which could not deploy planes to Europe on such
short notice.
	   ``We in the military know we can do certain things,'' said Lt.
Col. Dennis Prokopowicz, an American F-16 pilot. ``Sometimes we
have to demonstrate that.''
	   The air exercise was ordered by NATO defense ministers on
Thursday during their meeting in Brussels. The ministers also
ordered the alliance's military planners to begin looking at a wide
range of options for future action, including direct intervention
in Yugoslavia with air and ground forces.
	   Milosevic's Serb-led army and police have cracked down on
dissent in Kosovo province, inhabited mostly by ethnic Albanians.
More than 300 people have been killed and thousands have fled into
northern Albania. The allies worry that the violence could spread
to neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
	   The NATO exercise took place before Russian President Boris
Yeltsin had an opportunity to try to persuade Milosevic, visiting
Moscow Monday and Tuesday, to back off in Kosovo.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed any direct intervention in
Yugoslavia, considering that all of the diplomatic options have yet
to be exhausted.

	   COMO, Italy (AP) - After a big-bash opening in New York last
December, and a four-month run at the Metropolitan Museum, the
Gianni Versace retrospective exhibition has come home.
	   The city of Como is hosting the exhibit in a villa on the shores
of the lake where the slain designer used to retire to his
sumptuous neo-classic home for inspiration and where in a local
cemetary his ashes rest in a golden urn.
	   ``It makes me very sad to look around and see all the wonderful
things Gianni did, and angry too,'' said Donatella Versace,
Gianni's sister, at the opening ceremony Monday. Donatella has
taken over the designing helm of the multi-million dollar company
since her brother was shot to death outside his Miami Beach home
last July.
	   Some of the Versace clan's best friends, including Elton John, a
regular at the Como home, and Mick Jagger, in town for a Milan stop
of the Rolling Stone's European tour, gathered to join Donatella
and brother Santo, business head of the company, at a gala party in
Villa Olmo, site of the exhibition. The guest list also included
several of Milan's top designers, including once arch-rival Giorgio
Armani, Angela Missoni and Gianfranco Ferre.
	   Set up in five rooms of the 17th century villa, the exhibition
of 120 outfits -- 40 more than were on show at the Metropolitan --
traces the creative history of the designer whose style became
synonymous with Hollywood chic.
	   On display are the chain mail outfits, the studded leather
miniskirts, the sequined ``rock and roll'' jeans jackets and the
sumptuous Greco-Roman chiffon evening gowns that marked his last
period.
	   Perhaps the single most famous dress on exhibit is the basic
black gown barely held together by gold safety pins and worn by
actress Elizabeth Hurley. There is also a section of the exhibition
devoted to menswear.
	   This city 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the Versace headquarters
in Milan also plans to set up a fashion museum in the designer's
name.
	   A year after the designer's death, his family seems intent on
keeping his name and creativity alive.
	   Donatella is marching ahead in her brother's designing
footsteps. ``I don't think I have his talent, but I inherited his
courage,'' she said.
	   Speaking specifically of the future of the Versace company,
Santo denied recent reports that the company plans to go public in
the summer of 1999.
	   While he confirmed that his brother had taken concrete steps in
this direction, he said that Gianni's sudden death had set things
back.
	   ``It is too soon to talk about dates. We have many things
including inheritance to deal with first,'' Santo said. He did not
elaborate.

 &UR; London stocks tumble in wake of Asian market carnage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices fell at the London Stock Exchange on
Monday, but they managed to finish well off the day's lows as
investors responded to sharp overnight drops on Asian markets.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed with a loss of 54.1 points, or 0.9 percent, at 5,715.7. The
so-called ``footsie'' has been off by more than 120 points earlier
in the session.
	   Investors were nervously selling shares after seeing markets in
Hong Kong and Bangkok dive by 5.7 percent, with the big Tokyo Stock
Exchange also dipping 1.3 percent as the Japanese yen tumbled
further against the U.S. dollar.
	   Weakness on Wall Street didn't help matters. The Dow Jones
industrial average posted big losses when the New York trading day
began.
	   Preliminary volume in London came to 798.4 million shares, down
from 822.0 million in Friday's session.

World Cup: Blair says players show true face of England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed
England's 2-0 World Cup victory over Tunisia, saying the players
had shown the world the true ``face of England.''
	   Blair, who had earlier condemned the rioting in Marseille by
England fans as a ``complete disgrace,'' said he was ``absolutely
delighted'' with England's win in the first game of its World Cup
campaign.
	   ``This is the face of England people want to show the world,''
he said. ``The country will be right behind them. I just wish I had
been able to watch the game.''
	   The Prime Minister was kept up-to-date with the match every 15
minutes during the European Union summit.
	   ``We had a very good discussion at our lunch _ but every so
often we would get little messages in saying how the England team
was doing,'' Blair said after the game.
	   ``This is a fantastic result and I am absolutely delighted. The
whole country will be thrilled at the result,'' he added.
	   ``It is important that they went in there playing really well
and they got a great result.

Guinea-Bissau rebels say they're ready to negotiate an end to
</HEADLINE>
conflict
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Red Cross information on refugees, Senegalese
official saying 255 died in refugee boat &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ More than a hundred dead bodies
reportedly were strewn on the streets of the capital of
Guinea-Bissau as rebels said they were willing to negotiate an end
to their week-long revolt in the former Portuguese colony if the
president steps down.
	   Portuguese Secretary of State Jose Lello said Monday that the
military situation in Bissau remained deadlocked and could drag on
with both sides using heavy artillery and mortars, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported.
	   The International Red Cross, meanwhile, warned that tens of
thousands of refugees were fanning out across this tiny coastal
West African nation.
	   ``They have medical, water and food needs,'' said IRC spokesman
Michael Kleiner, contacted by telephone in Geneva.
	   A spokesman for the Senegalese Defense Ministry, speaking by
phone from the capital Dakar, said 255 refugees crowded onto a boat
drowned when the vessel capsized at sea last Friday on its way to
the Bissagis islands. Their nationalities were not known.
	   Sources in nearby Cape Verde said 5,000 locals had reached the
Bissagis islands safely but were in urgent need of help. Portuguese
radio station RDP-Africa said that about 20,000 hungry refugees had
arrived in Gabu, 200 kilometers (124 miles) east of the capital,
including 84 children evacuated from a Bissau mission.
	   A rebel spokesman said late Sunday that the soldiers mutinied
because President Joao Bernardo Vieira had made rebel leader Brig.
Ansumane Mane the scapegoat for a scandal concerning arms
trafficking to separatist forces in the Casamance region of
neighboring Senegal.
	   Mane was implicated in the scandal and removed from his post as
chief of the Guinea-Bissau armed forces on June 6, the day before
the revolt.
	   Rebel spokesman Maj. Gomes Fernandes told Portuguese state
television RTP that Mane was ``set up'' by Vieira, who was himself
running the arms scam with a different section of the army.
``Vieira cannot remain as president,'' he said.
	   Fernandes did not specify the agenda for negotiations to end
hostilities, but said the revolt was not a powergrab.
	   ``This is no military coup. It was done to reestablish justice
in the country ... we never intended to seize power,'' he said.
	   A spokesman for the Portuguese Defense Ministry said
intelligence from Bissau indicated that the rebels enjoyed some
support among local people.
	   ``The people were dissatisfied with Vieira long before this
started,'' the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity,
citing allegations of corruption and broad support for Casamance
separatists.
	   The spokesman also pointed to local anger provoked by the
deployment of Senegalese troops in Bissau, who along with soldiers
from the Republic of Guinea are supporting the government forces.
	   Fernandes said the rebels, who have been pinned in a military
garrison in a Bissau suburb since they mutinied June 7, were
heavily armed. No information was provided about the strength of
the rebel force.
	   A spokeswoman for the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said loyalist
troops in downtown areas exchanged sporadic artillery and
machine-gun fire with the rebels Monday.
	   Abandoned shops and houses were being looted, Lusa reported and
international phone lines to the country were still not working.
	   A Portuguese Navy frigate, accompanied by marines, was due to
arrive Monday and anchor outside Bissau harbor.
	   Lello told Lusa it would be used for ``logistic support and as a
communications hub.''

Swiss president: no action over `slanderous' Wiesenthal Center
</HEADLINE>
report &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Amid uproar over a report alleging
Switzerland was riddled with pro-Nazi groups during World War II,
Swiss President Flavio Cotti Monday ruled out government legal
action against the study's authors.
	   But Cotti branded the report by the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center as ``slanderous, perfidious and absurd.''
	   The study, published last week, alleged Switzerland was
``thoroughly saturated'' with right-wing groups claiming tens of
thousands of members during the war.
	   In a statement, the Swiss government conceded the presence of
``a variety of small rightist radical groups,'' but said they never
totaled more than 1.5 percent of Swiss voters and were already in
serious decline by the time World War II began in 1939.
	   Swiss newspapers reported on Sunday and Monday that Sigi Feigel,
the honorary president of the Hebrew Congregation of Zurich, was
investigating with Swiss lawyers a possible private legal action
against the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
	   ``Switzerland must defend itself better,'' the Lausanne daily Le
Matin on Monday quoted Feigel as saying.
	   During parliamentary question time on Monday, Cotti was asked
whether the government supported such moves.
	   Cotti said it was up to the individuals concerned. Swiss
authorities don't want to get involved in any further controversy
with the Simon Wiesenthal Center, ``already discredited by its
publications about Switzerland,'' he said.
	   A report published earlier this year by the center asserted
Switzerland put Jewish refugees in slave labor camps.

Yeltsin demands closer investigation into journalist's death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with report that authorities
banned rally honoring slain journalist. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded Monday
that the killing of an opposition journalist be investigated ``to
the utmost level.''
	   Yeltsin said that officials in the Russian republic of Kalmykia
who are investigating the case of Larisa Yudina ``cannot be fully
trusted,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yudina was found dead on June 8 in the Kalmykian capital Elista
with multiple knife wounds and a fractured skull.
	   A Russian news agency reported that Kalmykian authorities had
banned a rally scheduled for Monday in honor of Yudina. Local
activists said the authorities said they were worried about a
flare-up of ethnic tension in the region, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Yudina was the head of the Soviet Kalmykia Today newspaper, the
only opposition newspaper in Kalmykia, and was regional co-chairman
of the Yabloko liberal opposition party.
	   Lawmaker Sergei Ivanenko said that Yabloko was conducting its
own investigation into the case ``to put pressure on the
government'' to find the killer.
	   Yudina frequently wrote articles critical of President Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov. He announced on Sunday that he would run for the
presidency of Russia in 2000.
	   Three people, including a former official in Ilyumzhinov's
administration, have been detained in connection with the killing.

Russian defense minister rebukes U.S. commander over Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's defense minister publicly rebuked a top
U.S. military commander Monday, accusing NATO of failing to consult
with Moscow on holding air exercises over the Balkans.
	   The rare public clash came as the Russian Foreign Ministry said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's imminent meeting with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow would be ``potentially
decisive'' in defusing the explosive conflict in Kosovo.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev gave visiting Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dressing-down before
reporters. He said that NATO had decided to launch the air
exercises, which are intended to put pressure on Yugoslavia to curb
its forces in Kosovo, only after he had left consultations in
Brussels last week.
	   Shelton insisted that Sergeyev had been informed that the
exercises would take place, but might not have been informed of
their precise timing. He stressed that he and Sergeyev had held
``cordial'' talks and agreed that the situation in Kosovo had to
change.
	   The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that Russia had
recalled its military envoy to NATO, Lt.-Gen. Viktor Zavarzin. The
move was apparently to protest the NATO air patrols.
	   In Warsaw, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen insisted that he
and other NATO ministers had ``a number of meetings'' with the
Russian minister in Brussels.
	   ``It was very clear NATO expected the air exercises to take
place. ... It should come as no surprise to anyone that they took
place today,'' Cohen said.
	   The Russian government has strongly opposed any direct
intervention in Yugoslavia, contending that all of the diplomatic
options have yet to be exhausted.
	   NATO planes began maneuvers Monday over Albania and Macedonia,
both of which border on Kosovo. The exercise included 80 planes
from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries.
	   ``We specifically underlined the need to find a political
solution, and then, all of a sudden, I find out the next morning
that the exercises are being launched,'' Sergeyev complained.
	   ``And that was a consultative council, supposed to bring a joint
solution. As a soldier, most of all, I value honesty in relations
with colleagues. And I cannot understand what they did to me in
Brussels after I left.''
	   At a news conference later Monday, Shelton was asked how he
responded to Sergeyev. He said he told the Russian general, ``I
knew that he did know an exercise was going to take place.''
	   ``I personally do not know whether he was informed or not
informed as the the exact time. He said today he was not aware of
the exact timing of the exercise,'' Shelton said.
	   Milosevic arrived in Moscow on Monday evening and was scheduled
to meet with Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Tuesday. He did not speak to reporters covering his arrival.
	   Yeltsin is expected to deliver a warning to Milosevic that the
crisis facing him is far more serious than he appears to realize,
said a western official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We place greater hopes on this meeting'' than on the NATO
exercises, said Vladimir Rakhmanin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman,
in comments reported by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin was expected to discuss the meeting late Monday in a
phone call to U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Williams Sisters to face different look; Novotna seeded No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ The Williams family will have a
different look at this week's Wimbledon warmup tournament at
Eastbourne.
	   Oracene Williams, the mother of Venus and Serena, broke her
ankle falling down stairs at a house the family has rented in
Wimbledon and will be in a cast for six weeks.
	   Venus, ranked No. 6 in the world, declined to talk about her
mother's accident, preferring to describe her low-key preparations
for grass-court play.
	   ``I've been enjoying not being in a hotel room,'' Venus said.
``I've been watching some cable TV: The Simpsons and Married With
Children, and sometimes I watch the talk shows, and the Cartoon
Network.
	   ``And we were supposed to go shopping one day, but we
overslept,'' she added. ``We only had an hour and spent all that
time in a shoe store.''
	   The rainy weather hasn't helped.
	   ``I don't like being cold. I don't like struggling to stay
warm,'' Venus said. ``Other than that everything's great. When you
practice you warm up quick, so that's OK.''
	   Jana Novotna is the top seed when play begins Tuesday in the
final Wimbledon tuneup. Seven-time Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf
is No. 2, followed by French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
	   World No. 2 Lindsay Davenport has skipped the event, as has No.
5 Monica Seles.
	   Seles is arguably the defending champion here. The 1997 final
between Novotna and Sanchez Vicario was rained out, and Seles won
in '96.
	   ``I pretty much just felt I needed a little bit of time off,''
Seles said. ``It was just too much the past month or so.''
	   ``One year I won Eastbourne but did terrible at Wimbledon, and
last year I didn't do well at Eastbourne and still did terrible at
Wimbledon.
	   ``So to me it doesn't make that much of a difference whether I
play or not. This year I'm going to try something different. I also
wanted to spend some time with my mom and my brother a little bit
this week, which is the only week they can come.''
	   Graf is playing only her fourth tournament in a year after
undergoing knee surgery and being slowed by several injuries.
	   She won three matches at last week's DFS grass-court event in
Birmingham and reached the semifinals. But the tournament was
eventually abandoned by almost non-stop rain.
	   ``It is too bad the weather has been so bad,'' said Graf. ``It
is frustrating for the players and equally frustrating for the
fans.''

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians in the battered
Serb province of Kosovo welcomed NATO's airborne show of force
Monday _ even though they couldn't see it _ and called for more.
	   Their reaction came amid a conspicuous silence by the Yugoslav
government concerning the West's military display.
	   Serb forces responded with their own action, according to the
Albanians' Kosovo Information Center, attacking three Kosovo
villages with helicopters and heavy shelling.
	   The continuing offensive against ethnic Albanian militants is
furthering calls for outside intervention.
	   ``We salute what NATO's doing, but wish that they would come
into Kosovo, not just fly around,'' said Aziz Mazreku, a high
school gym teacher sipping tea at a cafe in Malisevo, 20 kilometers
(12 miles) from the Albanian border. ``That would put big pressure
on the Serbs.''
	   The bustling market town _ behind the lines controlled by the
ethnic Albanian militants fighting for independence from Serbia _
already seems like a separate territory.
	   Gunmen from the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army walk around
openly, greeted by an occasional salute from grizzled old men in
domed white fezes. A man standing on a wheelbarrow was painting
over the Cyrillic lettering of the Serbian street signs with yellow
paint. Albanian is the only language spoken.
	   But just up the road a few kilometers (miles), Serb forces mass
at roadblocks and position their heavy guns and armored personnel
carriers up in the hills.
	   The NATO exercise was meant to convince Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic the West is serious when it says it wants him to
change his hard-line policy against the insurgents, which has sent
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing their homes.
	   Towns like Komorane show what happens when the Serbs move in.
	   Attacked a few days ago, the streets were empty except for Serb
police and stray animals. The burnt-out shell of a truck was
crumpled on the side of the road. Windows were smashed and stores
looted. Walls of the houses were covered with freshly painted Serb
nationalist graffiti. A dead dog lay splayed out on the street, his
hind leg sticking straight up. Other dogs gnawed at the carcass of
a dead cow just outside town.
	   In the provincial capital of Pristina, opinion among Kosovo
Serbs was divided. Some were devoted to the fight to hold on to the
province, considered part of Serbia's historic heartland.
	   ``Let NATO come, let just a single plane fly over our skies _
we'll all be up to our knees in blood,'' said unemployed Biljana
Mitrovic, 30.
	   Others were ready to quit.
	   ``I simply don't care. If this keeps on much longer, I'll pack
up my stuff and move to Serbia,'' said Branko Rakic, a clerk in a
state-owned company.
	   Mahmut Bakali, a member of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating
team set up to talk with Serbian authorities, said he hoped
Milosevic would heed NATO's warning so that ``serious negotiations
on the status of Kosovo can begin.''
	   But at the Express Cafe in Malisevo, residents held out little
hope for a negotiated settlement. While they say they continue to
respect their elected leader, Ibrahim Rugova, they say the KLA
calls the shots now _ at least in their town.
	   ``We are very determined about the war,'' said Mazreku. ``We are
fighting for our rights. We want independence.''
	   But despite its stepped-up attacks on Serb forces, the militants
remain for the most part an unknown quotient. Some drive around in
fancy all-terrain vehicles, carrying automatic weapons and fancy
Motorola walkie-talkies. Others ride in hay carts pulled by
tractors, holding onto decades-old rifles. Some wear fancy new
camouflage, others rag-tag uniforms with sewn-on patches.
	   None of the KLA fighters would agree to be interviewed. The
shadowy group named a spokesman last week, but he has yet to make
any public statement.

EU remains bullish on economy despite Asia, Russia crises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with EU finance ministers meeting, comments; TRIMS

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ EU governments pledged Monday to stick
with high-growth economic policies as British Prime Minister Tony
Blair warned that turmoil in Russia and Asia present the global
economy with ``its greatest risk for two decades.''
	   While Japan's recession will hurt European exports, finance
ministers meeting in the margin of an EU summit saw a positive
side: Stagnation elsewhere will help keep European interest rates
and import prices down, boosting domestic demand and investment.
	   The finance ministers urged Russia and Japan to quickly restore
market and public confidence in their battered currencies and
economies.
	   ``We are concerned about the situation in Japan,'' said Belgian
Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt. ``In the past, the Japanese
authorities have not always demonstrated an ability to take the
necessary measures in due time.''
	   In a statement, the EU finance ministers urged Japan to make
additional reforms to stimulate its moribund economy.
	   There was no hint of EU financial or currency-related aid to
Japan, whose currency fell to an eight-year low against the U.S.
dollar Monday. However, officials said they would back more aid for
Russia, if it was channeled through the World Bank or the
International Monetary Fund.
	   The finance ministers celebrated a rosy economic outlook in
Western Europe, saying ``there is increasing evidence of broadly
based economic growth'' in Europe that will ``provide the basis for
new employment opportunities and greater prosperity.''
	   At the summit itself, host Blair told his counterparts that
Asia's financial crisis means the United States and the EU must be
``twin pillars of stabililty. ... The world economy is facing its
greatest risk for almost two decades, since the Latin-American
crisis.''
	   ``Our economies will not emerge from this turmoil unaffected.
... Our task as leaders of the European Union is to lay the basis
of the long period of expansion that the United States has just
enjoyed,'' he said.
	   The EU summit discussed ``action plans'' on curbing unemployment
that each nation has submitted, along with broader economic
guidelines incorporating low-inflation, low-deficit policies. The
job plans include tax breaks for employers, state-subsidized
training programs, and changing welfare regulations to make taking
a low-paid job more attractive than welfare.
	   The EU's need for economic stability and growth is spurred both
by Asia's economic crisis and by the introduction of the single
European currency, the euro, in January.
	   ``We have to quickly take account of the risks in the Japanese
situation and reflect collectively on the responses needed,''
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said.

Eritreans, Ethiopians welcome end to air raids

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ On both sides of the disputed
Ethiopian-Eritrean border, relief at a U.S.-brokered deal stopping
deadly air raids was mixed Monday with concerns over a continuing
ground war.
	   The accord left unresolved the biggest obstacle to peace:
Ethiopia reiterated its demand that Eritrea withdraw from more than
a half-dozen disputed areas before peace talks can begin.
	   ``I cannot rule out an all-out war if Eritrea maintains its
present intransigent attitude, but we will not rush to war,''
Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said in the Ethiopian capital, Addis
Ababa.
	   Eritrea has refused to withdraw, claiming it owns the disputed
territory, based on boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied the
country in 1885.
	   ``There's plenty of troops piled up on both sides of the border.
The chances of fighting boiling up again are great,'' said Patrick
Gilkes, a London-based expert on the Horn of Africa.
	   Nonetheless, Eritrea welcomed the air-strike ban as a first step
towards meeting its call for a total halt to hostilities.
	   ``I think the Ethiopian goverment is beginning to realize that
force is not going to solve this problem,'' government spokesman
Yemane Gebreab said in the Eritrean capital Asmara. ``We do hope
they will not want to fight on the ground anymore either.''
	   In Adigrat, an Ethiopian town where Eritrean bombs killed four
people and wounded 30 on Thursday, residents were both relieved and
anxious.
	   ``The news is good, but still I am afraid. This is just a tactic
to draw us all together in the town so they can bomb again,'' said
Alem Teklehimanot, 40, who, with one of her six children wrapped on
her back chatted with friends on the streets after the moratorium
was announced.
	   While the agreement does not end the border dispute between the
Horn of Africa countries, the White House said it ``can help
restore the mutual confidence necessary to achieve a peaceful
resolution of the conflict as quickly as possible.''
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea, one-time allies who less than a decade ago
were part of the same country, have battled since early May over
several stretches of their common border with the loss of hundreds
of lives.
	   Eritrean forces shelled the village of Karshifti Damariam, south
of the border town of Zala Ambessa, on Saturday, according to an
officer who did not give his name. He said Ethiopia did not fire
back. There were no injruies reported.
	   The White House statement said the moratorium against air
strikes, and threats of air strikes, ``will continue indefinitely
or until such time as either party concludes that any prospect for
a peace process has come to an end and provides formal advance
notice to the U.S. government that it will no longer respect this
moratorium.''
	   The announcement was quickly faxed between airlines, travel
agents and businessman anxious for a resumption of commercial
flights that stopped coming to Asmara on June 5, the first of two
days the capital's military-civilian airport was bombed by
Ethiopian warplanes, killing four.
	   After an idle week, Solomon Abraha of Travel House International
busily booked tickets. ``It's good to be working again, but I'd
rather be working in peace. This moratorium is only a temporary
solution.''
	   Many Eritreans were preoccupied by worries about loved ones on
the war front or living in Ethiopia. Ethiopia's Seyoum said 700
Eritreans have been expelled, including businessmen who had raised
funds for war effort and others who have had military training.
	   Yacob Zewengil, 17, said his street soccer game was off because
he was concerned about his brother, two years younger, who lied
about his age to join the military. ``We want peace, the last war
was enough,'' he said.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991. Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   Other diplomatic efforts were in the works. Five leaders
appointed by the Organization of African Unity planned to begin a
mission later in the week.
	   To avert a full-scale war that could destabilize the region, the
African delegation is seeking a plan that would let both Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki
back down with honor.
	   One of their greatest incentives to make peace, Gilkes said, is
``neither side can afford it.'' Ethiopia and Eritrea are among the
world's poorest countries.

Guinea-Bissau rebels say they're ready to negotiate an end to

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Red Cross information on refugees, Senegalese
official saying 255 died in refugee boat. No pickup &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ More than a hundred dead bodies
reportedly were strewn on the streets of the capital of
Guinea-Bissau, where rebels said they were willing to negotiate an
end to their weeklong revolt in the former Portuguese colony if the
president steps down.
	   The military situation in Bissau remained deadlocked and could
drag on with both sides using heavy artillery and mortars, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported quoted Portuguese Secretary of
State Jose Lello as saying Monday.
	   The International Red Cross, meanwhile, warned that tens of
thousands of refugees were fanning out across this tiny coastal
West African nation.
	   ``They have medical, water and food needs,'' IRC spokesman
Michael Kleiner said in Geneva.
	   A spokesman for the Senegalese Defense Ministry in Dakar said
255 refugees crowded onto a boat drowned when the vessel capsized
last Friday on its way to the Bissagis islands. Their nationalities
were unknown.
	   Sources in nearby Cape Verde said 5,000 locals reached the
Bissagis islands safely but were in urgent need of help. Portuguese
radio station RDP-Africa said about 20,000 hungry refugees arrived
in Gabu, 200 kilometers (124 miles) east of the capital, including
84 children evacuated from a Bissau mission.
	   A rebel spokesman said late Sunday that the soldiers mutinied
because President Joao Bernardo Vieira made rebel leader Brig.
Ansumane Mane the scapegoat for a scandal concerning arms
trafficking to separatist forces in the Casamance region of
neighboring Senegal.
	   Mane was removed from his post as chief of the Guinea-Bissau
armed forces on June 6, the day before the revolt.
	   Rebel spokesman Maj. Gomes Fernandes told Portuguese state
television RTP that Mane was ``set up'' by Vieira, who was running
the arms scam. ``Vieira cannot remain as president,'' he said.
	   Fernandes did not specify the agenda for negotiations to end
hostilities, but said the revolt was not a powergrab.
	   ``This is no military coup. It was done to re-establish justice
in the country ... we never intended to seize power,'' he said.
	   A spokesman for the Portuguese Defense Ministry said
intelligence from Bissau indicated the rebels enjoyed some support
among local people.
	   ``The people were dissatisfied with Vieira long before this
started,'' the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity,
citing allegations of corruption and broad support for Casamance
separatists.
	   The spokesman also pointed to local anger provoked by the
deployment of Senegalese troops in Bissau, who along with soldiers
from the Republic of Guinea, are supporting government forces.
	   Fernandes said the rebels, who have been pinned in a military
garrison in a Bissau suburb since they mutinied June 7, were
heavily armed. No information was provided about the strength of
the rebel force.
	   A spokeswoman for the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said loyalist
troops in downtown areas exchanged sporadic artillery and
machine-gun fire with the rebels Monday.
	   Abandoned shops and houses were being looted, Lusa reported and
international phone lines to the country were still not working.
	   A Portuguese Navy frigate, accompanied by marines, was due to
arrive Monday and anchor outside Bissau harbor.
	   Lello told Lusa it would be used for ``logistic support and as a
communications hub.''

	   DORTMUND, Germany (AP) _ Talk about an explosive team.
	   For decades Germany's first division soccer team Borussia
Dortmund has played their home games with a 1,000 pound World War
II bomb buried at midfield.
	   Construction workers installing a lawn heating system at the
stadium about noon Monday discovered the bomb and disposal experts
were called in to defuse it, police said.
	   As a precaution a few homes near the stadium were evacuated.
Streets were also closed and traffic rerouted until the all clear
was given, police said.

State drops investigation of government financing of settlers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's state comptroller dropped an
investigation into allegations of government financing of Jewish
settlers who have been buying up property in traditionally Arab
east Jerusalem, an opposition legislator said Monday.
	   Lawmaker Haim Oron of the opposition Labor party has petitioned
the Supreme Court to force State Comptroller Miriam Ben Porat to
renew the investigation. Oron told The Associated Press that Ben
Porat wrote him last week that she called off the probe in response
to a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, head of the
ruling Likud party.
	   Netanyahu's aide Shai Bazak said he had ``no comment,'' on the
matter. Ben Porat's office was not immediately available for
comment.
	   The comptroller probe was prompted by a 1992 report by former
justice ministry official Haim Klugman regarding the activities of
two Jewish settler groups, Ateret Cohanim and El-Ad, and their
government backers during a previous Likud government.
	   ``We found evidence of impropriety in the matter of housing, and
allocation and distribution of real estate in the dealings of
government offices with Ateret Cohanim and El-Ad. Those offices
included the Israel Land Administration and then-Housing Minister
Ariel Sharon,'' Klugman told the AP. ``We submitted the report to
the state comptroller for further investigation,'' Klugman said.
	   Both Ateret Cohanim and El-Ad are active in buying up properties
and settling Jews in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed. Sharon now serves as
infrastructures minister and supports Jewish settlement of east
Jerusalem which the Palestinians want as part of their future
state, and has helped Ateret Cohanim in the past year.
	   On Sunday, Oron and an Israeli peace group which opposes Jewish
settlement of east Jerusalem jointly petitioned the Supreme Court
to force Ben Porat to continue the investigation. It was not clear
when the court was to hand down its decision regarding the request.
	   Ben Porat had originally begun to investigate links between the
government and the settler groups in 1995 but stopped after
then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin froze all government aid to the
settlers groups as part of peace talks with the Palestinians.
	   However, Ben Porat, apparently under pressure from opposition
lawmakers, informed Netanyahu last month that she intended to
resume the probe unless the government asked her not to, Oron said.
Oron said Ben Porat wrote him that on June 3 she received a letter
from Netanyahu asking her not to go ahead with the probe. Ben Porat
did not detail the contents of the letter, Oron said.
	   Despite calls by the United States for a time-out in settlement
construction, Netanyahu has said he supports natural growth in
Jewish settlements. The Israel-Palestinian peace process broke-down
in March 1997 after Israel announced plans for a Jewish
neighborhood on a disputed east Jerusalem hilltop.

Agassi, Graf get boost in Wimbledon seeding list

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Former champions Andre Agassi and
Steffi Graf were the main beneficiaries Monday when the seedings
for Wimbledon were announced.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion, was seeded No. 13 _ six spots above
his world ranking of 19.
	   Graf, the seven-time champion who has dropped to No. 91 while
recovering from injury, was seeded No. 4.
	   Wimbledon is the only of the four Grand Slam tournaments which
reserves the right to deviate from the world rankings in its
seedings.
	   The All England Club takes into account a player's grass-court
expertise and past record at Wimbledon in determing the 16 men's
and women's seeds.

U.N. envoy: Sierra Leone investment can't wait for `perfect peace'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Investment to help rebuild war-ravaged Sierra
Leone ``cannot wait until a perfect peace is in place,'' a senior
U.N. official said Monday.
	   ``We are up against a continued humanitarian emergency which is
likely to take us well into 1999,'' Sergio Vieira de Mello,
undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, told reporters in
Geneva after a four-day trip to the country.
	   He declined to put a figure on the amount of investment needed.
	   A plan to address humanitarian needs and more general
rehabilitation will be drawn up after consultations with a
U.S.-European team arriving Tuesday in the country's capital
Freetown, Vieira de Mello said.
	   Thousands of villagers have lost limbs and others have been
killed in attacks apparently being carried out by former junta
troops seeking revenge for their ouster from Freetown by a
Nigerian-led West African force in February.
	   That allowed elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to return from
months in exile after Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma took power in a
bloody May 1997 coup.
	   ``I have close to 29 years' experience in these conflicts and I
have not seen something like this before,'' Vieira de Mello said.
There are ``no words to condemn'' the amputations, he added.
	   But efforts should be made to convince as many as possible of
the rebel troops still hiding in the countryside to give up
fighting, he continued. ``We must try to help them save themselves
from their own barbarity.''
	   Vieira de Mello estimated that ``for one individual that
survives amputations, there are at least five _ in my opinion, many
more _ who die.''
	   There was no convincing explanation for the rebels' brutality
although drugs and alcohol may ``at least partly account'' for it,
he said.
	   Vieira de Mello made a point of praising the West African ECOMOG
force of some 11,000 soldiers, which is trying to disarm rebel
groups.
	   The force must remain and must be financially supported until
Sierra Leone rebuilt its own army, he said.

Austria coach: being underdog against Chile has its advantages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARGAUX, France (AP) _ Nobody likes to be considered second best
_ but in soccer, being underestimated has its advantages, says
Herbert Prohaska, coach of the Austrian World Cup team.
	   ``I hope they think we are the underdogs,'' Prohaska said Monday
when told that the Chileans were confident they had the edge going
into Wednesday's game. ``The possibility of winning grows when
you're underestimated.''
	   The game in Saint-Etinenne matches two teams that drew in their
first World Cup games _ but with a difference.
	   While Austria struggled to pull even with low-ranked Cameroon
for a 1-1 result, the Chileans held Italy, who are favored in their
group, to a 2-2 tie.
	   The Austrians were heartened by news that Chilean strike Marcelo
Salas, whose two goals against Italy made him the World Cup's
scoring co-leader, strained his thigh in practice Sunday, even
though the sprain was minor and Salas was expected to play
Wednesday.
	   ``If Salas were to miss the game, a very well-coordinated
attacking team would be split up,'' said Prohaska of Salas and
fellow-striker Ivan Zamorano, whose speed and mastery of the ball
in the air are freely acknowledged by the Austrians. ``Still, they
have other good players to take up any slack.''
	   Prohaska said a video review Monday of the the Chile-Italy game
showed the South Americans ``very good in fore-checking.''
	   ``If you give the Chileans time to draw up in formation, then it
becomes extremely difficult to penetrate them,'' he said. One key
to victory was to force the the opponent to play the Austrian game
_ ``we have to force the Chileans to try and control us in midfield
instead of vice-versa,'' he said.
	   Forward Tony Polster, who played with Zamorano during the
Austrian's tour with FC Sevilla between 1988-1991 said he
remembered him even back then as a dangerous striker.
	   ``Still, I look forward to seeing him again,'' said Polster.
	   The Austrians planned a practice Monday afternoon with the full
complement of players, including defender Wolfgang Feiersinger, who
on Sunday complained of calf pains and midfielder Heimo
Pfeiffenberger who also had suffered a bruised calf against
Cameroon.
	   Reserve goal keeper Wolfgang Knaller also was fit again, after a
light cold.

World Cup: Romania beats Colombia 1-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIOREL URMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Adrian Ilie's 15-meter chip shot in
first-half injury time gave Romania a 1-0 victory over Colombia in
their Group G opener Monday.
	   The Valencia striker outmaneuvered defender Maurizio Serna and
launched the ball over advancing goalkeeper Farid Mondragon.
	   Colombia nearly tied the game in the 85th minute when
replacement Adolfo Valencia, nicknamed ``The Train'', stretched
Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea for a diving save to his right
with his shot from 30 meters.
	   The Romanian squad, still built around the core of veterans that
played at the 1994 World Cup in the United States, set the pace for
much of the match. In contrast, Colombia struggled to maintain
possession despite occasional flashes of technical excellence.
	   At the start of the second half, Colombia's coach Hernan Dario
Gomez livened up his attack by substituting ineffective striker
Victor Aritsizabal with Valencia.
	   In the first half, Colombia started briskly, eager to avenge its
3-1 defeat by Romania at the last World Cup. But its passing was
ragged and easily intercepted by the Romanians, who quickly
established midfield dominance.
	   Ilie had the first scoring chance on a fast break in the 11th
minute, when he beat three defenders in the box and crossed the
ball to unmarked Viorel Moldovan, who failed to connect from 7
meters.
	   Five minutes later, Colombian goalkeeper Farid Mondragon
stretched to his right to stop a rasping shot from Dorinel Munteanu
from the edge of the box, then knocked away the rebound hit by
Ilie.
	   In the 40th minute, Moldovan intercepted a ricochet in the
Colombian box, but his header from 6 meters just missed the right
post.

Alleged Palestinian terrorist jailed pending trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new material &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE GEARAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A Palestinian who authorities say was
second-in-command of a violent terrorist group will remain in jail
pending trial for a fatal 1982 bombing of an American jetliner, a
federal judge ruled Monday.
	   A federal prosecutor argued that Mohammed Rashid is dangerous
and skilled in eluding law enforcement, noting he once escaped from
a Turkish prison and has used fake passports from several different
countries.
	   ``He has no ties to this country'' and would likely flee
overseas if released, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Walutes said
during a brief hearing before U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson.
	   Rashid, 51, was whisked out of Egypt earlier this month and
brought to Washington to face terrorism charges. He pleaded
innocent June 3 in a bombing that killed a 16-year-old Japanese boy
and injured 15 other passengers on an international Pan Am flight
in August 1982.
	   An 11-year-old U.S. indictment contends Rashid and his wife
planted a bomb under a seat cushion on the Boeing 747. The couple,
with their young child in tow, set the timer to explode on a flight
from Japan to Hawaii and then got off the plane in Tokyo.
	   The explosion tore a 3-foot hole in the jet's cabin, Walutes
said. If the bomb had been placed elsewhere, he said, ``The entire
plane could have come down over the Pacific.''
	   Rashid has been in jail since his arrival in the United States,
and Robinson ordered him to remain there until a trial on nine
charges including bombing, sabotage and murder. If convicted,
Rashid faces a possible life term in prison.
	   A federal public defender, Robert Tucker, told the judge he did
not yet have enough information to dispute the government's claims,
saying, ``At this point in time our hands are a little tied.''
	   In court papers, Walutes claimed Rashid was a leader of the
Baghdad-based terrorist group 15 May, dedicated to violence against
U.S. and Israeli targets.
	   The indictment names two alleged conspirators, the reported
leader of the 15 May group, Abu Ibrahim, and Rashid's wife,
Christine Pinter. Ibrahim made the bomb, the indictment said.
Neither has been arrested.
	   Rashid was arrested in Greece in 1988 and tried there in 1992.
He was released from prison in 1996 and sources said he had been in
Egyptian custody since then.
	   He is also charged with placing a bomb on a Pan Am flight to Rio
de Janeiro two weeks after the fatal bombing. That bomb was
discovered before it exploded.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A Palestinian who authorities say was
second-in-command of a violent terrorist group will remain in jail
pending trial for a fatal 1982 bombing of an American jetliner, a
federal judge ruled Monday.
	   A federal prosecutor argued that Mohammed Rashid is dangerous
and skilled in eluding law enforcement, noting he once escaped from
a Turkish prison and has used fake passports from several different
countries.
	   ``He has no ties to this country'' and would likely flee
overseas if released, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Walutes said
during a brief hearing before U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson.
	   Rashid, 51, was whisked out of Egypt earlier this month and
brought to Washington to face terrorism charges. He pleaded
innocent June 3 in a bombing that killed a 16-year-old Japanese boy
and injured 15 other passengers on an international Pan Am flight
in August 1982.
	   An 11-year-old U.S. indictment contends Rashid and his wife
planted a bomb under a seat cushion on the Boeing 747. The couple,
with their young child in tow, set the timer to explode on a flight
from Japan to Hawaii and then got off the plane in Tokyo.
	   The explosion tore a 3-foot hole in the jet's cabin, Walutes
said. If the bomb had been placed elsewhere, he said, ``The entire
plane could have come down over the Pacific.''
	   Rashid has been in jail since his arrival in the United States,
and Robinson ordered him to remain there until a trial on nine
charges including bombing, sabotage and murder. If convicted,
Rashid faces a possible life term in prison.
	   A federal public defender, Robert Tucker, told the judge he did
not yet have enough information to dispute the government's claims,
saying, ``At this point in time our hands are a little tied.''
	   In court papers, Walutes claimed Rashid was a leader of the
Baghdad-based terrorist group 15 May, dedicated to violence against
U.S. and Israeli targets.
	   The indictment names two alleged conspirators, the reported
leader of the 15 May group, Abu Ibrahim, and Rashid's wife,
Christine Pinter. Ibrahim made the bomb, the indictment said.
Neither has been arrested.
	   Rashid was arrested in Greece in 1988 and tried there in 1992.
He was released from prison in 1996 and sources said he had been in
Egyptian custody since then.
	   He is also charged with placing a bomb on a Pan Am flight to Rio
de Janeiro two weeks after the fatal bombing. That bomb was
discovered before it exploded.

Third day of clashes as England beats Tunisia

	   PARIS (AP) _ The Stade Velodrome in Marseille was the calm eye
of a terrible storm Monday, as England defeated Tunisia 2-0 in
peaceful sunshine even as fans fought with police in the southern
resort city for the third straight day.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas on a beach to break up clashes
between English and Tunisian supporters watching the afternoon
match on a huge TV screen set up for people who lacked tickets to
the game. It followed street violence Sunday night that cut a path
of destruction through downtown Marseille and left two people
seriously injured _ one with a slit throat.
	   There were other skirmishes immediately before and after the
game. Shortly before kickoff, English hooligans threw bottles at
Tunisian supporters. Police beat some of the English with riot
sticks and made several arrests.
	   In other games Monday, Romania downed Colombia 1-0 at Lyon on
Adrian Ilie's 15-meter chip shot in first-half injury time. The
United States played Germany in a late match at Paris.
	   The clashes followed a night of violence Sunday between drunken
English hooligans and Tunisia supporters, backed by gangs from
north Marseille suburbs, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Police put a lock on Marseille early Monday, bringing in
reinforcements, putting a partial ban on alcohol and searching and
escorting arriving English soccer fans.
	   ``England seems to be intent on being world champion at this,''
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``It is not exclusively an
English problem, but again and again the English are involved.''
	   Cooper said some of England's hardened hooligans appeared to
head to Marseille just to stir up more violence, with little
interest in following the game.
	   ``(It) shows that they are not interested in the football, only
in what comes after,'' Cooper said. ``... We are determined not to
allow a small group of idiots spoil the party.''
	   Inside the stadium, the game took place oblivious to the
troubles outside. Alan Shearer scored late in the 42nd minute and
Paul Scholes in 89th in a game dominated by the heavy favored
English in their first game of the tournament.
	   ``We could have scored three or four goals,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said. ``We could have taken them to the cleaners.''
	   In outbreaks of fan violence Sunday night and early Monday in
Marseille, police arrested 50 people and 37 were injured, including
two English in serious condition with knife wounds. Earlier figures
spoke of more arrests, but authorities revised the figures
downward.
	   Violence first erupted Saturday night in the Old Port
entertainment district of Marseille, when fans clashed with police
and Tunisian supporters. Several English fans were arrested in the
melees.
	   The hooliganism was universally condemned.
	   ``What these fans are doing is that they come to a game to
fight, to cause trouble, to make war,'' said former Brazilian star
Pele. ``This is disgusting. The security, the police, should act
quickly to put these people in jail as an example to others.''
	   In England, Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned as a ``complete
disgrace'' the rampaging English fans.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and they have just got to put a stop to it.''

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England beat Tunisia, 2-0, in the
Velodrome Stadium on Monday, but less conclusive battles flared
off-and-on outside, with tear gas grenades, riot police charges,
and ambulances wailing through this rough port city.
	   At least ten people were slightly injured, police said, and
another, hit on the head by a bottle, was hospitalized. About a
dozen people _ mostly Englishmen _ were arrested.
	   Sporadic outbursts of violence continued early evening in the
heavily-policed Old Port where English fans were buying alcohol in
supermarkets and some bars, despite a post-match ban.
	   Bars were ordered to close at 11.00 p.m., (2100 GMT), hours
earlier than normal, and not sell alcohol.
	   The clashes came after a night of window-smashing violence at
the Old Port which left 36 people in hospital, three of them badly
hurt, and at least 50 Englishmen, Tunisians and Frenchmen in jail.
	   One Englishman had an artery cut in his neck, and a policeman
suffered multiple fractures before sporadic rioting petered out in
the early morning hours.
	   Before the game, a group of glum English fans rapidly drank beer
at an outside cafe on the Prado Avenue, next to the stadium.
Several had battered noses and bad cuts. One man with a blackened
eye just swore when asked what had happened.
	   Swarms of taunting Tunisians waved red flags at them, as their
hard looks turned to shouted insults. Someone ignited a spark, and
bottles flew. Suddenly, Englishmen and Tunisians chased each other,
landing blows as best they could.
	   Riot police raced into the melee, swinging night sticks and
chasing. At least a dozen people, mostly English, were handcuffed
and dragged away. The tree-lined Prado was left deserted, a no
man's land of broken glass.
	   Thousands of ticketless supporters for both teams then gathered
by Prado Beach by a huge screen to watch the match with townsfolk
from Marseille, heavily settled with North African immigrants who
favor Tunisia.
	   After England scored its first goal, violence flared again.
Ripped-out seats flew from the Tunisian section. English thugs
slammed into their foes, as well as uninvolved people who fled for
safety. Riot police poured onto the beach.
	   A whiff of tear gas reached the stadium, a mile away.
	   As the game ended, disconsolate Tunisians and Englishmen in
mixed moods headed off in similar directions. Some English fans
departed for Toulouse, where their team plays next, but others were
clearly spoiling for a fight.
	   Three men with bare chests, beer guts and bald heads slugged
back lager from long cans as they watched Tunisians walk past. One
glowered when asked if he expected trouble. ``We're here. They can
do whatever they want,'' he said, not giving his name.
	   ``It's the beer, isn't it,'' said Sharon Hyde, a London
policewoman on holiday, who like most English fans had no trouble.
She blamed the trouble on a few thugs who made a habit of wreaking
havoc when England played on the European continent.
	   Scotland Yard has sent specialists to help French police
identify known troublemakers, Hyde said. But the thugs' style was
to act like innocent funlovers until they found an opportunity to
smash things without police interference.
	   Although cameras focused the flareups, the predominant
atmosphere was more like a carnival. A skinny Englishman in a
Superman suit looked for tickets with a young woman in a bright
orange clown wig.
	   A beeping car rolled by, barely noticed by traffic police, with
seven balloon-festoned Tunisians on the hood, the top, and the
trunk. Tunisians danced wildly to drums in a gay swirl of red
flags.
	   Kamel Chaoi, a young Tunisian cook at the little port of Cassis,
was part of the flag-waving scooter swarm that rode back and forth
past English fans near the port Sunday night when the place

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians in the battered
Serb province of Kosovo welcomed NATO's airborne show of force
Monday _ even though they couldn't see it _ and called for more.
	   Their reaction came amid a conspicuous silence by the Yugoslav
government concerning the West's military display.
	   Serb forces responded with their own action, according to the
Albanians' Kosovo Information Center, attacking four Kosovo
villages in the Decani area with helicopters, grenades and heavy
shelling. The area is considered a stronghold of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.

Indian court issues warrants against Frenchwoman in rape case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KISHORE PATHANIA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) _ An Indian court issued warrants Monday
for a Frenchwoman allegedly raped during a 1994 tour of the country
by an influential man related to a political leader.
	   Katia Darnaud, who was allegedly abducted and later raped by the
grandson of the then highest official of the northern Punjab state,
Chief Minister Beant Singh, would have to return to India to be
deposed or the case would be closed for lack of evidence, court
officials said.
	   Darnaud returned to France a month after the August 31, 1994,
incident and has not returned for the trial since. She did not
respond to summons served on her in France, said
government-appointed prosecution counsel Himmat Singh.
	   ``She has failed to depose in court due to financial and
security reasons,'' Himmat Singh told The Associated Press. ``She
apprehended danger to her life if she returned.''
	   Darnaud was having drinks at a bar in this northern Indian city
with her Nigerian friends when the chief minister's grandson
Gurkirat Singh walked in with six friends.
	   He was accompanied by a column of security guards, provided by
the government as the chief minister was leading a government
onslaught against a violent Sikh separatist movement and his family
had received death threats.
	   The guards allegedly chased the tourists' car through desolate
streets to Mohali, a suburb, where they barged into the house where
Darnaud was staying and forcibly took her away, accusing her of
carrying drugs.
	   Darnaud was then allegedly raped by the seven men in a factory,
prosecution and newspaper reports alleged.
	   The Frenchwoman filed a complaint before the police and deposed
before a magistrate, but she needs to depose afresh before the
judge hearing the case.
	   After a public furor, cases were registered against the accused,
but the charges read only ``abduction and molestation.'' Opposition
groups accused the government of influencing the probe.
	   The chief minister was blown up in a car bomb explosion
triggered by terrorists exactly one year after the incident on
August 31, 1995.
	   Thirty-six witnesses were examined by Judge Sant Prakash during
the trial, but the prosecution case suffered a blow after key
witness Phillip, then Darnaud's boyfriend, turned hostile. The
judge has set the next hearing for July 20.

English, Tunisian fans clash, thwarting police measures

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with clashes continuing, new quotes, color, fans
getting around alcohol ban by buying in supermarkets, and in some
bars; a version has moved with ``i'' category code &QL;

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England beat Tunisia, 2-0, in the
Velodrome Stadium on Monday, but less conclusive battles flared
off-and-on outside, with tear gas grenades, riot police charges,
and ambulances wailing through this rough port city.
	   At least 10 people were slightly injured, police said, and
another, hit on the head by a bottle, was hospitalized. About a
dozen people _ mostly Englishmen _ were arrested.
	   Sporadic outbursts of violence continued early evening in the
heavily-policed Old Port where English fans were buying alcohol in
supermarkets and some bars, despite a post-match ban.
	   Bars were ordered to close at 11 p.m., (2100 GMT), hours earlier
than normal, and not sell alcohol.
	   The clashes came after a night of window-smashing violence at
the Old Port which left 36 people in hospital, three of them badly
hurt, and at least 50 Englishmen, Tunisians and Frenchmen in jail.
	   One Englishman had an artery cut in his neck, and a policeman
suffered multiple fractures before sporadic rioting petered out in
the early morning hours.
	   Before the game, a group of glum English fans rapidly drank beer
at an outside cafe on the Prado Avenue, next to the stadium.
Several had battered noses and bad cuts. One man with a blackened
eye just swore when asked what had happened.
	   Swarms of taunting Tunisians waved red flags at them, as their
hard looks turned to shouted insults. Someone ignited a spark, and
bottles flew. Suddenly, Englishmen and Tunisians chased each other,
landing blows as best they could.
	   Riot police raced into the melee, swinging night sticks and
chasing. At least a dozen people, mostly English, were handcuffed
and dragged away. The tree-lined Prado was left deserted, a no
man's land of broken glass.
	   Thousands of ticketless supporters for both teams then gathered
by Prado Beach by a huge screen to watch the match with townsfolk
from Marseille, heavily settled with North African immigrants who
favor Tunisia.
	   After England scored its first goal, violence flared again.
Ripped-out seats flew from the Tunisian section. English thugs
slammed into their foes, as well as uninvolved people who fled for
safety. Riot police poured onto the beach.
	   A whiff of tear gas reached the stadium, one mile (1.6 kms)
away.
	   As the game ended, disconsolate Tunisians and Englishmen in
mixed moods headed off in similar directions. Some English fans
departed for Toulouse, where their team plays next, but others were
clearly spoiling for a fight.
	   Three men with bare chests, beer guts and bald heads slugged
back lager from long cans as they watched Tunisians walk past. One
glowered when asked if he expected trouble. ``We're here. They can
do whatever they want,'' he said, not giving his name.
	   ``It's the beer, isn't it,'' said Sharon Hyde, a London
policewoman on holiday, who like most English fans had no trouble.
She blamed the trouble on a few thugs who made a habit of wreaking
havoc when England played on the European continent.
	   Scotland Yard has sent specialists to help French police
identify known troublemakers, Hyde said. But the thugs' style was
to act like innocent funlovers until they found an opportunity to
smash things without police interference.
	   Although cameras focused the flareups, the predominant
atmosphere was more like a carnival. A skinny Englishman in a
Superman suit looked for tickets with a young woman in a bright
orange clown wig.
	   A beeping car rolled by, barely noticed by traffic police, with
seven balloon-festoned Tunisians on the hood, the top, and the
trunk. Tunisians danced wildly to drums in a gay swirl of red
flags.
	   Kamel Chaoi, a young Tunisian cook at the little port of Cassis,
was part of the flag-waving scooter swarm that rode back and forth
past English fans near the port Sunday night when the place
erupted.
	   ``They were looking for a fight, to do anything to make
trouble,'' he said. ``We were just trying to have a good time. I
believe in fair play, like the English are supposed to, and I just
came for the soccer.''
	   English fans who shunned the thugs said young local delinquents
kept prodding at the inebriated England supporters until they
reacted.
	   ``That was a stupid thing to do,'' said Gary Lazarus, a London
printer who lamented that ordinary Britons suffer for the faults of
a few. ``Everyone knows the reputation of English supporters.''

Indian state cracks down on kidney theft rackets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's most populous province declared
trade in human organs illegal Monday, a month after three top
surgeons of a state hospital were arrested for allegedly robbing
poor patients of kidneys and selling them to rich clients.
	   Shiva Kant Ojha, minister for medical education in the northern
Uttar Pradesh state, said a government order made unauthorized
transplants of organs an offense punishable with prison terms
ranging from two to seven years, Press Trust of India reported.
	   Three doctors of a private hospital in Gautam Budh Nagar, an
industrial town near Delhi, are currently in judicial custody after
being charged with paying agents to cruise shantytowns for
potential patients in a racket that involved several Indian states.
The unsuspecting donors were lured with promises of cash or jobs.
	   Senior local official Manoj Singh said the hospital carried out
the illegal operation with ease because a tough 1995 federal law
regulating organ transplants had not been ratified by the
government of Uttar Pradesh, among a string of other states.
	   Tuesday's government order could help crack down on similar
rackets in the state, officials said. Only hospitals registered for
organ transplants with the government will now be able to carry out
such operations.
	   In 1995, India's parliament passed a bill limiting organ
donations to close relatives and imposing prison terms of up to
seven years for selling an organ.
	   Those receiving the stolen kidneys typically pay about dlrs
6,000 to dlrs 10,000 for the kidney and the transplant operation,
according to the police.
	   Of that, the donor can get dlrs 1,000 _ more than one year's
salary for a rural Indian laborer.

	   JAKARTA (JP): A group of 10 armed robbers broke into a
businessman's house in Kelurahan Cipinang Besar Selatan in East
Jakarta Saturday morning and took away Rp 60 million (US$4,300) in
cash and a television set, a police officer said over the weekend.
	   Armed with machetes, sickles and a gun, the thieves wounded the
fruit wholesaler vendor Badrul, 30, in the head and tied up his
wife and their three children, according to the officer who asked
for anonymity.
	   In a report to the police, Badrul's wife said that the incident
at her family's house on Jl. Panca Warga IV occurred at about 3:30
a.m..
	   After securing the housewife and the three children, the
intruders pointed their weapons at Badrul and forced the
businessman to show them where he kept his cash and other
valuables, the officer said.
	   ``When he tried to resist, one of the burglars swung his sickle
onto Badrul's head,'' he said.
	   Badrul's wife admitted that she was unable to help her husband
until after the robbers had fled.
	   ``I had to wait until they were completely gone. I then screamed
for help and the neighbors started coming,'' she recalled.
	   Her husband is being treated at the Mitra Keluarga Hospital in
Jatinegara.
	   Duren Sawit police detectives are still investigating the case.
	   Beaten
	   A day earlier, a man was beaten to death by an angry mob after
allegedly trying to rob a woman in the early hours at the
Pulogadung inter-city bus station, also in East Jakarta.
	   The body was abandoned in the street and by the time the police
got there, the crowd had disappeared.
	   According to the supposed victim, identified as Sutinah, 26, the
man tried to grab her gold necklace just after she got off a bus at
around 3:15 a.m..
	   ``She screamed for help and people rushed to her and punched the
suspect.
	   He was dying when we took them to the police hospital in Kramat
Jati,'' said an officer at the Pulogadung police subprecinct.
	   After he died, the body of the alleged culprit was taken to
Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital for identification.

	   JAKARTA (JP): City councillors have criticized the
administrations of Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang and Bekasi over their
lack of political will to synchronize their development programs.
	   They said over the weekend that disharmony in the implementation
of programs by the four administrations would only hinder
development in the areas.
	   Ali Wongso Sinaga of the Golkar faction said Saturday that
political will was badly needed to help accommodate differences and
enable the administrations to achieve a balanced progress in
development.
	   He said political will can be translated into a single
management, ``which does not necessarily mean that the
administrations must merge into one. The point is they should be
willing to cooperate with each other.''
	   ``A united spatial plan is also needed because at the moment,
each administration has its own plan, which is made based on its
own conditions and concerns,'' he said.
	   Lukman F. Mokoginta of the Indonesian Democratic Party said
Saturday that the disharmony between the four administrations'
development programs had severely affected Jakarta.
	   ``Jakarta administration, for example, wants Bogor to function
mainly as a catchment but in reality, the latter continues
allocating some areas in Puncak and Bogor for housing,'' he said.
	   The elimination of catchments, especially in Bogor, would make
Jakarta prone to flooding, said Lukman.
	   He said that the government of Jakarta and West Java, which
administers Bogor, Bekasi and Tangerang, had actually formed the
Coordination Board in Development and Planning in 1973 in a bid to
synchronize the development in the four administration areas.
	   Lukman said the board focused its work on motivating the
administrations to coordinate their development programs,
especially on aspects which were considered essential, including
water resources, transportation, population and housing.
	   Saud Rahman of the United Development Party said the board,
however, had not functioned as well as expected.
	   ``The board has not functioned in the sense that it fails to
motivate the administrations to cooperate with each other whenever
they plan on some development projects,'' he said Friday.
	   The failure, however, was not dominantly due to the board's
capability, he said.
	   ``We feel that the administrations just don't have the good will
to cooperate with each other. They have different interests and do
not want to compromise,'' said Saud.
	   According to Lukman, the board did not have the legal authority
to oversee the administrations' development and planning programs
so that it would never be able to prevent one administration from
making programs which would affect another administration's
concern.
	   Ali said the central government, through the National
Development Planning Board (Bappenas), also formed a development
coordination board last year with the four administrations.
	   Under its establishment, he said, Bappenas was expected to
arbitrate any conflict of interest among the administrations.
	   The board was now working to complete the united spatial plan,
he said. ``Hopefully, it can be completed before 2000.''

	   BOGOR (JP): Hundreds of angry Sukamaju village residents in
Jonggol district here have severely damaged a house belonging to
the village head, who was believed to have been involved in corrupt
practices.
	   The residents threw stones at Andi Setiawan's house Thursday,
causing significant damage to the house and belongings inside.
	   No fatalities were reported during the incident.
	   Andi and his family fled as soon as they found out that the
residents were coming.
	   Local security officers managed to calm down the residents and
stop them from causing further damage.
	   The residents said they were disappointed by findings of a Bogor
regency team which declared that the village head was clean of
corruption. Most residents believe otherwise.
	   They accused Andi of corrupt practices, including shady
involvement in the construction of a butcher house, an elementary
school building and a road.
	   Regional inspector Fauzi Si'in, however, insisted that the
village head was not guilty of corruption.
	   ``It was just an administrative mistake. The village head has
yet to complete some administrative requirements,'' Fauzi was
quoted by Antara as saying.
	   Some residents, angry by the team's finding, immediately rushed
to the Jonggol district head to ask whether the findings could be
changed.
	   They later attacked Andi's house on Jl. Raya Jonggol after
receiving what they felt to be unsatisfactory answers from the
district head.
	   The district head had earlier sent a letter to Bogor regent Eddy
Yoso Martadipura to temporarily dismiss Andi while the
investigation was under way.
	   The residents, who used to be supporters of Andi, often
complained to him over his alleged wrongdoings but their complaints
were apparently ignored.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians in the battered
Serb province of Kosovo welcomed NATO's airborne show of force
Monday _ even though they couldn't see it _ and called for more.
	   Their reaction came amid a conspicuous silence by the Yugoslav
government concerning the West's military display. Serb forces,
however, responded with attacks Monday on four villages in western
Kosovo, using helicopters, grenades and heavy shelling, according
to the Albanians' Kosovo Information Center. The area is considered
a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``We salute what NATO's doing, but wish that they would come
into Kosovo, not just fly around,'' said Aziz Mazreku, a high
school gym teacher sipping tea at a cafe in Malisevo, 20 kilometers
(12 miles) from the Albanian border. ``That would put big pressure
on the Serbs.''
	   The bustling market town _ behind the lines controlled by the
ethnic Albanian militants fighting for independence from Serbia _
already seems like a separate territory.
	   Gunmen from the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army walk around
openly, greeted by an occasional salute from grizzled old men in
domed white fezes. A man standing on a wheelbarrow was covering the
Cyrillic lettering of the Serbian street signs with yellow paint.
Albanian is the only language spoken.
	   But just up the road a few kilometers (miles), Serb forces
massed at roadblocks and positioned their heavy guns and armored
personnel carriers up in the hills.
	   The NATO exercise was meant to convince Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that the West was serious about its demand for
him to change his hard-line policy against the insurgents, which
has sent tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing
their homes in villages such as Komorane, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
west of the provincial capital of Pristina.
	   The streets were empty except for Serb police and stray animals
after a Serb attack a few days ago. The burnt-out shell of a truck
was crumpled on the side of the road. Windows were smashed and
stores looted. Walls of houses were covered with freshly painted
Serb nationalist graffiti. A dead dog lay splayed out on the
street. Other dogs gnawed at the carcass of a dead cow just outside
town.
	   In Pristina, opinion among Kosovo Serbs was divided. Some were
devoted to the fight to hold on to the province, considered part of
Serbia's historic heartland.
	   ``Let NATO come, let just a single plane fly over our skies _
we'll all be up to our knees in blood,'' said unemployed Biljana
Mitrovic, 30.
	   Others were ready to quit.
	   ``I simply don't care. If this keeps on much longer, I'll pack
up my stuff and move to Serbia,'' said Branko Rakic, a clerk in a
state-owned company.
	   Mahmut Bakali, a member of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating
team set up to talk with Serbian authorities, said he hoped
Milosevic would heed NATO's warning so that ``serious negotiations
on the status of Kosovo can begin.''
	   But at the Express Cafe in Malisevo, residents held out little
hope for a negotiated settlement. While they say they continue to
respect their elected leader, Ibrahim Rugova, they say the KLA
calls the shots now _ at least in their town.
	   ``We are very determined about the war,'' said Mazreku. ``We are
fighting for our rights. We want independence.''
	   But despite its stepped-up attacks on Serb forces, the militants
remain for the most part an unknown quotient. Some drive around in
fancy all-terrain vehicles, carrying automatic weapons and fancy
walkie-talkies. Others ride in hay carts pulled by tractors,
holding onto decades-old rifles. Some wear fancy new camouflage,
others rag-tag uniforms with sewn-on patches.
	   None of the KLA fighters would agree to be interviewed. The
shadowy group named a spokesman last week, but he has yet to make
any public statement.

WIMBLEDON: women's seeds.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   As expected, four-time champion and defending titlist Pete
Sampras was seeded No. 1 among the men, while defending champ
Martina Hingis was No. 1 among the women.
	   The Wimbledon seeding committee stayed with the men's rankings
for the first seven players, with Sampras followed by Marcelo Rios,
Petr Korda, Greg Rusedski, Carlos Moya, Patrick Rafter and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov.
	   Rusedski, who sprained ankle ligaments last week at the Queen's
Club tournament, is questionable for Wimbledon.
	   Cedric Pioline, last year's losing finalist, was bumped up two
places to No. 8 seed, while 1996 champion Richard Krajicek moved up
three places to No. 9.
	   Alex Corretja, a Spanish clay-court expert who lost to Moya in
last month's French Open final, was seeded No. 10 _ two places
below his world ranking.
	   Agassi, who tumbled out of the top 100 earlier this year, has
shot back up the rankings in recent months and was rewarded with
the No. 13 seeding. Agassi's form is uncertain, however, after his
first-round loss at the French Open.
	   The Wimbledon committee also did a big favor for Goran
Ivanisevic, a two-time finalist who has dropped to No. 24, by
seeding him at No. 14.
	   The biggest casualty was Michael Chang, who was unseeded despite
his No. 14 ranking. Chang lost in the first round at Wimbledon the
past two years and has never advanced past the fourth round.
	   Britain's Tim Henman, ranked No. 17, was seeded No. 12. Alberto
Costa, ranked No. 15, was unseeded, while fellow Spaniard Alberto
Berasategui (16) has not entered.
	   On the women's side, Wimbledon stayed with the rankings, except
in the case of Graf.
	   The German, who underwent reconstructive knee surgery a year ago
and missed Wimbledon, dropped out of the WTA Tour rankings on June
1 after playing only two tournaments in the space of a year.
	   However, Graf re-entered the rankings this week at No. 91 after
reaching the semifinals of the DFS Classic in Birmingham. The
tournament was abandoned Monday due to rain.
	   Graf is seeded behind Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and Jana
Novotna. After Graf comes Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Monica Seles and
Venus Williams. Anna Kournikova is seeded No. 12.
	   The Wimbledon draw is set for Tuesday, with the tournament
starting next Monday.

World Cup: Pele is scathing of fans, coaches, players _ but it's
</HEADLINE>
still a beautiful game &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Happy anniversary, Pele.
	   Forty years to the day since he made his World Cup debut and
began an international career that made him the most loved player
in history of soccer, Pele said he still sees good things in what
he calls ``the beautiful game''.
	   ``Thankfully we have a lot of teams who are prepared to play
open football,'' the Brazilian star said Monday on the fifth day of
the World Cup.
	   ``We have seen a lot of goals, which is good for the fans and
for the game. People go to see goals and it's great that we have
seen some surprises.''
	   But Pele, one of the game's greatest ambassadors whose on-field
manner also was impeccable, is mindful of the darker side of the
game.
	   He said he was disgusted at the sight of violent English and
Tunisian fans brawling in Marseille, was scathing of mercenary
players who jump from one club to another for a few dollars more
and of coaches who drive the talent out of teen-age players before
they've had the chance to shine.
	   ``What these fans are doing is that they come to a game to
fight, to cause trouble, to make war. This is disgusting,'' Pele
told The Associated Press.
	   ``The security, the police, should act quickly to put these
people in jail as an example to others because, until now we have
had a good World Cup with a lot of goals and a very happy
competition.''
	   Pele said some of the coaches and players riled him too.
	   ``What disappoints me the most is the modern way of preparing
teams,'' he said. ``Many of the big coaches are afraid to play the
beautiful game.
	   ``The most important thing for them isn't to play to win but to
play not to lose.
	   ``You see it starting among the youth teams. If a player of 15,
16 or 17 makes one slight movement the coach doesn't like, then
he's taken off. It's disheartening for the youngster and you create
a negative mentality even at that age.''
	   It wasn't that way when Pele went out as a free spirit at age 17
to start a World Cup career that won the hearts of fans all over
the world.
	   Called up by Brazil in its third first-round game on June 15,
1958, Pele hit the bar after only two minutes against the Soviet
Union in a 2-0 victory. He went on to score three times in the
final as Brazil overwhelmed Sweden 5-2.
	   He was on the Brazil team that successfully defended the title
in 1962 but was forced out of the 1966 tournament through injuries
caused by cynically fouling rough defenders.
	   Then he returned at age 29 for perhaps his finest show of all _
a spectacular series of performances in the 1970 World Cup, when
probably the finest Brazilian team ever defeated Italy 4-1 in the
final in Mexico.
	   After a successful spell with the New York Cosmos in the North
American Soccer League, Pele, who scored more than 1,000 goals as a
pro, retired in the late 1970s to become a businessman then later a
politician.
	   Now Brazil's Sports Minister and in Paris as official spokesman
for World Cup sponsor MasterCard, Pele likes to be reminded that it
was 40 years ago that he made his storybook World Cup debut.
	   ``Yes, but I don't look so old, do I?'' said Pele, now age 57.
	   ``It is incredible how different the World Cup is now than in my
first tournament. Do you know there are two billion people watching
it on TV now and now we have 32 teams taking part instead of 16
when I made my debut?
	   ``Because the game gets so much exposure on TV, the players are
paid a lot more now and that's a good thing because their careers
don't go on forever.
	   ``If you're a lawyer or a doctor you can go on until you are 70.
Not so a soccer player.''
	   Pele spent his entire 20-year career with just two clubs:
Brazil's Santos or the NASL's Cosmos. He doesn't like the way
players switch teams so readily today.
	   ``There are some players who are too mercenary. They will play a
tournament for one team and, for dlrs 10 more, they go to another.
	   ``I think that's a bad way to behave.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Justice Muladi said Saturday that
there had been no request from authorities to stop former president
Soeharto from traveling overseas.
	   ``The immigration office only waits for requests. Up to now,
there has been no request to impose a travel ban against Mr.
Soeharto,'' Muladi told reporters after attending the installment
ceremony of Supreme Advisory Council members at the State Palace on
Saturday.
	   The Attorney General's Office, the Ministry of Finance and the
Armed Forces Headquarters all have the power to request travel bans
which are administered by the immigration office.
	   Soeharto and his family have been the focus of public criticism
since he stepped down from the presidency on May 21. Many have been
demanding that a thorough investigation be conducted against him
for allegedly abusing his power to advance his family's business
interests.
	   The Attorney General's Office recently formed a team to
investigate the wealth officials earned during Soeharto's rule.
	   Despite calls that the government take steps to ensure that
Soeharto and his family do not flee, Muladi said he was confident
Soeharto would stay in Indonesia.
	   ``I am certain Soeharto will not go overseas. Just look at his
biography, which is full of his fighting spirit for the country,''
he said.
	   Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said Friday that
Soeharto had hired Yohanes Yacob, a relatively unknown lawyer, as
his legal council.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Political analyst Amien Rais has predicted the
three major political organizations -- Golkar, the United
Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
-- which have dominated the political scene for years will soon
disappear.
	   Speaking at a discussion titled Political Parties in the
post-Reform Era, here, Amien expressed his belief that those
contesting the next polls will all be new parties.
	   ``I am almost sure that the three political organizations will
disintegrate in line with the end of Soeharto's leadership era, he
said.
	   ``None of them will be able to regain the people's trust
anymore,'' he explained during the discussion hosted by the
Indonesian Council of Islamic Propagation Saturday.
	   For nearly three decades the government has kept a tight reign
on political activities and only recognizes Golkar, PPP and PDI as
poll contestants.
	   But since the resignation of former president Soeharto, the
government has loosened its gripped and allowed people to form
political parties at will.
	   President B.J. Habibie has indicated that polls will be held in
May.
	   A team of experts is currently drafting a revision of three
political laws, including a law on political parties, which is
expected to be the guideline for political organizations in the
future.
	   The growth of these new political parties and atmosphere of
political openness is expected to wither the strong political hold
of the three major political organizations.
	   Amien is one of the leading proponents of a speedy election,
repeatedly asserting that Habibie's is merely a transitional
government.
	   Pointing to the leadership crux engulfing Golkar, Amien said the
dominant organization, which was one of Soeharto's bedrock
supporters, would not be able to regain its past glory as its
leading figures are simply not trusted by the people.
	   ``Names, like chairman Harmoko, and deputies, like Abdul Gafur
or Siti Hardijanti Rukmana are not saleable.
	   ``Even former vice president Try Sutrisno and former minister of
defense and security Edy Sudradjat will find it difficult to
restore Golkar's past supremacy,'' he said.
	   Golkar is holding an extraordinary congress next month as more
and more regional factions call for Harmoko to be replaced.
	   The names of Try and Edy have been cited as possible candidates
for the chairmanship.
	   Golkar is also under threat of disintegration as major allies,
such as the Musyawarah Kekeluargaan Gotong Royong have broken ranks
and established separate political parties.
	   Speaking of PPP, Amien said the Moslem-oriented party is facing
a similar threat of decay, especially after one of its four
components, the Syarikat Islam (SI), announced its independence and
established its own party, the Indonesian Syarikat Islam Party
(PSII), which was an old name of SI.
	   He said PPP would find it difficult to compete with PSII and
other Moslem-oriented parties which might emerge in the near
future.
	   ``PPP even invited me to join it,'' he said noting their sense
of desperation.
	   ``Yet, I still find it hard to join a party which colluded with
other political elements for Soeharto's renomination and reelection
in last March's General Session of the People's Consultative
Assembly.''
	   Soeharto was unanimously reelected for a seventh consecutive
term in the Assembly's March 10 session. Golkar, PPP and the PDI
all gave his reelection their full support.
	   Turning his attention to PDI, Amien maintained that it was
obvious that the current government-recognized leadership would not
be able to gain any popular support.
	   Soerjadi ousted Megawati Soekarnoputri from the PDI chair in a
government-backed congress in 1996.
	   Megawati and her supporters have remained defiant and continued
to challenge Soerjadi despite the government's disapproval.
	   ``Megawati now has her own faction with a line of railway cars
behind her,'' Amien said.
	   Soerjadi's PDI board was extremely unpopular, even among the
party's traditional supporters, and only secured 11 House of
Representatives seats in the 1997 general election, the worst
showing in its history. PDI won 62 seats in the 1992 general
election.
	   Moslems
	   Referring to suggestions that a Moslem party be formed, Amien
called for such a temptation to be resisted.
	   He argued that it would not be a viable way to gain a
substantial percentage of the vote to become a dominant force.
	   ``A Moslem-based political party will only obtain a maximum of
20-percent of the votes in the general election. This is not
powerful enough for a presidential election,'' he said.
	   ``I suggest the Moslem community establishes an open party,
which allows the non-Moslem community to join,'' he added.
	   Amien further argued that there should not be any limitation on
the number of political parties contesting the general elections.
	   ``Let the people decide which political parties are the best,''
he said.
	   Asked to comment on Habibie's statement that he might not run in
the next election, Amien described him as ``noble'' for making such
a declaration.
	   ``It's difficult for us to find such a state leader, who has
been in office just for a few weeks but is already unwilling to be
nominated in the election,'' he told reporters.
	   He quipped that Habibie might be different from his predecessor,
Soeharto, who repeatedly declined to be renominated, but later
repeatedly agreed to be renominated.
	   ``I believe that pak Habibie honestly told the truth. He was not
playing cosmetic politics,'' he said.
	   Habibie said during a meeting with members of the Indonesian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry Thursday that his mission was only
to deliver a democratically elected government to the nation and
not to be reelected president.

Turkey uncovers missile carriers aboard Maltese ship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with ship being allowed to leave, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GELIBOLU, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish authorities allowed a
Maltese-flagged cargo ship to continue on its course after stopping
and searching it on suspicion that it was carrying parts for
Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles destined for Cyprus.
	   The semi-official Anatolia news said authorities found seven
mobile missile launching pads aboard the Natasha-1, which was
stopped Sunday evening at the mouth of the Dardanelles Strait,
linking the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.
	   ``The search has been completed. The ship has been given
permission to leave,'' said State Minister Sukru Sina Gurel, after
a regular Cabinet meeting.
	   It was not clear if the missile pads were destined for Cyprus.
The ship, coming from Russia, had declared its cargo as tractors
and cars for Egypt.
	   Gurel, without being specific, said the ship was carrying ``some
weapons parts.'' He said the ship was allowed to leave because of
an international agreement that allows free passage through the
Turkish straits during peacetime.
	   ``Our government has taken the necessary precautions for extra
military measures in the event of their deployment,'' Gurel said.
	   Turkey has vowed to take military action if the missiles are
installed by the Greek Cypriots, claiming they are a threat to
Turkish Cypriots in the north and Turkey itself. Cyprus claims the
missiles are merely defensive.

Russia to replace Vietnamese planes destroyed in cargo plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will replace two fighter planes being
exported to Vietnam when they were destroyed in the crash of a
cargo plane, a news agency reported Monday.
	   The Su-27s were on a huge An-124 military transport jet that
crashed into a five-story apartment building in the Siberian city
of Irkutsk last year, turning it into a fireball as 100 tons of
fuel on board the plane exploded. Sixty-five people died.
	   The Interfax news agency said the two replacement fighter planes
have been tested and are ready to be sent to Vietnam.

	   But Nigeria's best known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not mentioned in the statement from
David Atta, the press secretary for Nigeria's new military leader,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the release of some detainees and
prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation and
reconstruction,'' Atta said.
	   Abubakar came to power a little less than a week ago, following
the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose five-year-dictatorship became
an international pariah for its human rights record.

Leader of German Jewish community honored at Israel's parliament

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The outspoken leader of Germany's Jewish
community, Ignatz Bubis, was honored Monday at a ceremony in
Israel's parliament for his commitment to Israel and Germany's
Jewish community life.
	   Bubis, 71 is president of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany. He received the 1998 Israel Goldstein award from Keren
Hayesod, an Israeli-Jewish fundraising organization, for his
``vocal advocacy on behalf of the Jews in Germany, for his
insistence that Germany never forget the burden of its history, and
for his unflagging efforts for the sake of the Jewish people, in
its dispersion and in its eternal homeland,'' the award citation
read.
	   ``We are not forgetting that our roots are in Jerusalem,'' an
emotional Bubis told 200 guests including Knesset Speaker Dan
Tichon, Germany's ambassador to Israel.
	   During the 1970's and 1980's, Bubis received international
prominence for his effective response to thinly-disguised
anti-Semitic attacks against Jewish businesses and social
activities in Germany. He has served as president of Frankfurt's
Jewish community almost continually since 1978, and has been
President of the Central Board of the Jews in Germany since 1992.
	   ``In Germany, Bubis is resolute in his efforts to assure that
the Germans know their history,'' Tichon said in a speech at the
ceremony.
	   In 1933, the year Adolf Hitler took power, about 500,000 Jews
lived in Germany, according to the German encyclopedia but most
were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust along with six
million of Europe's Jews. Today some 60,000 Jews live in Germany,
many of whom are immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
	   Bubis said he planned to serve his Jewish community for many
more years and made a wish of peace for Israel.
	   ``I wish the peace process will continue for peace in the
country and in the area, which is very important for all Jews,''he
said.
	   Last year's recipient of award, named for Dr. Israel Goldstein,
who served as World Chairman of Keren Hayesod between 1961 to 1971,
was Julie Loschitzky, a leader of the Canadian Jewish community.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Reports on escalating antigovernment protests will
likely put more pressure on the country's already ailing financial
market this week.
	   Securities analysts have said that at this stage, a fresh
disbursement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would do
little to help the economy.
	   The head of research at Mashill Jaya Securities, Tjandra
Kartika, said that continued antigovernment protests would negate
the country's painstaking efforts to heal its tattered economy.
	   ``How can we expect foreign investors to have confidence in our
recovery if political protests like this continue to take place?''
he asked.
	   Some 1,000 East Timor students rallied Saturday against the
government in the provincial capital of Dili and called for a
referendum on self-determination, following similar protests in
Jakarta the previous day.
	   Several groups of students also staged protests last week
demanding the government eliminate corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
	   Concern over the country's unresolved political uncertainties
are casting a shadow on trading activities despite encouraging
signals from the IMF that it will release a new disbursement from
its bailout package.
	   An economist with Danareksa Sekuritas, Raden Pardede, said the
anticipation of a new IMF disbursement would, in a normal
situation, have improved market sentiment.
	   ``Now, such an expectation is very much overshadowed by the
country's unresolved political uncertainties,'' he said.
	   The IMF director for Asia and the Pacific said here last week
that the IMF would speed up the disbursement to help the country's
ailing economy.
	   Tjandra said investors were also disappointed over the worsening
performance of the country's major companies.
	   Most local companies are already too weak to even pay the
interest on their overseas debts because the amount of their
foreign debts have more than tripled in rupiah terms.
	   The rupiah has plunged more than 80 percent against the U.S.
dollar since July last year.
	   Tjandra said the capital market's short- and long-term prospects
largely depended on the direction of the rupiah, which is predicted
to further weaken in the coming days.
	   ``I think there is no sign that the rupiah will strengthen
against the dollar during this political uncertainty,'' Tjandra
said.
	   The rupiah closed at 14,000 to the U.S. dollar Friday, down from
its close at 11,550 the previous week.
	   Trading activity in the local bourse is predicted to remain
dormant with most foreign brokerage firms likely to continue
discarding their stocks linked to Soeharto's family and his
cronies.
	   ``Investors fear that stocks of companies linked to Soeharto's
family and his cronies will be worthless,'' a broker with Bali
Securities said.
	   The JSX Composite Index fell slightly to 408.37 points last week
from 409.51 the previous week
	   The average daily turnover also slid 23 percent to 231.75
million shares on the regular market from 304.59 million shares the
previous week.
	   The average daily transaction also fell 28 percent to Rp 238.83
billion (US$17.05 million) last week from Rp 332.87 billion the
previous week.

were missing after they were swept off their boat by raging waters
on a river in Ecuador's Amazon jungle, police said Monday.
	   Gilde Van Hevel, 31, died, and Bruno Ball, 36, Haerenns Anous,

river boat capsized on the Pastaza River, 75 miles (120 kms) south
of Quito, a police news release said.
	   No survivors have been found, but rescuers were continuing the
search, police said.
	   The boat was tossed by a strong current, police said.
	   The Pastaza River is located near the town of Banos, a center
for travelers seeking ecotourism trips to the Amazon jungle.

NATO-led peace force arrests Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peace force
arrested a Bosnian Serb suspected of committing war crimes while
running a detention facility in eastern Bosnia, NATO officials said
Monday.
	   Milorad Krnojelac, a captain in the former Yugoslav army, was a
commander at the infamous Foca prison, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southeast of Sarajevo, between April 1992 and August 1993, NATO
said in a press release.
	   Maj. Sheena Thomson, a NATO spokeswoman, said the peace force
arrested Krnojelac without incident around 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday
in Foca.
	   Several thousand people gathered in Foca on Monday to protest
the arrest, including teachers and students from the school where
he is headmaster, according to the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said in a statement that
German and French troops were involved in the arrest.
	   The NATO press release said Krnojelac surrendered to soldiers
when it was clear his ``attempts to evade (authorities) were at an
end.'' The arrest ``resulted from opportunities that developed
recently'' when peacekeepers confirmed Krnojelac's identity and
location.
	   ``He is charged with permitting prolonged torture and beatings,
countless killings and forced labor practices,'' the press release
said.
	   The Hague tribunal accused Krnojelac of being present during the
separation and segregation of non-Serb detainees, for ``providing
inhumane conditions'' in the Foca prison, as well as for assisting
in the deportation of Muslims, who made up the majority of the
population in Foca, the press release said.
	   Krnojelac is among an unknown number of war crimes suspects
contained on a secret list of indictees compiled by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. In addition, the names
of 75 Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim indictees have been released.
	   Ruehe said the arrest of war crimes suspects is vital. ``War
criminals who are still at large not only hinder implementation of
the peace accord but block reconciliation among the former
combatants, undermine credibility of the international tribunal and
awake calls of vengeance from victims.''
	   Thomson said that immediately after the arrest, NATO took
Krnojelac to The Hague. He is to be arraigned there on Thursday.
	   So far, the peace force has arrested nine war-crimes suspects,
most of them Bosnian Serbs.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that the job of bringing
stability to Bosnia is incomplete, the Security Council was meeting
Monday to approve a one-year extension of the NATO-led peacekeeping
force and the separate U.N. civilian mission there.
	   Council members adjourned their meeting after about an hour
Monday but were to resume at 3:15 p.m. (1915 GMT). A vote was
expected during the afternoon session.
	   The 15 members were voting on a resolution to extend the
mandates of the two missions until June 21, 1999. Their current
mandates expire at the end of this month.
	   ``Regardless of all the progress in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
preconditions for durable and sustainable peace have not yet been
firmly put into place,'' German Ambassador Antonius Eitel told the
council. ``It is our historic responsibility before the people of
Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain fully focused on the goal of lasting
peace in that country which has suffered so much.''
	   Germany is not a council member but wields considerable
influence over international policy in the Balkans as a member of
the six-nation ``Contact Group'' which coordinates diplomatic
efforts there.
	   Others in the Contact Group include the United States, Russia,
France, Britain and Italy.
	   Last month, NATO agreed to maintain its troops in Bosnia for
another year to continue overseeing the 1995 Dayton Peace Accord,
which ended the 3 1/2-year conflict there.
	   Security Council approval provides a legal basis for the
operation under international law. The United Nations handed over
peacekeeping responsibilities to the alliance after the Dayton
agreement.
	   But the United Nations maintains a mission in Bosnia to oversee
the civilian components of the pact, including the return of
refugees and the building of institutions governing the Bosnian
Serb portion of the country and parts administered by the
Muslim-Croat Federation.
	   The U.N. mission includes about 2,000 civilian police who train
and monitor officers from the Serb, Muslim and Croat communities.
	   Speaking for the European Union, Britain's U.N. ambassador, John
Weston, said the continued presence of the U.N. and NATO forces was
part of the European goal of seeing ``a democratic, prosperous
Bosnia taking its place as a modern nation in Europe.
	   ``The message to the people of Bosnia is clear: Such a future is
within their grasp provided they continue to make good progress on
the Dayton road, leaving the violence and ethnic hatred of recent
years behind them,'' Weston said.
	   NATO currently maintains about 34,000 troops in Bosnia, down
from an original 60,000 deployed there in December 1995.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Many crude palm oil (CPO) producers have not been
supporting the government's program to stabilize cooking oil prices
in the domestic market.
	   An official of the government-sponsored Joint Marketing Office
(KPB), which handles the marketing of farm products produced by
state-owned plantation companies, said that many CPO producers
still preferred exporting their produce despite a 40 percent export
tax.
	   ``This has hurt the government's program to stabilize cooking
oil prices at home,'' the official, who asked for anonymity, said.
	   He said KPB had urged producers to sell their produce at home,
but that CPO was still being exported in large quantities.
	   CPO is the main raw material in cooking oil production.
	   The official named several big producers, including PT Darmex,
PD Kemajuan, Inti Boga Sejahtera of the Salim Group, SMART of the
Sinar Mas Group, Asean Agro and Hasil Kesatuan, as companies which
still preferred to sell their produce overseas.
	   He said the international price of CPO was currently much higher
than domestic prices, a fact that drew many companies to export
their produce despite the high export tax.
	   Last month, Minister of Trade and Industry Rahardi Ramelan
ordered KPB to buy all cooking oil from the Association of
Indonesian Edible Oil Industries (AIMMI) and sell it directly to
market retail cooperatives (Inkoppas) in Jakarta at Rp 3,500 per
kilogram.
	   The cooperatives would then sell cooking oil at city markets for
no more than Rp 4,000 per kg. Private producers are allowed to sell
directly to retailers at Rp 3,500 per kg.
	   The measure, effective May 27, replaced a system under which the
marketing office and plantation firms had to sell CPO to the State
Logistics Agency (Bulog). The agency is notorious for its
inefficiency and lack of transparency in its distribution network.
	   Bulog sold CPO to several appointed refineries to be processed
into cooking oil before buying it back as a finished product and
distributing it on the domestic market.
	   KPB data shows that the office supplied 16,267 tons of cooking
oil to the domestic market in the May 27 to June 11 period. It
sells 300 metric tons to 500 tons of cooking oil per day, which is
mostly distributed to Inkoppas, retailers and workers'
cooperatives.
	   The official said that until last week, KPB had only supplied
cooking oil to Inkoppas, but that since the cooperatives were
incapable of influencing the market price because their
distribution capacity was a mere 50 tons a day, it was also selling
cooking oil to other retailers.
	   Inkoppas do not have a sufficiently large cash flow to be able
to keep a large volume of cooking oil on hand for a long period of
time, he said.
	   The Cooking Oil Distributors Forum urged private cooking oil
producers to sell their produce locally, saying that KPB's efforts
to stabilize the cooking oil price would not succeed if it was not
supported by private producers.
	   Forum secretary Karebet said cooking oil prices would go up
again if private companies refused to sell their products on the
domestic market.
	   ``I fear that cooking oil prices will soar again if private
companies don't help, especially because KPB's distribution is not
running smoothly,'' Karebet said.
	   He said that cooking oil distribution from KPB's stock to
Inkoppas and retailers was often delayed for days, causing a
scarcity of cooking oil on the market.
	   But he admitted that KPB had been able to force down cooking oil
prices to the Rp 4,000 to Rp 4,400 per kg range from a previous
price of Rp 6,000 per kg.
	   Earlier reports quoted trade sources as saying that using KPB to
stabilize cooking oil prices was no use because some KPB officials
were allegedly involved in collusive practices with several giant
cooking oil producers.

Agassi, Graf get boost in Wimbledon seeding list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Former champions Andre Agassi and
Steffi Graf were the main beneficiaries Monday when the seedings
for Wimbledon were announced.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion, was seeded No. 13 _ six spots higher
than his world ranking of 19.
	   Graf, the seven-time champion who has dropped to No. 91 while
recovering from injury, was seeded No. 4.
	   Wimbledon is the only of the four Grand Slam tournaments which
reserves the right to deviate from the world rankings in its
seedings.
	   The All England Club takes into account a player's grass-court
expertise and past record at Wimbledon in determing the 16 men's
and women's seeds.
	   As expected, four-time champion and defending titlist Pete
Sampras was seeded No. 1 among the men, while defending champ
Martina Hingis was No. 1 among the women.
	   The Wimbledon seeding committee stayed with the men's rankings
for the first seven players, with Sampras followed by Marcelo Rios,
Petr Korda, Greg Rusedski, Carlos Moya, Patrick Rafter and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov.
	   Rusedski, who sprained ankle ligaments last week at the Queen's
Club tournament, is questionable for Wimbledon.
	   Cedric Pioline, last year's losing finalist, was bumped up two
places to No. 8 seed, while 1996 champion Richard Krajicek moved up
three places to No. 9.
	   Alex Corretja, a Spanish clay-court expert who lost to Moya in
last month's French Open final, was seeded No. 10 _ two places
below his world ranking.
	   Agassi, who tumbled out of the top 100 earlier this year, has
shot back up the rankings in recent months and was rewarded with
the No. 13 seeding. Agassi's form is uncertain, however, after his
first-round loss at the French Open.
	   The Wimbledon committee also did a big favor for Goran
Ivanisevic, a two-time finalist who has dropped to No. 24, by
seeding him at No. 14.
	   The biggest casualty was Michael Chang, who was unseeded despite
his No. 14 ranking. Chang lost in the first round at Wimbledon the
past two years and has never advanced past the fourth round.
	   Britain's Tim Henman, ranked No. 17, was seeded No. 12. Albert
Costa, ranked No. 15, was unseeded, while fellow Spaniard Alberto
Berasategui (16) has not entered.
	   On the women's side, Wimbledon stayed with the rankings, except
in the case of Graf.
	   The German, who underwent reconstructive knee surgery a year ago
and missed Wimbledon, dropped out of the WTA Tour rankings on June
1 after playing only two tournaments in the space of a year.
	   However, Graf re-entered the rankings this week at No. 91 after
reaching the semifinals of the DFS Classic in Birmingham. The
tournament was abandoned Monday due to rain.
	   Graf is seeded behind Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and Jana
Novotna. After Graf comes Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Monica Seles and

	   JAKARTA (JP): Indonesia must continue with its program to
privatize state enterprises and secure badly needed foreign
exchange, despite worries over the lack of transparency in the sale
of steel maker PT Krakatau Steel.
	   Former finance minister Mar'ie Muhammad said the Krakatau case
should not affect the privatization program.
	   Proceeds from the privatization program would help to finance
the 1998/1999 state budget, which has been badly affected by the
plunge in the value of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar, he said.
	   ``If we can secure US$2 billion from the privatization program
then that would be a very meaningful contribution to the budget,''
he told journalists on Friday.
	   The government plans to sell 12 state-owned companies in the
current fiscal year and hopes to raise Rp 15 trillion ($1.2
billion) by doing so.
	   Mar'ie explained that the sharp depreciation in the rupiah had
considerably inflated planned expenditure. The budget has allocated
trillions of rupiah to subsidize the import of essential food
items.
	   ``Proceeds from privatizations can be used to cover some of the
budget deficit,'' he said, adding that the deficit would be further
worsened by last week's plunge in the rupiah, which surpassed Rp
15,000 to the dollar last week.
	   He stressed that the privatization process must be transparent
and arranged in a way that ensured no company could ``steal a
march'' in the competition to acquire state assets.
	   State Minister for the Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri
Abeng was recently accused of quietly trying to sell PT Krakatau
Steel to Netherlands-based Ispat International.
	   Infuriated
	   The House of Representatives was infuriated by press reports of
the accusations which quoted Krakatau's management.
	   Although Tanri later explained that it was not a final deal but
part of the early stages of a 12 steps process which includes
competitive bidding, some observers suspect that Ispat was trying
to steal an early start in the competition.
	   Ispat's local partner is a company related to the former first
family.
	   Despite Tanri's explanation, some House members urged the
government to cancel the privatization program.
	   Tanri said the government would not cancel the memorandum of
understanding signed with Ispat chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal on May
7, unless Ispat, which is listed as a bluechip company on the New
York Stock Exchange, failed to undertake a due diligence process
within 60 days of signing the memorandum.
	   He also said that investment bank Salomon Smith Barney, which
had been appointed to advise the government over the sale, would
soon invite 12 foreign steel companies to submit competitive bids
for PT Krakatau.
	   The government has appointed nine overseas investment banks
including Salomon to assist in the privatization process.
	   Tanri indicated that strategic foreign investors would be given
a say in the management of the state-owned companies.
	   This may explain why some bureaucrats have been trying hard to
thwart the privatization program, because for a long time they have
used the state companies as personal cash cows, one analyst said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic came to
Moscow on Monday in search of a sympathetic ear from someone who
shares his intense resentment of NATO.
	   He was expected to get that _ and no more _ from Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, whose own defense minister dressed down
the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff earlier in the day
over NATO exercises near Kosovo.
	   Although Yeltsin disagrees with NATO over its handling of the
Kosovo crisis, he is expected to join the Western powers in
criticizing the heavy hand Milosevic has used in putting down an
ethnic Albanian uprising in the Serb province.
	   Arriving late Monday, Milosevic refused to comment to reporters
on the NATO exercises that began earlier in the day. They are aimed
at intimidating him into backing off from the troubled province.
	   The good news for Milosevic was that Russia's longstanding
suspicion of NATO boiled over into anger earlier Monday when
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev complained that NATO had failed to
consult with Moscow when it planned its air exercises over the
Balkans.
	   Sergeyev publicly rebuked Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was arriving for a week of
travel and consultations in Russia.
	   Sergeyev said he had met with Shelton, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen and top NATO officials in Brussels on Friday.
	   ``We specifically underlined the need to find a political
solution, and then, all of a sudden, I find out the next morning
that the exercises are being launched,'' Sergeyev complained.
	   NATO planes began maneuvers Monday over Albania and Macedonia,
both of which border on Kosovo. The exercise included 80 planes
from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries.
	   Shelton responded that NATO officials had fully informed
Sergeyev that it was planning the exercises, but might have failed
to tell him precisely when they would begin.
	   ``I personally do not know whether he was informed or not
informed as to the exact time,'' Shelton said.
	   The upbraiding was reminiscent of Sergeyev's treatment of Cohen
in February. The U.S. defense secretary arrived in Moscow to a
tongue-lashing by Sergeyev over weapons inspections in Iraq.
	   Shelton stressed that his talks with Sergeyev had otherwise been
``cordial.''
	   ``I have found more agreements, in terms of what needs to happen
in Kosovo, than I have found disagreements,'' the general said.
``We all agree that the violence must stop, that there must be a
cease-fire, that the diplomatic solution would be preferred. There
is some difference, I think, in terms of exactly the technique that
you might use to go about that.''
	   That difference is significant. Russia opposes even a show of
force in Serbia at this point, while Shelton said NATO had sent its
warplanes into the region ``to project power'' and send a signal to
Milosevic.
	   Still, while Milosevic might feel at home amid Russia's
NATO-bashing, he probably isn't going to hear any support for his
policies in Kosovo, even if Russia agrees that Albanian separatists
are partially to blame.
	   ``I don't think he can expect much from the Russians except that
they'll continue to refuse to go along with NATO and single out the
Serbs,'' said one Western official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``There's not much more he can get out of the
Russians.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): The government has announced that it will set up a
distribution center to ease the backlog of undistributed goods
which has built up following last months riots.
	   The center, to be established and run by the Ministry of Trade
and Industry, will ensure that basic supplies reach retail outlets.
	   The planned establishment of a distribution center was announced
by Minister of Industry and Trade Rahardi Ramelan during a hearing
at the House of representatives last Wednesday.
	   ``Distribution is spearheaded by retailers. The riots therefore
damaged our distribution network,'' he told members of House
Commission V for industry at the Wednesday hearing.
	   Rahardi said the ministry would use warehouses belonging to the
State Logistics Agency (Bulog) to store supplies, and would charge
state-owned trading firms with running the center.
	   Multinational producers of consumer goods such as Unilever and
Proctor and Gamble agreed to distribute their products through the
center when they met with the minister on Friday.
	   Others companies, including shoe producer PT Sepatu Bata,
retailer ALatief Corp and some textile companies, also expressed
their readiness to cooperate with the center during the Friday
meeting.
	   ``The companies are ready to supply their products to the
distribution center, which will sell the goods to retailers,''
Sujata, director general of farm and forestry products in the
ministry, told reporters after the meeting on Friday.
	   Sujata said the distribution center would mend links between
producers and retailers which were severed during last-month's
riots.
	   It would also lead to lower prices, he said, because it would
simplify the process of distributing goods.
	   Currently supplies go from main distributors to distributors to
sub-distributors, agents and then retailers.
	   During the riots, many shops and distribution outlets belonging
to Chinese-Indonesians were looted and burned. Chinese-Indonesians
control the larger part of the country's retail and distribution
sector.
	   In the Greater Jakarta area, losses resulting from damaged
property were placed in the region of Rp 2.5 trillion.
	   The riots led to a mass exodus of tens of thousands of
Chinese-Indonesians, some of whom were too traumatized to
contemplate returning to the country to rebuild their businesses.
	   Since the riots, the distribution of goods has been restrained.
Some agents have held goods in their warehouses because of fears of
further unrest.
	   President of PT Unilever Indonesia Sri Urip said on Friday that
current problems in the trading of consumer goods were the result
of damage inflicted on the distribution system and the lack of
security guarantees.
	   ``We have discussed how best to continue our operations with the
minister, and we are also going to talk about the problems with the
President because we have been working here for over 60 years,''
Sri said after the meeting.
	   ``We are concerned that the there is no security guarantee,''
she said, adding that security did not mean being ``guarded all the
time'' but a guarantee of complete national safety.

Lack of money blamed for new delay in bringing down Mir space

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The cash-strapped Russian space program is
pleading poverty again, saying Monday that it cannot afford to
start the controlled descent of the Mir space station _ the first
step in its destruction _ as planned.
	   Viktor Blagov of Mission Control Center told the ITAR-Tass news
agency that a cargo ship attached to Mir would fire its engines
Thursday to lower Mir's orbit by about six kilometers (four miles).
	   Several hours later, Blagov reversed course, saying the cargo
ship must remain linked to Mir longer than planned because the
space agency can't afford to send up a replacement.
	   That will use up all the cargo ship's fuel, leaving none to
control the descent maneuver.
	   However, Mir is already slowly descending toward Earth on its
own and will probably cover the six kilometers (four miles) by
early next month, Blagov said.
	   A new cargo ship is now scheduled to be launched in September to
start the process, providing more control over the descent.
	   Taking Mir out of orbit is expected to take 18 months, by which
time the first stages of an international space station are to be
in orbit.
	   Five cargo ships, docked to Mir one at a time, will lower it
from 400 kilometers (250 miles) above Earth to 120 kilometers (75
miles), before it burns up in the atmosphere in December 1999.
	   A few large fragments that don't burn up are likely to fall into
the Pacific Ocean.
	   If Mir's orbit isn't controlled, it would fall back to Earth
within two years on its own and some big pieces could hit populated
areas, space officials have warned.
	   Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin confirmed that the
maneuver scheduled for Thursday was canceled, but would not comment
on the reasons for the decision.
	   However, Russian space officials have long been complaining
about lack of funds. The government owes Energiya, the company that
built Mir and has operated it since it went into orbit in 1986, 440
million rubles (dlrs 70 million) from last year and hasn't paid any
bills so far this year.
	   Space officials have variously warned in recent weeks they may
have to discard Mir early, to delay the arrival of the next crew
and to cancel a money-making program of bringing foreign cosmonauts
on board.
	   Money problems have also jeopardized Russia's contributions to
the international space station and caused several delays in the
program already.
	   The government recently ordered space officials to help pay this
year's 1.5 billion ruble (dlrs 240 million) bill for the
international space station by renting out communications
satellites, selling more space photographs and other commercial
ventures.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A court on Monday convicted seven
leaders of a get-rich-quick pyramid scheme of fraud and sentenced
them each to 25 years in prison.
	   Members joining the scheme were asked to pay 2,500 German marks
(dlrs 1,400) at initiation. The funds were distributed
pyramid-style to earlier members.
	   The court also ordered Kenan Seranoglu, founder of the Titan
organization, and the six others to pay the equivalent of some dlrs
100,000 in fines apiece. Six other employees of the organization
were acquitted. Seranoglu said he would appeal the verdict.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peace force
arrested a Bosnian Serb suspected of committing war crimes while
running a detention facility in eastern Bosnia, NATO officials said
Monday.
	   Milorad Krnojelac, a captain in the former Yugoslav army, was a
commander at the infamous Foca prison, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southeast of Sarajevo, between April 1992 and August 1993, NATO
said in a press release.
	   Maj. Sheena Thomson, a NATO spokeswoman, said the peace force
arrested Krnojelac without incident around 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday
in Foca.
	   Several thousand people gathered in Foca on Monday to protest
the arrest, including teachers and students from the school where
he is headmaster, according to the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said in a statement that
German and French troops were involved in the arrest.
	   The NATO press release said Krnojelac surrendered to soldiers
when it was clear his ``attempts to evade (authorities) were at an
end.'' The arrest ``resulted from opportunities that developed
recently'' when peacekeepers confirmed Krnojelac's identity and
location.
	   ``He is charged with permitting prolonged torture and beatings,
countless killings and forced labor practices,'' the press release
said.
	   The Hague tribunal accused Krnojelac of being present during the
separation and segregation of non-Serb detainees, for ``providing
inhumane conditions'' in the Foca prison, as well as for assisting
in the deportation of Muslims, who made up the majority of the
population in Foca, the press release said.
	   Krnojelac is among an unknown number of war crimes suspects
contained on a secret list of indictees compiled by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. In addition, the names
of 75 Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim indictees have been released.
	   Thomson said NATO took Krnojelac to The Hague, where he is to be
arraigned Thursday.
	   So far, the peace force has arrested nine war-crimes suspects,
mostly Bosnian Serbs.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leadership Monday
ordered the release of nine of the country's most prominent
political prisoners to ``facilitate the process of national
reconciliation.''
	   The prisoners include such well-known figures as Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979 and Beko
Ransome-Kuti, a pro-democracy activist jailed since 1995.
	   But Nigeria's best known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not mentioned in the statement from
David Atta, the press secretary for Nigeria's new military leader,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the release of some detainees and
prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation and
reconstruction,'' Atta said.
	   Abubakar came to power a little less than a week ago, following
the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose five-year-dictatorship became
an international pariah for its human rights record.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusubroto
has blasted state electricity company PLN for charging customers
above-normal prices.
	   Kuntoro voiced his criticism Friday following reports that PLN
increased power prices for many households by up to 300 percent
starting last month, as against the government-set price increase
of an average of 20 percent.
	   ``If this (the extreme increase in power price) is a normal
phenomenon, there must be something wrong in PLN's management,''
Kuntoro said.
	   ``PLN should discipline its employees so that they work well and
no clients are charged above the normal price,'' Kuntoro said.
	   Kuntoro added that PLN should be held responsible for the
extreme power increase instead of accusing cooperatives or
companies which were contracted by PLN to count the volume of power
used by clients.
	   The government raised power prices by an average of 20 percent
starting last month. The tariffs for households using between 450
volt-ampere (VA) and 2,200 VA increased by 38 percent and 40
percent.
	   According to the new tariff, households which use between 450 VA
and 2,200 VA must pay a subscription fee of Rp 11,500 per KVA per
month separate from a power utilization fee of between Rp 109,000
and Rp 149,50 per kilowatt hour (kwh) per month.
	   However, many PLN costumers claim their power bills have been
raised by up to 300 percent.
	   On Thursday, dozens of residents of the Krembangan district,
Surabaya, East Java protested the exorbitant price hike.
	   They said they had to pay PLN Rp 1 million last month, as
against Rp 267,000 in the previous months.
	   Hizban, head of the PLN distribution office in the province,
promised to investigate the exorbitant price increases.
	   ``Maybe, PLN's employees made mistakes in counting the volume of
power used,'' he said, reported Antara.
	   The government raised power prices in May by an average of 20
percent. It will further raise power prices by an average of 18
percent in August and 20 percent in November, to reduce subsidies
for electricity from Rp 11 trillion to Rp 2.3 trillion for the
current fiscal year.
	   The rupiah's sharp depreciation against the dollar since the
middle of last year has left the company suffering more than Rp 500
billion in losses last year because it gets earnings in rupiah but
pays 60 percent of its costs in dollars.
	   PLN has tried to reduce its dollar-based costs by asking
independent power producers to renegotiate their dollar-based power
purchase contracts, but none of the producers has given any
response to the request.
	   PLN's president, Djiteng Marsudi, unilaterally annulled a power
purchase contract recently with producer PT Cikarang Listrindo,
owned by former president Soeharto's cousin Sudwikatmono, in an
effort to break through the stalemate. But the move was opposed by
Minister for the Empowerment of State-Owned Companies Tanri Abeng.

World Cup: Argentina's `favorite' status slips after flat Japan
</HEADLINE>
win &QL; 
 &UR; By VICENTE LEONARDO PANETTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ In spite of a win, Argentina's shine as
one of the top World Cup favorites dimmed somewhat after its flat
1-0 victory in its tournament debut against underdog Japan.
	   Even though it was only their first game of first-round play,
the Argentines were left shaking their heads after a hard-fought
match that almost ended in a tie. Now they find themselves in
second place in group H, behind Croatia on goal differential. The
Croats also won their first match Sunday, 3-1 against Jamaica.
	   Gabriel Batistuta, the leading scorer for Argentina and for
Italy's Fiorentina, scored in the 28th minute and crashed two shots
on the posts, but Argentina was unable to take full advantage of
its ample World Cup experience and clearly superior technique.
	   If anything, it was fortunate to have escaped two late scoring
chances by the Japanese, who did not seem to mind playing the
two-time world champs in their first World Cup match ever.
	   Argentina's coach Daniel Passarella grudgingly admitted to being
``only half satisfied'' with his team's performance. Argentina
faces Jamaica Sunday in Paris.
	   Halfway through the second half, with Japan more self-assured
and even dominating during brief stretches, Passarella showed his
displeasure with Argentina's uneven attack and sent in Abel Balbo
to reeplace Claudio Lopez.
	   The change did not improve matters, but it did show no player's
spot is guaranteed. Now, against the much faster and more
experienced Jamaicans, Passarella finds himself rethinking his
front line.
	   ``We lacked precision with the ball in the second half,'' said
Passarella of his trio of blue-chip strikers: Batistuta; Balbo, of
Italy's AS Roma; and Lopez, of Spain's Valencia.
	   Batistuta and Lopez have been a winning combination, having
started together six consecutive matches, including Sunday's game.
	   Awaiting their chances to shine are Hernan Crespo, of Italy's
Parma, and Marcelo Delgado, of Argentina's Racing. If neither of
them work out, Ariel Ortega can also be moved up as a forward.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Prasetiya Mulya Foundation (YPM), an
educational and social organization established by the country's
top conglomerates, has turned down an offer to join the Indonesian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin).
	   Prasetiya chairman Ciputra and executive director Prasastro
Sudyatmiko said in a statement that the invitation went to a wrong
address.
	   ``It doesn't make any sense to ask YPM to join Kadin because YPM
is not a business organization,'' Ciputra said about Kadin's offer.
	   Kadin chairman Aburizal Bakrie last week asked Prasetiya Mulia
to join the chamber.
	   But Aburizal, also the chairman of the Bakrie Group, did not
specifically explain why he was inviting Prasetiya Mulia to join.
	   To many people, Prasetiya Mulia represents an exclusive group of
top conglomerates owned by Chinese-Indonesian businessmen,
including Sudono Salim alias Liem Sioe Liong, rather than a social
organization.
	   YPM's statement said that Kadin statutes did not allow the
chamber to take members which were not business or trade
organizations.
	   YPM stated that individual member companies and businesspeople
in the foundation were free to join the chamber.
	   ``Most of our businesspeople have become Kadin members since the
foundation was established,'' the statement said.
	   ``If Kadin wants to establish an organization practicing in
social services and education like us, we would be very pleased to
help it,'' the statement added.
	   The foundation said its Prasetiya Mulya Management Institute
could help Kadin implement business education should the chamber
start such a project.

 &UR; Lawyers argue two of three convicted soldiers may be innocent &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Two of three British soldiers serving
life sentences for the brutal killing of a Danish tour guide may be
found innocent if the appeals court accepts new evidence, their
lawyers argued Monday.
	   But the lawyer for the third British soldier argued against
accepting testimony of a former British police officer who claimed
in a series of British newspaper articles last year that only one
of the soldiers was behind the killing.
	   Lawyers for Alan Ford and Geoffrey Pernell want to use claims
made by Michael Flack that only Justin Fowler raped and killed the
victim.
	   Flack did time for burglary and theft in the same prison where
the three soldiers were held.
	   The soldiers were sentenced to life imprisonment without
remission for the 1994 killing of 23-year-old Louise Jensen.
	   They were found guilty of kidnapping Jensen outside a night spot
in the tourist resort of Ayia Napa, raping her, bludgeoning her to
death with a shovel and then burying her in a shallow grave in a
field.
	   The three admitted to kidnapping Jensen during their trial but
claimed they were too drunk to remember what happened and tried to
blame each for the rape and the killing.
	   ``The new evidence may mean that my client is innocent,'' said
Andonis Andreou, who represents Ford. Pernell's lawyer also argued
the evidence could prove his client's innocence.
	   But Fowler's attorney, Christos Pourgrourides, argued against
hearing Flack's testimony, saying he was an untrustworthy convicted
criminal who was seeking publicity.
	   ``I have been informed that this man (Flack) has sold his story
for hundreds of thousands of pounds to the British press and this
could influence the case,'' Pourgrourides said.
	   ``Flack has strong financial interests in this case as he has
been claiming that as a detective and former police chief inspector
he did a better job than the Cyprus police in solving this crime,''
Pourgrourides said.
	   But instead of informing the Cyprus police immediately of the
alleged new evidence, he chose to sell his story to British
newspapers, Pourgrourides added.
	   The three-member appeals court adjourned the case until Tuesday
afternoon to hear further arguments from the lawyers.

	   GELIBOLU, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish authorities allowed a
Maltese-flagged cargo ship to continue on its course after stopping
and searching it on suspicion that it was carrying parts for
Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles destined for Cyprus.
	   The semi-official Anatolia news said authorities found seven
mobile missile launching pads aboard the Natasha-1, which was
stopped Sunday evening at the mouth of the Dardanelles Strait,
linking the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.
	   ``The search has been completed. The ship has been given
permission to leave,'' said State Minister Sukru Sina Gurel, after
a regular Cabinet meeting.
	   It was not clear if the missile pads were destined for Cyprus.
The ship, coming from Russia, had declared its cargo as tractors
and cars for Egypt.
	   Russian weapons exporter Rosvooruzheniye denied Turkish reports
that the ship was carrying missile components, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.

	   JAKARTA (JP): ``What happens to my savings accounts now? Do the
banks still have the data, or have I lost all the money that I
entrusted to them?''
	   As the riots raged out of control last month and we all felt
helpless because of the lack of a reliable national leadership,
that must have been among the many questions on peoples' minds.
	   It was a fair question to raise as we watched looters ripping
computers off tables and carrying them out of burning buildings.
Banks rely heavily on information technology and if their computers
get damaged there is a risk that vital data may be lost.
	   All big companies, particularly financial institutions, collect
massive amounts of data. Banks hold information on every single
customer, and large banks with a scattered bank of automated teller
machines (ATMs) transfer funds electronically. Every single
transaction is recorded by binary numbers, a series of 1s and 0s,
which are called data. If they ever lose this data they will be out
of business. And you will be too.
	   Luckily most large banks and financial institutions cannot lose
their data so easily because it is regularly backed up. Different
banks have different policies on how often backups are made, but
they are invariably made fairly frequently.
	   The backup tapes are stored in a protected, fireproof vault at
the data center or at a different location. Storing the tapes
``off-site'' offers more protection than on-site storage.
	   The data center itself is usually very well protected. To
minimize the risk of flooding it is usually located on the upper
floors of a multistory building. Normally it is camouflaged in such
a way that you won't be able to find it easily unless you've been
an employee of the company for quite some time. In a well-managed
security environment, visitors won't see any sign pointing to the
Data Center. Even when you know where it is located you may not be
able to get in because it is supposed to be a highly restricted
area.
	   However, just like in any other walk of life, disaster can
strike at any time.
	   If a calamity destroyed the data center business activities
would be interrupted. This would mean a lot of angry bank customers
because ATMs would stop dispensing money. Does this sound familiar
to you?
	   ATM users are by no means the only people who would be affected
by the destruction of the data center. A bank is a service
institution and when its activities are suspended, even for just
for one hour, it loses revenue on services that cannot be rendered.
	   To avoid a prolonged suspension of operations, many reputable
banks and other organizations have prepared themselves against such
an event with something called a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). With
the help of a reliable DRP, the bank can resume business activities
in a very short time after a serious disaster.
	   ``A good DRP has a number of elements,'' said Ronnie A. Dumaguin
of PT Pratesis, a company which has been providing disaster
recovery services to various companies in Indonesia. ``First, it
has to assign several Disaster Recovery Teams, each of which is
responsible for a different set of tasks. Once a disaster has been
declared, the teams will then follow the procedures detailed in the
Plan.''
	   DRC
	   Within 15 minutes of the disaster a damage assessment should be
carried out to determine whether it is necessary to move the data
center to a different location. If the damage is not serious this
may not be necessary. But if, for example, the data center building
is no longer safe operations will have to be relocated to a
Disaster Recovery Center, or DRC.
	   A DRC should be equipped with enough hardware, software, network
facilities and communication links to set the entire operation in
motion again with the minimum disruption to services.
	   ``Preferably a DRC should be quite a distance away from the
location of the primary data center,'' Ronnie explained. ``Last
month's riots showed why this should be so. If the data center was
destroyed outright duringriot it would not help much if the
recovery center was very close by.''
	   Another very important element of the DRP is the holding of
regular training and simulation exercises to ensure that staff now
how to react. For example, data center staff should know where they
have to meet after evacuating the building, and members of the
recovery team should know where the command center has to be set
up.
	   The exercises also help to uncover pitfalls in the Plan. If any
mistakes have been made or responsibilities left unallocated this
will become evident during the exercises.
	   Organizations do not normally organize their own contingency
plans for the simple reason that no one knows when disaster will
strike. Waiting for an uncertain event is one of the most boring
tasks that an employee can be paid to do. In most cases disaster
management is subcontracted to companies that specialize in
providing the service such as PT Pratesis and Gateway Group Inc.
	   According to a survey conducted by the UK National Computing
Center (NCC), a lot of disasters have ended as just that because of
a lack of funds allocated to ensure business continuity.
	   Luckily, according to analysts at Gartner Group, banks are among
the institutions that allocate the highest percentage (6 to 8
percent) of their information technology budget to disaster
recovery services.
	   We can only hope that large Indonesian banks with advanced
information technology, including the ubiquitous BCA, will have
some level of protection and disaster recovery plan in place. At
least then it is not so easy for such banks to lose their data and
purge your savings account!

	   JAKARTA (JP): Who shot the four Trisakti students to death on
May 12? Will we ever know the truth? Or will it remain a ``buried
secret'' like the Marsinah and Udin cases?
	   I do not think that anyone among the lay public can answer these
questions. And I do not think that those who have the facts will
volunteer to answer these questions. I think that the facts will
emerge to the surface only if there is tremendous public pressure
on the military establishment.
	   I do not think I am alone in my skepticism. People like me feel
that the military is not being quite honest to the public. I feel
personally that the military has been trying to cover up something
big in this case.
	   Against the background of the firm promises made by the generals
in the Armed Forces (ABRI), including Gen. Wiranto, that this case
will be investigated in a thorough and objective manner, the
performance of the military tribunal is very, very disappointing.
Based on ABRI's promises, the public expects that the military
tribunal will open the case by examining those suspected of doing
the shootings. But what the public has witnessed instead is the
prosecution of police officers accused of not obeying an order
given to them.
	   My immediate reaction to this was disbelief. ``What is this? Is
this a joke? What does 'disobeying an order' have to do with the
death of the four students? Is this the most important element that
caused their deaths?''
	   Until today, I am still disappointed and frustrated. I know I am
illiterate in matters related to legal proceedings, but my common
sense has prompted me to conclude that the military has decided to
conceal many secrets in this case, and resist any attempt to
uncover them.
	   Every good citizen realizes that there are things which cannot
be revealed to the public. We know there are secrets that must be
tightly guarded for the sake of maintaining public security and
preventing chaos.
	   Experiences show, however, that too much secrecy can lead to too
little accountability, and that this in turn can lead to excessive
practices among intelligence ``professionals''.
	   The torture of people kidnapped by intelligence officers is one
testimony of such excesses. The mysterious death of Marsinah is
another testimony. And the prosecution of Dwi Sumaji, an entirely
innocent man, in the case of the mysterious death of Udin is still
another testimony.
	   Something must be inherently wrong when the intelligence
apparatus has so much freedom to do so much harm, and all to no
advantage to the country.
	   I think there are too many unnecessary secrets, too many
unexplained events in Indonesia. In addition to the Marsinah and
Udin cases mentioned above, there are many other events that until
today remain unexplained. They have become buried with time.
	   The recent kidnappings, riots that seemed to be quite well
organized and the physical assault on Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI) Megawati supporters at the PDI headquarters on July 27, 1996
are all secrets that the military seems unwilling to uncover.
	   These are not trivial events, but events of great significance
for the rehabilitation and cultivation of democracy in Indonesia.
	   These are practices that flatly deny and reject respect for the
people, the highest political authority in any well-functioning
democracy.
	   The very important question ABRI has to answer in this respect
is: ``How should intelligence work be carried out effectively
without betraying the principles of democracy?''
	   It should not be forgotten that ABRI is a part of Indonesian
society. And if the promises to carry out total reform are genuine,
then it should reexamine its definition of ``secret'' and rethink
the present classification of its secrets.
	   According to Adm. Stansfield Turner, director of the CIA during
the Carter administration from 1977 to 1982, there are two kinds of
secrets that are truly important in intelligence work: secrets
concerning the identity of the people who risk their lives spying
on ``hostile'' territories, and secrets concerning technical means
used to conduct spying.
	   This definition can be employed to raise a number of questions,
the answers of which can then be used to reclassify Indonesia's
existing secrets into two groups: secrets that are really vital for
protecting the country and the nation, and secrets that stand in
the way of the nation's efforts to generate a clean and just
society.
	   We can ask in this regard, for instance, what or which should be
considered as ``hostile'' territory. Are university campuses
``hostile'' territory?
	   If the answer is yes, it was a very grave mistake on the part of
ABRI to leak signals concerning their operations within campuses.
It was truly unprofessional conduct.
	   If, on the other hand, university campuses are not considered
``hostile'', then it was also a grave mistake to spy on them. It
was again totally unprofessional conduct.
	   It must be admitted, I think, that public esteem toward certain
elements of ABRI has sunk to a very low point. The word ``intel''
-- short for ``intelligence'' -- has a very bad connotation in the
public's mind.
	   To restore the reputation and trust of the military, especially
that of the intelligence apparatus, Adm. Stansfield Turner
prescribed the following two principles: objectivity and legality.
	   The principle of objectivity requires that all ``reporting and
analyses coming from intelligence community must be scrupulously
free of bias, either conscious or unconscious''. And the principle
of legality demands that ``intelligence agencies, like all arms of
government, must reflect the mores of the nation and abide by its
laws''.
	   To restate our main question, the essential issue in this case
is whether or not the military will allow the public know the
entire truth.
	   Will the military let the public know who did the shootings and
for what reason? Or will ABRI treat the answer to this essential
question as a ``secret'' that must be guarded at all costs, even at
the risk of killing once again the seeds of democracy in our
society?

	   KOBE, Japan (JP): ``Foreign news'' is being rediscovered by the
American press.
	   For most of the world's editors, foreign news has not been MIA
(missing in action) as it has been in the United States.
	   Only in the U.S., where panic over declining circulation and
falling advertising revenues a decade ago led to wholesale sacking
of foreign correspondents and signing up of ``focus groups'' to
decide what should go in the paper, has there been such a turning
inward of newsjudgment.
	   A ``focus group'' is a band of citizens rounded up by editors to
make the decisions that the editors should have been making in the
first place, by themselves. Editors are supposed to be leaders, not
followers.
	   Here in Kobe, the attendees at the 51st World Association of
Newspapers (WAN) Congress heard industry leaders talk about
international news as being no different, no less important than
``local'' news.
	   Lachlan Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch and now head
of News Limited of Australia, spoke of ``harnessing creativity'' to
guarantee the future of newspapers. The serious challenge from
interactive or Internet media is still a ways down the road, he
said.
	   And you'd like Leslie Fong, editor of the Straits Times of
Singapore. He's spending US$6 million this year on foreign bureaus
in order to bring to readers of his highly-successful paper the
meaning of the world in a Singapore context.
	   It is understandable that readers in places like Seoul, Taipei,
Jakarta, Tokyo, and Honolulu feel more comfortable with
international news than readers in Kansas City, Albuquerque,
Nashville, or Minneapolis (Voice offstage: ``It's the geography,
stupid!'').
	   But international business and improved communication are
changing that perception.
	   Meanwhile in Moscow (I'd rather be in Kobe; So would Marilyn
Greene of the World Press Freedom Committee. ``We asked for an
extra pitcher of water at Moscow's best hotel and the sulking
waiter refused, telling us: 'One pitcher for each table.''' In
Japan, any request is met immediately, with civility), editors were
warned against cutting international coverage.
	   Speaking at the International Press Institute (IPI) conference
in Moscow, American newspaper editors warned that a lack of
international coverage is hurting the public.
	   Edward Seaton, new president of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors (ASNE) and editor-in-chief of the Manhattan
(Kans.) Mercury, said that since 1971 the amount of space devoted
to foreign news in American papers has fallen from 10.2 percent to
less than 2 percent.
	   ``An uninformed public offers opportunities for demagogues and
enemies to cause serious harm,'' he said, adding that the majority
of existing coverage consists of ``10 inches about mayhem that
presents the world as a series of unconnected disasters.''
	   According to Philip Gailey, editor and publisher of the St.
Petersburg (Fla.) Times, the lack of coverage means that the
American public lacks a clear grasp of international affairs, and
so allows foreign policy to be driven by government officials
rather than influencing those policies.
	   ``There are no giants in the American foreign policy
establishment these days only small politicians constantly
calculating the domestic political pluses and minuses of every
foreign policy move,'' Gailey said.
	   CallingAmericans' lack of interest in world affairs a
``comfortable illusion,'' Gailey added that, ``My belief is that if
[Americans] don't care, at least in part, it is because they've
been lulled into believing that what happens overseas will have no
real impact on their own lives.''
	   On taking over ASNE leadership, Seaton launched a program to
make global news within the reaches of community newspapers of all
sizes.
	   Seaton said: ``It is an effort to look at how we are using
international news with an emphasis on helping readers figure out
how international forces are affecting and changing their
communities and their lives.''
	   He said the emphasis on international news -- ``we should banish
the word 'foreign' when talking about news and correspondents. How
parochial can we get?'' -- benefited from timing.
	   People were tiring of White House sex scandal allegations and
O.J.Simpson-type trials that seemed to parody the justice system.
The President Clinton China visit and U.S. China policy
ramifications began to intrigue readers as did the altered power
balances emerging from the India and Pakistan nuclear tests.
	   Seaton will organize a series of roundtableswith Freedom Forum
backing to take the concept of increased international news to
smaller communities.
	   Recent readership polls show the turnaround in preferences.
Readers are interested in international news and columns dealing
with lifestyles, human interest, environment, drug traffic, crime
and jobs more than ``diplomatic doubletalk.''
	   There needs to be a rekindling of interest among younger
journalists in foreign reporting. ``There was a time, before the
days of working spouses, when reporters would kill for a foreign
assignment,'' said columnist Tom Winship, former editor of the
Boston Globe.

Russia to propose new arms sales to India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will make new proposals to sell
conventional weapons to India, one of its biggest arms clients,
including some from the stocks of the Russian armed forces, a news
agency reported Monday.
	   First Deputy Defense Minister Nikolai Mikhailov said the two
countries will also consider joint scientific research on arms for
ground forces, Interfax said.
	   Mikhailov spoke after meeting with Indian First Deputy Defense
Minister Adjit Kumar.
	   India's armed forces uses primarily Soviet-era equipment, which
requires maintenance and upgrades.
	   Russia has been accused of helping India develop a sea-launched
ballistic missile that could reach deep into Pakistan. Russia
denies the reports and says India never asked for such help.

US envoy renews call for Vatican to open wartime records
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The top U.S. official on Holocaust restitution
on Monday called the pace of payments from a fund set up by Swiss
banks to help impoverished Holocaust survivors ``very
disappointing'' and renewed his call for the Vatican to open its
wartime records
	   U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said only dlrs 11
million has been distributed since a dlrs 200 million fund was set
up by Swiss banks last year to make payments to help aging victims
of the Holocaust.
	   ``It is frankly disappointing ... very disappointing,'' he said.
``From our standpoint as the U.S. government, we certainly wish the
money were pushed out much faster.''
	   The slow pace of disbursement had been ``a discouragement to
getting additional contributions to the fund, when that which is
already there is still unspent,'' he said.
	   Eizenstat attributed the delays to disagreements among the
fund's board members, who includes several international Jewish
leaders, on how the money should be allocated. ``These are
difficult and emotional issues,'' he said.
	   Eizenstat said the United States has received no response to its
call earlier this month for the Vatican to open its wartime records
to shed light on its activities during World War II.
	   The pontifical College of San Giralmo in Rome gave refuge after
the war to leaders of Croatia's Nazi puppet regime, the Ustasha,
and helped them escape to South America, Eizenstat said.
	   While emphasizing that he was not accusing the Vatican itself of
wrongdoing, Eizenstat said ``It would be useful to know what
relationship if any (the college) had to the Vatican. What did the
Vatican know about their activities?''
	   ``It's important that every institution, every country, try to
fully come to terms with what happened during the most ghastly
period of this or any other century, and let the chips fall where
they may,'' he said.
	   ``I think that's the healthiest thing that could be done.''
	   A report issued earlier this month by Eizenstat looked at how
neutral countries helped sustain the Nazi war effort through trade.
	   Eizenstat noted that although neutral countries provided
significant economic assistance to the Nazis, they also helped save
more than 250,000 Jews from the Nazi Holocaust _ while the United
States itself took only 21,000 Jewish refugees.
	   Eizenstat credited Switzerland's efforts to examine its wartime
role. ``No nation has come further in trying to face the truth than
Switzerland,'' he said.

AND WORLD TIMES, INC. NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN
MAY BE USED IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO WORLDSOURCES, INC.
	   Now that 1,001 suggestions have been put forward by people of
various backgrounds, I would like to introduce mine, which I'll
call the 1,002th suggestion. While the 1,001 suggestions have been
made known simply as people's participation in the freedom of
expression cause, my suggestion does differ from all others.
	   As we have only limited time at our disposal in which we must
implement total reform with the establishment of a government free
from corrupt, collusion and nepotism, I suggest that this total
reform begin with a referendum in which the Indonesian people
directly elect their president and vice president. Arrangements may
later be made to ensure that this referendum is constitutional.
	   The following are my suggestions about how the referendum should
be held:
	   As the leadership of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR)/House of Representatives (DPR) was not involved in the
transfer of the presidency from H.M. Soeharto to B.J. Habibie, the
leadership of the MPR/DPR may announce that the present government
is a transitional one and that Habibie is only an acting president,
not a full president/mandate-holder. This transitional government
could be assigned to tackle crucial economic problems and organize
a referendum. Immediately after this announcement, the political
activities of MPR/DPR could be suspended while these two
institutions put things in order as a prerequisite for the
establishment of a government free from corruption, collusion and
nepotism. I believe the leadership of the MPR/DPR is
constitutionally vested with the power to put right Habibie's oath
taking by the Supreme Court.
	   Then Habibie administration and its apparatuses could open up
opportunities, for a certain span of time, for any Indonesian
citizen to nominate himself as a candidate for the presidency of
the Republic of Indonesia. A presidential candidate need not be
supported by the masses. The most important thing would be that he
fulfills the requirements. Aside from the requirements set by the
law, a candidate should also draw up a curriculum vitae, in
particular mentioning all his assets, along with a certificate
certifying that they were acquired not through corruption, and his
complete family tree, several removes above, below, to the right
and to the left. These presidential candidates should also be
required to write brief outlines of their programs. In this way,
only those fulfilling these tight requirements could join the
presidential race.
	   The data of all presidential candidates should then be made
known to the public, who would have one month prior to the
referendum to consider their choice.
	   A candidate collecting the most votes would be the president and
the one securing the second biggest number of votes the vice
president.
	   Afterward, the MPR, now relatively free from elements of
corruption, collusion and nepotism, could resume its activities. It
would install the president and the vice president, who would be in
office until 2003. The president would then form his cabinet.
Later, failed presidential candidates along with the MPR/DPR and
the new government would work together to revise the 1945
Constitution by supplementing a provision on a referendum, which
would be retroactive and contain provisions about the referendum
already held in addition to a stipulation that there be no further
referendums.
	   Then the new government, the MPR/DPR and the failed presidential
candidates should work again together to draft laws about
organizations participating in the general election, the general
election itself, the composition of the new MPR/DPR, etc. A general
election should be held in 2002, as stipulated in a prevailing MPR
decree.
	   My suggestions above may save time and money and ensure that our
political system is revamped in an orderly manner without causing
national disintegration.
	   I believe the 1945 Constitution will remain sacred despite any
revisions. In fact, the present differences of opinions in our
society have come about because the Constitution is not perfect. As
for a supplementary provision on the referendum, which would be
retroactive and not forward looking in its vision as no future
referendums would be allowed, this is all right because even the
preamble of the 1945 Constitution and a number of its articles are
basically concerned with the shift from colonial times to
Indonesia's independent era.

Nigerian junta frees nine prominent political prisoners

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leadership Monday
ordered the release of nine of the country's most prominent
political prisoners to ``facilitate the process of national
reconciliation.''
	   The prisoners include such well-known figures as Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979 and Beko
Ransome-Kuti, a pro-democracy activist jailed since 1995.
	   Nigeria's best known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not mentioned in the statement from
David Atta, the press secretary for Nigeria's new military leader,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the release of some detainees and
prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation and
reconstruction,'' Atta said adding other prisoners ``would be given
consideration from time.
	   Abubakar came to power a little less than a week ago, following
the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose five-year-dictatorship became
an international pariah for its human rights record.
	   In releasing the prisoners, the new military leader urged those
granted amnesty to ``cooperate'' with the government to create
``the country of our dreams.''
	   Abubakar also appealed to the international community to
appreciate the regime's efforts ``at solving our problems and show
greater understanding and sensitivity to our internal affairs.''

	   I was alarmed after reading an article in the ``Across the
Archipelago'' section of the June 9 edition of The Jakarta Post
reporting that the speaker of the South Sumatra provincial
legislature had publicly called on Chinese-Indonesians to use
Indonesian or the predominant ethnic language of the area for
everyday use. I was puzzled when, in almost the same breath, he
also urged a stop to discrimination in the country.
	   The speaker made the announcement after meeting with a group of
Taman Siswa University students who argued that the use of Chinese
in public detracted from national unity and the development of
nationalism. They said the 1945 Constitution stipulated that
Indonesian was the national language.
	   At the same time, the students asserted they fully supported an
end to discriminatory practices in the country.
	   Do these students and the speaker actually believe that asking
an ethnic minority not to use their preferred language in public is
not discriminatory?
	   If we take their logic a step further, then we should be asking
all Javanese living in Kalimantan not to use the Javanese language
in public since they are indeed a minority there. And in Jakarta,
the use of Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, etc. should not be used
in public since the predominant language here is Indonesian.
	   Or do the students and the speaker wish to only discourage the
public use of languages not indigenous to the shores of Indonesia?
This would be a convenient way of saying that Chinese is not
welcome here.
	   Being an American, do they propose that I should have to use
Indonesian when speaking in public with another American friend to
make sure we don't threaten national unity? Should two Indonesians
practicing English, Dutch or Japanese only do so behind closed
doors? Or are the students and the speaker proposing to single out
only the Chinese language?
	   The fact that they are not urging me, my Javanese friends or my
Sundanese friends to use only Indonesian in Jakarta while they are
asking Chinese-Indonesians to do so is outrageously discriminatory.
	   Indonesian has been a truly unifying language for this country.
It has enabled people from Aceh to Irian Jaya to communicate freely
in everyday business, governmental and personal contacts. But I
don't believe Indonesia's founders ever intended the national
language to stamp out regional and ethnic languages in the process.
	   To the contrary, Indonesia is rightfully proud of maintaining
its diverse cultural heritage. The question is: When will the
majority of Indonesians accept the fact that Chinese culture, too,
is a part of this country's heritage since almost 10 million of its
citizens claim it as part of their ancestry?
	   When a country singles out one of its ethnic groups by denying
or curbing the maintenance of its cultural heritage, then how can
that group feel like it is a respected component of society? Is
national unity forged through the repression of the country's
minorities?
	   What has happened to the idea behind Indonesia's seal that
states: Bhinneka Tunggal Eka (unity in diversity)?

Saudi foreign minister in Damascus to discuss holding Arab summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's foreign minister arrived
in Damascus Monday for talks on a proposed Arab summit and the
stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Saud al-Faisal will also head his country in the two-day
meetings of the Syrian-Saudi joint economic committee.
	   ``The Arab stand toward the peace process should be based on the
restoration of occupied Arab lands and the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people,'' Prince Saud told reporters.
	   Hopes for holding a summit on the stalled peace talks faded
after some Arab countries differed on its agenda and doubts about
its outcome.
	   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said Monday the summit
should be well prepared _ ``otherwise it will send a wrong message
to the Israeli government, a matter that will stiffen its stubborn
stands toward the peace process and the Arab rights in general.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has called for a summit to
clearly blame Israel for the stalemate in the negotiations.
	   Israel-Palestinian talks broke off in March last year when
Israel began building a Jewish housing project in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The meeting of the Syrian-Saudi economic committee, established
in 1993, will focus on means of boosting economic and trade
relations and encourage investment, according to Syrian officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Prince Saud is expected to meet with Syrian President Hafez
Assad Tuesday.

Turkish police clash with pro-Islamic protesters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police arrested 11 protesters Monday
during an angry protest of a ban on head scarves at universities,
the semi-official Anatolia news agency said.
	   Using truncheons and tear gas, riot police moved in to break up
the downtown demonstration by hundreds of people after calls to
disperse by a police chief remained unheeded.
	   Protesters responded by throwing stones, private NTV television
said. Several demonstrators were injured by police truncheons, and
a cameraman of the private Kanal 6 lost consciousness after being
hit in the head by a stone, his station reported.
	   The protest was sparked by the suspension of 11 Istanbul
university students for wearing Islamic-style head scarves and
beards and the schools' decision not to allow students in Islamic
garb to take exams.
	   The staunchly pro-secular military regards the head scarves as a
sign of support for an Islamic regime.
	   Dozens of students were arrested Friday in similar protest.

E-mail can be a mixed blessing

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Rosie McSweeney, a college student in Arizona,
thought she was sending an e-mail to a friend. But she hit a wrong
key and inadvertently sent it racing across the Internet into the
mailboxes of thousands of strangers.
	   Oops.
	   Embraced for its convenience, e-mail has become for Internet
users the fast and cheap communications medium of the '90s. Its
nature lends itself to informal use, complete with misspellings,
quirky abbreviations and casual references to friends, co-workers
or employers.
	   Trouble is, those casual messages sometimes get misdirected, or
they can have long lifespans, hibernating for years on a computer
backup in the company's basement. Sometimes, like old soldiers, old
e-mail messages never die.
	   When the Justice Department and 20 states filed antitrust
lawsuits last month against Microsoft Corp., they used e-mail
written by the company's top executives _ from printouts Microsoft
provided under civil subpoena _ to bolster their claims that
Microsoft was unfair in its fight against rival Netscape
Communications Corp.
	   ``When you have a written memo, you rip it up and it's all
gone,'' said Terry Loscalzo, a Philadelphia lawyer who specializes
in Internet issues. ``Many employees don't understand that when you
hit the Delete button it does not delete the e-mail for all
eternity.... It can still be retrieved very easily.''
	   The misdirected e-mail from McSweeney, a student at Arizona
State University, was an innocuous note to a friend. But that
didn't stem her embarrassment after her surprisingly common mistake
sent it to thousands of people who participate in an Internet
discussion group she uses.
	   ``It was a horrible feeling,'' she said. As her message raced
across the Internet, she said, ``It's like when you realize that
you've just locked your keys in your car. The dangling key chain
seems to taunt you.''
	   Even savvy computer executives can be confronted by their own
e-mail written years earlier, increasingly in lawsuits, as the
medium becomes more widely used.
	   A report earlier this year by Forrester Research Inc. said 15
percent of the U.S. adult population, or 30 million people, uses
e-mail. That number is expected to grow to 135 million by 2001.
	   ``There was sort of a gentlemen's rule that attorneys wouldn't
look into it, because nobody understood how it worked,'' said David
Sorkin, associate director of the Chicago-based Center for
Information Technology and Privacy Law. ``That's disappearing in
this age of litigation. It's almost routine to investigate whether
there are electronic documents.''
	   An e-mail from Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is included in the
government's antitrust lawsuit. Gates described in a July 1996
message how he tried to persuade the chief executive officer at
Intuit Inc. not to distribute Netscape's Internet browser with
Intuit's popular personal finance software.
	   ``I was quite frank with him that if he had a favor we could do
for him that would cost us something like (dlrs 1 million), to do
that in return for switching browsers in the next few months, I
would be open to doing that,'' Gates wrote.
	   Microsoft contends the e-mail messages, quoted liberally
throughout the government antitrust lawsuits, were taken out of
context.
	   Microsoft benefited from an earlier e-mail message uncovered
during the government's investigation. When a judge appointed
Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig as a ``special master'' to look
into important technical issues over Microsoft's objections, the
company uncovered an old e-mail in which Lessig told Netscape he
had ``sold my soul'' by installing Microsoft's browser.
	   ``There is nothing more powerful in litigation than having a
handwritten note that somebody stuck in a file or an e-mail,'' said
Tyler Baker, an antitrust lawyer in Dallas. ``People are much more
conversational and less guarded and more colorful. It comes across
much more directly.''
	   Unlike paper documents, it can be difficult to verify authorship
of an e-mail, which carries no telltale pen-and-ink signature. Even
if the mail account is protected by a password, that does not prove
it was not sent by someone else with access.
	   ``It's a fairly simple procedure,'' said Loscalzo, the Internet
lawyer. ``Anybody with a fair amount of technical skill can create
e-mail that purports to be written by someone they're not.''
	   Sometimes a person faking an e-mail can have sinister motives.
After Oracle Corp. in 1992 fired employee Adelyn Lee, the one-time
girlfriend of Larry Ellison, Oracle's billionaire chairman, Ellison
received a message purportedly from one of his vice presidents
saying, ``I have terminated Adelyn per your request.''
	   Ellison fired back: ``Are you out of your mind! ... I did not
want to get involved in the decision for obvious reasons.''
	   Lee sued over her firing and settled with Oracle in 1993 for
dlrs 100,000. But she was sentenced in 1994 to one year in prison
and ordered to repay the money after prosecutors showed she had
sent the incriminating e-mail to Ellison, forging the name of the
Oracle vice president from his own account.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Two days before announcing his resignation on May
21, Soeharto asked a group of nine Islamic leaders whether
appointing Habibie, his vice president cum golden boy, as president
would guarantee an end to the troubles. None of the nine Islamic
leaders wanted Habibie to be President.
	   Habibie's subsequent appointment has been widely questioned by
many parties, including some of his supporters. Constitutional law
experts have debated the legality of his appointment because the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) decree which appointed
Soeharto president has not yet been revoked. Politicians and
political observers have also voiced their doubts about the
legitimacy of Habibie's presidency.
	   These questions have arisen firstly because of doubts over
Habibie's power base and his commitment to political reform and
democratization. There are also grave doubts over his ability to
deal with the monetary crisis and recultivate confidence in the
Indonesian economy. Finally, Habibie himself has been tarnished by
the corruption, collusion, and nepotism of the old regime and must
at some time in the future answer these accusations.
	   Doubts over Habibie's ability to deal with the monetary crisis
stem from his reputation as a free-spending eccentric who has a
penchant for projects of an excessively grand nature. This, and his
famous zig-zag theory to explain the rate of inflation, has
severely damaged his credibility in financial and economic circles
around the world.
	   Genuine pro-reform politicians and activists have not endorsed
Habibie's administration. This stance is quite understandable
because Habibie is inseparable from Soeharto's regime and its now
notorious corruption, collusion, and nepotism.
	   Decisions taken by members of Habibie's family to resign from
positions of power and influence are strong confirmation of
Habibie's indulgence in the bad practices of the old regime. Both
foreign and local media have revealed that immediate and distance
relatives of Habibie have benefited considerably from corrupt,
collusive and nepotistic practices.
	   For example, it is clear that development projects on Batam
island are firmly controlled by the Habibie clan. His brother, J.E.
``Fanny'' Habibie replaced him as head of the Batam Industrial
Development Authority. His son, Thareq, and an aunt have a US$100
million joint venture project to build a resort area on the island,
and his brother Timmy, who heads the Timsco conglomerate, is
planning to construct a $1 billion dollar container terminal.
	   Furthermore, Habibie's younger sister, Sri Rejeki, chairs a
foundation that runs the island's hospital and schools. Her husband
is the former CEO of Batam Island Development Authority and still
holds exclusive rights to manage the island's ports.
	   Habibie dismissed these accusations in an interview with The New
York Times, saying that his family's wealth was due to their high
education and talent. It is true that his family are blessed in
both of these respects, but Habibie has shown himself to be naive
by denying that he abused his position of power to advance the
business interests of his family.
	   Habibie hopes to stay in power until the end of next year and it
is likely that he is buying time to prepare himself to stand in the
next presidential election, although last week he said he would not
be a presidential candidate in the election.
	   These circumstances have forced Emil Salim, a former cabinet
member and respected pro-reform figure, to resign from the Group of
Six, a grouping which is set to become a loyal opposition to the
new President.
	   Emil believes that an election should be held immediately and
that Habibie should not be allowed to buy time for himself.
Furthermore, he argues that Habibie's occupation of the country's
highest office will create market distrust, obstruct the flow of
capital back into the country and delay economic recovery.
	   Habibie's uneasy relations with the Armed Forces (ABRI) are
well-known. The simmering animosity between the President and ABRI
dates from when he controlled the purchase of weapons, ships, and
jet fighters. Soeharto's decision to hand over control of some key
military-owned industries to Habibie did little to improve this
situation.
	   Habibie's only power base is the Association of Indonesian
Moslem Intellectuals (ICMI). The association played a strategic
role in securing Habibie's nomination as vice president, but
reports of a rift between him and ICMI emerged ten days before he
took over the presidency. Habibie naively stated on May 9 that the
ICMI call for a cabinet reshuffle and an extraordinary session of
the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) amounted to harassment of
the Assembly.
	   ICMI is a complex and heterogeneous organization established in
1990 under the auspices of the Soeharto regime. Habibie was
assigned to lead and control the newly born Islamic intellectual
organization. The association benefited from Habibie's close ties
to Soeharto but adopted a mildly critical stance toward the New
Order regime. Habibie successfully built a political power base
inside ICMI and secured the sympathies of a number of other Islamic
groups in the process because the association is made up of a
number of different groupings, including intellectuals, scholars,
academics, professionals, government bureaucrats, officials, and
political activists.
	   Although this diverse grouping has no obvious political
constituents, the association has always maintained that it
represents marginalized and underprivileged Moslems, who happen to
be the majority of Indonesians.
	   ICMI has served as a vehicle for a number of different types of
political careerists who saw it as an effective means through which
to advance their interests under Soeharto's repressive regime.
	   Some ICMI figures apparently actively assisted Habibie during
the transfer of power, the formation of his cabinet, and in
implementing policy thereafter.
	   Twelve of the thirty six cabinet members have belonged to ICMI
at some time in their careers, so it not surprising that political
observers have labeled it an ICMI cabinet.
	   It is nevertheless too much too presume that Islamic politics
will secure Habibie's political future. One ICMI member who belongs
to Habibie's inner-circle admits that he is worried about the
possibility of social unrest, or even revolution, as a result of a
further deterioration in economic conditions over the next few
months.
	   In spite of Habibie's unpromising political future, some ICMI
figures still hope to influence the design of a blueprint for
Indonesian politics under Habibie. It seems that the group of
Catholic intellectuals who under the patronage of the late Gen. Ali
Moertopo assisted Soeharto design a political blueprint in the late
1960s has become something of a model for some ICMI figures.
	   But those in Habibie's inner circle who support his plan to stay
in power until late 1999 must face a number of challenges.
	   The association has no basis on which to claim it is pro-reform.
Its main objective, to varying degrees, is to encourage the
development of Islamic society, not democratization.
	   Furthermore, the new government has yet to introduce any
credible policies or take any convincing action to restore public
and international confidence in Indonesian politics and the
economy.
	   Habibie's cabinet must also prove that it can provide a
sufficient supply of affordable staple food, stabilize social and
political conditions, and attract back foreign investment and
Chinese-Indonesians who were forced to flee last months riots.
	   Finally, Habibie must deal with challenges to his regime, but
unlike Soeharto, who had the full support of Western countries
during the Cold War, he will face close scrutiny of his every move
from the global community.
	   The writer is an observer of political affairs based in Jakarta.
	   Window A: ICMI has served as a vehicle for a number of different
types of political careerists who saw it as an effective means
through which to advance their interests under Soeharto's
repressive regime.
	   Window B: In spite of Habibie's unpromising political future,
some ICMI figures still hope to influence the design of a blueprint
for Indonesian politics under Habibie.

World Cup: Maldini Jr. as secretive as father
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Another Maldini, same answers.
	   Italy's captain Paolo Maldini was as evasive as his father
Cesare _ the team coach _ Monday when asked about the team tactic
for Wednesday's Group-B match against Cameroon.
	   Flooded with questions on whether Roberto Baggio and Alessandro
Del Piero may be starting together in an attack trident also
including striker Christian Vieri, Paolo Maldini said ``it's one of
the possibilities.''
	   ``We could start with three forwards. But we could also get into
the match with two strikers and add a third later, depending on
developments,'' Maldini said following the team's final pre-match
training in Senlis. ``A more offensive tactic does not necessarily
mean more defensive risks.''
	   Italy travels to Montpellier on Tuesday.
	   ``As team captain I like to win, not to make tactical
discussions. I don't know if my father already decided the starting
11. Everyone is making a guess,'' Maldini said. ``We are looking
forward to playing a tough opponent. We need to win following the
draw (in the first match) against Chile.''
	   Maldini noted that most of the so-called title contenders
struggled in their first matches.
	   ``Many teams have won by one goal, following lackluster
performances. Spain was upset by Nigeria. We drew against a team
reputed of lower rank but fielding such great strikers as (Marcelo)
Salas and (Ivan) Zamorano,'' he said.
	   Maldini Jr. did not disclose details about the late afternoon
training, held behind closed doors, intended to test tactics.
Italian players also studied tape of the Cameroon-Austria 1-1 draw,
with Anton Polster scoring a last-minute equalizer.
	   Vieri, who tallied Italy's first goal against Chile, said he was
impressed by the speed and quality of Cameroon's players.
	   ``They have a good technique and a great physical condition. We
must be prepared to take advantage of their defensive lapses,''
said Vieri, the leading Spanish league scorer with Atletico Madrid
this year.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Britain's Thames Water Overseas Ltd. and French
conglomerate Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux are to invest Rp 350 billion
(US$25 million) as part of their cooperation agreement with
city-owned water management firm PDAM Jaya to improve water
infrastructure in the capital, it was announced yesterday.
	   In a two-page release signed jointly by managing directors John
Hurcom of Thames and Christian Michelon of Suez Lyonnaise made
available to The Jakarta Post yesterday, the companies said the
funds would be the first stage of their investment program.
	   The decision ``was made following their extensive planning and
investigation on the condition of the water supply infrastructure
in the capital city over the past few months'', it said.
	   The two companies, however, did not disclose the delivery date
or the start of the projects.
	   Under the scheme, the two foreign firms will fund the repair and
replacement of approximately 120 kilometers of pipes; the
refurbishment of water treatment plants; the laying of transmission
mains, and construction of a new reservoir.
	   All the projects will be awarded to local contractors and are
expected to provide jobs for 600 people for approximately 12
months.
	   ``Both companies are very keen to publicly announce this to the
people of Jakarta. It will enable us to reduce leakage throughout
Jakarta and serve more customers,'' said Hurcom.
	   His counterpart from Suez Lyonnaise added: ``We are determined
to honor our obligations under the cooperation agreement with the
Jakarta administration and PDAM Jaya and in doing so will continue
to make a very significant investment in Indonesia.''
	   The two foreign firms resumed their contracts with PDAM recently
after the Jakarta administration canceled tap water concessions
with PT Kekar-Thames Airindo (Kati) -- the Thames joint venture --
and PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (GDS), which involved Suez Lyonnaise,
shortly after Soeharto resigned as president on May 21.
	   The cancellation of the deals to supply water to Jakarta
customers was taken on the grounds that the awarding of the
projects was not done fairly.
	   Kati is owned by former president Soeharto's eldest son Sigit
Hardjojudanto in cooperation with a subsidiary of Thames.
	   GDS is a subsidiary of the giant Salim group owned by tycoon
Soedono Salim, which has close ties to the family of Soeharto. All
their business dealings are now under scrutiny by the Indonesian
government.
	   Last week, Suez Lyonnaise said in Paris that it has acquired a
further share of GDS and that it is now the majority shareholder.
	   In yesterday's statement, the two firms stated that they had
invested ``substantial funds'' during the initial development of
the cooperation agreement.
	   They, however, gave no details.
	   Under the initial cooperation, a 25-year deal, PDAM announced an
increase of up to 65.71 percent in water tariffs from April 1. This
sparked considerable public anger.
	   Under the new deal, PDAM has promised to lower its water tariffs
to appease Jakartans although this has yet to be realized.
	   Last week, Governor Sutiyoso announced that the administration
decided to lower the tariffs by an average of 25 percent, starting
next month.
	   He said the decision was made after the two foreign business
partners agreed to the new tariff proposals.
	   ``The new tariffs are still in accordance with the cross-subsidy
principle in that wealthy customers subsidize those in the
middle-to-lower classes,'' Sutiyoso said.

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Adrian Ilie's 15-meter chip shot in
first-half injury time gave Romania a 1-0 victory over Colombia in
their Group G opener Monday.
	   The Valencia striker outmaneuvered midfielder Maurizio Serna and
defender Everth Palacios and lobbed the ball over advancing
goalkeeper Farid Mondragon.
	   Colombia nearly tied the game in the 85th minute when
replacement Adolfo Valencia, nicknamed ``The Train,'' stretched
Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea for a diving save to his right
with his shot from 30 meters.
	   The Romanian squad, still built around the core of veterans that
played at the 1994 World Cup in the United States, set the pace for
much of the match. In contrast, Colombia struggled to maintain
possession despite occasional flashes of technical excellence.
	   ``We repeated history from four years ago at USA World Cup '94
but with a different score,'' Anghel Iordanescu said after the
lively game before 44,000 soccer fans, about 7,000 of them from
Colombia. Romania beat Colombia 3-1 in 1994.
	   ``The victory has a great psychological importance for us,
because this was the opening game and also because we fielded
several young, less experienced players.''
	   At the start of the second half, Colombia's coach Hernan Dario
Gomez livened up his attack by substituting ineffective striker
Victor Aritsizabal with Valencia.
	   In the first half, Colombia started briskly, eager to avenge
defeat by Romania at the last World Cup. But its passing was ragged
and easily intercepted by the Romanians, who quickly established
midfield dominance.
	   Ilie had the first scoring chance on a fast break in the 11th
minute, when he beat three defenders in the box and crossed the
ball to unmarked Viorel Moldovan, who failed to connect from 7
meters.
	   Five minutes later, Colombian goalkeeper Farid Mondragon
stretched to his right to stop a rasping shot from Dorinel Munteanu
from the edge of the box, then knocked away the rebound hit by
Ilie.
	   In the 40th minute, Moldovan intercepted a ricochet in the
Colombian box, but his header from 6 meters just missed the right
post.
	   ``In the first period we lacked cohesion and clarity. After the
break we were much more determined but unfortunately we missed all
our scoring opportunities,'' Gomez told reporters.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Disagreement over who will annul the PLO
founding charter and determine the scope of a final West Bank troop
withdrawal are holding up Israeli acceptance of the U.S. peace
initiative, a senior Israeli official said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with key Cabinet ministers
for three hours Monday to discuss the U.S. plan, which calls for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged Netanyahu
to make a decision soon, but informal U.S. deadlines have passed
without U.S. action against Israel. The United States presented its
plan in January, and the Palestinians have accepted it. Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat accused Israel of ``trying to avoid,'' a deal.
	   Israel TV reported Sunday that Netanyahu had agreed to a 13
percent pullback after initially saying he could hand over only 9
percent. Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the
Americans had not informed the Palestinians of any such agreement.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, would not comment
Monday on the report, but suggested that the size of that
withdrawal, the second of three promised by Israel, was no longer
an issue.
	   Netanyahu said that despite the delays, he still expected to
wrap up a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians by May
1999, as scheduled. ``This morning, we weren't just talking about
the second redeployment, but about the whole package which will
hopefully lead to a permanent peace agreement by next year,
provided the Palestinians stick to their commitments,'' he said.
	   Arafat was less optimistic however. In Gaza, he told reporters
that he did not expect Israel to accept the offer and accused
Netanyahu of trying to avoid making a deal.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu wants iron-clad U.S. assurances that
the scope of the third pullback be determined by Israel, without
U.S. involvement.
	   ``We don't want an open-ended situation about a third
redeployment,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press. ``The American
commitment that we be the only ones to determine its scope must be
nailed down.''
	   Israel also insists that the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, annul sections of the PLO
founding charter that call for Israel's destruction, rather than
leave the vote to the much smaller PLO Executive Committee.
	   In the U.S. proposal, a vote by the PLO Executive Committee is
considered sufficient to annul those sections. However, Bar-Illan
said the PLO charter itself stipulates that it can only be changed
by a two-thirds majority of the Palestine National Council.
	   In other developments Monday, four Palestinian opposition
groups, including the Islamic militant group Hamas, said they would
turn down offers by Arafat to join his Cabinet.
	   ``It's up to them and not up to us,'' Arafat said. ``If they
want unity we are ready,'' he said.
	   However, Hamas and two secular PLO factions, the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said they would attend consultations with
Arafat on Tuesday concerning his planned Cabinet reshuffle.
	   ``We are going to listen to the president and to present our
views, but we are not going to join the new Cabinet,'' said Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar.
	   A fourth group, Islamic Jihad, said it would not join the talks.
	   Arafat apparently hoped to neutralize the opposition groups by
offering them Cabinet posts.
	   Arafat is under pressure from the Palestinian legislative
council to reshuffle his Cabinet. Last month, the 88-member
legislature gave Arafat two weeks to respond to complaints about
corruption and inaction or face his first no-confidence motion.
	   Arafat has said he would complete the reshuffle by Friday.
	   On Monday, the legislature voted to give the Palestinian leader
until June 25 at the latest to present his new Cabinet.

European leaders acknowledge EU has become remote and faceless

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Within months of taking a giant step
toward integration by adopting a single currency, European Union
leaders acknowledged Monday that the union has become faceless to
its 370 million citizens and scheduled a special summit to bolster
national autonomy.
	   The October summit in the Austrian capital of Vienna will seek
to address a problem long-voiced by previous British Conservative
Party governments, and newly taken up by France and Germany.
	   Aides to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose Labor Party
won power 13 months ago and who is the current EU president, said
the leaders acknowledged jointly _ and without trying to blame each
other _ that the EU's Belgian-based beaucracy is regarded as both
remote and overbearing.
	   ``I hope there can be strong agreement that we need a
decentralized Europe, not some European federal superstate,'' Blair
said at the start of the two-day meeting in the Welsh capital.
	   Officials gave no specific examples of changes likely to be
agreed upon during the six-month presidency of the EU by Austria,
which takes over July 1.
	   However, a major complaint is the hundreds of directives that
emanate from the European Commission, an unelected body in
Brussels, covering everything from working hours to safety
standards to the size of fishing nets.
	   In a joint letter last week to Blair, French President Jacques
Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl termed the EU an ivory
tower issuing edicts affecting the lives of millions of Europeans
but accountable to none.
	   Adding to the fears, when the single currency, the euro, is
adopted Jan. 1 by 11 of the 15 EU nations, a central bank will
decide key economic questions such as interest rates.
	   The EU already has a raft of internal disputes over how to
organize itself and adapt to admitting 10 East European nations and
Cyprus over the next decade. In addition, there are serious
arguments over money.
	   Germany, which provides nearly one-third of the EU budget, on
Monday renewed demands for a big cut in its 21 billion mark (dlrs
11.7 billion) annual contribution.
	   Jealously guarding a substantial reduction in Britain's
contribution that was negotiated in 1984, Blair politely sidelined
Kohl's complaints. Britain's current contribution is 2.5 billion
pounds (dlrs 4 billion).
	   The money issue, always unlikely to be resolved anyway with Kohl
facing an election in September, was left over for Austria to try
to sort out. But poorer members, such as Greece and Portugal, also
had no interest in Germany paying less.
	   The Cardiff summit was set to formally adopt programs to
maintain low deficits and create jobs as part of economic reform
program.
	   Blair said it was particularly necessary now, with Europe and
the United States needing to be ``twin pillars'' of stability
because of the Asian financial crisis.
	   The job programs, which Blair asked each country to submit,
included tax breaks for employers, state-subsidized training
programs, and changing welfare regulations to make taking low-paid
jobs more attractive than welfare.
	   In other action, the EU leaders banned flights by Yugolsav
commercial airlines to their nations in another move to pressure
President Slobodan Milosevic to stop ``indiscriminate violence''
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   And the EU finance ministers, also in Cardiff, urged Tokyo to
take new measures to strengthen and reform the Japanese economy, as
the yen weakened to an eight-year low against the dollar.
	   Monday night, Queen Elizabeth II was hosting a banquet for the
leaders at Cardiff Castle, a magnificent building whose walls date
from Roman times. On Tuesday, the EU leaders will serve as hosts
themselves with a farewell lunch for South African President Nelson
Mandela, who is leaving office soon.

Portuguese PM asks Mandela to seek release of Timor leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-East Timor

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres
on Monday urged South African President Nelson Mandela to press
ahead with efforts to persuade Indonesia to release East Timor
independence leader Xanana Gusmao.
	   ``President Mandela will resume his conversations with the
Indonesian authorities,'' Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama
told reporters after Guterres and Mandela discussed East Timor.
	   They met on the margins of a European Union summit, where the
South African leader will be a guest of honor at a Tuesday
luncheon.
	   Portuguese officials said Mandela would add his voice to
mounting international pressure on new Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie to free Gusmao, who was captured in 1992 and is serving a
20-year sentence.
	   During a visit to Indonesia a year ago, Mandela met Gusmao in
jail and appealed for the rebel leaders' release. That request was
ignored by Indonesia's former leader, Suharto.
	   Habibie, who replaced Suharto last month, signaled in an
interview this week that he was considering freeing Gusmao.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 as Portugal was preparing
to grant independence to the territory. Portugal is lobbying to
secure self-determination for the territory, which the United
Nations refuses to recognize as part of Indonesia.

	   A keeper at the Wildlife Safari Park in Cisarua here died of a
cerebral hemorrhage Thursday after an on-the-job fall Tuesday, an
executive of the park said yesterday.
	   Usep Mulyana, 29, was treated at three hospitals in Bogor but
died at Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital in Jakarta, according
to Toni Sumampauw, a co-owner of the park.
	   Usep and five fellow animal keepers were trying to remove two
young hippopotamuses from their mother's cage when the accident
occurred.
	   ``The hippos' mother is going to give birth soon,'' he told The
Jakarta Post yesterday.
	   As they tried to guide the hippos along a steep and slippery
floor, one of the animals slipped and fell against the wood panels
used by the employees as herding tools.
	   ``The wood panels are always used by the employees to lead the
hippos out from a cage,'' Toni explained.
	   Unfortunately, Usep fell headfirst onto the cage's floor.
	   ``He collapsed immediately after the incident but regained
consciousness for a while and complained about the pain in his back
and head.''
	   After being admitted to the park's clinic, Karya Bhakti Hospital
and the Indonesian Red Cross Hospital here, Usep was rushed to
Cipto Mangunkusumo, some 70 kilometers away.
	   Toni said Usep was knowledgeable in handling the animals.
	   ``He had undergone training in the Czech Republic.''
	   Usep was buried in his nearby hometown of Pangalengan yesterday
morning.

	   About 1,557 people from 36 social institutions in the city will
receive financial assistance of Rp 141.9 million from the Ministry
of Social Services, an official said.
	   Asmono, the ministry's secretary-general, said Rp 65.7 million
of the assistance would be given to 20 orphanages with 730
children, Rp 28.8 million to four institutions for senior citizens
and Rp 47.4 million to 12 institutions for the disabled.
	   He said the donation was part of Rp 1.8 billion to be given to
481 social institutions involving about 20,000 people nationwide.
	   This is the remainder of Rp 16 billion in funds collected by
former social services minister Siti Hardijanti Rukmana to help the
poor and laid-off workers during the prolonged economic crisis,
Asmono was quoted by Antara as saying Thursday.
	   ``Each of those getting the donation will receive Rp 1,000 in
cash for 90 days. After that, the associations are expected to get
funds from other sources,'' Minister of Social Services Justika
Sjarifudin Baharsjah said Thursday.

	   Anecdotal evidence shows thousands of Chinese-Indonesian
families in the capital have prepared themselves to pack up and
head to more accommodating shores at the first sign of renewed
unrest.
	   With passports up-to-date and in hand, the families said last
month's riots taught them a valuable but painful lesson about their
acute vulnerability in this society.
	   ``My relatives and most of my students keep their passports with
them so they can flee as soon as a new riot takes place,'' Edison
Yulius, a lecturer of architecture at Tarumanegara University here,
told The Jakarta Post yesterday.
	   The families, he said, were kept on tenterhooks that more riots
may break out in the next few days.
	   In a desperate bid to offload their belongings and get quick
cash, some are reportedly offering houses, vehicles and furniture
at low prices.
	   Temporary
	   Preferred destinations for temporary refuge are Singapore,
Malaysia and Hong Kong, which require no visas.
	   ``If another violent riot happens again, I'll immediately rush
to the airport with my two teenage daughters and leave all our
belongings behind,'' avowed housewife Liliek of Jelambar, West
Jakarta.
	   She said she knew of hundreds of families, neighbors and friends
who shared a similar strategy to get out.
	   ``It's no use to stay and defend our shop or house only to face
an endless horrifying nightmare.''
	   She told of a couple undergoing treatment at Bhakti Husada
Hospital for deep psychological trauma.
	   They could not bear to face the reality of the deaths of their
three teenage daughters at the family's shop at Glodok business
center in West Jakarta on May 13.
	   ``Two of the girls threw themselves into the fire that gutted
the shop after they failed to help their youngest sister, who was
gang raped by a mob,'' Liliek recounted.
	   Distraught, the young girl followed her sisters by jumping into
the fire from the second floor of the building.
	   ``Their parents are in a deep shock from this tragedy which took
their only children, and they refuse to communicate with anybody,''
Liliek explained.
	   ``The lesson of the family's grim suffering and many other bad
experiences during last month's riots are more than enough for
us.''
	   Liliek said she quickly took her two teenage daughters to the
local immigration office to obtain passports because she did not
want her children to be victims in any future riots.
	   ``My eldest daughter told me how her friends were stripped naked
by mobs during the recent riots. They were not raped but the mobs
brutally groped their breasts.''
	   Her family lived in constant fear until their passports were
completed last week.
	   ``At least, we have a plan for survival,'' she said.
	   Hard decision
	   Last week, the Forum of Reform Entrepreneurs revealed that about
110,000 Chinese-Indonesian families had left the country since the
riots erupted.
	   About 80,000 of the families planned to return if the political
and security situation stabilized, 20,000 were still undecided, and
the remaining 10,000 had decided to move to Singapore, Taiwan and
Hong Kong, the group's spokesperson Nazar Haroen said.
	   Deep concern prevails in the Chinese-Indonesian community over
the future, and for good reason.
	   Ethnic Chinese are the usual target for mob violence during
times of hardship in Indonesia for their perceived wealth.
	   They make up 4 percent of the more than 200 million population
but reportedly control about 70 percent of the trade and commerce
through the vast archipelago. Economic recovery for the country
also involves drawing them, and their business, back.
	   Despite the resentment and hostility against them, many
Chinese-Indonesians are quick to point out that this is the only
land they have ever known.
	   ``The decision to prepare to leave Indonesia, the country where
we were born and grew up, is not an easy choice,'' said Oin Yang
Min Tze of South Jakarta.
	   ``My shop and belongings have all been looted and burned. I
still owe so many people but cannot afford to pay them. I even have
to struggle for my family's daily needs.''
	   Still, he is preparing for the worst.
	   ``I spent the only money we had after the riots to make
passports for me, my wife and my two daughters.''
	   Oin Yang and his family plan to fly to mainland China or the
United States, where his brothers are enthusiastically waiting for
his family's arrival.
	   ``But I hope our plan will not become a reality,'' he whispered.

	   Despite losses suffered by the retail industry from last month's
social unrest, 13 shopping centers and malls are taking part in a
one-month special sale from yesterday in conjunction with the
city's 471th anniversary, an executive said.
	   Steve Sondakh, chief coordinator of Jakarta Great Sales, told
reporters, however, that the event would not be as big as last year
due to the economic crisis.
	   The city's anniversary, which was usually celebrated on June 22,
will be commemorated on July 4 this year.
	   ``Actually, it's not easy to hold the event in such a crisis,''
he said.
	   But the committee wanted to continue the tradition, which
started last year, to support retailers through hard times, he
said, adding that more shoppers were expected to fill the shopping
centers due to the event.
	   ``That's why we can't set any targets. We just ask malls and
shopping centers to participate in the event,'' he said.
	   The malls and shopping centers in Central Jakarta participating
in the sale include Plaza Atrium, Sogo, Plaza Indonesia, Sarinah
and Rimo, while those from South Jakarta are Blok M Mall, Pasar
Festival, Mal Pondok Indah, Mal Kalibata and Plaza Senayan shopping
center.
	   Others are Matahari and Pasaraya department stores throughout
the city and Mal Taman Anggrek in West Jakarta.
	   Sale prices will be continued through July 14.
	   Sondakh, who is also the director of Hero Supermarket, said that
the amount of the discounts at each store would be determined by
their owners.
	   Matahari department store, for example, is offering discounts of
up to 50 percent, while Plaza Indonesia has slashed some prices as
much as 80 percent, he said.
	   Sondakh said no ceremonies were planned for the opening or
closing of the sale because of the crisis. Last year's event saw a
large-scale ceremony headed by former governor Surjadi Soedirdja
and several public figures.
	   The committee's secretary, Kustarjono Prodjolalito, said that
the sale was part of the city's plan to boost the tourist industry.
	   ``That's why the administration enthusiastically supports the
event through a tax exemption on banners (and billboards related to
the sale),'' he said.
	   Kustarjono said this year's target for the sale was to attract
buyers from other cities and other ASEAN countries next year.
	   ``But due to the disaster, I don't know whether that target can
be met.''

Seventy-two forest fires registered near Moscow over weekend

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unusually hot and dry weather has contributed to
72 forest fires that have flared up in the Moscow region over the
weekend, a news agency said Monday.
	   Temperatures in Moscow during the past five days have been among
the highest for these dates in 100 years, Russia's Meteorology
Service spokesman Anatoly Yakovlev was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   On Sunday, the temperature in central Moscow rose to 34.7
degrees C (95 F), he said.
	   More than 60 people, including five children, trying to escape
the heat by swimming in reservoirs have died in the past week,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Twenty-seven people died in other Moscow waters during the
weekend, the Interfax news agency said. It quoted police as saying
alcohol was to blame in some cases.
	   In the Moscow region, fires have engulfed 72 hectares (178
acres) of forests and peat-covered land, ITAR-Tass said.
	   More than 100 firefighters equipped with 35 trucks were trying
to combat the flames, but new fires keep flaring up, it said.
Authorities have appealed to local residents not to throw lit
cigarettes or matches on the ground, and have warned that even a
spark flying out of a faulty car exhaust pipe can start a fire,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   In a central Russian region, a powerful fire has spread over
1,000 hectares (2,470 acres) of forests near a military base. More
than 150 firefighters were trying to extinguish the fire in the
Vladimir region, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of Moscow.

	   About 1000 East Timorese staged a rally in front of the foreign
ministry yesterday demanding a referendum in Indonesia's youngest
province and the release of jailed separatist leader Jose Alexandre
``Xanana'' Gusmao.
	   ``We have made a petition that should be read before President
B.J. Habibie, Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto and Minister of
Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas,'' the protesters' spokesman, Aderito de
Jesus Soares, said.
	   The protesters, calling themselves the ``Front Nasional Timor
Leste'', demanded that a referendum on independence be held and
that Xanana be included in the government's release of political
prisoners.
	   Three foreign ministry officials -- Director of Foreign
Information Ghaffar Fadyl, acting Director for Political Affairs
Hadi Wayarabi and Director for Security and Guidance of the
Indonesian Community Abroad Boedidoyo -- met with representatives
of the protesters to receive the demands.
	   Gaffar promised that he would convey the protesters' wishes to
Alatas as soon as the minister returned from the Philippines.
	   Alatas went to the Philippines to attend the country's
centennial independence celebrations.
	   The demonstration began at about 7:00 a.m when protesters began
unfurling posters and banners on the ministry's grounds.
	   Some then entered the main building unchallenged and sat in the
lobby while hundreds waved black, gold, red and white rebel flags.
	   Security forces moved in at about 1 p.m. to flush out the
protesters after repeated appeals from ministry officials to
disperse went unheeded.
	   In an attempt to escape, many protesters jumped over the front
fence of the ministry's compound.
	   All were eventually herded onto buses and driven away under
police escort.
	   The ministry said in a statement that two protesters and one
soldier were injured. They were Agustina da Foceca, Maria de Fatima
and Pvt. Amrullah.
	   The two protesters were rushed to St. Carolus Hospital on Jl.
Salemba, Central Jakarta, while Amrullah was taken to nearby Gatot
Subroto Hospital.
	   The Indonesian Legal Aid and Human Rights Association (PBHI)
condemned the security forces' actions yesterday for arresting
activists Bonar Tigor Naipospos, Tri Agus Siswowihardja and Benny
who had been distributing bottled water to the protesters.
	   A statement signed by PBHI's executive director Hendardi said
the three were arbitrarily arrested despite merely distributing the
bottled water.
	   Separately, in Dili, East Timor, Bishop Carlos Felipe Ximenes
Belo asserted yesterday that any solution to the East Timor issue
must be resolved through the current talks between Indonesia and
Portugal under the auspices of the United Nations.
	   He said that the result of the dialog must be fair and accepted
by all parties.
	   Belo, however, warned that the talks must involve the East
Timorese people, otherwise the problem would be protracted.
	   East Timor was integrated as the country's 27th province in
1976, but the UN still recognizes Lisbon as its administrator.

	   Minister of Education and Culture Juwono Sudarsono said here
yesterday that aside from logistical and budgetary constraints, the
nation was ill-prepared for hasty polls.
	   Speaking to an informal gathering at Pembangunan Nasional
University, Juwono said the social risks of a speedy poll were too
big.
	   ``Who could guarantee that there would be no outbreak of riots
during election rallies if polls were held in such a difficult
economic climate,'' he said.
	   Juwono was referring to demands by opposition figures and
demonstrators for early polls.
	   Habibie, who was sworn in as president last month to replace
Soeharto, has said that elections would be held next year so that a
new government could take over the reigns of power by 2000.
	   His promises have not quieted demands for quick polls or brought
an end to public distrust in the government.
	   Juwono warned yesterday that the nation could descend into
greater chaos if democracy was not practiced with proper
organization and preparation.
	   He pointed to India as an example where ``political democracy
exists, (but) rioting also exists''.
	   ``Indeed, true reformists want a more speedy election, but it's
just practical matters that we are dealing with here: funding,
logistics, possible social unrest,'' he warned.
	   Allocating more time to prepare for polling would give the
nation a greater chance to organize a safe general election and to
allocate the necessary funding, he said, pointing out that last
year's general election cost over Rp 500 billion.
	   Juwono then argued that Indonesians historically lack a
tradition of strong political institution building.
	   He said people here had always been idealistic about forming
various movements, but when it came to the work to establish a
pertinent institution, the organization and drive was not there.
	   He added that the Armed Forces and strong business conglomerates
were the only seemingly competent organizations in the country.
	   Campus
	   Yesterday, Juwono also took the opportunity to tell several
university rectors at the gathering to keep ``political
campaigning'' off their campuses during the elections.
	   ``Only invite political figures to hold panel discussions with
the campus, but don't let them use the campus as a political
arena,'' he said.
	   Juwono later told journalists that it was time for students to
cease their demonstrations and return to their studies.
	   Separately in Yogyakarta, the rector of the state-run Gadjah
Mada University, Ichlasul Amal, aired a similar call yesterday.
	   Amal, who was a supporter of the student reform movement at the
height of demonstrations last month, said universities must retreat
from the world of ``real'' politics and return to being a moral
force in society.
	   ``Real politics are filled with diverse interests which tend to
lead to conflict and disintegration. So if this is the case,
universities must retreat from real politics,'' he told reporters
after attending an international seminar on democracy and
civilian-military dialog here.

	   The Armed Forces (ABRI) has suggested to its political ally
Golkar, currently wracked by internal dissention, that it prepare
to be more self-reliant in the future.
	   ``A more independent Golkar should be sought in such an era of
reform,'' ABRI spokesman Brig. Gen. A. Wahab Mokodongan said
yesterday.
	   Speaking to reporters after accompanying Minister of Defense and
Security/Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto on a visit to the
House of Representatives (DPR), Wahab hinted that it was time for
the Armed Forces to reduce its strong influence in Golkar.
	   A delegation of ABRI top brass, led by Wiranto, went to the
House yesterday to present the Armed Forces' concept for reform.
	   Among Wiranto's entourage were Army Chief Gen. Subagyo
Hadisiswoyo, Air Force Chief Marshal Sutria Tubagus, Police Chief
Gen. Dibyo Widodo, Armed Forces chief of Sociopolitical Affairs Lt.
Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Armed Forces chief of General
Affairs Lt. Gen. Fachrul Razi.
	   Golkar was established in October 1964 as an amalgamate of seven
organizations which included the Armed Forces, labor organization
SOKSI, cooperative movement Kosgoro and the Musyawarah Kekeluargaan
Gotong Royong (MKGR).
	   But since former president Soeharto's resignation, Golkar is
facing a serious threat of disintegration, especially after MKGR
broke ranks and announced itself as a separate political party late
last month.
	   Kosgoro is taking a wait-and-see approach to the latest
developments in the political situation but has indicated a desire
to also go it alone as a political party.
	   Wahab, however, declined to write off Golkar just yet.
	   ``I think we (people) should wait until Golkar's extraordinary
congress is held,'' he said referring to a planned congress next
month.
	   ``And we (ABRI) still haven't come up with a firm position as
yet, not until the new law on political parties is introduced,'' he
added.
	   When asked what direction the Armed Forces would likely take,
Wahab said he could not say where the ``greater family'' would
channel its future political aspirations.
	   ``Let us wait and see,'' the spokesman said.
	   Meanwhile, a seven-member team, led by the rector of the
state-run Institute for Public Administration (IIP) Ryaas Rasyid,
is currently working on drafts for three political laws, including
a law on political parties.
	   Ryaas indicated that Golkar would have to transform itself into
a political party if it still wished to exist.
	   The drafts are to be completed by the end of next month and to
be open to public scrutiny for necessary revision and improvement
next August. The new laws will be used as the basis next May's
general election.
	   Separately in Yogyakarta, political scientist Yahya Muhaimin
pointed out the need for an arrangement in civil-military
relations.
	   While stopping short of urging an end to the Armed Forces dual
function, Yahya stressed the need for its review.
	   ``There needs to be a serious and intensive dialog between the
two sides so a true understanding can be reached,'' he said.
	   The Armed Forces asserts that it has both a security role and a
socio-political role.
	   Armed Forces personnel do not vote in elections, but they are
allotted 75 seats in the House.

	   The Ministry of Manpower has suspended almost all of its
development projects, including the vocational training program,
due to the worsening economic crisis, an official said yesterday.
	   Yudo Swasono, chief of the planning and development board in the
Ministry of Manpower, told The Jakarta Post that all development
projects except the nationwide labor-intensive ones had been
suspended and its development budget frozen.
	   ``The government recently decided to stop all development
projects and refocus all budgets on the social safety net program
and labor-intensive projects because of the worsening economic
crisis.''
	   He said that more and more companies had laid-off or fired their
workers and the number of unemployed had risen from 14 million
earlier this year to over 20 million.
	   He said the ministry had postponed all training programs at its
152 training centers across the country and all directorates at the
ministry had been asked to take cost-cutting measures.
	   He agreed with the decision to suspend development projects,
saying that ensuring a steady supply of food was more important to
the country in its current circumstances.
	   ``It is better for the government to suspend all projects and
work to ensure the people don't go hungry,'' he said.
	   The ministry's development budget for the 1998/1999 fiscal year
is Rp 140 billion.

	   FRASER &AMP; Neave Holdings Bhd posted a group pre-tax profit of
RM16.56 million for the six months ended March 31, compared with
RM45.85 million for the previous corresponding period.
	   This is despite an 11.8 per cent increase in turnover to
RM624.77 million.
	   Company-level pre-tax profit fell 57.5 per cent to RM7.04
million from RM16.58 million.
	   The company said the dip in earnings was due to the higher costs
of imported materials - which were denominated in US dollars, and
due to the inability to adjust prices in time because of price
controls.
	   The company said group turnover improved on the back of growth
in domestic demand for soft drinks and dairy products.
	   It said although growth rates were lower than expected, both the
soft drinks and dairy operations reported a higher market share.
	   Group earnings per share fell to 5.9 sen from 16.5 sen
previously. An interim dividend of seven sen less tax has been
declared.

	   Twenty private insurance companies agreed yesterday to form a
consortium to set up an insurance coverage scheme to protect
Indonesian workers working overseas.
	   This new agreement effectively ends the controversial monopoly
held by the Human Resources Development Foundation (YPSDM), owned
by former minister of manpower Abdul Latief, on insurance for
workers heading abroad.
	   The agreement was reached between the insurance companies and
about 100 labor export companies in a meeting presided over by
Director General of Labor Placement Din Samsudin here yesterday.
	   Didi Wijaya, marketing manager of insurance company PT Beringin
Life, said that three or four individual insurance firms would
cooperate together to offer insurance coverage to labor export
companies.
	   These labor export companies would then be free to decide which
insurance firm or cooperation to use.
	   ``The insurance will cover protection in occupational accidents,
deaths, transportation, medical service and legal problems,'' he
said.
	   He expects the consortium to table a draft insurance scheme in
10-days so it can be discussed with labor export companies.
	   Minister of Manpower Fahmi Idris issued last month a ministerial
decree stipulating that labor export companies were responsible for
providing protection to workers. All workers sent overseas are
obliged to participate in a social security program.
	   The new decree comes on the heels of strong protests by the
labor export companies against YPSDM, which they claim has refused
to pay insurance claims to troubled workers abroad.
	   Anthon Sihombing, secretary-general of the Association of Labor
Export Companies (APJATI), claims that YPSDM has collected at least
US$15 million since its establishment in 1996 but has never paid
insurance claims to troubled clients.
	   ``The foundation collects $80 from each worker sent overseas,
but has never paid anything to the workers. Besides, all forms of
monopoly should be eliminated,'' said Anthon, who is also president
of labor export company PT Luhur Asa Vrima.
	   Wijaya said his insurance company was ready to compete by
offering better services to workers.
	   Meanwhile, Mansur, chairman of the East Java APJATI branch,
called on the government to take strict measures against labor
export companies found guilty of deceiving and abandoning workers.
	   ``The government should be strict with violating companies to
help eliminate cases of fraud and inhumane treatment toward
workers,'' he said.
	   He contended that the government should revoke the license of PT
Bina Inti Utama, which had been found guilty of collecting
placement fees from workers but had not sent them abroad.
	   The workers have lodged their own lawsuit against the company at
the Surabaya District Court.
	   Official figures put the number of Indonesians working abroad at
about 1.9 million.

	   Former minister of home affairs Yogie S.M., former coordinating
minister for people's welfare Azwar Anas and the government
sanctioned chairman of the Indonesian Democratic Party Soerjadi are
to be among the 45 people sworn in today as members of the Supreme
Advisory Council (DPA).
	   They are due to take their oath this morning in a ceremony at
the State Palace and will then begin five-year terms as supreme
advisors to the president.
	   ``The new council members are expected to provide inputs to the
process of political, economic and judicial reform which the
government is implementing,'' Minister/State Secretary Akbar
Tandjung said yesterday.
	   According to the 1945 Constitution, the council has equal status
to the president. The council is supposed to advise the president,
either on its own initiative or when requested.
	   However, in recent years the council has often been criticized
as being the final retreat for retired generals, ministers and
politicians whose advice to the president is almost never heard in
public.
	   Prior to ending his five year term in March, the previous
chairman Sudomo claimed that former president Soeharto always
listened to the council's suggestions, although he never allowed
them to speak to public.
	   ``We are not just a rubber stamp for the president,'' Sudomo
once said defensively.
	   The composition of the new council due to be sworn in today is
certain to raise a few eyebrows.
	   The inclusion of Soerjadi is expected to draw much criticism.
	   Soerjadi ousted Megawati Soekarnoputri from the PDI leadership
during a controversial government backed congress in 1996.
	   The final selection of council members remains the prerogative
of the president, who can choose from a list of 90 names prepared
by the House of Representatives.
	   The council must include representatives from Golkar, the PDI,
the United Development (PPP), the Armed Forces and leading societal
groups.
	   The list of names proposed for the current council was submitted
by the House in April.
	   Other members due to be sworn in today include National
Commission on Human Rights member A.A. Baramuli, Chairman of the
Indonesian Ulemas Council (MUI) Hasan Basri, Chairman of the
Indonesian Union of Churches (PGI) Sularso Sopater, former East
Timor governor Mario Viegas Carrascalao, and PPPs Jusuf Syakir.
	   Two Chinese-Indonesians will also be included -- businesswoman
Siti Hartati Murdaya and leading community figure Yunus Yahya.
	   Next week the 45 members are expected to elect a new chairman
and vice chairmen.
	   ``The president and his cabinet are ready to have a more
interactive relationship with the Council,'' Akbar said. Copyright

	   The Yogyakarta Legal Aid Institute has urged Governor Sri Paku
Alam VIII to investigate R. Noto Suwito, former president
Soeharto's half-brother, for alleged complicity in a scandal
involving former Bantul regent Sri Roso Sudarmo.
	   ``We demand the governor fire Suwito from his position as chief
of Argo Mulyo village and investigate his involvement in the
case,'' A. Budi Hartono, operations director of the institute, said
here yesterday.
	   The institute alleged Suwito gave his personal guarantee that
Sri Roso would again be chosen for a second term as regent if he
could provide a letter promising a Rp 1 billion donation to the
Dharmais Foundation chaired by Soeharto.
	   Sri Roso has been temporarily suspended from his post to allow
police to investigate the case.

not have any material effect on the earnings of the group for the
current financial year ending Dec 31, 1998.

	   Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro claimed yesterday that a
relatively unknown local by the name of Yohanes Yacob had been
hired as former president Soeharto's lawyer and that he had not
appointed any foreign attorneys.
	   However serious questions remain about Yohanes' legal
credentials after a background check revealed that his name was
almost unknown in legal circles.
	   Soedjono made his statement in an apparent attempt to correct
some media reports that he had met foreign lawyers hired by
Soeharto.
	   The spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, Barman Zahir,
told The Jakarta Post that he was summoned by Soedjono yesterday
morning and revealed Yohanes' name to prove his argument.
	   ``Please notify the media to correct their reports saying that
Soeharto has hired a foreign lawyer. He is not a foreigner, he is
Indonesian,'' Soedjono was quoted by Barman as saying.
	   According to Barman, Soedjono did not give any details about
Yohanes.
	   Soedjono himself was not available for comment.
	   The revelation came as a surprise to many as Yohanes' name is
unheard of among prominent legal practitioners.
	   Attempts to track Yohanes down also proved almost fruitless as
few people had heard of him. Many even raised serious doubts as to
his true identity.
	   The chairmen of all three lawyer's organizations, Haryono
Tjitrosoebono of the Indonesian Bar Association (IKADIN), Yan Apul
from the Indonesian Advocates Association (AAI) and Yan Juanda
Saputra from the Association of Indonesian Lawyers (IPHI) all told
the Post that they had not heard of Yohanes.
	   ``I can assure you that his name is not on IKADIN's list,''
Haryono said.
	   Juanda Saputra however said that friends in the Attorney
General's Office had told him that Yohanes is the chairman of a
little known legal aid office in Tebet, South Jakarta.
	   Soedjono admitted Thursday that he had met lawyers representing
Soeharto. At the time he rushed off and refused to give further
details.
	   Demonstrators and opposition leaders have been demanding that an
investigation be conducted into whether Soeharto and his family
accumulated wealth illegally while he was in power.
	   Separately yesterday, Armed Forces spokesman Brig. Gen. A. Wahab
Mokodongan said he was not adverse to an investigation by the
Attorney General's office into corruption under Soeharto.
	   ``ABRI is part of the government. And the authority to conduct
the investigation is the Attorney General's office,'' he told
reporters.

UPDATES throughout with Arafat comments &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Disagreement over who will annul the PLO
founding charter and determine the scope of a final West Bank troop
withdrawal is holding up Israeli acceptance of the U.S. peace
initiative, a senior Israeli official said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with key Cabinet ministers
for three hours Monday to discuss the U.S. plan, which calls for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged Netanyahu
to make a decision soon, but informal U.S. deadlines have passed
without U.S. action against Israel. The United States presented its
plan in January, and the Palestinians have accepted it. Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat accused Israel of ``trying to avoid,'' a deal.
	   Israel TV reported Sunday that Netanyahu had agreed to a 13
percent pullback after initially saying he could hand over only 9
percent. Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the
Americans had not informed the Palestinians of any such agreement.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, would not comment
Monday on the report, but suggested that the size of that
withdrawal, the second of three promised by Israel, was no longer
an issue.
	   Netanyahu said that despite the delays, he still expected to
wrap up a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians by May
1999, as scheduled. ``This morning, we weren't just talking about
the second redeployment, but about the whole package which will
hopefully lead to a permanent peace agreement by next year,
provided the Palestinians stick to their commitments,'' he said.
	   Arafat was less optimistic. In Gaza, he told reporters that he
did not expect Israel to accept the offer and accused Netanyahu of
trying to avoid making a deal.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu wants iron-clad U.S. assurances that
the scope of the third pullback be determined by Israel, without
U.S. involvement.
	   ``We don't want an open-ended situation about a third
redeployment,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press. ``The American
commitment that we be the only ones to determine its scope must be
nailed down.''
	   Israel also insists that the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, annul sections of the PLO
founding charter that call for Israel's destruction, rather than
leave the vote to the much smaller PLO Executive Committee.
	   In the U.S. proposal, a vote by the PLO Executive Committee is
considered sufficient to annul those sections. However, Bar-Illan
said the PLO charter itself stipulates that it can only be changed
by a two-thirds majority of the Palestine National Council.
	   In other developments Monday, four Palestinian opposition
groups, including the Islamic militant group Hamas, said they would
turn down offers by Arafat to join his Cabinet _ an offer
apparently meant to neutralize the opposition groups.
	   ``It's up to them and not up to us,'' Arafat said. ``If they
want unity we are ready.''
	   However, Hamas and two secular PLO factions, the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said they would attend consultations with
Arafat on Tuesday concerning his planned Cabinet reshuffle.
	   ``We are going to listen to the president and to present our
views, but we are not going to join the new Cabinet,'' Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said.
	   A fourth group, Islamic Jihad, said it would not join the talks.
	   Arafat is under pressure from the Palestinian legislative
council to reshuffle his Cabinet. Last month, the 88-member
legislature gave Arafat two weeks to respond to complaints about
corruption and inaction or face his first no-confidence motion.
	   Arafat has said he would complete the reshuffle by Friday.
	   On Monday, the legislature voted to give the Palestinian leader
until June 25 at the latest to present his new Cabinet.

	   Indonesia's revised state budget agreed with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in January has to be expanded further to
accommodate bigger spending on social welfare programs, IMF Asia
Pacific director Hubert Neiss said yesterday.
	   Speaking to journalists after a luncheon with President B.J.
Habibie and economic ministers at the State Guest House, Neiss said
the budget had suffered a large deficit as a result of swelling
expenditure.
	   ``We have to accommodate a larger amount of expenditure for
socially related purposes, not only for subsidies but also for
medical purposes and education.
	   ``And we have to deal with the problems of a larger deficit
which if it gets too large and out of hand, ... results in higher
inflation.''
	   Neiss projected that the revenue side of the budget would be
smaller than previously assumed because of the deepening recession.
	   The current budget, balanced by law, is set at Rp 147.22
trillion (US$12.2 billion). This is a nominal increase of 45.6
percent over the 1997/1998 budget ending March 31.
	   Neiss, who arrived Wednesday afternoon, is expected to be in the
capital for three weeks. He is leading an IMF technical team
reviewing the country's economic reform programs before the IMF
board of directors makes a decision whether to disburse another
US$1 billion of the $10 billion bailout money committed by the fund
for Indonesia.
	   Indonesia has already received $4 billion from the IMF.
	   In addition to the budget, Neiss is going to review
macroeconomic assumptions, monetary policy and financial
restructuring.
	   Based on macroeconomic assumptions revised last April,
Indonesia's economic growth was projected to contract 4 percent
this year, inflation to rise 45 percent and the rupiah to stabilize
at Rp 6,000 per U.S. dollar.
	   However, the Central Bureau of Statistics projected recently
that gross domestic product would contract 10 percent and inflation
would rise 80 percent. The rupiah is currently being traded at less
than 13,500 against the dollar.
	   Neiss said a revision of macroeconomic assumptions was needed to
reflect reality following the political unrest in May which led to
the resignation of former president Soeharto.
	   Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita, who attended the luncheon, said he was
optimistic the IMF would disburse the next $1 billion standby loan
facility to Indonesia in July.
	   The disbursement was initially scheduled for June 4 but was
delayed following the political turmoil last month.
	   Mar'ie
	   Separately, former finance minister Mar'ie Muhammad said the IMF
must speed up its aid disbursement to Indonesia because the country
had implemented the sweeping economic reform programs faster than
scheduled.
	   ``I strongly urge the IMF and other donor institutions to speed
up the disbursement of their aid commitments,'' he told journalists
yesterday during a discussion.
	   He also said that since most of the reform programs had been
agreed and implemented, reviewing the macroeconomic assumption
figures should not take long.
	   The IMF promised the country in November that it would provided
$10 billion of the total $43 billion organized to back up the
economic reform programs.
	   It was initially agreed to disburse the bailout money in $3
billion tranches, to make sure that the country remains committed
to the agreed reforms.
	   Indonesia received the first installment of $3 billion in
November, but the second disbursement of $3 billion was delayed and
divided into three monthly installments, each amounting to $1
billion, following a failed attempt by the government to implement
the promised reforms. The second $1 billion payment, due this
month, will likely be made only next month.
	   Mar'ie said that disbursing $1 billion in the current situation
would not help much in boosting confidence in the crisis-hit
country.
	   ``If Indonesia fails to solve its crisis, this will spread to
other countries in the region,'' he said.
	   Mar'ie said the privatization of 12 state companies became more
important now to raise Rp 15 trillion (US$1.15 billion) to support
the budget.
	   He also said the government must quickly move to raise its
nontax revenue, especially the non-budgetary cash-pool managed by
ministries and state agencies, to help relieve the bleeding state
budget.
	   Although he declined to disclose the total figure of the nontax
revenue, Mar'ie said: ``Believe me, it is quite large.''
	   Although the cash pool was still being audited by the state
comptroller agency (BPKP), Mar'ie said, it would be best if the
money could be directly used to finance the current budget.
	   To satisfy the agreement with the IMF, the non-budgetary funds
have to be aligned in the budget to make sure of the transparent
use of the money.
	   The non-budgetary cash-pool includes the so-called reforestation
fund and the state social security fund.
	   The reforestation fund, introduced by former president Soeharto
in 1990, has been collected from forest concessionaires. The use
and the amount of the fund, however, is not made public.
	   Between 1996 and 1997 alone, more than Rp 2 trillion was
collected, while for the 1998/1999 fiscal year, the target is Rp
1.6 trillion.
	   The state social security fund, managed by the Ministry of
Manpower, is similarly untransparent. The total amount is believed
to be more than Rp 6 trillion.

Greek veto dooms EU effort to revive relations with Turkey

 &UR; With BC-EU Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders failed Monday to
mend their frayed ties with Turkey after Greece objected to
concessions that might have put Ankara on a list of nations in line
to join the EU.
	   At a two-day European summit, British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
the current EU president, proposed effectively reversing last
December's decision in which the leaders kept Turkey at bay while
inviting Cyprus and 10 East European nations into membership talks.
	   Blair proposed what Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok called a
``repackaging'' of conditions for Turkey to start membership talks.
But Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis vetoed that, saying, ``We
have to make no excuses'' for the decision to keep Turkey on hold.
	   Turkey was snubbed because of its poor human rights record,
territorial disputes with Greece and occupation of northern Cyprus.
Instead, it was offered a special relationship, including annual
summits with EU leaders.
	   Blair proposed a more conciliatory stance toward Ankara.
	   ``We really do need to make an effort to get relations back on
track. We are trying to find a form of words that the Greek prime
minister might be able to agree to,'' his spokesman, Alastair
Campbell, told reporters. ``The European Union's relations with
Turkey have stalled.''
	   Last month, Greece made the holding of an EU-Turkey foreign
ministers meeting impossible by demanding the Europeans spell out,
ahead of the event, all of Turkey's failings.
	   Officials said Blair proposed to make it impossible for Greece
to issue such demands.
	   British officials sidestepped reporters' questions whether the
aim was to make Turkey a formal candidate for membership.
	   After last December's snub, Turkey froze all relations with the
EU. The failure to renew the relationship here came despite recent
fence-mending efforts by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
	   Greece maintains a veto on EU aid funds for Turkey. Cyprus, too,
complicates matters for the EU. It has opened membership talks with
the Greek Cypriot side after Turkish Cypriots refused to join an
all-Cyprus negotiating team.

	   President B.J. Habibie has claimed that his ascent to the
presidency was not contrived by anyone except God and has indicated
that he might not run in the forthcoming polls.
	   ``My presence here (as president) was not contrived by anyone,
including myself. As religious people we should at the utmost
conclude that it was engineered by Allah,'' Habibie told a group of
47 rectors from the State Institute of Islamic Studies (IAIN)
during a meeting at the Bina Graha presidential office yesterday.
	   On Thursday, Habibie declared that he would not seek another
term in office.
	   He reiterated this statement yesterday, saying that God had made
it his destiny to lead the country in its process of
democratization through to the election of a new democratic
government next year.
	   He appealed for the nation to give his cabinet time to work
toward healing the country's dying economy because hastily
introduced measures would only make the country even more chaotic.
	   Comparing his position to that of a doctor, Habibie said: ``The
decision is a matter of life or death. If the doctor gives the
wrong medication and the patient dies, he can not just laugh and
say 'oh, I was wrong'''.
	   The IAIN rectors in a prepared statement to the media said they
supported Habibie and that his government should be given time to
resolve the crisis.
	   They called for an end to the polemic on Habibie's presidency,
pointing out that a prolonged debate on the issue could distract
attention away from the urgent reform agenda.
	   Mission
	   In a meeting with members of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce
and Industry on Thursday, Habibie emphasized that he just wanted to
lead the nation through the general election in May next year then
onward to the democratic election of a new president, adding that
he hoped the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) would convene in
December 1999 to undertake this task.
	   He said his mission was only to deliver a democratically elected
government to the nation.
	   ``Do not think that I want to be appointed president again,''
Habibie told the business people.
	   Habibie was elected vice president in March and replaced his
mentor Soeharto on May 21, when the latter finally succumbed to
massive pressure for him resign after 32 years in power.
	   ``When the MPR elects a president and vice president it will
obviously not be me...When on Dec. 22, 1999, the MPR general
session has elected a president and vice president, I will consider
my task as president completed,'' he added.
	   After retiring from the presidency, Habibie said he wished to
dedicate himself to the task of improving Indonesian human
resources.
	   In a meeting with senior editors last Saturday, Habibie also
hinted that he would be satisfied by merely witnessing the country
enter the 21st century with a new president.
	   Opposition leaders and students continue to insist that Habibie
is only a transitional leader and are demanding fresh polls as soon
as possible.
	   In an apparent demonstration of support for the new President,
top Armed Forces (ABRI) generals met with him on Thursday and
promised their loyalty to their new supreme commander.
	   ABRI Commander Gen. Wiranto strongly expressed his support for
Habibie's leadership.
	   ``Continually questioning the president's legitimacy is a waste
of time,'' Wiranto said.

	   Ignoring the stench and market bustle, President B.J. Habibie
made his first ever visit to a traditional market in Jatinegara and
the Cipinang rice depot, both in East Jakarta, yesterday.
	   Habibie talked casually with traders and asked them to tell him
their troubles.
	   He claimed that this was the only way for him to truly know the
market price of rice and its supply.
	   He described himself as a doctor, probing for the correct
prognosis.
	   ``Like a patient who must frankly confide his aches to a
physician... you must tell me the real truth so the correct
prescription can be prescribed,'' he told traders.
	   A wholesaler went up and proposed Habibie order the State
Logistics Agency (Bulog) to increase the purchasing price of
unhusked rice from farmers to increase their income.
	   Habibie smilingly retorted: ``But then it would not be the
farmers but you traders who would get more money.''
	   Most traders told Habibie that the daily supply of goods was
enough, though prices continued to rise each day.
	   Economists have said the current Rp 1,000 per kg price of rice
is too low compared to imported rice prices which exceed Rp 3,000
per kg.
	   Security was lax throughout the visit. Even three-wheeled bajaj
taxis were free to move about.
	   The presidential security team sometimes lost Habibie in the
bustling market as his small frame moved quickly from one stall to
another in between large stacks of rice sacks.
	   Habibie was accompanied by Minister of Defense and
Security/Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto, Minister/State
Secretary Akbar Tandjung, Minister of Industry and Trade Rahardi
Ramelan and Bulog chief Beddu Amang.
	   The group went to Jatinegara after staying about 30 minutes in
Cipinang. They all rode in the same van.
	   Wide-eyed, Habibie joyfully recounted his maiden visit to a
traditional market.
	   ``Just now I saw my favorite salted fish. Actually I wanted to
buy it, but I felt ashamed because the trader might have refused my
money if I tried to pay,'' Habibie said after the visit.
	   Habibie, however, was confident he would eventually get the
fish. ``I will tell ibu (his wife) that I want the fish and ask her
to buy it,'' Habibie cheekily remarked.
	   ``I will turn 62 this month but I have never been to the central
market. Not because I don't care but I had other duties, you
know''.

	   ARAB Malaysian Development Bhd has received the Securities
Commission's approval to lift the moratorium on all 28,152,000
shares representing about 12.24 per cent of the issued and paid-up
capital of Powertek Bhd. In a statement on behalf of AMDB,
Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank Bhd said the lifting of the moratorium
is subject to the following conditions: 1. In the event the
proposed disposal of 55,701,600 shares by Cergas Unggul Sdn Bhd to
Tanjong Plc announced on Feb 6 and 27, 1998 is varied or called
off, the lifting of the moratorium will be rescinded; and 2. A
moratorium is to be imposed on Powertek Moratorium Shares upon

disposal is now subject to the approval of Tanjong and AMDB
shareholders at their extraordinary general meeting later this
month.

Third day of clashes as England beats Tunisia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Romanian coach, latest numbers from
fan violence; EDITS; WILL be UPDATED with Germany-United States &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Stade Velodrome in Marseille was the calm eye
of a terrible storm Monday, as England defeated Tunisia 2-0 in
peaceful sunshine even as fans fought with police in the southern
resort city for the third straight day.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas on a beach to break up clashes
between English and Tunisian supporters watching the afternoon
match on a huge TV screen set up for people who lacked tickets to
the game.
	   There were other skirmishes before and after the game, prompting
at least a dozen arrests and an unknown number of injuries.
	   Monday's clashes followed street violence Sunday night that cut
a path of destruction through downtown Marseille and left 36 people
hospitalized, three of them badly hurt. One Englishman had an
artery cut in his neck, and a policeman suffered multiple
fractures.
	   All told, more than 60 Englishmen, Tunisians and Frenchmen were
in jail.
	   ``England seems to be intent on being world champion at this,''
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``It is not exclusively an
English problem, but again and again the English are involved.''
	   In other games Monday, Romania downed Colombia 1-0 at Lyon. The
United States played Germany in a late match at Paris.
	   The clashes in Marseille followed a night of violence Sunday
between drunken English hooligans and Tunisia supporters, backed by
gangs from the city's north suburbs, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Police put a lock on Marseille early Monday, bringing in
reinforcements, putting a partial ban on alcohol and searching and
escorting arriving English soccer fans.
	   Cooper said some of England's hardened hooligans appeared to
head to Marseille just to stir up more violence, with little
interest in following the game.
	   ``(It) shows that they are not interested in the football, only
in what comes after,'' Cooper said. ``... We are determined not to
allow a small group of idiots spoil the party.''
	   Inside the stadium, the game took place oblivious to the
troubles outside. Alan Shearer scored late in the 42nd minute and
Paul Scholes in 89th in a game dominated by the heavy favored
English in their first game of the tournament.
	   ``We could have scored three or four goals,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said. ``We could have taken them to the cleaners.''
	   At Lyon, Adrian Ilie's 15-meter chip shot in first-half injury
time kept Colombia from avenging a 3-1 defeat to Romania in the
1994 World Cup.
	   ``We repeated history from four years ago at USA World Cup '94,
but with a different score,'' Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu
said.
	   Violence first erupted in Marseille on Saturday night in the Old
Port entertainment district, when fans clashed with police and
Tunisian supporters. Several English fans were arrested in the
melees.
	   The hooliganism was universally condemned.
	   ``What these fans are doing is that they come to a game to
fight, to cause trouble, to make war,'' said former Brazilian star
Pele. ``This is disgusting. The security, the police, should act
quickly to put these people in jail as an example to others.''
	   In England, Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned as a ``complete
disgrace'' the rampaging English fans.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and they have just got to put a stop to it.''

	   TAIPING, Fri. - The call for the resignation of the Federation
of Malaysian Consumers' Association's secretary-general has been
described as mischievous and uncalled for by its president.
	   Prof Mohd Hamdan Adnan said N. Marimuthu was merely carrying out
his duties and was not politically motivated by anyone.
	   He said if Marimuthu was politically backed by anyone or had any
political intentions, then he would personally ask him to resign
immediately.
	   ``Fomca is a non-profitable and non-political movement with a
social responsibilty to its members and consumers.
	   ``Therefore, when the movement takes up any consumer issue or
case, it has no political motive,'' said Hamdan.
	   It was reported today that Fomca vice-president Mohd Zuki Ragam,
who is also Terengganu Consumers Association chairman, had called
for Marimuthu's resignation.
	   It was also reported that Marimuthu was aligned with certain
opposition party members.
	   Hamdan also said the non-governmental organisation's Press
conference held at the MTUC building on June 9th was to discuss the
police's refusal in granting permits and the cancellation of such
permits for public gatherings.
	   ``The meeting was not politically motivated as it had a public
interest,''
	   he said, adding that those present were consumers irrespective
whether they were from political or non-governmental organisations.
	   Meanwhile, Marimuthu said he was willing to resign as
secretary-general if he had any political gains from the
federation.
	   ``I have proof that there are certain people who want to destroy
the consumer movement in the country,'' he said.

	   PT Djayanti Group, controlled by timber baron Burhan Uray, plans
to develop 35,000 hectares of rice fields in West Mimika regency,
Irian Jaya.
	   An executive of the Djayanti group's Irian Jaya division, Busli
Saraka, said yesterday that in the first stage the company would
develop a 300 hectare-rice field in the company's forest
concessions in Mimika.
	   The company has already opened a 17-hectare rice field in the
area.
	   ``The development of rice fields is badly needed in Irian Jaya
to help the province become self-sufficient in rice production,''
he was quoted as saying by Antara yesterday.
	   Governor of Irian Jaya province Freddy Numberi said that the
provincial government supported the company's plan and asked the
Djayanti group to involve local people in the rice field project.

	   KLANG, Fri. - The DAP national leaders and the Selangor
committee have failed to reach a consensus on the disciplinary
action taken against three of its leaders at a meeting last night.
	   A source said the closed door meeting at the Selangor DAP
headquarters ended abruptly after sacked national publicity
secretary Wee Choo Keong was allowed to give his side of the story.
	   The source said Wee was disturbed several times during the
speech, forcing the meeting to be adjourned.
	   The other two leaders facing disciplinary action are national
vice- chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing. Both have
been suspended.
	   Party leaders refused to comment when approached by reporters.
	   ``We have been barred from speaking to the media. The leaders
have told us to stop speaking to the press on the matter,'' said
one member who refused to be named.
	   The party's chairman, Dr Chen Man Hin, his deputy Karpal Singh
and secretary-general Lim Kit Siang also refused to speak to the
Press.
	   ``I have already said what I have to say. There is nothing more
to add,''
	   said Lim.
	   Karpal: This is a party matter. I have no comment.
	   The media were earlier barred from entering the building on
grounds that it was a party affair.
	   Selangor DAP chairman Chua Kow Eng said the national leaders
called for the meeting to explain the matter to members.
	   Asked if a consensus was reached at the meeting, Chua said it
was a divided decision.
	   ``No vote can be carried out as those present were not
delegates.''
	   In Seremban, many DAP branch leaders in the State are against
the present composition of the disciplinary committee which is
going to hear the case of the three suspended members.
	   A branch leader who did not wish to be identified said the three
should be given a fair hearing and a chance to defend themselves.
	   He said the two committee members - Teng Chang Kim and Ronnie
Liu - should disqualify themselves as they had taken part in the
CEC's decision to suspend and remove Liew, Fung and Wee. The
three-member committee is headed by party vice-chairman Ahmad Nor.
	   He said the statement made by State DAP chairman, Wong Zee Nyok
that members in the State were in full support of any decision
taken by the CEC was made in his personal capacity and did not
reflect the opinion at the grassroots level.

	   State-run electricity firm PLN has cut the power supply to the
go cart track at Sentul circuit yesterday after the latter failed
to pay an outstanding bill of Rp 7 million (US$700) for the first
six months of this year.
	   Head of PLN's Bogor branch Pandoe A said yesterday the
management of Sentul circuit, controlled by former President
Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra, had ignored
several warnings on the late payment.
	   ``As a result, we have had to cut the power supply temporarily
to Sentul circuit,'' he was quoted as saying by Antara yesterday.
	   Pandoe admitted that it was impossible for his company to take
the action when Soeharto was still in power several months ago.
	   ``But after Soeharto resigned from presidency, we feel obliged
to cut the power supply,'' he said.

	   THE supervising committee on independent television stations
seems certain to grant iTV a 678-day delay in its first instalment
of its royalty fee, PM's Office Permanent Secretary Prasit
Damrongchai said.
	   In an interview published in Monday's Thai Rath, the crusading
newspaper which opposes the concession fee deferment, Prasit said
the state had to make a hard decision -- reaping some financial
benefits from a late payment or gaining no benefits at all from the
collapsed venture.
	   ''Broadcasting frequencies are state properties. In a case of
joint-venture operations, should the company fail, the state would
lose revenue,'' he said, adding that in the long run the government
might recover the fees, should it allow the station operator to
complete the 30-year contract.
	   The PM's Office permanent secretary, who chairs the coordinating
committee on the supervision of the UHF television broadcasting
operations, said the committee had appointed a working group to
scrutinise the iTV petition to defer the Bt300 million fee payment
which is due on July 3.
	   According to the working group review, the station had two
factual problems -- of having to wait for more than one year to use
the Public Relations Department's facilities in order to expand its
broadcasting relay stations and the adverse impact of the plunging
baht.
	   Based on past Cabinet decisions, the group ruled that iTV should
be permitted to postpone its payment of royalty fee equivalent to
the time it had to wait for government facilities plus another 180
days, the duration which the government allowed other contractors
to delay payments owing to the impact of the currency volatility.
	   Prasit predicted the committee would Tuesday endorse the working
group's findings before forwarding its report to the Cabinet.
	   Should the Cabinet agree with its report, he said, iTV would be
notified of the government decision. Either of the contractual
parties, namely iTV and the PM's Permanent Secretary Office, could
appeal for an arbitrator's ruling if it found the government's
review unacceptable, he added.
	   The Federation of Administrative Legal Professionals Monday
circulated an open letter demanding a government review to ensure
the survival of iTV.
	   Citing the constitutional provisions to ensure public
participation and ownership of broadcasting frequencies, the
government had a policy obligation to facilitate the operations of
the independent television station, the statement said.
	   New Aspiration MP Muk Sulaiman Monday filed a motion requesting
the House committee on justice to open a public hearing to clarify
issues regarding the government review of iTV's petition.

	   Eight foreign companies, mostly from Malaysia, have received
licenses from the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) to develop
oil palm plantations in the country, it was announced yesterday.
	   Director General of Plantations A. Rante Tondok said the size of
the eight companies' plantations would total about 342,000
hectares.
	   He said that they planned to invest about US$1 billion in the
plantation projects.
	   ``The projects are scattered all over Indonesia, especially in
eastern Indonesia,'' Tondok told a news conference.
	   He said the investment board was also processing the permits for
six other foreign investors to start similar projects.
	   Last year the government closed the oil palm sector to foreign
investors to protect domestic companies and to prevent excessive
land acquisition by foreigners.
	   However, the government eased the investment restrictions in
January and allowed foreign investors to enter the business if
their plantation areas are located in the eastern part of the
country and if they operate in partnership with local companies.
	   In February the government totally freed the oil palm industry
to foreign investors to comply with the reform program imposed by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
	   Tondok said there are currently 50 foreign investors developing
oil palm plantations in Indonesia, covering 926,650 hectares. About
80 percent of these are Malaysian companies.
	   Before the freeze Malaysian companies signed joint venture
agreements to develop 1.5 million hectares of oil palm estates,
mainly in Sumatra and Kalimantan.
	   According to the Directorate General of Plantations, Indonesian
investors controlled about 2.4 million hectares as of last year, of
which 1.19 million were owned by big private companies, 443,000 by
state companies, and 824,000 by smallholders.
	   Global crude palm oil production is estimated to be 24.7 million
tons this year, while consumption is estimated at just 17 million
tons.
	   Indonesia is expected to produce 5.9 million tons of crude palm
oil (CPO) this year, up from 5.3 million in 1997. It is the world's
second largest producer after Malaysia.
	   Tondok said that foreign exchange earnings from the forestry
sector are expected to reach $5.7 billion this year, up from $5.3
billion in 1997.
	   Tondok said that the increase was partly due to increasing
prices of CPO and several other commodities in the world market.

	   GURUN, Fri. - An Australian soldier was killed when a hand
grenade he was carrying exploded during a military exercise at the
Hobart Army Camp this morning.
	   The 23-year-old-soldier, whose identity was withheld, died on
the spot in the incident about 11.35am.
	   The explosion caused the victim's lower torso to be blown away.
	   The soldier's body was sent to the Sungai Petani Hospital for a
post- mortem.
	   Arrangements are under way to contact his next-of-kin.
	   It is learnt that the grenade exploded prematurely as the
soldier, who was walking alone at the time, was about to use it
during the training mission.
	   The soldier, attached to the Australian Rifle Company, was among
120 Australian soldiers undergoing a routine training mission at
the camp.
	   No Malaysian soldier was involved in the training which, it is
learnt, would continue despite the tragedy.
	   The Australian soldiers have been training at the camp since
Monday and their stint is scheduled to end on June 17.
	   Kuala Muda police chief Assistant Commisioner Mohd Ariffin Ahmat
confirmed the incident.
	   He declined to disclose details of the incident pending
completion of investigations.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England beat Tunisia, 2-0, in the
Velodrome Stadium on Monday, but less conclusive battles flared
off-and-on outside, with tear gas grenades, riot police charges,
and ambulances wailing through this rough port city.
	   Fifteen people were slightly injured, police said, and another,
hit on the head by a bottle, was hospitalized. Twenty seven people
were detained.
	   Tension ran high Monday night in the heavily policed streets of
the Old Port where English fans were buying alcohol in supermarkets
and some bars, despite a post-match ban. Bars were ordered to close
at 11:00 p.m., (2100 GMT), hours earlier than normal, and not sell
alcohol.
	   Riot police charged small groups of English fans, some of whom
said they wanted to return home. Nervous merchants closed for the
night, but stood guard outside their shops. In one charge, a
passer-by was trampled by riot police, and suffered an epileptic
fit.
	   Many fans trying to leave the city were put in police vans and
escorted to the train station.
	   The latest clashes came after a night of window-smashing
violence at the Old Port which left 36 people in hospital, three of
them badly hurt, and at least 50 Englishmen, Tunisians and
Frenchmen in jail.
	   One Englishman had an artery cut in his neck, and a policeman
suffered multiple fractures before sporadic rioting petered out in
the early morning hours.
	   French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who has warned
hooligans they will be dealt with swiftly and harshly, said Monday
the offenders should be deported.

	   MALACCA, Fri. - In line with the party's move to promote the
status of women, the State MCA has endorsed the formation of six
new Wanita branches.
	   The branches, which come under the Kota Melaka division, are Tun
Leong Yew Koh Garden (174 members), Nam Sing Garden (82), Aman
Garden (60), Puteri Hang Li Poh Garden (69), Taman Laksamana Cheng
Ho (75) and Permatang Garden (79).
	   State MCA liaison chief Datuk Gan Boon Leong said more of such
branches would be set up to encourage women to be involved in
politics.
	   ``We have set a target to recruit some 3,000 women before the
year-end.''
	   Gan, who is also State Human Resource, Health and Consumer
Affairs Committee chairman, said Malacca was the first State to
have all-women branches.
	   MCA president Datuk Seri Ling Liong Sik will launch the branches
on June 21.

	   THAILAND is confident that Australia's recent state elections,
which saw a growing support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party
with an anti-Asian attitude, would not be translated at the
national level.
	   According to a Foreign Ministry statement, the Queensland state
elections, held last Saturday in which Hanson's party won 23 per
cent of the votes and is likely to obtain 10 seats in the state
legislature, revolved around local issues like the gun law and
falling commodity prices.
	   Hanson's anti-Asian views were apparently not a major issue at
the elections.
	   The statement also said that Thailand is confident that the
government in Canberra and the national political parties including
the overwhelming majority of the Australian electorate continue to
repudiate the views expounded by Hanson as can be evidenced from
the fact that in a recent national opinion poll the One Nation
party had received support from 6 per cent of the electorate.

	   Minister of Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusubroto has ordered
state oil and gas company Pertamina to retender contracts awarded
to former President Soeharto's family and cronies.
	   Kuntoro said the contracts which would be retendered included
those for the procurement of fuel, goods and materials for the
company, and the shipment of Pertamina products.
	   ``The bidding process is aimed at weeding out companies which
charge Pertamina excessively high costs,'' Kuntoro said, adding
that the bidding would be opened to all interested parties even
though the existing contracts have not yet expired.
	   Companies which currently hold the contracts should cut their
prices below the level proposed in the new call for tenders if they
wanted to continue their operations, Kuntoro said.
	   If they refuse to do so the contracts will be transferred to
companies which offer more competitive prices, he added.
	   ``The retendering process does not mean that existing contracts
have been annulled. Companies which currently work with Pertamina
are being offered the chance to continue working with the company,
provided they lower their prices,'' Kuntoro said, reiterating his
earlier commitment to honoring all contracts already awarded to
private companies.
	   Kuntoro said Pertamina would retender the US$46 million a year
contract to procure catalysts and chemicals for the production of
fuel oil in the Balongan refinery in West Java. Bids will be
welcomed by the company from next week.
	   An informed source said the contract was currently held by PT
Catalyst Indopratama, a company partly owned by former president
Soeharto's son Hutomo Mandala Putra, who is better known as Tommy.
	   According to the source, the company charges Pertamina $2,500
per ton of catalyst, compared to a price proposal of less than
$2,000 per ton submitted by two rival companies during the initial
bidding process.
	   He said Pertamina would also reopen competitive bidding for the
import of fuel next month. Fuel imports have for decades been
monopolized by PT Permindo, a company controlled by the Bimantara
Group led by Soeharto's second son Bambang Trihatmodjo.
	   Permindo would be allowed to participate in the bidding process
if it wanted to attempt to win the contract based on its own merits
alone, Kuntoro said.
	   The import of crude oil, which was for decades monopolized by
Perta Oil Marketing Ltd, controlled by Tommy and Soeharto's crony
Mohammad ``Bob'' Hassan, would be taken under the wing of
Pertamina's own trading division from next month, Kuntoro added.
	   Pertamina said earlier that between 120 and 149 companies which
do business with the company were owned by Soeharto's family and
cronies.
	   Soeharto's family dominates the shipping of liquefied natural
gas (LNG), crude oil and fuel, gas pipeline network development,
geothermal power and the development of refineries and many other
aspects of the hydrocarbon sector.
	   Analysts said the companies obtained contracts from Pertamina
through special appointment or quasi-tenders. The terms offered by
the companies were frequently uncompetitive but the contracts were
nevertheless awarded because of their close relations with the
former president.
	   The House of Representatives said last week that they supported
Kuntoro's plan to ask the Attorney General's Office and the
Development and Finance Comptroller (BPKP) to audit the legal and
financial content of the contracts awarded to the companies.
	   Legislators believe the companies marked up prices for contracts
to work with Pertamina as a matter of course.
	   Kuntoro also noted yesterday that contracts which would be
retendered were only those which had been awarded to the companies
through a competitive bidding process.
	   ``Contracts which were awarded without any bidding procedure
will be annulled,'' he said.

	   RICE millers Monday called on the government to allow them to
hire foreign workers because so few Thais showed any interest.
	   Bamrung Kritpakorn, vice-president of the Rice Mill Association
and head of the committee to solve the labour shortage in the
mills, said after the Transport Union advertised jobs for 20,000
workers in the mills for a week, only 17 Thai workers turned up for
the test.
	   ''This clearly shows Thai workers detest hard labour in the
mill. We would like the government to further relax the foreign
workers ban,'' he said.
	   The millers reasoned that hundreds of mills were already forced
to shut down because they could not find Thais to work for them.
	   They have been calling for the government to relax the
restriction after the policy of repatriating foreign workers was
introduced early this year.
	   Under the policy, foreign workers are only allowed to work in 11
fishing provinces.
	   The government last month allowed millers to hire foreign
workers until July 10. The Job Placement Department will help them
recruit workers through job fairs.
	   Bamrung said if the government did not heed its call to further
relax the restriction, the remaining 300 rice mills will be forced
to shut down. This would result in the loss of Bt700 million in
revenue per day and the country would also lose income from rice
exports. Of this year's export target of six million tonnes, only
2.7 million tonnes have been exported to date.
	   A job fair will be launched tomorrow in 19 northeastern
provinces and on Friday in Saraburi seeking 20,000 workers for the
mills in Ayuthaya, Nakhon Pathom, Suphan Buri, Chainat, Saraburi,
Chachoengsao, Nakhon Nayok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Pathum Thani and
Bangkok. They will receive a monthly salary of Bt5,400, free
accommodation and a free sack of rice every month.

	   Minister of Forestry and Plantations Muslimin Nasution said
yesterday that the government would grant no new forest concessions
in order to prevent further deterioration of the country's forests.
	   The minister said that logging contracts would be limited to
areas whose concessions had been revoked by the government.
	   ``The open bidding system for such forest areas is being
prepared,'' Muslimin told journalists.
	   He said that adopting an open bidding system to appoint forest
concessionaires would help to ensure transparency in the management
of the country's forest resources.
	   The auction of forest concessions is stipulated in the
Supplementary Memorandum on Economics and Financial Policies, a
reform package agreed by the government with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in exchange for a US$43 billion bailout
package.
	   Under the memorandum, Indonesia is supposed to introduce the
auction system by the end of this month.
	   ``The bidding system will be designed in a such way as to
prevent the concentration of forest concession ownership in only a
handful of big companies,'' Muslimin said.
	   The government first began to award forest concessions to
private companies through the 1971 Forestry Law, which granted
concessionaires the sole right to exploit and cultivate forests in
their concession area.
	   Private concessions -- which cover more than 61 million hectares
of forest -- are controlled by 50 leading groups, including the
Kalimanis Group owned by Mohammad ``Bob'' Hasan, Barito Pacific
Timber owned by Prajogo Pangestu, Sujono Varinata's Djajanti Group,
PT Alas Kesuma owned by Handjaja and Nana Suparna and the Mercu
Buana Group owned by Probosutedjo, Soeharto's half-brother.
	   Informed sources say most of the forest concessions are also
partly owned by Soeharto's children.
	   In a related development, about 300 environmentalists staged a
demonstration at the ministry Thursday. They demanded Muslimin
replace the existing forestry regulations, which they claimed only
benefited a handful of companies, mostly owned by the former
leader's family and friends.
	   The protesters, wearing green headbands, chanted slogans and
carried banners calling on the government to use the proceeds of
the country's forest resources for the interests of the whole of
society, not just for a small clique.
	   Meanwhile, a group of forestry businesspeople announced
yesterday the establishment of a new forestry organization called
the Indonesian Forestry Society for Reform (MPI Reformasi) to
replace the existing MPI, an organization once controlled by
Soeharto's long-time crony Bob Hasan.
	   The new organization pledged to help the Ministry of Forestry
manage the country's forests in an environmentally sustainable
manner which would benefit locals, and to abolish several levies
imposed by Bob Hasan's MPI which they said burdened timber
companies.
	   The new organization, headed by Sofyan Siambaton as the general
chairman, said that it had named the minister of forestry and
plantations as its patron, and named the ministry's inspector
general, Hariadi Dharmawan, and former directors general Hendarsun
S. Sanusiputra and Titus Sarijanto as its advisors.
	   Forestry experts and the presidents of state timber companies PT
Inhutani I to V are named on the lists of members.
	   Other key executives of the MPI Reformasi include chairmen Akie
Setiawan, Soetono, Moh. Toha and Aris Adhianto and Zain Masyhur as
the secretary-general.
	   MPI is a holding(umbrella) organization of all forest-related
organizations, including the Association of Indonesian Wood Panel
Producers (Apkindo), the Association of Indonesian Concessionaires
(APHI) and the Indonesian Saw Mill Association (ISA).
	   MPI under Bob Hasan and its subsidiaries have been criticized
for their crony-capitalism and rent-seeking practices.
	   The head of the new organization said that it was scheduled to
meet Muslimin next Wednesday.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Umno Youth today supported Deputy Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's decision to stop granting
Government contracts under the umbrella concept.
	   Saying that it concerned the survival of small and medium
contractors, the movement said the issue had long been raised and
much discontent had been brought forward at Umno Youth's many
forums.
	   ``The concept had caused many issues of injustice to arise in
the award of contracts. Because of that, talk of nepotism was rife.
	   ``Therefore, the Deputy Prime Minister's decision had brought
back the contractors' confidence in the Government and its pledge
to help small and medium businesses,'' Umno Youth said in a Press
statement by its entrepreneur development council chairman Nordin
Mohd Noor today.
	   Yesterday, Anwar announced that the awarding of government
contracts to build village roads under the umbrella concept had
been stopped due to complaints of unfair distribution.
	   Anwar said the selection of contractors would now be handled by
district offices as was the practice before the concept was
introduced by the Treasury last year.
	   On this, Umno Youth said it felt this would expand the scope of
opportunities for small and medium contractors, apart from
restoring the condition of those affected by the current economic
problems.
	   ``This decision also paves the way for more accountability and
transparency.
	   ``After this, it is hoped elements of favouritism and cronyism
in granting contracts can be eliminated,'' it said.
	   The umbrella concept which was introduced last year involved
granting jobs to established contractors who in turn would get
small contractors to handle the breakdown of the tasks involved.
	   Yesterday, Anwar said while the concept had its merits, it had
also drawn many complaints, especially from small contractors who
said they had been left out.

Chief inspector: Iraq close to being free from U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs; ADDS more quotes, background on why Butler is
optimistic about lifting sanctions. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations could soon lift
sanctions on Iraq if Baghdad fully cooperates with its arms
experts, the chief U.N. weapons inspector said Monday.
	   In another sign of flexibility, Richard Butler said his experts
_ who had previously insisted on conclusive evidence _ are willing
to acknowledge that it is impossible to verify every Iraqi claim
that it has met U.N. demands for the elimination of its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council will allow the lifting of the embargo
only after Butler's U.N. Special Commission certifies that Iraq has
no more illegal weapons. The sanctions were imposed following
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``The light at the end of the tunnel today is more visible than
anytime,'' Butler said at the end of his three-day talks with Iraqi
officials on disarming Iraq of its illegal weapons.
	   Butler announced Sunday that he had reached an agreement with
Baghdad on a 2-month timetable to end U.N. disarmament activities
in Iraq. At the end of that period, he and Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz are expected to meet again to review the situation.
	   ``In my view if that work is done satisfactorily ... I believe
we should be in a position'' to prepare for lifting the sanctions,
Butler told a news conference Monday before leaving for Kuwait en
route to Australia to attend an arms control meeting there.
	   ``I am very positive about it. It is good news,'' Butler added.
	   He said he is optimistic because during his latest visit he felt
Iraqi officials were serious about implementing the deal that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan signed with Iraq in February _ that
granted weapons inspectors free access to all sites in Iraq,
including presidential palaces.
	   ``The memorandum of understanding not only gave us access to
presidential sites, but actually involved a very serious promise of
full cooperation by Iraq with UNSCOM,'' Butler said.
	   Diplomats in Baghdad said privately that Butler and his
inspectors were under pressure from some U.N. Security Council
members _ France and Russia _ to end the inspection as soon as
possible.
	   They said the inspectors were finding it difficult to prolong
the inspections by insisting on proof of some minor details.
	   U.N. inspectors also rejected Iraqi arguments that it had
unilaterally destroyed _ without keeping any records _ many weapons
before the inspection process began.
	   ``It may be that we won't ever get 100 percent verification
where physical parts have been torn apart and dispersed,'' Butler
said.
	   He said searches for missile and chemical weapons are nearing
their end. Verification of Iraq's past germ warfare program is
cumbersome but the two sides have ``found a new way to deal with
it,'' Butler said without elaborating.
	   During his talks here, Butler presented Iraq with a list of
obligations, which he said Iraq must fulfill to back its claims
that it has dismantled all banned chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.

World Cup relief in Chile: Salas will play against Austria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARIGNAC, France (AP) _ Striker Marcelo Salas brightened things
up for his Chilean teammates, showing up for an easy practice
Monday after suffering a minor injury and making it clear he'll be
ready for Wednesday's World Cup match against Austria.
	   Salas, the Cup's scoring co-leader with two goals, suffered a
minor pull on his right abductor muscle five minutes into Sunday's
practice.
	   ``He's doing well, he's improving nicely,'' said team doctor
Eugenio Valdecantos, who treated Salas immediately. He said Salas
trained lightly Monday and ``everything indicates he'll be ready to
play as of Tuesday.''
	   The Chileans travel Tuesday to Saint Etienne for their Group B
match.
	   Team trainer Fernando Zamorano said Salas was treated with
massages, heat pads and anti-inflammatories.
	   Salas, who scored twice for Chile in its 2-2 tie with Italy on
Thursday, could be seen jogging during the otherwise closed
practice session.

 &UR; Nigerian junta frees nine prominent political detainees
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reaction by human rights lawyer, names prisoners. Edits
to conform, no pickup. ADDS byline.
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leadership Monday
ordered the release of nine of the country's most prominent
political prisoners to ``facilitate the process of national
reconciliation.''
	   The prisoners to be released include such well-known figures as
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979
and Beko Ransome-Kuti, a pro-democracy activist jailed since 1995.
	   But Nigeria's best known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not mentioned in the statement from
David Atta, the press secretary for Nigeria's new military leader,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   It not immediately clear when the releases would occur.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the release of some detainees and
prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation and
reconstruction,'' Atta said adding other prisoners ``would be given
consideration from time.''
	   Gani Fawehinmi, an attorney and one of Nigeria's most vocal
critics of military rule praised the move as a ``joyous step
towards reconciliation.''
	   ``This is incredible. This is fantastic,'' said Fawehinmi.
``This gives us hope that something good will begin to happen
soon.''
	   He noted however that a number of prominent political figures
remained behind bars. ``They must go further and release all
detainees and all prisoners still in the gulag.''
	   Abubakar came to power a little less than a week ago, following
the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose five-year-dictatorship became
an international pariah for its human rights record.
	   In announcing the release of the prisoners, the new military
leader urged those granted amnesty to ``cooperate'' with the
government to create ``the country of our dreams.''
	   Abubakar also appealed to the international community to
appreciate the regime's efforts ``at solving our problems and show
greater understanding and sensitivity to our internal affairs.''
	   The prisoners to be freed were:
	   _ Obasanjo, who is serving a 15-year treason sentence,
voluntarily relinquished the presidency after an election and went
on to became a formidable critic of the late dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha. He was released on compassionate grounds and will be
confined to his farm near Lagos at first.
	   _ Ransome-Kuti, a doctor, brother of the late Afrobeat music
star Fela, was convicted of being an ``accessory after the fact to
treason'' and was serving a 15-year sentence. He was ordered freed
for health reasons.
	   _ Frank Kokori and Milton Dabibi, leaders of Nigeria's Oil
Workers Union. They have been held in detention since a three-month
oil workers' strike he led in 1994. No charges were filed against
them.
	   _ Ibrahim Dasuki, the deposed sultan of the town of Sokoto and
an Islamic leader. He has been held without charges since 1996.
	   _ Bola Ige, a former state governor, was imprisoned without
charges after violent anti-Abacha riots May 1 in the city of
Kaduna. Ige was not particularly prominent in the opposition
movement and it was never clear why he was arrested.
	   _ Chris Ayanwu, editor in chief of Quest, an independent
magazine that was frequently critical of the Abacha regime. She has

	   Indonesia's five operating commercial airlines announced
yesterday they plan to combine their resources and unite their
domestic operations to survive the deepening economic crisis.
	   The chairman of the Indonesian National Air Carriers
Association, Soelarto Hadisumarto, said the association proposed
the plan to Minister of Communications Giri Suseno Hadihardjono
during a meeting yesterday.
	   ``We are going to work together -- all the existing airlines --
through an operation similar to a pooling system,'' Soelarto told
reporters after the meeting.
	   ``The aim is simply to survive,'' he added.
	   Soelarto said the scheme would be implemented soon, as all the
airlines had approved the plan.
	   ``If it can start this month, why not?''
	   There used to be six commercial airlines in the country until
last week when Sempati Air stopped operating due to crippling
financial hardships.
	   Sempati Air's shareholders include former president Soeharto's
son youngest Hutomo Mandala Putra (15 percent) and long-term pal
Mohammad ``Bob'' Hasan (20 percent).
	   The five remaining air carriers are state owned Garuda
Indonesia, Garuda's subsidiary Merpati Nusantara, Bouraq Airlines,
Mandala Airlines and Dirgantara Air Service.
	   Soelarto said the five airlines would form a consortium which
would share the revenue of their operations.
	   The consortium would combine the fleets of the airlines, and
allocate the domestic routes to the carriers.
	   A code-sharing system would be applied so that tickets could be
sold at uniform prices and with the same incentives, he said.
	   The domestic air carriers have been in dire straits for months
as the crisis continued to worsen this year.
	   Many analysts believe all the national private airlines will
collapse soon if the Indonesian currency does not strengthen and
the government does not help them.
	   Their operating costs are mainly in dollars, including aircraft
leasing and fuel costs.
	   Unaffordable
	   The rupiah's 80 percent depreciation against the U.S. dollar
since last July has made the jet leasing payments of their aircraft
unaffordable.
	   At the same time, flights' load factors have slumped
drastically, following people's declining purchasing power.
	   The airlines have had to return their aircraft and they are now
burdened with matured leasing payments they could not pay.
	   Soelarto said the airlines' executives expressed concerns over
the rupiah's value against the dollar, which has continued to
weaken in the last few days.
	   Yesterday the rupiah closed at 14,000 to the dollar, compared to
around 2,500 last June.
	   This week, State Minister of the Empowerment of State
Enterprises Tanri Abeng said Garuda's total foreign debt stood at
US$200 million, half of which was due to be repaid this year.
	   Tanri admitted ``Garuda is in critical condition, so
restructuring both on the management and financial sides is a
matter of great urgency.''
	   Tanri said Garuda would have a new president by Monday.
	   After being pressured by its employees, Garuda announced this
week that it would sever cooperation with companies linked to
Soeharto and return leased aircraft to ensure its survival.

	   THE visiting governor of the central bank of New Zealand
outlined the importance of social and peer pressures in bank
supervision to top officials of the Bank of Thailand Monday.
	   Don Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, warned
the Thai monetary authorities to be ''sceptical'' of accepting just
essential bank prudency rules and information recommended by the
Basle-based Bank for International Settlement.
	   ''I could not be certain of a conventional approach when I look
at [bank-failure cases in] Scandinavia, Japan, US, France, United
Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.'' Nor, he said, is conventional
bank supervision good at dealing with fraud, as in the case of the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in Thailand or
Barings' Nick Lesson case, which occurred despite tough supervision
by the Singapore Monetary Authority.
	   In reforming the New Zealand central bank, Brash said,
incentives were offered to bank directors and managers because of
the high level of disclosures, including interest-rate and
foreign-exchange risks and credit concentration, required not just
to the authorities but also to the market and the public.
	   And bank directors must countersign the disclosed information he
said, adding: ''We put emphasis on bank disclosures and
responsibility.'' Brash cited an example of a bank extending an
excessive level of loans to a shareholder and almost breaking the
capital-adequacy ratio. The market was informed, and the media and
other banks jumped on this bank. ''In the old regime I would have
to write a nasty letter. Now we have pressure from the peer
group.'' Brash was giving a run-down on the development of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand as part of the Bank of Thailand's
international lecture series which will eventually lead to a reform
of the Thai central bank. Selected academics and members of the
press were also invited to the presentation Monday.

	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Fri. - Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia has
suggested that the Asset Management Company be managed by
internationally recognised auditors to avoid cronyism and nepotism.
	   Its president, Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik, said by doing so
AMC's management could be carried out with more transparency,
effectiveness and independence without having to worry about unjust
decisions made by the corporation especially by those who had
self-interest in any troubled company.
	   He said Gerakan was not criticising any party on the issue of
cronyism and nepotism, but the party was trying to provide a
solution on the matter.
	   ``We do not want to see the country's economy succumbing to a
depression but to ensure a kick-start in the country's economic
growth.''
	   He said this after opening the 7th Terengganu Gerakan delegates'
meeting at a hotel here.
	   Dr Lim said the AMC must also identify those companies or
projects which were strategic for the growth of the country's
economy but faced problems to pay their loans because of the
present economic situation.
	   ``Then, AMC can inject its fund into the banks which are saddled
with non-performing loans problem caused by these troubled
companies or projects,'' he said.

NBA players might be bounced from U.S. roster
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In response to a threatened player boycott of
the world championships, U.S. basketball authorities might enter a
team excluding the 12 NBA players already chosen.
	   A decision must be made by Friday, the deadline for submitting
24-man rosters to FIBA, the international governing body that runs
the tournament.
	   Options include entering the 12-man Goodwill Games team, made up
of college players, or a roster of CBA players and Americans
playing overseas. No roster would be final, however, until 72 hours
before the tournament begins July 29.
	   USA Basketball's executive board will confer Tuesday or
Wednesday by conference call to vote on the next move. Players
spoke by conference call last Thursday and decided they would not
commit to playing as long as a lockout seems likely July 1 when the
NBA's labor agreement expires.
	   ``I think we'll just have to send another team,'' said NBA
deputy commissioner Russ Granik, who also serves as president of
USA Basketball, told USA Today. ``That will be my recommendation.''
	   The 12 NBA players on U.S. team are: Tim Duncan (San Antonio),
Tim Hardaway (Miami), Vin Baker and Gary Payton (Seattle), Terrell
Brandon (Milwaukee), Kevin Garnett and Tom Gugliotta (Minnesota),
Grant Hill (Detroit), Allan Houston (New York), Christian Laettner
(Atlanta), Glen Rice (Charlotte) and Chris Webber (Sacramento).
	   The world championships, held every four years, will be played
in Athens, Greece, from July 29-Aug. 9. This will be the fourth
U.S. national team to use NBA players. Rudy Tomjanovich of the
Houston Rockets will be the coach.
	   Other countries participating are Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, Greece, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Nigeria, Puerto Rico,
Russia, Senegal, South Korea, Spain and Yugoslavia.

	   While there is no doubt students played an important role in
toppling the Soeharto regime, the question remains: What was the
extent of their influence?
	   Different assessments have tried to gauge their role, and all
have reached divergent conclusions.
	   Although Ikrar Nusa Bhakti's article Military to win if civilian
fails (The Jakarta Post, May 2) focused on the possibility of the
emergence of military rule, he also mentioned that the success of
the student movement was partly because of the support they
received from the middle class.
	   There is some truth in Ikrar's argument. But when he pointed out
five factors that contributed to Soeharto's downfall, Ikrar seemed
to belittle the role of the students.
	   It is definitely misleading to say that students would not have
succeeded without the support of the middle class. The resignation
of 14 cabinet ministers and other political pressure exerted by
various elite groups indeed contributed to the political push for
Soeharto to step down. But even without this ``support'', the
students were already unstoppable. They had reached a point of no
return.
	   The 1998 student movement actually started rather late in the
wake of political movements. Various factors played a role, two
clearly important. First, many students, especially those studying
in Jakarta, come from middle-class families. The economic crisis
first hit those students who are from the lower class. This fact
alone explains why cities like Yogyakarta and Surakarta, where many
students from the lower class study, were the first ones to
experience the movement. Students from Jakarta were the latest in
joining their friends from smaller cities.
	   Second, these students, who were mostly born in the late 1970s,
grew up in an apolitical and nonpolitical atmosphere. There were no
significant political affairs during their life, except when the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) was in conflict in 1996. Yet,
this party's dispute was too far from their daily activities to
force them to get involved in politics. Under such an apolitical
and nonpolitical situation they ran their student organizations.
Thus, many student leaders were ``apolitically'' elected.
	   When these student leaders, many of whom were elected through
nonpolitical qualities such as high achievement in sports and arts,
had to face a political crisis, they were disoriented for a while.
Thus, small groups of student activists formed what they called
posko, an acronym for pos komando which literally means ``command
post'' (technically speaking, it was a ``camping post''). Some
became informal leaders of these posts, and they were the ones who
first moved to the streets.
	   But within relatively a short time, formal student leaders
learned fast. They were racing against these ``informal student
leaders'', although there is no formal organization for the posko.
Thus, we saw fragmented student movements. Many joined the formal
organizations such as the student senates. Many others joined the
posko groups. Still, many others founded various ``action units''
(kesatuan aksi) with their own posko.
	   Competition among these groups were not always a fair game. In
many cases, this competition erupted into hostility and violence.
But, the competition was a powerful driving force to exert
political pressure. They tried to outdo each other in bravery to
physically confront the security forces. Many posko, for instance,
prepared what they called ``death squads'', although they were
totally unarmed.
	   Learning from the past, student activists believed that student
leaders were the ones who would have benefited from the movement. A
consensus reached, then, that there should be no leaders. In most
cases, a presidium was to replace a structured organization. Every
activist then had an opportunity to lead a single action, although
in practice still not many students reserved the ability to lead.
	   In a snowballing effect, student movements grew rapidly. Rumors
making the round which gained currency had it that students
received political and economic support from outside their
campuses. These had a boomerang effect. Many campuses closed their
``charity boxes'', and students refused to receive money, even from
their own university alumni.
	   Allegations that outside political powers were using the
students also had a boomerang effect. Only a handful of ``senior
counterparts'' were accepted into their circles. They were very
suspicious toward people from outside their posko. Only in the
latest stages of their movements did students receive outside
support openly, especially in terms of food and other supplies.
	   Now, where are the student movements heading? This question has
no easy answer. As with other segments of society, they are
disoriented. When Soeharto resigned, some students believed that
their duty was served. Some decided that Habibie deserved their
support and that he should have his chance to prove his leadership.
Others were determined to continue their movements under an
assumption that Habibie's administration was nothing else than
Soeharto's clone.
	   Many expatriates in Jakarta are unsure whether the riots that
exploded concurrently with the mounting student movements would not
reoccur in the near future. They use student demonstrations as an
indicator of a climate favorable for a riot to explode. If student
demonstrations can be used as a proper parameter for a riot, then
we should not be afraid. Several reasons could be cited here.
	   First, student movements have passed their peak with the
resignation of Soeharto. It is very unlikely they can gather up to
hundred of thousands in number, as in the past. Fragmented targets
of the movements also contributed to a smaller number of
demonstrations. Second, demonstrations would not lead to another
massive riot because the Armed Forces had almost settled their
internal conflicts. Lastly, riots would not have taken place had
the Armed Forces not been hesitant to deploy their forces.
	   Third, many segments of the elite have taken the student's role
in channeling various interests. This is a kind of ``political
safety net'' for the future. Political struggle is now taking place
among various factions within the elite. At the same time, most
campuses are now having finals, although some are still sitting
their mid-term exams because the semester was so disrupted.
	   The situation in the near future is still difficult to assess.
There are three ``regimes'' moving together in an unsynchronized
composition. The economic regime is already bankrupt. There is
still not even the slightest hint of economic recovery. Under
Habibie's administration, the exchange rate seems to worsen every
day. Meanwhile, the social regime is at a junction. If one of the
measures is public trust in the administration, then it was partly
recovered when Soeharto resigned. But now social distrust is
increasing.
	   With economic and social regimes not working, it is impossible
to expect a viable political regime to work even for a short
period. Habibie's announcement of the time frame to conduct an
extraordinary session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
and the general elections is based on an assumption that the
political regime is still viable. In fact, without two working
regimes supporting this political regime, Habibie will not last.
	   To some degree, the viability of Habibie's transitional
administration will directly affect the format and scale of student
movements in the near future. If Habibie fails to overcome even
part of the economic crisis, students will definitely come into
action again, this time in a much less massive scale. However, more
and more nonstudent segments of the society, especially the
workers, will come to the fore to launch rallies.

	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Fri. - Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said
today the Government will continue to provide infrastructure
facilities to the people, without forgetting those living in rural
areas.
	   The Prime Minister said the Government wanted everyone, rich or
poor, to benefit from the country's wealth.
	   ``Thank God. Although we are faced with economic problems, it is
not as bad as in other countries.
	   ``It is not bad because we manage the country in an orderly
manner...
	   ``Countries which borrowed too much found out that they cannot
repay the loans and as such have to succumb to foreign powers.
However, we are still free and have not succumbed to anyone.
	   ``We are confident that with peace and strong support from the
people, we can overcome the economic pressure and thus defend our
freedom,'' he told a large crowd who greeted him during his visit
to the Kepong water treatment plant.
	   Among those present were Menteri Besar Tan Sri Wan Mokhtar
Ahmad, Deputy Agriculture Minister Datuk Dr Tengku Mahmud Mansor,
Deputy Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Idris Jusoh, State
Secretary Datuk Baharuddin Ismail and State Executive Councillors.

	   Thousands of children work as laborers, domestic servants,
workers and in various areas. They are the breadwinners of their
families. Even though they may yearn to study, can they? The answer
is no. This is one side of the coin.
	   Now let us take the other side of the coin. Parents work hard to
earn and send their children to school and college. What do these
people do? Do they concentrate on their studies? They indulge in
unnecessary strikes and riots, thereby causing inconvenience to
both the public and themselves.
	   I would like to recall a true incident which happened a few
years ago. A college student and some of his friends called for a
strike and they started throwing stones at vehicles. At the same
time his father suffered a massive heart attack. There was no one
in the house except his mother. She went to call for transport to
take her husband to the hospital. But all the drivers refused to
work, saying a strike had been called by students. When the boy
returned to his house he found his father dead. His mother told him
that if his father had been taken to the hospital immediately he
could have been saved, but transport could not be found because of
some strike. In a way he was responsible for his father's death.
	   Involve yourself with your studies rather than participating in
riots, which cause discomfort both to you and to others. Know for
sure that without devotion to your studies and your teachers,
without unflinching patience and perseverance, nothing can be
achieved. Having been educated and nursed in luxury by your
parents, is it not your duty to be faithful to them? If you never
give them a thought, then you're a traitor. Help the poor and needy
not by force but by kindness.
	   Cherish positive thoughts. Learn from the past, savor the
present, and with confidence and hope build for the future. Time is
the only coin of your life. It is the only coin you have. Only you
can determine how well it can be used. Be careful, lest others
spend it for you!

	   SHAH ALAM, Fri. - The former chief confidential secretary and
the Press secretary to Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib were charged
today in the Sessions Court here with misusing their positions as
public servants for financial gain in connection with a RM20
million land deal in 1989.
	   The two worked for Muhammad when he was Selangor Menteri Besar.
	   Murad Ibrahim was his chief confidential secretary while
Shamsuddin Merin was his Press secretary.
	   They are alleged to have jointly committed bribery by asking
Muhammad to extend an application for a 40ha land at Km16 Jalan
Cheras, Hulu Langat by Syarikat Jiwa Mewah Sdn Bhd, in which they
have an interest, for the approval of the State Executive Council.
	   The land application was approved by the Exco at its meeting on
Aug 1, 1990.
	   They were charged under Section 2(1) of the Emergency Ordinance
(Special Powers) 1970 which carries a maximum 14 years' jail or
RM20,000 fine or both upon conviction.
	   Later, in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court Murad was also charged
with four counts of accepting a total of RM1.2 million in cash from
Datuk Teong Teck Lai in connection with his official duties.
	   Murad, 46, of SS 17/3C Subang Jaya and Shamsuddin, 54, from
Taman Tun Dr Ismail, Shah Alam pleaded not guilty to all charges.
	   Murad is currently Rural Development Ministry principal
assistant secretary while Shamsuddin, 54, is Selangor Agriculture
Development Corporation general manager for corporate affairs.
	   In the joint charge, they are alleged to have committed the
offence at the Menteri Besar's office at the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah
Building on Dec 20, 1989.
	   Judge Sulaiman Ismail fixed hearing for Aug 3 to 11 and allowed
them bail of RM200,000 in one surety each.
	   He also ordered them to surrender to the court, their
international passports and other travel documents.
	   Sulaiman said in deciding bail, he considered the value of the
land involved and the seriousness of the alleged offence.
	   Defence counsel for both Murad and Shamsuddin, Ahmad Rosdi Ahmad
Idros had asked the court to consider bail of between RM30,000 and
RM40,000 for both the accused.
	   He said they would have difficulties in meeting the deputy
public prosecutor Nordan Hassan's suggested bail of RM200,000 as
they were only Government servants.
	   In the case of Murad, he said, all of his money and assets which
were related to the case had been frozen by the Anti Corruption
Agency pending the outcome of the trial, while Shamsuddin had just
undergone coronary by- pass surgery and would need money for his
follow-up treatments.
	   Both of them, he said, had also cooperated fully with the ACA
during its investigation.
	   Murad is alleged to have accepted the money on four occasions in
amounts of RM200,000, RM500,000, RM250,000 and RM250,000 while
being the senior confidential secretary to Muhammad.
	   He is alleged to have committed the offences at the office of
Syarikat Jiwa Mewah Sdn Bhd at No. 364-366, Bangunan Teong Kim
Chai, Jalan Pudu on Sept 7, 1990, Feb 12, July 5, and Aug 26, 1996
respectively.
	   He was charged under section 165 of the Penal Code and, if found
guilty, faces a maximum two years jail, a fine or both.
	   Judge Suraya Othman fixed hearing for five days beginning Sept
28 and allowed bail of RM100,000 in one surety for all the four
counts.
	   Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor Masri Mohd Daud asked for bail
at RM50,000 in one surety for each count saying the offences
committed by Murad were serious.
	   THE CHARGES THE charges against Murad Ibrahim and Shamsuddin
Merin.
	   JOINT CHARGE: That together, you on Dec 20, 1989, at the Menteri
Besar's office at Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Building in Shah Alam, as
Government officers, i.e. Press secretary and chief confidential
secretary to the Menteri Besar, committed bribery by misusing your
positions as public servants for your own monetary gain by asking
Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib as Menteri Besar of Selangor to
extend an application for a 40 hectare land at Km 16, Jalan Cheras,
Hulu Langat, by Syarikat Jiwa Mewah Sdn Bhd, in which you have an
interest, for the approval of the State Executive Council, and that
the application was approved on Aug 1, 1990, and with that, you
have committed an offence punishable under Section 2(1) of the
Emergency Ordinance (Special Powers) 1970.
	   THE charges against Murad Ibrahim.
	   1. That you on 7.9.1990, at Syarikat Jiwa Mewah Sdn Bhd, No
364-366, Bangunan Teong Kim Chai, Jalan Pudu, Kuala Lumpur, as a
public servant, that being the senior confidential secretary to the
Selangor Menteri Besar, accepted for yourself RM200,000 cash
without consideration from Datuk Teong Teck Lai, which you knew
concerned your official duties, and therefore have committed an
offence punishable under section 165 of the Penal Code.
	   2. That you on 12.2.1996, at Syarikat Jiwa Mewah Sdn Bhd, No
364-366, Bangunan Teong Kim Chai, Jalan Pudu, Kuala Lumpur, as a
public servant, that being the senior confidential secretary to the
Selangor Menteri Besar, accepted for yourself RM500,000 cash
without consideration from Datuk Teong Teck Lai, which you knew
concerned your official duties, and therefore have committed an
offence punishable under section 165 of the Penal Code.
	   3. That you on 5.7.1996, at Syarikat Jiwa Mewah Sdn Bhd, No
364-366, Bangunan Teong Kim Chai, Jalan Pudu, Kuala Lumpur, as a
public servant, that being the senior confidential secretary to the
Selangor Menteri Besar, accepted for yourself RM250,000 cash
without consideration from Datuk Teong Teck Lai, which you knew
concerned your official duties, and therefore have committed an
offence punishable under section 165 of the Penal Code.
	   4. That you on 26.8.1996, at Syarikat Jiwa Mewah Sdn Bhd, No
364-366, Bangunan Teong Kim Chai, Jalan Pudu, Kuala Lumpur, as a

	   I always try to watch soccer telecasts from foreign TV stations.
Some people have accused me of being unpatriotic, but I do it
because I was often disappointed by the lack of professionalism of
all the TV stations in this country.
	   My disappointment does not center on the 90-minute match, but
the atmosphere before and after its completion. Our TV stations are
apparently insensitive toward the atmosphere of drama in real life.
	   I have had my share of bitter experiences when watching final
matches among European clubs. In 1995, the coverage of the Winners
Cup final between Real Zaragosa and Arsenal ended after the referee
had blown his whistle. I did not have the chance to see Nayim and
friends join in the procession to receive the cup. A similar
experience happened at the UEFA Cup final in 1997 between Inter
Milan and Schalke 04 and the Champions final of the same year when
Dortmund defeated Juventus.
	   In all three telecasts the TV stations did not give the
opportunity to their viewers to watch the explosion of atmosphere
of winning and losing, the happiness and the sorrow of the players.
The coverage cut everything short. Instead, we got the
advertisements of the sponsors and the analyses of people too
hastily qualified as experts. Furthermore, viewers may remember the
disappointment we got in the first minute of the direct telecast of
the FA Cup last year -- when Roberto di Matteo put the ball into
the Middlesborough net -- or the time when the national anthems of
Denmark and Germany were played before the 1992 European Cup final.
	   Now I can only hope that all those inadvertencies will not be
repeated in the coverage of the World Cup 1998 promised loudly for
months to the public.

	   Our congratulations to Indonesia's Thomas Cup team with their
victory in Hong Kong on May 24. The red and white flag was hoisted,
the national anthem Indonesia Raya was played, the athletes, the
coaches and the organizers hugged each other. The scene was
familiar to us. However, this time we watched and stood stock-still
in puzzlement. This was one of the rare moments when Indonesian
people were really united without a reference to ``ethnic Chinese''
being made.
	   It was ironic that at a time when looting and discriminatory
acts had just passed, the athletes, mostly ethnic Chinese, had just
struggled for the nation. Is it only at such moments that the
ethnic Chinese are part of the nation?
	   On the one hand, we have acknowledged Indonesia as our
birthplace, our residence and our home. On the other, the attitude
of the government and other citizens is sometimes more than
apathetic. This makes us think again about whether Indonesia really
is our country too.
	   The question is: how long will the ``exclusive'' treatment apply
to ethnic Chinese? (We do not like the term.) It is undeniable that
our neighboring countries have been more successful in the
assimilation of their citizens. If we really are part of the body
of this nation, as averred by Amien Rais, give us the chance to
play an active role in this body. A missing body part or the
amputation of a body part will result in deformity. Is it not so,
Pak Amien?
	   We only want a country that also wants us. Is it impossible? We
are indeed Chinese-Indonesians. What is wrong with that?
	   Witnessing the emotional atmosphere of the victory of the
Indonesian Thomas Cup team, we felt the irony of it all.

	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Fri. - The Government is sending the right
signals and wants to know what else it has to do to win the
confidence of foreign fund managers and investors, Prime Minister
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said today.
	   ``I want to know what else we have to do. We have done a lot. We
have also given them a lot but they are still not confident.''
	   Dr Mahathir was asked to comment on a statement by US Ambassador
to Malaysia John R. Mallot in Washington yesterday that Malaysia
needed to send the right signals to fund managers if it wanted to
attract foreign capital back.
	   In an interview with Bernama, Mallot also said recent statements
that foreign investors were out to ``recolonise'' the country
following the depreciation of the ringgit and the fall of the stock
market had scared away investors.
	   ``In the past when we did not do anything, they came. Now I
don't know what else we should do to convince them,'' he said.
	   He was speaking to reporters before addressing heads of
departments and political leaders at Sri Iman. Menteri Besar Tan
Sri Wan Mokhtar Ahmad was also present.
	   Asked if the fall of the yen would affect the Malaysian economy,
he said Malaysian importers and exporters could benefit.
	   ``It means that some Japanese products will be cheaper and we
are buying a lot of Japanese products which we in turn use to
manufacture products for the export market, for example Proton
cars.''
	   To a question on the problems of small- and medium-scale
businesses, Dr Mahathir said some of these businessmen were unaware
of the special fund from which they could borrow to ease their
problems.
	   ``If they want to do business they must know where to get the
funds. If the fund is not enough, we can increase it. However, it
is important that they use this fund. I am sure if the business is
viable they will be given the loan.''
	   Asked about retrenchment by companies affected by the current
economic problems, Dr Mahathir said there were enough jobs.
	   However, local workers should not be retrenched but if they
were, they should be willing to work in other sectors.
	   ``In difficult times like this, we must not be choosy. If they
need to be trained, the Government has many training centres.
	   ``Our problem is we have been too comfortable. When we are asked
to work elsewhere, we do not want to stray too far from our homes
or villages. We must remember that we have two million foreign
workers. If they leave we can fill the vacancies but our people
don't want the jobs.''

	   In May 1998, Asiaweek, a Hong Kong-based news magazine,
announced the best universities in Asia. Unlike last year, this
year's list was split into universities and schools of science and
technology.
	   Last year, the magazine placed ITB (the Bandung Institute of
Technology) 19th out of 50, much higher than four or five other
Indonesian universities that were also on the list. This year,
after the split, ITB only ranks 14th out of 30.
	   The best five schools of science and technology, according to
Asiaweek, are Pohang University of Science and Technology (South
Korea), the Indian Institute of Technology at Delhi (India), the
Indian Institute of Technology at Madras (India), Nanyang
Technological University (Singapore), and the Science University of
Tokyo (Japan).
	   In an improvement on last year, this year's rankings were based
on academic reputation, student selectivity, faculty resources,
research output, financial resources, average annual teachers' pay,
students per teacher, articles in international journal per
teacher, and students per Internet access point. The best five
schools scored 75.73, 65.24, 63.94, 63.54, and 60.82, while ITB
scored 44.75.
	   The ITB rector and deputy rector for academic affairs said they
were disappointed with the ranking. They questioned the criteria
used by Asiaweek, particularly the use of teachers' salaries (The
Jakarta Post, June 3, 1998). In terms of teachers' salaries, ITB
ranks only 23rd.
	   Teachers' salaries, however, is not the only category that
caused ITB to fall in the rankings. In terms of financial resources
(which put ITB high last year), ITB ranks as low as 25th. Although
it ranks 13th in terms of research output, ITB sadly scores 0.00
and ranks 23rd in terms of the number of articles in international
journals. What does this tell us?
	   It tells us clearly that, nationwide, our university teachers'
research capability is questionable. It also tells us that there is
something wrong with the whole academic system and atmosphere.
	   In the last couple of years, hundreds or perhaps thousands of
research projects were funded by many sources, such as the National
Research Council, the Office of the State Minister of Research and
Technology, the Directorate General of Higher Education. Billions
of rupiah were spent on research projects.
	   Universities like UI (University of Indonesia), UGM (University
of Gadjah Mada), IPB (Bogor Institute of Agriculture), and ITB are
always leading in obtaining research funding.
	   Research was carried out, there is no doubt about it. But
apparently the results were not as expected: they often stopped as
research reports and never got published (or perhaps were never
sent for publication). But why?
	   There are at least two explanations. First, for most
researchers, research projects have become projects to get extra
money, not to extend the boundaries of our knowledge nor to yield
any sort of breakthrough. Teachers' salaries are low, so they need
this extra income.
	   It is true that if one writes a paper from one's research
results and publishes it, then one would get points that are needed
for promotion. For instance, if it is published in a local or
national journal, one gets 10 points and if it is published in an
international journal, the result is 15 points.
	   But since getting a paper published in an international journal
is much more difficult than in a local or national journal while
the points earned are not that different, why worry about
publishing research in an international journal?
	   Thus you write a research proposal, obtain the funding, do the
research, and write the report. If you need more points for your
promotion, you write a paper out of your research results and
publish it in a local journal. (Usually nobody will question the
content of your paper except perhaps the format or the number of
pages.) You do this once a year, and you will become a professor
one day.
	   Second, for most teachers, writing a research proposal is time
consuming and doing research is much more demanding. Meanwhile,
facilities and the academic atmosphere are not supportive. So why
worry about doing research at all?
	   Teachers know that they will not get fired just because they do
not do research. At worst, they will not become professors. But as
far as money is concerned, they can just moonlight and get extra
income (which is sometimes more than the average research grant).
	   All this happens because of the bureaucratic nature of the
system, including the recruitment process, promotion system and
salary scales that applies to our university teachers. In
particular, teachers at state universities are civil servants. Once
employed at a state university, they work there for the rest of
their lives or till they retired.
	   In most cases, new recruits start working at a university as a
junior assistant. To be promoted to a senior assistant, they need
to accumulate 50 points, which can be obtained from teaching,
research and service to the community. The higher one's position,
the more points that have to be earned to be promoted further. A
minimum of two years in any current position is required before one
can be promoted to a higher position.
	   But the problem is there is no maximum number of years one can
remain in any position. This means that lecturers will not be
fired, even if you do not earn enough points after many years.
Since there is no such threat of dismissal, why worry about, say,
doing research?
	   With such a uniquely bureaucratic system, how can our
universities compete globally? Unless the system is changed, the
number of research publications in international journals will
hardly increase. And without research published in international
journals, it will be very unlikely if any of our universities
become the best university in Asia, let alone the world.
	   The writer is a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the
Bandung Institute of Technology.

	   PETALING JAYA, Fri. - A gag order has been imposed on DAP
members prohibiting them from speaking to the media or issuing
statements questioning the recent action taken against three
national party leaders.
	   The party disciplinary committee, which met today, also banned
roadshows and the passing of resolutions on the matter.
	   Its chairman Ahmad Nor said the disciplinary committee felt the
road shows and passing of resolutions so far over the suspension of
national vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing and
the removal of national publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong were
detrimental to party unity.
	   ``The ban applies to all, even the central executive committee
members and party leaders. Disciplinary action will be taken
against those who flout the ruling,'' he said at a Press conference
at the party's headquarters.
	   The action against the three has divided party members, with
some States questioning the CEC's decision and calling for the trio
to be allowed to present their case and given a fair hearing.
	   Party secretary-general Lim Kit Siang and a few other leaders
have been conducting meet-the-member sessions in several States to
garner support for the CEC's decision.
	   Ahmad said the disciplinary committee's decision meant that
three meetings between the national and State leaders in Johor,
Federal Territory and Perak scheduled for next week were cancelled.
	   He said members and State committees were still allowed to
discuss the action against the three but any resolutions or
objections must be sent directly to the disciplinary committee.
	   On the objection by the three that Teng Chang Kim and Ronnie Liu
were not fit to sit in the disciplinary committee to hear their
case as they had taken part in the CEC's decision to suspend the
two of them and remove another, Ahmad assured them that they would
be given a fair hearing.
	   Barely a few hours after the ban on holding Press conferences
was announced, Wee, Liew and Fung held one at a hotel here,
declaring that they would not subject themselves to a kangaroo
court.
	   Speaking on behalf of the three, Wee said they were only asking
for justice to be done and a chance to be heard by an independent
and impartial committee.
	   ``It is strange that Kit Siang has not responded when this is
the subject closest to his heart if we are to listen to his
speeches all this while.''
	   Asked about the ban, he said they were not aware of it but felt
the committee should not issue any directive as the composition of
its members had been questioned.
	   Wee said they were prepared to quit if it could be proven that
their action had split the party.
	   Liew said it was Kit Siang who had caused the split in the party
by going on the road shows and asking the State committees to vote
on the matter.
	   ``In fact, if there is a need to take action against one for
causing disunity, it is him and not us.''
	   He added the solution to the problems faced by the party rested
with Kit Siang and would not be achieved by suspending or expelling
them.

	   Whatever one may say or think about President B.J. Habibie, it
cannot be denied that the new de facto head-of-state and
head-of-government at least seems to be sincerely trying to live up
to the gargantuan challenges he is facing. His instructions to the
Armed Forces (ABRI) leadership to dig up the truth over allegations
that a certain ``organized group'' was behind last month's riots,
for example, is a step in the right direction.
	   Speaking to more than 150 top-ranking Armed Forces officers at
Jakarta's presidential palace on Thursday, Habibie called on ABRI
to conduct a thorough investigation into the riots and present a
straightforward clarification of the issue to the public.
	   Suspicions that at least one organized group played a part in
inciting the riots that ravaged Jakarta and Surakarta last month
was mentioned publicly for the first time early this month by
Baharuddin Lopa, the secretary-general of this country's respected
human rights watchdog, the National Commission on Human Rights.
Although Baharuddin mentioned no names, he said the inquiries which
the commission had made led it to conclude that ``organized
groups'' had made use of the prevailing situation to incite
trouble.
	   A similar public allegation was made earlier this week by Amien
Rais, the chairman of the Muhammadiyah Islamic organization.
Speaking to an assemblage of 2,000 Chinese-Indonesians in Surakarta
on Wednesday, Amien said he had received information that the riots
which erupted in several towns during the middle of last month were
not spontaneous incidents but were masterminded by ``puppeteers''.
``Who those puppeteers are, we will come to know later,'' he said.
Accounts of groups of people being ``dropped'' by trucks at some of
the city's worst flash points during the rioting, however, were in
fact first reported to the media at the time the looting and
burning was taking place.
	   To make things worse, a strong suspicion, rightly or wrongly, is
forming in society that the rape and brutalization of innocent
women, mostly of Chinese-Indonesian descent, was committed by the
same, or by similar ``organized groups'' that started the looting
and burning. In the meantime, even after all the time that has
elapsed since Pius Lustrilanang made his sensational revelations
about his abduction in April, investigators still have not come up
with a convincing answer -- or, in fact, with any answer at all --
to who was behind the disappearance and alleged torture of
opposition activists. To further add to the complications, the
suspicion that the police officers currently on trial in the
Trisakti student shooting case are mere scapegoats designed to
protect the real guilty parties, refuses to die.
	   As all these questions remain unanswered, the public outrage
over these perceived wrongs tends to pile up, rather than die down.
The unfortunate way events are unfolding is that, unavoidably, the
public's suspicions tend to be aimed at a number of members of what
is perceived to be the only ``organized institution'' in this
country capable of committing these acts, namely the Armed Forces.
	   Considering all this, and given the crucial role which the
Indonesian Armed Forces still plays in practically every sector of
our public life, it is in all our interests that a satisfactory
explanation for all those events be given as soon as possible. For
the Armed Forces in particular, the importance of doing so cannot
be overstated.
	   One reminder, though, is in order: Any explanation that is given
must be straightforward, honest and convincing. Unless these
criteria are met, it is difficult to expect the current public
skepticism to ease. At stake is the credibility of the government,
and with it the immediate outlook for this nation's well-being.

	   KUALA Lumpur Stock Exchange executive chairman Datuk Mohd Azlan
Hashim yesterday disclosed for the first time that some
stockbroking firms have been found to have violated the Exchange's
rules relating to exposure to a single client.
	   ``Yes, there are still several companies which have not complied
with the single client limit. Action has been formulated, is being
and will be taken where there is violation.''
	   He said the KLSE will continue to monitor all stockbroking firms
on a weekly and monthly basis.
	   Mohd Azlan declined to disclose names of the stockbroking firms
or their clients, and smiled when asked if prominent businessman
Datuk Soh Chee Wen is among the clients.
	   The KLSE had in January sent circulars on ``Exposure to single
client and single security'' to all stockbroking firms to request
for the companies' exposure to Soh.
	   The KLSE later said no stockbroking firm was found to have
breached any KLSE rules with regard to their dealings with Soh.
	   Under KLSE rules, a stockbroking company shall not exceed
exposure of 300 per cent or three times of its last audited
shareholders' funds.
	   In terms of margin financing, exposure should not exceed 30 per
cent of the stockbrokers' adjusted capital. This rule will take
effect from December 31, this year.
	   For trading purposes, exposure to a single client should exceed
100 per cent of adjusted capital.
	   Exposure of 200 per cent of adjusted capital may be permitted
only for approved clients as determined by the Exchange. These
rules will be effective from Dec 31, this year.
	   Mohd Azlan said the Exchange is working on a framework for its
members which will be finalised by July.
	   The Exchange had met with the Association of Stockbroking
Companies and other organisations, including banks and merchant
banks.
	   ``We have been discussing the degree and content of reporting
and the frequency, and will device a sort of measurement that will
be useful for investors,'' he said.
	   Other measures taken by the KLSE towards a more disclosure-based
regulatory environment for the securities industry include the
Minimum Liquid Funds requirement.
	   The MLF requires stockbrokers to ensure that liquid funds
available in the company are not less than the MLF at all times.
The MLF should either be RM500,000 or five per cent of aggregate
debt, whichever is greater.
	   Mohd Azlan voiced the KLSE's concern over the increasing number
of listed companies' financial accounts that carried auditors
qualifications.
	   ``Our listing and surveillance departments are in the process of
inquiring, and we do have coordination with the Registrar of
Companies, although they have their own investigating team.''
	   The ROC is not the only party that could take action, he said,
as the auditors could also make reports to various authorities.

Nigerian junta frees nine prominent political detainees

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leadership Monday
ordered the release of nine of the country's most prominent
political prisoners to ``facilitate the process of national
reconciliation.''
	   The prisoners to be released include such well-known figures as
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979
and Beko Ransome-Kuti, a pro-democracy activist jailed since 1995.
	   But Nigeria's best known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not mentioned in the statement from
David Atta, the press secretary for Nigeria's new military leader,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   It not immediately clear when the releases would occur.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the release of some detainees and
prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation and
reconstruction,'' Atta said adding other prisoners ``would be given
consideration from time.''
	   Gani Fawehinmi, an attorney and one of Nigeria's most vocal
critics of military rule praised the move as a ``joyous step
towards reconciliation.''
	   ``This is incredible. This is fantastic,'' said Fawehinmi.
``This gives us hope that something good will begin to happen
soon.''
	   He noted however that a number of prominent political figures
remained behind bars. ``They must go further and release all
detainees and all prisoners still in the gulag.''
	   Abubakar came to power a little less than a week ago, following
the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose five-year-dictatorship became
an international pariah for its human rights record.
	   In announcing the release of the prisoners, the new military
leader urged those granted amnesty to ``cooperate'' with the
government to create ``the country of our dreams.''
	   Abubakar also appealed to the international community to
appreciate the regime's efforts ``at solving our problems and show
greater understanding and sensitivity to our internal affairs.''
	   The prisoners to be freed were:
	   _ Obasanjo, who is serving a 15-year treason sentence,
voluntarily relinquished the presidency after an election and went
on to became a formidable critic of the late dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha. He was released on compassionate grounds and will be
confined to his farm near Lagos at first.
	   _ Ransome-Kuti, a doctor, brother of the late Afrobeat music
star Fela, was convicted of being an ``accessory after the fact to
treason'' and was serving a 15-year sentence. He was ordered freed
for health reasons.
	   _ Frank Kokori and Milton Dabibi, leaders of Nigeria's Oil
Workers Union. They have been held in detention since a three-month
oil workers' strike he led in 1994. No charges were filed against
them.
	   _ Ibrahim Dasuki, the deposed sultan of the town of Sokoto and
an Islamic leader. He has been held without charges since 1996.
	   _ Bola Ige, a former state governor, was imprisoned without
charges after violent anti-Abacha riots May 1 in the city of
Kaduna. Ige was not particularly prominent in the opposition
movement and it was never clear why he was arrested.
	   _ Chris Ayanwu, editor in chief of Quest, an independent
magazine that was frequently critical of the Abacha regime. She has
been held since 1995.
	   _ Olabintan Durojaiye, a lawyer and critic of the Abacha regime.
He has been held since last year. No charges were filed against
him.
	   _ Uwen Udo, a pro-democracy politician, detained since 1997. No
charges have been filed against him.

	   The official number of jobless in the city has soared by 21
percent since last month, but the head of the local manpower office
concedes the actual number could be much higher.
	   R.H. Sudhartin said yesterday that unemployment -- officially at
762,648 -- may exceed 800,000 as his office's data was restricted
to companies or individuals who officially reported the dismissals.
	   ``The opportunity for the unemployed to get new jobs these days
is quite small, especially due to the current economic development
growth, which is projected to be minus 6.5 percent.''
	   Job opportunities were further diminished, he said, because many
companies had their properties pillaged and destroyed during the
orgy of rioting last month.
	   ``Besides, there are hardly vacancies available now. In December
alone, we recorded only about 3,700 positions offered by companies
in Jakarta.''
	   Sudhartin said at least 18,888 people from 158 firms lost their
jobs due to the riots in May.
	   ``I don't know whether these people have been dismissed or just
laid off because the offices where they worked were destroyed or
burned by the mobs during the riots.''
	   The number of unemployed also included 158,717 people who were
officially dismissed before May by companies which were severely
affected by the monetary crisis.
	   He said the other 585,043 were those who had lost their jobs
before the crisis, which first hit the country in July last year.
	   Sudhartin also explained that the city administration was
preparing to provide more work opportunities for the unemployed
next month.
	   ``The employment opportunities, which are almost similar to the
recent labor-intensive program, will likely be held for one year.
It's part of the central government's program to help ease the
unemployment problem in Jakarta. It'll be financed by the state
budget.''
	   About Rp 17 billion would be allocated for the program, he said.
	   But he added the program was different from the city's earlier
labor-intensive program as it would absorb only about 1,300
technically skilled people to be selected by the district
administrators.
	   Under the program, participants would be advised on how to
establish several workshops in accordance with their skills.
	   ``There will no longer be hard labor on idle land. The
participants will work on their skills.''
	   Sudhartin said a separate training program, also scheduled to
start next month, would also be held for unemployed who were high
school graduates.
	   He said each of the participants in the training program would
be provided a monthly stipend of about Rp 300,000.
	   The city administration also plans to continue its
labor-intensive program, he said. The program, which costs about Rp
8 billion, was designed to absorb 4,200 people and to begin next
month.
	   Sudhartin said all programs would give priority to unemployed
who possessed Jakarta residency cards.
	   ``Hopefully, all the programs can be realized. It will depend
heavily on the availability of government funds,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs
Minister Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayob said today suing the
authorities for alleged negligence in managing water resources will
not solve the problem.
	   Steps to overcome the water crisis, he added, would take time
and it would be unwise to take the Selangor Government and Menteri
Besar to court.
	   Megat Junid was commenting on a report on Tuesday which quoted
Selangor Consumer Association legal adviser A. Jeyaseelan as saying
that the association planned to sue the Selangor Government and the
Menteri Besar for allegedly being negligent in managing water
resources.
	   The Federation of Malaysian Consumer Associations
director-cum-legal adviser T. Indrani had also confirmed yesterday
that two suits were being filed, one against the State Government
and Menteri Besar and another against Kuala Lumpur City Hall and
the police for withdrawing Fomca`s permit to hold a forum on the
water crisis at the Bandar Tun Razak Sports Complex.
	   Megat Junid's view was also shared by the MCA Youth
secretary-general Datuk Ong Tee Keat, who said that resolving the
water crisis effectively was more important than to take the matter
to court.
	   ``Exploiting the issue and causing the people to resent the
authorities as advocated by the Opposition is not the solution.''
	   Ong, who is also the Member of Parliament for Ampang Jaya and
Dewan Rakyat deputy speaker said he respected the democratic rights
of organisations and societies to take legal action but asked:
``Will these actions solve the water woes faced by the people?''
	   Speaking to reporters after chairing a meeting with
representatives of 10 Non-Governmental Organisations on efforts to
fight dadah abuse at Wisma MCA, he added that, resolving the water
crisis concerned the overall system of implementation of water
management.
	   It was also reported on Wednesday that Selangor Menteri Besar
Datuk Abu Hassan Omar had called for the ministry and the Registrar
of Societies to review the status of Fomca and the SCA.
	   Abu Hassan had said the associations seemed to be more
interested in politicising the water crisis rather than working
with the authorities to find ways to help consumers.
	   Megat Junid told reporters after launching the ``Buildmat
Malaysia '98'', an exhibition of Made-in-Malaysia construction
materials to be held at the Putra World Trade Centre from Nov 10 to
13 that Fomca's role should be broadened to include all services
affecting consumers. The approach used (by joining up with
political parties) was wrong.
	   The association, he added, should hold discussions with the
State Government without insulting or demeaning anyone as the real
issues would be overshadowed.
	   Megat Junid said the ministry would also take the issue of
reviewing the structure of Fomca's with the Registrar of Societies.
	   He added that he had directed the ministry secretary-general
Datuk Mohamad Noor Abdul Rahim to discuss the structure of national
and State- level consumer associations with the ROS.
	   He said discussions will be held with ROS, Fomca and other State
consumer associations to find ways to make Fomca a more effective
consumer organisation.

	   MORE than 70 students were rushed Monday for first aid as the
foul smell from the Mab Tha Phut Industrial Estate hounding the Mab
Tha Phut Phanphittayakarn School in Rayong became more intense.
	   An official of the industrial estate said the students were
treated for respiratory problems and some were said to have
fainted.
	   Director of the school Winit Pathanrat said the smell, which was
very strong, had made his students run out of the school the first
few times. The ones who had no resistance to the smell headed to
the first aid room for medical help.
	   ''It's like the school has turned into a hospital,'' he said.
''I don't understand why the event occurs so often now. What do I
do except keep reporting to the authorities in the Rayong
province.'' According to Winit, the strong smell which takes about
two hours to disappear, occurs more than once a day.
	   ''Our school is not like a school anymore. Lots of officials
from several offices have visited us to try and examine the smell
by waiting for the smell and then running out to find the source.
But they have not been able to find the real source of the bad
smell,'' the school's president Nopphamas Rotmaninatakit said.
	   A Mab Ta Phud Industrial Estate official, who declined to be
named, revealed Monday that the event of bad smell will occur more
often due to the rainy season. The atmosphere and direction of the
wind would carry the smell from the estate to the school area, she
said.
	   The head of the survey team was not available for comment
Monday.
	   A public relations official of the Star Petroleum Refinery
Company (SPRC), one of the factories suspected to be the source of
the smell, said the firm sent a doctor to the school for an hour
three times a week, to monitor and help with the first aid for
students who have no resistance against the smell.
	   ''It's at the request of a teacher from the school because she
cannot take care of all the students at the same time,'' she said.
	   ''We had been sending a doctor to the school last semester and
after the summer holidays, two weeks ago, have started sending him
there again,'' she added. According to the estate officials the
source of the bad smell is still unknown while the SPRC official
said it was not from their factory but from some of the other 50
factories in the estate.

Third day of clashes as England beats Tunisia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with news figures in fan violence; WILL be UPDATED
with US-Germany &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Stade Velodrome in Marseille was the calm eye
of a terrible storm Monday, as England defeated Tunisia 2-0 in
peaceful sunshine even as fans fought with police in the southern
resort city for the third straight day.
	   There were clashes before, during and after the game, leaving
the streets smelling of tear gas. Fifteen people were slightly
injured, police said, and another, hit on the head by a bottle, was
hospitalized. Twenty seven people were detained.
	   Tension ran high Monday night in the Old Port, where English
fans were buying alcohol in supermarkets and some bars, despite a
post-match ban. Bars were ordered to close at 11:00 p.m., (2100
GMT), hours earlier than normal, and not sell alcohol.
	   Earlier, riot police lobbed tear gas on a beach to break up
clashes between English and Tunisian supporters watching the
afternoon match on a huge TV screen set up for people who lacked
tickets to the game.
	   Monday's clashes followed street violence Sunday night that cut
a path of destruction through downtown Marseille and left 36 people
hospitalized, three of them badly hurt, and some 50 Englishmen,
Tunisians and Frenchmen in jail. One Englishman had an artery cut
in his neck, and a policeman suffered multiple fractures.
	   French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who has warned
hooligans they will be dealt with swiftly and harshly, said Monday
the offenders should be deported.
	   ``England seems to be intent on being world champion at this,''
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``It is not exclusively an
English problem, but again and again the English are involved.''
	   In other games Monday, Romania downed Colombia 1-0 at Lyon. The
United States played Germany in a late match at Paris.
	   Cooper said some of England's hardened hooligans appeared to
head to Marseille just to stir up more violence, with little
interest in following the game.
	   ``(It) shows that they are not interested in the football, only
in what comes after,'' Cooper said. ``... We are determined not to
allow a small group of idiots spoil the party.''
	   Inside the stadium, the game took place oblivious to the
troubles outside. Alan Shearer scored late in the 42nd minute and
Paul Scholes in 89th in a game dominated by the heavy favored
English in their first game of the tournament.
	   ``We could have scored three or four goals,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said. ``We could have taken them to the cleaners.''
	   At Lyon, Adrian Ilie's 15-meter chip shot in first-half injury
time kept Colombia from avenging a 3-1 defeat to Romania in the
1994 World Cup.
	   ``We repeated history from four years ago at USA World Cup '94,
but with a different score,'' Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu
said.
	   Violence first erupted in Marseille on Saturday night in the Old
Port entertainment district, when fans clashed with police and
Tunisian supporters. Several English fans were arrested in the
melees.
	   The hooliganism was universally condemned.
	   ``What these fans are doing is that they come to a game to
fight, to cause trouble, to make war,'' said former Brazilian star
Pele. ``This is disgusting. The security, the police, should act
quickly to put these people in jail as an example to others.''
	   In England, Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned as a ``complete
disgrace'' the rampaging English fans.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and they have just got to put a stop to it.''

	   DONATE AND WIN TICKETS TO THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES ... More than
200 staff of the Kuala Terengganu Primula Parkroyal Hotel are
taking part in a competition to donate as many one sen coins as
they can to win a ticket to the Games in September.
	   Besides the tickets, the three lucky winners would also be
provided with accommodation and food for two days and one night at
the Kuala Lumpur Parkroyal and Central Kuala Lumpur.
	   Primula Parkroyal general manager Rodney Hawker (right) said the
management decided to hold the competition for its employees
because they were keen to see the historic event.
	   He said the hotel wanted its employees to ``have fun while
donating to a worthy cause'' as well as trying their luck at
winning the tickets for the Games.
	   The One Sen Fun competition is organised by the New Straits
Times Press (Malaysia) Bhd and TV3 with the co-operation of the
Association of Banks Malaysia and Associaition of Finance
Companies. It is supported by Bank Negara, Sukom Ninety Eight Bhd
and the Youth and Sports Ministry.
	   State Youth, Sports and Small and Medium Industry Development
Committee chairman Othman Daud launched the competition which will
be closed at the end of this month.

	   The Jakarta Military High Court rejected yesterday the defense's
plea to dismiss the case of two police officers charged for their
roles in the shooting deaths of four Trisakti University students
last month.
	   Presiding judge Col. Sudji Suradi in his pretrial verdict stated
that the defense statement was irrelevant and therefore needed no
further consideration.
	   ``The defense plea for all the charges to be dismissed is based
on the assumption that the two officers were answerable to their
superior for their wrongdoings and that their punishment was also
at the prerogative of their superior, in this case, the commander
of the Mobile Brigade.
	   ``Therefore,'' the defense lawyer said, ``the case cannot be
tried in a military high court.
	   ``I tell you, this is very wrong,'' Sudji said.
	   On the contrary, he said, the superior officers were authorized
only to investigate the wrongdoings of the two defendants, but were
unable to do anything in a military court.
	   ``And it is the right of the military court to continue the
trial and build a solid case,'' he added.
	   Sudji quoted Law No.13 /1997, Article 40 on the military high
court which states that a military court is authorized to
investigate and make decisions in the first trial of a criminal
case involving defendants with a maximum rank of captain.
	   The presiding judge also told the court that the chronology of
the incident was described clearly in the prosecutor's statement.
	   ``These two officers went against procedures by giving the order
to shoot, in a bid to disperse the crowds, without authorization
from the West Jakarta Police chief as commander in the field when
the incident happened,'' Sudji revealed.
	   ``Based on that fact, the (defense) arguments will not affect
the charges brought against the two officers.
	   ``I hereby declare that, first, we rejected the defense's
statement submitted to the court and second, the trial proceed with
all of the charges intact,'' Sudji said, banging his gavel.
	   He then announced that the trial should present 10 witnesses for
cross-examination.
	   Objection
	   The leader of the defense team, Adnan Buyung Nasution, objected
and made a request.
	   ``We want to make an appeal and ask that the trial be adjourned,
based on the fact that we're not ready for cross-examination,''
Buyung said.
	   He said the defense lawyers had not had a chance to talk to the
defendants. The defense team had only met with their clients once,
on Saturday, June 6, before the first session, from 1 a.m. to 2
a.m., Buyung told the court.
	   ``This is not fair and they have the right to consult with us,''
he said, adding that the defense team wanted the trial to be
adjourned until Monday.
	   After heated debate, the presiding judge granted Buyung's
request and adjourned the trial of the two defendants -- company
commander First Lt. Agus Tri Heryanto, 29, and platoon leader
Second Lt. Pariyo, 38, both from Jakarta Police Mobile Brigade --
until 9 a.m. Monday.
	   Speaking after the session, Buyung said he had put all his mind
and efforts into defending the defendants and would continue to
conduct his own investigation.
	   ``Therefore, I ask for the full support from the National Police
chief. I do not want him to back down and not cooperate in this
case. I want a guarantee on that,'' he told the media.
	   The defense team also planned to meet with the defendants this
morning at the Jakarta Military Police Headquarters in Guntur,
South Jakarta.
	   The wife of one of the defendants, Agus, gave birth to their
first child on Thursday night in their hometown of Cimahi in West
Java.
	   ``Both mother and baby are safe and are already back home,''
city police spokesman Lt. Col. Aritonang said.
	   At the first session of the trial last week, Buyung asked the
court to allow Agus to stay with his pregnant wife until the birth
of their baby, but the judge rejected the request.
	   More suspects
	   Meanwhile, Jakarta Military Commander Col. Hendardji revealed
yesterday that there were two more suspects in the Trisakti case.
	   ``It brings the suspects to 21 at last count. The number of
suspects will not be decreased, and there possibly could be more
named,'' he said, refusing to give further details.
	   ``We're currently preparing the dossiers of the new suspects,''
he said.
	   On Wednesday, Hendardji said that 11 of the first 18 officers
charged in the case would not be tried unless the weapons they used
during the incident were submitted to the investigation team.
	   Hendardji said yesterday that all of the 21 weapons were
submitted to the National Police Forensic Laboratory on Thursday
night for ballistics tests.
	   ``We're also continuing the effort to find new evidence. Based
on our investigation, most of the suspects have lied about their
whereabouts when the incident happened.
	   ``What kind of lie? It would be unethical for me to disclose.
But we'll soon prove it after the ballistics examination is
completed,'' he said.

Russian experts leave to inspect German military installations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian military experts traveled to Germany on
Monday to inspect military installations under the terms of the
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The experts will visit military installations in central Germany
from Tuesday to Thursday, the news agency said, quoting the Defense
Ministry.
	   The treaty, signed in Paris in 1990, limits ground forces and
equipment in Europe. Signatories are required to submit to regular
inspections and verification of information they provide.

	   CHATRI Sophonpanich, Bangkok Bank's executive chairman, said
Monday that the government might have to bail out the entire
banking system by financing the recapitalisation of banks tipped to
survive the economic crisis.
	   He made the comment on the worst case scenario where the
non-performing loans of the banks continue to soar on the back of
the sharp economic contraction.
	   Chatri, head of the country's largest bank, said the
intervention can be done by holding equity stakes in the local
banks with a buy-back agreement once the economy returns to normal,
he said.
	   He was quick to assert that it was a personal suggestion, which
might or might not happen, for he understood that government
intervention in the banking industry could draw a backlash on the
politics of the rich and the poor.
	   On June 10, Moody's Investors Service Inc, the international
credit rating agency, said it might be necessary for Thai
government intervention to support banks' recapitalisation because
the amount of money needed to bring the Thai banking system back on
its feet was enormous.
	   It said the amount of recapitalisation was so huge that ''the
restoration of full solvency from market sources seems
impractical'', and thus ''the Thai government will need to support
banks' capital-raising''.
	   Moody's also warned that ''if the banking system is not
sufficiently capitalised, in whole or in part, the new competitive
dynamics and the fragile confidence of investors will combine to
perpetuate the chronic instability of the country's financial
structures''.
	   Earlier Chatri said that Bangkok Bank's non-performing loans
have increased to about 20 per cent from 14 per cent at the 1996
year-end but if the new regulation on a three-month interest
recognition of unpaid loans is taken into account the bank's NPLs
should reach 30 per cent this year.
	   ''More worrisome will be the beginning of next year when a new
regulation on the three-month interest recognition of unpaid loans
is imposed. This will result in an increase of NPLs. The banks'
customers might not be in a position to service their debts,
leading the banks to continue to recapitalise indefinitely,'' he
said.
	   Bangkok Bank successfully raised fresh capital from
international financial markets in April 1998 by selling more than
48 per cent of its stake, or about 425 million shares. The bank
mustered a private placement price of Bt93 a share, which brought
in new capital of about Bt40 billion. The only other bank to have
made a successful private placement is Thai Farmers Bank, which got
a private placement price of Bt85 a share and gave the bank more
than Bt38 billion to shore up its operations.
	   Monday Bangkok Bank closed at Bt49 a share, compared to Bt40 a
share for Thai Farmers Bank.
	   By buying into Bangkok Bank and Thai Farmers Bank, foreign
investors at that time gave the two banks the benefit of the doubt
that they would be survivors in the economic crisis. Bangkok Bank's
private placement has raised foreign ownership in the bank to 48.9
per cent. However, Chatri has good relationships with his strategic
partners in China and Taiwan, who will help to ensure that the
management, headed by Chartsiri Sophonpanich, Chatri's son, will
keep its independence.
	   According to Standard &AMP; Poor's, the Thai banking system will
need to recapitalise by another Bt800 billion to keep it solvent,
and doubts have been raised over the possibility of salvaging other
unviable banks. Thailand could end up with a handful of banks,
instead of 15 as is now the case, after the financial hurricane
finishes its sweep over the country, but the banking regulators
have yet to draw up a blueprint on how many banks they want to see
left.
	   In the meantime, Chatri admitted that no one -- not himself, nor
anyone else -- could have imagined that the crisis hitting Thailand
would be this severe. It happened so quickly, with adverse
consequences far beyond the ability of any country alone to handle.
	   He had expected the baht would devalue to Bt30-Bt32 per dollar
at the most, but it plunged to Bt56 at one point in January this
year. But since Chatri did anticipate the downturn of the economy
and the rising NPLs, he set aside Bt50 billion in provisions.
Again, nobody had expected that this huge provision would not be
enough to cover the bad debts. The bank ended up increasing its
provisions to Bt100 billion.
	   With Bt43 billion in fresh capital from the private placement,
Bangkok Bank is probably in a position to withstand the turmoil
this year. But Chatri would not have an answer if the crisis
worsens.
	   ''The bank cannot stand on its own feet. We depend on the market
and the customers. If the customers cannot service their debts to
us, we will suffer from high non-performing loans.
	   ''What we are afraid of now is the high interest rates. If they
are kept high, eventually customers will not have the money to pay
us back,'' he told a local newspaper.

	   The Central Jakarta District Court pronounced yesterday that
four activists from the Indonesian Prosperous Labor Union (SBSI)
were not guilty of charges of holding an illegal demonstration.
	   The defendants -- Kuldip Singh, Widhi Wahyu, Wandy Nicodamus
Tuturoong and Farah Diba Agustine -- were on trial for holding a
street rally on Jl. M.H. Thamrin, Central Jakarta on March 9.
	   Presiding judge I.G.N. Nyoman Putra declared yesterday that the
four were not guilty.
	   ``The decision was made by the panel of judges without pressure
from any other party. It's not connected with the recent political
situation either and is only based on the facts of the trial,''
Putra said.
	   He said the defendants did not violate Article 5 of Law No.
5/1963 on political activities since the law, issued under
Indonesia's first president Sukarno, was no longer relevant to the
current political situation.
	   The court also declared that the defendants did not violate
Article 218 of the Criminal Code for conducting an illegal
demonstration and ignoring police orders to disperse.
	   Only one witness, a police officer, testified that the
defendants ignored the police order, he said.
	   ``The police should actually use amplifiers, such as a loud
speaker, to disperse the demonstrators. But they did not,'' Putra
said.
	   He said the police officer arrested the defendants at a bus
shelter near the scene and ordered them to a nearby police office
for questioning.
	   ``The fact is, the defendants dispersed by themselves. The
demonstration also did not disturb public order, such as by causing
traffic congestion,'' he said.
	   Putra said the names of the defendants would be restored and the
cost of the trial would be borne by the state.
	   Prosecutor Suhardi is still considering whether to appeal the
decision.
	   He earlier asked the court to sentence Kuldip, Widhi and Wandy
to three months in jail each and Farah to 15 days in jail for
ignoring the police order.
	   Kuldip, Widhi and Wandy had been detained for 47 days since
their arrest on March 9. Farah was held for 11 days.
	   The defendants and their lawyers from the Indonesian Legal Aid
and Human Rights Association (PBHI) accepted the judge's decision.
	   The four activists were the only defendants freed from the
charges.
	   In earlier trials, the city's district courts have jailed
activists, such as actress Ratna Sarumpaet and hundreds of
supporters of ousted Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) leader
Megawati Soekarnoputri, under the same charges of ignoring police
orders.

	   CRANE Operators Testing and Training Sdn Bhd yesterday signed a
memorandum of understanding with Worksafe Western Australia to
assist in its training course for crane operators in Malaysia.
	   This tie-up is a result of COTT's safety certificates being
recognised by the Department of Occupational Safety and Health as
being sufficient to meet crane operators' licensing requirements.
	   COTT is the first local entity to have its safety training
certification recognised by DOSH, and it aims to raise the
standards of crane operators in this country to an internationally
accepted level.
	   Under the latest ruling announced in August last year by Human
Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek, crane operators have to be
registered for courses to ensure competency. Otherwise, DOSH will
not renew the operating licences of contractors.
	   COTT, set up in August last year, is the designated provider of
crane operation training under the auspices of the National
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.
	   The standards that COTT uses are identical to Australian and
international standards. Worksafe is a Western Australian
government agency responsible for industrial and worksite safety.
	   The training course for crane operators takes four days,
consisting of three days of training and one day of assessment at
COTT's RM2 million training centre in Nilai, Negri Sembilan.
	   Training cost is set at RM1,600 with a 25 per cent discount for
students who are members of NIOSH. Students will gain a competency
certificate upon successful completion.
	   COTT chairman Ismail Atan estimated that thus far, about 1,000
people had attended the course, or 10 per cent of the total number
of crane operators in the country.
	   The centre is equipped with technical equipment such as tower
cranes, mobile cranes, truck-mounted cranes, crawler cranes and
hoisting equipment of various types. A total of seven trainers are
stationed in Nilai and each one can train up to 20 in a class.
	   Under the tie-up between COTT and Worksafe, an innovative method
to teaching people about crane operating is being implemented for
the first time in the world.
	   Worksafe will develop a crane simulator in the next six months
to be installed into Safety Line, a web page about occupational
safety and health.
	   Viewers worldwide can download the simulator and ``play'' the
game to test their skills as a crane operator. A similar simulator
programme will be developed for forklifts as well.
	   Western Australia Commissioner Neil Bartholomaeus said that the
simulator would demonstrate that education and safety can be
delivered over the Internet.
	   He said he would like Worksafe and COTT to set up a joint
venture to provide all aspects of safety training at a regional and
international level in the near future.
	   In recognition of the mobile nature of labour in the region,
Bartholomaeus said that similar crane training programmes with
international accreditation, such as that being offered by COTT,
would also be offered to Indonesia and Singapore to standardise the
industry.

	   North Jakarta mayoralty will most likely lose about Rp 500
million in locally generated revenue per annum following a ban on
the collection of 20 levies, an official said.
	   Djohan Anwar, head of the mayoralty's population office, said
revenue from the collection of levies from the processing of
citizenship documents alone, including family cards, resettling
licenses, change of citizenship and expatriate registration,
reached about Rp 976 million per annum.
	   ``After the stoppage of the collections, however, the revenue
from citizenship document processing is projected to reach only
about half as much,'' Djohan was quoted by Antara as saying.
	   Based on Gubernatorial Decree No. 134/1998, he said, only
collection of the levy from citizenship identity cards was allowed
to continue.
	   ``It will be the main contributor to our locally generated
revenue,'' he said.

	   THE Sangha Supreme Council has ordered all monastic chiefs and
abbots of Buddhist temples throughout the country to scrap all
construction plans and refrain from soliciting money from the
public for the purpose during the current economic downturn.
	   Samanjit Piromruen, director-general of Religious Affairs
Department, told a gathering of almost 3,000 Buddhist monastic
chiefs and abbots at a seminar on monastic reform in Nakhon Pathom
that the money earmarked for construction projects should be
reverted to more useful purposes, like helping the poor.
	   ''There is no justification for building new chanting halls and
other non-essential structures in this national crisis when the
people are suffering from consequences of economic slump,''
Samanjit said quoting the Sangha Supreme Council.
	   The director-general said Buddhist temples with ongoing
construction projects could continue provided that they already
have the budget supplied by the government.
	   ''However, even if there is a budget to continue the
construction projects, abbots are advised to consider diverting the
money for social works,'' Samanjit said.
	   The director-general said the seminar held at Buddha Monthon
religious centre in Nakhon Pathom was aimed at ridding Buddhist
monastic order of bad elements and promoting a more positive image
of monks in propagating Buddhism and helping relieve the hardships
facing the people.
	   ''All Buddhist monks must do their part to solve problems facing
the monastic order so that the community and the people can turn to
Buddhist temples for help in these difficult times,'' Samanjit
said.
	   Phra Yannawarodom, a member of the Sangha Supreme Council, said
there was still room for improvement in the way people entering
monkhood are screened by senior monks and abbots charged with
ordination. Lack of effective screening means bad people could slip
through and become ''bad'' monks.
	   ''But there is bound to be some bad monks in the Buddhist
monastic order just like in every other walk of life. But bad monks
are in a minority,'' the senior monk said.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy Education Minister Arkhom Engchuan said Monday
that he had decided not to submit a proposal seeking to change the
way monks are promoted in the Buddhist hierarchy as earlier
planned.
	   ''I changed my mind after realising that I have overlooked the
fact that the Sangha Supreme Council already has a very effective
criteria for promotion of Buddhist monks,'' Arkhom said.
	   Arkhom, who supervises the Religious Affairs Department, said
the department would provide training in modern management
techniques and familiarise monks with social issues so that
Buddhist monks and temples can better help people in need.
	   ''Temples are called on to help people in every way they can,
including providing food for the poor, giving job training for the
jobless, treating drug addicts or organising funerals for the
destitute,'' the deputy minister said.
	   Buddhist temples should strive to find economical ways of
performing religious rites as part of the effort to preserve the
age-old tradition and propagate Buddhism.
	   ''For example, in these difficult times the temples should try
to find cheaper ways to organise funerals, cut back on water and
electricity bills, and so on,'' Arkhom said.

World Cup: Romania beats Colombia 1-0

	   LYON, France (AP) _ ``The Cobra'' lived up to his nickname.
	   The 24-year-old Adrian Ilie of Valencia gave Romania a 1-0
victory Monday over Colombia _ and probably a solid chance to
qualify for the second round.
	   The former Steaua Bucharest star, who exploded onto the scene
this year as a forward both in Spain and for his country, placed a
magnificent chip shot in the 44th minute from some 15 meters
(yards) that sailed over goalkeeper Farid Mondragon into the net.
	   The Valencia forward, so nicknamed because of his habit of
striking from nowhere, outmaneuvered midfielder Maurizio Serna and
defender Everth Palacios in his effort and sealed off the fate of
the Group G opener.
	   Ilie's goal poured cold water over Colombian efforts to avenge
their 3-1 loss to Romania at the '94 World Cup.
	   ``We repeated the history of four years ago at USA World Cup '94
but with a different score,'' coach Anghel Iordanescu said after
the lively game before 44,000 soccer fans, about 7,000 of them from
Colombia.
	   ``The victory has a great psychological importance for us,
because this was the opening game and also because we fielded
several young, less experienced players. This implied certain
risks,'' he said.
	   He replaced veteran midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, 32, with
25-year-old Lucian Marinescu of Rapid Bucharest, due to Hagi's poor
play and passing. Hagi, who plays for Galatasaray, already has
announced that he will retire after France.
	   The Romanian squad, still built around the core of veterans that
played at the 1994 World Cup in the United States, set the pace for
much of the match. In contrast, Colombia struggled to maintain
possession despite occasional flashes of technical excellence.
	   Colombia nearly tied the game in the 85th minute when
replacement Adolfo Valencia stretched Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan
Stelea for a diving save to his right with his shot from 30 meters.
	   Colombia started the game briskly but its passing was ragged and
easily intercepted by the Romanians, who quickly established
midfield dominance.
	   Ilie had the first scoring chance on a fast break in the 11th
minute, when he beat three defenders in the box and crossed the
ball to unmarked Viorel Moldovan, who failed to connect from 7
meters (yards).
	   At the start of the second half, Colombia's coach Hernan Dario
Gomez livened up his attack by substituting ineffective striker
Victor Aritsizabal with Valencia, but to no avail.
	   ``It was a difficult game. In the first period we lacked
cohesion and clarity. After the break we were much more determined
but unfortunately we missed all our scoring opportunities. We
didn't have much luck,'' Gomez told reporters.
	   In the other Group G game Monday, England beat Tunisia 2-0.

	   FINANCIAL services group Affin Holdings Bhd is interested in
acquiring a major stake in a life insurance company, said managing
director Datuk Lodin Wok Kamaruddin yesterday.
	   He said the group is presently in early negotiations with a
``large life insurance company'', which he declined to name.
	   ``We are looking for a quality and professional insurer and are
scouting for partners actively,'' Lodin told reporters in Kuala
Lumpur after attending the group's annual general meeting.
	   Affin Holdings is currently involved in general insurance
through associate company Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance (M)
Bhd.
	   The interest in the insurance company is in line with the aim to
transform the group into a ``financial supermarket''.
	   Lodin also said Affin Holdings expected this year to be a
profitable one, and is confident in maintaining the non-performing
loan ratio of its banking operations at a single-digit figure.
	   Perwira Affin Bank Bhd chief executive Raja Aman Ahmad said
total net NPL stood at 6.11 per cent or RM894.43 million of total
lending during the first quarter compared to 2.83 per cent or
RM415.07 million in the previous quarter.
	   ``The economic scenario is of importance and we see NPLs
increasing, but we are optimistic that our NPL will be maintained
at a single-digit figure,'' he said.
	   ``At least 80 per cent of our profits come from our banking
operations and that is very stable at the moment. I think we will
show profits throughout 1998,'' said Lodin.
	   The group reported an interest income of RM563.42 million for
the quarter ended March 31, 1998, and achieved a pre-tax profit of
RM79.07 million.
	   At bank level, it turned in RM462.3 million in interest income
and generated RM40.18 million in pre-tax profit.
	   Lodin said profits for the second quarter are expected to be
maintained but ``may fall slightly'' and the group will be
increasing its general provisioning as at June 30, 1998.
	   Raja Aman said Perwira Affin Bank will further restructure and
continue to give priority to productive sectors outlined by the
Government, though he expected to see slower loan payments for the
year.
	   He said the bank ``can still do well in times like this'' and is
getting good business from sectors such as plantation, export and
manufacturing.
	   Meanwhile, Lodin said Affin-UOB Securities Sdn Bhd, a joint
stockbroking venture between Affin Holdings and Singapore-based
United Overseas Bank Group, is expected to commence operations in
July or August this year.
	   The expected merger between the group's finance arm - Affin
Finance Bhd - and Asia Commercial Finance (M) Bhd is to be
completed within six months, he said.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leadership Monday
ordered the immediate release of nine of the country's most
prominent political prisoners to ``facilitate the process of
national reconciliation.''
	   The prisoners to be released include such well-known figures as
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979
and Beko Ransome-Kuti, a pro-democracy activist jailed since 1995.
	   But Nigeria's best known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not mentioned in the statement from
David Atta, the press secretary for Nigeria's new military leader,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   The prisoners were being held in far-flung jails across this
sprawling West African country and it was not immediately clear
exactly when they would return home.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the immediate release of some detainees
and prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation
and reconstruction,'' Atta said adding other prisoners ``would be
given consideration from time.''

	   Rupiah remained weak yesterday despite the International
Monetary Fund's (IMF) encouraging statement about its forthcoming
aid for Indonesia.
	   The rupiah continued to tumble, hitting an intraday low of
14,500 in early trading but recovered slightly to 14,000 at the end
of trading yesterday.
	   It had closed at 13,900 the previous day.
	   ``Though the rupiah remains weak, it managed to recover slightly
due to profit-taking by some operators ahead of the weekend,'' a
dealer with a local private bank said.
	   Currency dealers said that the weak sentiment in the regional
currency market and escalating protests on the country's political
and social fronts further dragged down the currency,
	   The IMF's Asia Pacific director Hubert Neiss said yesterday that
the agency would speed up the disbursement of its next loan tranche
to Indonesia.
	   But his statement elicited no positive response in the market.
	   Neiss said the rupiah's plunge against the U.S. dollar was
attributed to a combination of internal developments and external
factors, including weakness across Asian markets this week.
	   ``The rupiah has been weak for a while because of the economic
situation in Indonesia, and that has not yet turned around,'' he
told reporters after meeting President B.J. Habibie yesterday .
	   ``And the rupiah has absorbed the effects of the regional
disruption,' he said.
	   ``The whole situation in the region has deteriorated in the last
few days and the rupiah has weakened with it,'' he said.
	   An economist with Danareksa Sekuritas, Raden Pardede, said that
persistent unresolved political uncertainties at home remained a
major obstacle to the rupiah and stock market's recovery.
	   Following the bearish rupiah, the main index on the Jakarta
Stock Exchange (JSX) closed 0.8 percent lower yesterday, falling
3.17 points to 408.37 on a total turnover of 296.16million shares
on the regular market worth Rp 328.15 billion (US$23.43 million).
	   Brokers attributed the fall to profit taking by most investors
on the gains they made on cross-listed stocks like PT Telkom,
Indosat and Tambang Timah.
	   Stock prices for the above three stocks account for 30 percent
of the total market capitalization on the local exchange.
	   Telkom's share price fell Rp 150 to Rp 3,550 on a total turnover
of 2.89 million shares, Indosat shed Rp 1,525 to Rp 15,175 on 1.23
million shares and tin miner Tambang Timah slid Rp 75 to Rp 6,900
on 360,000 shares traded.
	   Brokers said most investors were concentrating on one-day
trading activities.
	   ``There is no medium or long-term investors in the local
market,'' a broker with Bali Securities said.
	   The head of Sales of Bahana Securities Bruce Rolph said
yesterday that the country's crippled financial market and economy
was further withered by a bleak economic outlook this year with
soaring inflation and predicted growth of minus 10 percent.
	   ``The overseas general view on Indonesia is bad causing more
offshore funds to get rid of the local market,'' he said.
	   Though Rolph praised the government's painstaking measures to
cope with the country's economic and political crisis, more
measures had to be taken.
	   ``President Habibie has done positive things but the country's
problems are so big that much more has to be done,'' he said.

	   IN timing his move to coincide with public sentiments over the
worsening economy, opposition leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh Monday
called on Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai to quit.
	   In keeping with his reputation of having a honey-coated razor
tongue, Chuan countered that the government was tackling the
problems head on although it would be impossible to restore
everything to the pre-July 2, 1997, conditions, referring to
Chavalit's decision to switch the currency exchange regime which
triggered the present crisis.
	   Amid a growing feeling of uncertainty in the region, the two
rival political leaders engaged in a new round of verbal exchanges
instead of working on a solution.
	   Chavalit kicked off the fresh political game by blaming Chuan
for his failure to steer the economy out of the doldrums.
	   ''Chuan could not deliver on his promise, which has damaged the
country. So he must go,'' he said, adding that leaders would choose
a new prime minister after Chuan resigned.
	   The prime minister, on his turn, shrugged off Chavalit's call,
saying that it would have no impact on public's confidence in him,
adding that the ruling coalition would only heed criticism if it
was constructive in nature.
	   New Aspiration Party secretary general Snoh Thienthong on Sunday
floated the idea of inviting an ''outsider'' to head the government
after Chuan's exit, were he to resign.
	   Senate Speaker Meechai Ruchuphan commented that the Constitution
specifically prohibited an non-elected official from becoming the
premier.
	   Meechai wryly suggested that politicians should search among
their peers of about 390 House members for a suitable candidate to
take the government's helm before calling for a change in
leadership.
	   ''There must be a candidate who can tackle the economic woes
before we form an opinion on whether he is a suitable
replacement,'' he said.
	   He also warned against a hasty judgement on the government's
performance, saying that the crisis was too large and complex to
allow a quick cure.
	   House Speaker Wan Mohammad Noor Matha said that Snoh was
expressing his own personal view.
	   He noted that the call for an outsider to lead the government
was not in line with the intents of the charter.
	   Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart reaffirmed that the
government would continue to implement its mandate to steer the
country out of the crisis.
	   ''The people would be the judge of our performance,'' he said,
rebuking the opposition's attempt to undermine the coalition.
	   Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiseth criticised the
opposition for making demands based on emotion rather than reason.
	   ''Political changes would depend on the political situation in a
given period, not on the emotions or personal desires of
politicians,'' he added.
	   He also quipped that the Chinese should start worrying about
Chavalit's recent announcement that China would not devalue the
yuan, referring to the ex-premier's repeated failure of keep his
words when he led the coalition in 1997.

	   PENGURUSAN Danaharta Nasional Bhd has appointed ``UBS and J.P.
Morgan as joint bookrunners and joint lead managers'' for its
upcoming US dollar global bond issue of up to US$2 billion (RM8
billion).
	   Danaharta said in a statement issued yesterday that the bonds
will be fully guaranteed by the Government but did not release any
further details.
	   J.P. Morgan, along with Arthur Andersen, is the financial
adviser to Danaharta, the asset management company formed by the
Government to revive viable non-performing loans (NPLs) of local
financial institutions.
	   Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim had said Danaharta would initially raise RM10 billion via
the issue of bonds locally and abroad.
	   He said US$1 billion to US$2 billion would be raised in the
international bond market while the rest of the initial proceeds
will be raised in the domestic market when liquidity improves.
	   Danaharta is expected to need about RM25 billion to take up the
non- performing loans of the banking system.
	   Seed capital for the establishment of Danaharta will come in the
form of a RM50 million grant from the Government, which will
initially hold the entire stake in the company.
	   Local and foreign investors will then be invited to take up
stakes in Danaharta, leaving the Government with only a minority
stake.

	   NIGERIA will be fired up by spicy Thai curry when they clash
with Bulgaria at the World Cup finals in France this week. The Thai
offering is part of Bangkok's show of gratitude towards one of its
largest rice importers.
	   The Thai Embassy in France is to prepare complimentary curry
rice for the Nigerian players, in appreciation of their country's
continued import of Thai rice and to congratulate the team for
their superb performance at the World Cup, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said Monday.
	   He said Nigeria buys 500,000 tonnes of Thai rice annually and
used to be the country's biggest customer. But with an order of 1
million tonnes, Indonesia is currently the biggest buyer of Thai
rice.
	   Kobsak said Thai officials in Paris will contact the Nigerian
team, who are scheduled to arrive in the city tomorrow, and treat
them to curry rice before their next match against Bulgaria on
Friday.
	   Nigeria, the current Olympic champions, beat Spain 3-2 in their
opening Group D match last Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration-operated
pawnshops have seen a rocketing increase in customers since France
'98 began last Wednesday, pawnshop managers said Monday.
	   The surge in pawnshop business, in fact, has caught the managers
on the wrong foot, having found themselves with inadequate
revolving funds to cope with the sudden burst of customers, they
said.
	   BMA's Talat Plu pawnshop manager Hansa Chutimaporn said she
found the Bt100,000 to Bt200,000 the shop uses to deal with its
daily clientele dismally inadequate. ''An increase in customers
this size needs up to Bt700,000 to Bt1,200,000 in revolving
funds,'' she revealed.
	   Sureeporn Dao-udom, the manager of BMA's Min Buri pawnshop, said
that up to 200 new customers a day have flocked to her shop dealing
in Bt2 million worth of loans in lieu of pawned valuables.
	   She said she planned to ask for more cash of up to Bt1.4 million
from the BMA if the shop is to cope with the increase in new
business.
	   BMA's Bang Bon pawnshop manager Kasem Thirajit said he, too,
planned to ask for more funds, adding that people returning to
redeem their pawned valuables have dwindled in number.
	   In another soccer-related matter, police Monday said they had
rounded up 70 bookmakers and 80 punters in a crackdown on World Cup
gambling.
	   Millions of baht were also seized in the raids since the
tournament opened, an officer at the operations centre of a special
World Cup anti-gambling task force said.
	   All gambling outside horse-racing and lotteries is illegal in
Thailand and the maximum penalty of two years in jail, or a fine of
2,000 baht applies to both bookies and punters.

	   JOHOR is pursuing a balance within its retail sector in line
with the quest for balanced development in the State's economy,
Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman said.
	   ``There is a place for everybody; supermarkets, hypermarkets and
small traders. We would like to see a balanced development in the
retail sector,'' he said.
	   He said this when opening Booker Cash &AMP; Carry (Malaysia) Sdn
Bhd's first wholesale depot at Tebrau Industrial Estate II in Johor
Baru yesterday.
	   Also present were Booker Malaysia chairman Tan Sri Wan Azmi Wan
Hamzah, Booker plc group commercial director Richard Maude-Roxby
and Booker Malaysia managing director David Boner.
	   Ghani said he believed Booker was playing a role which
facilitated balanced development in the retail sector, in big and
small towns alike.
	   He said because Booker had direct links with manufacturers, it
would be able to offer reasonable prices to retailers, who in turn,
could pass on savings to consumers.
	   At the ceremony, Ghani also unveilled Booker's own range of
products, labelled ``Pelanggan Ria,'' which are sold exclusively to
its trade customers.
	   The Booker depot caters only to traders, not end consumers.
	   Meanwhile, Wan Azmi said Bookers' operations in Malaysia, which
will be expanded to 20 to 25 outlets in the next five years, is to
help small traders and caterers compete with established
hypermarkets and supermarkets.
	   ``We are here to help them remain an integral part of the
Malaysian community. The only way to stop them from losing their
market share is to increase their competitiveness.''
	   Wan Azmi added that Booker's introduction of the wholesale
business was in line with the State Government's wishes to check
the rising cost of living in Johor Baru and promote Malaysian-made
products.

	   The Indonesian Importers Association urged the government
yesterday to ease the import restriction on lubricants, saying such
a barrier only encouraged monopolistic and graft practices.
	   The association's chairman, Amirudin Saud, said the restriction
should be lifted to help factories reduce their operational costs.
	   The state oil and gas company Pertamina is the only company
allowed to import and sell oil and oil-related products.
	   Industrial companies are allowed to import them for their own
use but they must obtain permits from Pertamina, Amirudin said.
	   Pertamina officials who deal with the importers, however, often
charge the companies large sums of money before issuing the
permits, he said, adding that the permit issuance also took weeks.
	   The lubricant and petrochemical products currently under the
control of Pertamina include solid and liquid lubricants, crude
lubricant oil, ethylene, propylene, butylene and butadiene.
	   Lubricants are used in many factories, such as textile plants,
while petrochemical products are used as raw materials for certain
products such as cosmetics, he said.
	   Amirudin said companies could spend about 5 percent of the total
import cost on illegal fees just to get their permits issued.
	   One member of the Indonesian Exporters Association, Anton Supit,
said yesterday that managed trading of other commodities created
the ``invisible monopoly''.
	   Anton said that under the current managed trading, certain
export-oriented companies are exempted from tax and customs fees
when they import raw materials.
	   But some of these companies often only sell the imported raw
materials at higher prices to local buyers, instead of using them
to produce goods, he said.

	   JUBILATION ... Happiness is printed glaringly on the faces of
these Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia students.
	   They are the proud recipients of loans under the National Higher
Education Fund, totalling some RM6 million.
	   The money will come in handy to 676 UKM students - 400 Arts and
276 Science students - for the 1997/98 academic session.
	   Presenting the loans was the National Higher Education Fund
Corporation chairman, Ahmad Husni Hanadzlah.
	   While the loans are expected to ease the financial constraints
of parents a little, the students were reminded to repay their
loans within the stipulated time.
	   Recipients must begin repayment six months after completing
their studies but they are not required to secure guarantors.

	   The government should revise its strategy in the fight against
the second Asian financial crisis, Vatchara Charoonsantikul writes.
	   As widespread fears over a regional economic recession loom, the
Chuan government should take decisive action before a renewed
crisis develops which could drive many Asian economies to record
zero or negative growth this year.
	   Thailand has been highly commended by international leaders for
adhering to its commitments under a US$17.2 billion economic
bail-out package sponsored by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
	   Under the conditions, the government is forced to implement a
high interest rate policy to defend the baht, on hopes that it will
help boost investor confidence.
	   As Asia's economies have been closely linked for a long time,
the Chuan government should undergo a radical change in its
strategy to ward off any renewed crisis.
	   The change should be put in place right away as several
neighbouring countries are posting negative economic growth for the
first quarter of 1998.
	   The Japanese yen Monday broke through 145 against the US dollar
after the country announced its economy has been mired in
recession.
	   The Japanese economy in the first quarter of this year is
expected to shrink by 1.3 per cent while Hong Kong and Indonesia
are forecast to post growth of minus 2 per cent and minus 6.2 per
cent, respectively.
	   Furthermore, Malaysia's economic growth is expected to shrink by
10.8 per cent for the quarter while South Korea and Thailand are
expected to contract by 3.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent,
respectively.
	   With dark clouds hanging over the region, it seems impossible
for the Thai economy to stage a quick turnaround in the second half
of 1998. The IMF forecast 1998 economic growth at minus 4.5 to
minus 6 per cent.
	   The Thai government is now facing an uphill task on injecting
liquidity into the real sector.
	   The big question remains on whether Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda will agree to relax monetary policy and allow the
Bank of Thailand to increase the money supply in the system.
	   If the six-month-old government decides to revise its strategy,
it would be a big change after Tarrin repeatedly said baht
stability is the top priority for tackling financial problems and
boosting exports.
	   Nevertheless, rising exports do not help much when local firms
must pay their gigantic foreign debts and a trade surplus of $700
million to $800 million per month is not adequate to regenerate
exports. More importantly, export income is failing to reduce
illiquidity in the local market.
	   The government's hope to boost exports and stage an economic
recovery is quite limited, given the expected economic recession
across the region would reduce purchasing power significantly.
	   Tackling the problems of local financial institutions should be
a pre-condition before the central bank agrees to increase the
money supply.
	   If the financial institutions are not functioning well, such an
increase may not help stimulate the economy as hoped.
	   Moreover, the central bank plans to buy local bonds issued by
the government to help reduce the financial burden of the Financial
Institutions Development Fund. This will push up inflation as the
purchase is one means of increasing the money supply.
	   The next concern is that if domestic banks fail to recapitalise
as required, some of them are expected to fall under state control.
	   Realising the liquidity shortage is ongoing, the government
plans to issue bonds worth $5 billion to be sold internationally.
	   The question remains as to how the government will finance
itself as it will shoulder a high interest burden from the bond
issues as the Thai and regional economies continue to plumb new
depths.
	   Another question is where the money will come from as the
government is expected to post a budget deficit of 3 per cent for
the 1998 fiscal year. The government is under intense pressure as
it must rely largely on state enterprise revenues as well as the
remaining budget of only Bt230 billion.
	   Instead of recording a budget deficit, an across-the board tax
cut should be another alternative. Although the cut would not boost
local corporates which are expected to face heavy losses, it would
help reduce individual burdens and stimulate greater public
savings.
	   Currently, the corporate income tax rate is 30 per cent while
personal income tax varies from 5 per cent to 37 per cent depending
on the salary.
	   ''Fiscal management policy should be a combination between a
possible reduction of personal income tax and an appropriate
allocation of the national budget to relieve the economic pain,''
an expert said.
	   The time bomb is ticking as the worsening economic situation may
not leave much time for the Chuan government to act. Support for
the current economic team led by Tarrin and deputy prime minister
Supachai Panichpakdi is likely to fade as economic troubles become
social problems.
	   Social problems are demonstrated by the rising unemployment
rate. The rate is expected to escalate by 6 per cent or about three
million to four million layoffs. The Labour and Social Welfare
Ministry earlier forecast the number of unemployed this year will
remain around 2.6 million while the National Statistic Agency
predicts 2.8 million layoffs.
	   Furthermore, private foreign debt worth more than $72 billion
has not been completely restructured or rolled over. Foreign
creditors are calling in their loans and capital continues to flow
out of the country.
	   Foreign speculators are reportedly preparing to launch a renewed
attack on the baht after their successful attack in July of last
year.
	   A foreign dealer believes there are signs that offshore currency
investors have started speculating on the baht.
	   The deteriorating Thai economy as well as the regional financial
crisis continue to test the Chuan government's capabilities.

	   KOTA BARU, Fri. - The Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Kota Baru today
donated about 3,000 one sen coins collected by its students for the
``1 Sen Fun''
	   campaign launched last November.
	   Thirteen students accompanied by their teachers, Shaila
Ramakrishnan and Cheam Poh Peng, handed over their contribution to
the New Straits Times office here.
	   Shaila said they were pleased to be part of the campaign to help
the underprivileged attend the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur
in September.
	   ``We decide to take part in the campaign to show our concern for
the less fortunate.
	   ``In doing so, we also hope to inculcate the values of love and
care for our fellow men, especially young children.
	   ``Being a non-sectarian and multi religious organisation, this
is one of our ways of extending our services to help society.''
	   She said the collection was carried out by the centre's Human
Values Class among the teachers and students.
	   ``We began collecting the coins soon after when the campaign was
lauched seven months ago,'' she added.
	   Shaila said the centre also organised other activities including
blood donation drives, aids to the old folks' homes and the hard
core poor.
	   The ``1 Sen Fun'' campaign, organised by the New Straits Times
and TV3, was launched by Youth and Sports Minister Tan Sri
Muhyiddin Yasin on Nov 13, last year.
	   It was aimed to collect 1 sen coins to sponsor orphans, the
disabled, schoolchildren, former athletes, the elderly and
volunteers to watch the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games.

	   PT Djayanti Group, controlled by timber baron Burhan Uray, plans
to develop 35,000 hectares of rice fields in West Mimika regency,
Irian Jaya.
	   An executive of the Djayanti group's Irian Jaya division, Busli
Saraka, said yesterday that in the first stage the company would
develop a 300 hectare-rice field in the company's forest
concessions in Mimika.
	   The company has already opened a 17-hectare rice field in the
area.
	   ``The development of rice fields is badly needed in Irian Jaya
to help the province become self-sufficient in rice production,''
he was quoted as saying by Antara yesterday.
	   Governor of Irian Jaya province Freddy Numberi said that the
provincial government supported the company's plan and asked the
Djayanti group to involve local people in the rice field project.

	   WHEN Menteri Besar Tan Sri Wan Mokhtar Ahmad said the State
Government has given another two-year extension to five companies
to start their projects in Tasik Kenyir last week, he was merely
emphasising that the Government needed the private sector to take
the lead in developing the lake.
	   The proposals by the five companies to develop hotels, chalets,
theme parks and other recreational facilities, were approved as far
back as 1993, when the country's economy was robust and supported
by a strong ringgit. Their performance so far has been dismal.
	   The five companies, SPPT Development Sdn Bhd, ASM Development
Sdn Bhd, Atasan Holdings Sdn Bhd, Kenyir Lake Tourist Sdn Bhd and
Rumpun Indera Sdn Bhd, obtained approvals to develop large areas,
some covering more than 400 hectares each.
	   However, with the slowdown in the economy, it is not certain if
the two- year extension given to them would be sufficient for them
to proceed with their projects.
	   It was reported that SPPT Development planned to invest RM12
million to build a 128-room hotel, five chalets and a jetty at
Pulau Sumas, one of the 340 islands in Tasik Kenyir, and its
project was supposed to be completed in 1994.
	   In 1993, ASM Development planned to begin its construction of a
tourist complex complete with a theme park at Pulau Dula. The
project involving an investment of about RM107 million, was the
most ambitious and would transform the island into a ``Fantasy
Island''. However, until today, the project remains a fantasy.
	   In the same year, Atasan Holdings was expected to invest about
RM60 million to build 60 chalets, two dormitories and five
bungalows at Pulau Serindit.
	   Kenyir Lake Tourist Resort, one of the first companies to
provide floating chalets at Tasik Kenyir, had planned to invest RM2
million to build 50 floating chalets at the Saok waterfall and
another RM3 million on 40 more chalets near the waterfall in 1993.
	   The fifth company, Rumpun Indera had planned to invest RM6
million to build 60 chalets at the north-easterly side of the lake.
	   Had all these plans been implemented, Tasik Kenyir would have
become a truly prime tourist destination in the country if not the
region today.
	   However, in 1995, when not a single pile was sunk by these
companies, the State Government issued a warning asking them to
proceed with their projects. This was again a period of strong
economic growth.
	   Last year, the State Government issued an ultimatum that the
approvals would be revoked unless a good reason was given to
explain the delay in implementing the projects.
	   According to Wan Mokhtar, the companies wanted the Government to
provide the basic infrastructure to inaccessible areas, an argument
which was accepted, and also because the Government still wanted
the projects to get off the ground in view of the growth potential.
	   However, before the extension was given, the State Government
through Ketengah, constructed a seven kilometre road costing RM7
million fringing Tasik Kenyir. The road was completed in 1996 but
was hardly used, except by workers constructing a new building for
the Kenyir Waterworks Department.
	   The State Government also decided last year that it could not
wait for the private sector to implement their projects.
	   It decided to build a road leading to a 400ha area near Sungai
Gawi which will be developed into a training and educational
centre. By the middle of next year the road is expected to be
completed and buildings for the training and educational
institutions would be erected.
	   In addition to the buildings, a new township would be developed
by the Government in anticipation of the increase in traffic flow
from the west coast when the second East-West highway from Ipoh to
Sungai Gawi is completed by 2000.
	   All these infrastructure development was aimed at making Tasik
Kenyir not merely a stopover for travellers but to turn the
country's largest man-made lake into a prime destination for
holiday makers and investors.
	   About two years ago, Wan Mokhtar, who is also chairman of
Ketengah, said Ketengah could build hotels to support the demand by
visitors but it would be costly.
	   What was worrying the State Government was that the private
sector lacked confidence about the potential of Tasik Kenyir as a
growth centre despite the increase in the number of visitors from
about 10,000 people eight years ago to more than 130,000 people
last year.
	   The State Government could not launch an all-out promotion
campaign with accommodation and other facilities not in place.
	   Most of the 130,000 visitors last year were day-trippers who
lingered around the main jetty at Sungai Gawi or visited the Sultan
Mahmud Hydro- electric Dam in Jenagor.
	   Even if 10 per cent of the visitors decided to stay overnight at
the lake, they would probably have to bring along camping gear as
existing accommodation facilities are not enough.
	   There are less than 500 rooms available for accommodation. The
biggest resort is the five-star Tasik Kenyir Golf Resort which has
150 rooms.
	   Some visitors also find the unregulated boat service confusing
as fares for the round-island trips as well as to certain
waterfalls are not only different from one boat operator to another
but also expensive.
	   Tasik Kenyir is a haven for nature lovers, especially anglers,
but the promotion of the lake as an angler's paradise is depleting
its resources.
	   Again, the State Government has to step in to regulate angling
activities and release some species not found in the lake, such as
the temoleh, to ensure that anglers continue to enjoy their sport.
	   The private sector has also failed to take advantage of the
State Government's incentives to promote the lake as an aquaculture
centre.
	   A few small-timers in the aquaculture sector have proven that
the lake's water is suitable for breeding of fish such as the red
tilapia and baung, which has a good market in the country and
Singapore.
	   However, their success has not wetted the appetite of big
players in the industry.

	   TELECOMASIA Corp Plc, the largest private fixed-line operator in
Thailand, is cutting staff as demanded by its creditors and parent
company Charoen Pokphand Group.
	   TA and its subsidiaries currently employ about 7,300 people. It
remains unclear how many have to leave the telecom group, a company
source said.
	   He said each deparment has already been ordered to find out the
number of staff it actually needs to keep operations going amid the
current economic difficulties and report to the management by
August.
	   TA's president Dr Ajva Taulananda remains opposed to the lay-off
plan. He believes that expenses could be cut further instead. Dr
Vallobh Vimolvanich, a director, has been given the responsibity to
reduce staff, the source said.
	   Thai-Germany Products takes steps to survive TO maintain and
improve its business situation, Thai-Germany Products Plc has
decided to significantly downsize its operations, particularly in
terms of employment.
	   The firm, in its report to the Stock Exchange of Thailand, said
its rehabilitation plan would be completed by October.
	   Since the fourth quarter of last year it has reduced its
workforce to 600 from 800. It has also reduced staff salaries,
including those of the executives, including optional Saturdays
off.
	   The report said it had no plans to increase salaries, except
those of sales personnel, or its workforce.
	   The firm also said it would try and increase exports by 30 per
cent and reduce credit terms by 30 days.
	   BoT to sign Slovak accord VICE chairman of the Board of Trade of
Thailand Pramon Sutivong is to sign an Agreement of Cooperation
with the Slovak Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI).
	   The accord, discussed during the Board of Trade's mission to
Slovakia two years ago, will mark the first step towards
establishing trade and economic relations between the Thai and
Slovak private sectors.
	   Peter Mihok, SCCI president, is to lead an eight-member
delegation to Thailand and hold talks with Thai firms wishing to do
business with Slovakia.
	   The main interest of the mission will be in the export of
chemical products, equipment for power generation, oil refineries,
the nuclear industry, petrochemicals, building and mining, office
furniture and the transfer of technology.
	   Thai products of interest to the Slovaks include chemical
products, consumer goods, knitting and weaving machines and
truck-mounted cranes.
	   Thailand's trade with Slovakia had fallen to Bt85.2 million at
the start of this year from last year's total of Bt381.9 million,
though it still looks to be in Thailand's favour.
	   Thai exports totalled Bt66.2 million in this year's first
quarter. Major export items were garments, household textiles,
footwear, tinned fish, fabrics, plastic products, umbrellas,
precious stones and jewellery.
	   New flavour for Strepsils BOOTS has, for the first time,
launched a new flavour in Strepsils Lozenges in Thailand.
	   Managing director of Boots Healthcare (Thailand), Kelvin
Moffatt, disclosed that the firm had researched and developed the
Strepsils Herbal Mint Lozenges to satisfy the herb-conscious
market, which has been growing internationally.
	   The company expects the herbal mint to gain at least four per
cent of the total market in Thailand in the next two years.
	   In 1991 the lozenge market growth rate through the drug store
channel was six per cent while Strepsil's growth rate was 36 per
cent, which has since increased to 39 per cent.
	   ''Boots has earned revenue of Bt68 million from traditional
vitamin-C flavoured Strepsils and Bt25 million from the menthol
flavour,'' Moffatt said.
	   Having succeeded from the marketing campaign in the last two
months in Thailand, Boots plans to launch the product in Malaysia,
Hong Kong, Vietnam and Spain in the near future. The new flavour
will be launched in Singapore in August.

	   State-run electricity firm PLN has cut the power supply to the
go cart track at Sentul circuit yesterday after the latter failed
to pay an outstanding bill of Rp 7 million (US$700) for the first
six months of this year.
	   Head of PLN's Bogor branch Pandoe A said yesterday the
management of Sentul circuit, controlled by former President
Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra, had ignored
several warnings on the late payment.
	   ``As a result, we have had to cut the power supply temporarily
to Sentul circuit,'' he was quoted as saying by Antara yesterday.
	   Pandoe admitted that it was impossible for his company to take
the action when Soeharto was still in power several months ago.
	   ``But after Soeharto resigned from presidency, we feel obliged
to cut the power supply,'' he said.

	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Fri. - Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad called
on Malaysians not to be influenced by media propaganda by western
capitalists to manipulate their minds to create disunity and weaken
the country.
	   The Prime Minister said the West had coined many words such as
globalisation, deregulation and crony capitalism and these were
often used by the Malaysian media.
	   ``In the past we have not heard of crony capitalism. They
created this word and we echoed it. To them, all those who are rich
are Government cronies although they are not.
	   ``They also said we are not transparent and talk about
globalisation which allows them to go wherever they want to do
business. They say they have the expertise and the capital they
brought in will bring happiness to the people.
	   ``Our people accept them and we also talk about globalisation,
deregulation, liberalisation, borderless world, crony capitalism,
corruption and many more.
	   ``It sounds nice and they (western capitalists) like it when
they know that the poison they have injected is working and they
have succeeded in controlling the minds,'' he said.
	   He was speaking to political leaders and heads of government
departments during a luncheon here. Also present were Menteri Besar
Tan Sri Wan Mokhtar Ahmad and State executive councillors.
	   Dr Mahathir said the capitalists were now showing their might
following the fall of communism and socialism.
	   He said these capitalists introduced a theory where business and
industries should be free of Government interference and that there
must be deregulation and liberalisation.
	   He added that Governments which obstructed people with capital
from carrying out activities which profited them were labelled as
undemocratic.
	   However, he said, the capitalists felt that they should not just
confine themselves to their own countries, thus they wanted to
control the world and making the world ``a fruit garden where they
can pick the fruits anytime''.
	   ``However, there are laws which determine a nation's border and
such laws is the right of the nation to protect its interests.
	   ``That is why they created globalisation and borderless world.
Therefore, we must not think that we should have a border or
boundary. We are a world society and anyone can come into our
country to do business and we must not obstruct them.
	   ``At the same time, they say their countries are also open for
us to invest in. But how are we going to do business. We don't know
anything. We don't have the ability and the capital.
	   ``If we open our borders, they are the ones who will come and
not us going to their countries. They wanted us to remove all the
obstacles so that their banks and industries can grow and take over
our companies, thus controlling our economy.
	   ``However, those who normally have control on the economy will
want to control politics as well so that they can determine who
leads a nation so that they can get what they want.''
	   He added that history showed that in South America, the
Government of a few small countries depended solely on banana
plantation opened by investors.
	   ``It is similar here. If we do not have our own companies, they
will have control over our economy and politics.
	   ``This is their ambition. But they are clever. They will deny
any such plans. However, we can observe that there are nations
which have to change their leaders due to pressures from them.
	   ``These are the market forces which is a new name for
capitalism. They want to control the world,'' he added.
	   Dr Mahathir said no one could deny that the people of various
races had benefited from Government programmes, including the New
Economic Policy.
	   He added that the Government provided scholarships, built
schools in rural areas, provided medical facilities and sent
students abroad so that when they return they could be involved in
business.
	   ``Anyone who says that they have not benefited, they are
ungrateful,'' he added.
	   However, he made it clear that not everyone received the same
benefit.
	   Those who worked hard and were efficient, he said, would get
more and those not efficient would get less.
	   ``However, there are those who alleged that the administration
is inefficient and oppresses the people. These are the people who
allow themselves to be used by outsiders.''
	   He said outsiders were not keen in helping the nation, but more
interested in controlling the country by bringing down the value of
the ringgit.
	   In so doing, he said, they wanted to colonise the country.
	   He said Malaysia succeeded in defending itself because, despite
the economic problem, the people were united and responsible.

	   THE Stock Exchange of Thailand Monday registered a 5.72 per cent
drop with the lowest trading volume in years, due to a slide in the
embattled yen which unleashed early fresh tremors to the Thai baht
and the stock market.
	   The Thai market closed at 263.37 points. Meanwhile, the Thai
baht nearly breached the 44 level before ending at 43.80 from
43.45.
	   ''The market has weakened further on the continued fall of the
Japanese yen, and these falls are on the back of extremely thin
liquidity and volume,'' Seamico Securities' analyst Bill Anderson
said.
	   An analyst at Asia Securities Trading Plc said the yen affected
the downward trading in the region, where the drop averaged 3 to 5
per cent, with the Thai bourse in worse shape than others.
	   Analysts said investor confidence in Thailand was suffering at
the hands of regional currency turmoil at a time when the index
could gain no support from domestic economic news.
	   The SET's broad-based index fell 15.98 points to close at 263.39
points, while the select SET 50 was down 1.24 points to 17.47
points. Only Bt918.2 million worth of stocks were traded.
	   The baht depreciated Bt0.30 to end at Bt43.85 to the US dollar.
	   Investors were also mindful of the pressure on the Chinese yuan
and Hong Kong dollar, analysts said.
	   An analyst at Asia Securities said there was an expectation that
yen would reach YEN 150/US$ faster than the initial forecast.
	   Currency speculation was active Monday. And the expectation that
China will later certainly need to readjust the yuan's value has
further hampered sentiments. If that occurs, the SET index will
find it very difficult to pick up.
	   Selling sprees occurred in banking and finance stocks which
closed 5.27 and 14.85 per cent lower to 154.04 and 559.58 points
Monday.
	   Market capitalisation over the Thai bourse dropped from Bt1.133
trillion as of the end of 1997 (index at 372.69) to Bt968.08
billion on June 12 this year (index at 279.37).
	   The banking and finance stock index shed 297.37 and 1180.93
points respectively at the end of last year to 162.61 and 657.19
points last Friday. In the same period, market capitalisation of
the banking and finance sectors dropped from Bt234 billion and
Bt27.7 billion to Bt193 billion and Bt29.6 billion respectively.
	   As in Thailand, sellers speeded up their dumping of Singapore
shares Monday, as the main index dived 3.5 per cent and another
investment house predicted a recession this year.
	   ''Twelve months into the economic crisis, the GDP contraction
across Asia has proved to be severe and widespread,'' said
investment banker Merrill Lynch in a monthly report.
''Fundamentally strong economies like Hong Kong and Singapore now
appear heading for recession.'' The benchmark Straits Times
Industrial Index in Singapore dropped 38 points to 1052.84.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index plunged 82.16
points, or 4.5 per cent, to 1,746.86, a new five-month low. The
dollar averaged 41.566 pesos, up 1.247 pesos or 3 per cent from
Thursday's 40.319 pesos. The dollar touched a high of 42.580 pesos,
a level last reached in early February. Philippine markets were
closed on Friday for the centennial of the country's declaration of
independence from Spanish colonial rule.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index plunged 5.7 per cent, Seoul's market
index fell 4.8 per cent to an 11-year low, and Kuala Lumpur slumped
4.3 per cent.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index closed 1.871 points
lower at 406.501. Turnover totalled 249.5 million shares worth
269.992 billion rupiah (US$18.1 million). The Indonesian rupiah was
trading at 14,700-14,900 against the dollar in late trade Monday.

	   SUNGAI PETANI, Fri. - The Cabinet has approved a RM30 million
allocation to speed up the construction of a supply pipe from the
Sungai Selangor Phase II water treatment plant to Kuala Lumpur,
Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu said today.
	   He said, originally the work was expected to be completed by Dec
31 at a cost of RM380 million.
	   However, in order to complete the project earlier the Government
will have to pump in an additional RM30 million.
	   He said the allocation would allow work to be carried out by a
larger number of contractors on a 24-hour basis to complete it
before the end of the year.
	   The proposal to allocate additional funds to speed up the
construction of the supply pipe by Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd was put
forward in the Ministry's working paper to the Cabinet earlier this
month.
	   Under the proposal the construction of the supply pipe will now
be completed in three phases - on July 15, Aug 15 and Oct 15
respectively.
	   ``The ministry has estimated that the extra cost incurred would
be about RM30 million and this sum was approved at the recent
Cabinet meeting.
	   ``However, Puncak Niaga has requested a higher allocation,'' he
said adding that the ministry and the Selangor Waterworks
Department officers are now trying to reach an agreement with
Puncak Niaga over the figure ``The three parties are holding
discussions today and I have given them until noon tomorrow to
reach a decision,'' he said after chairing the MIC Merbok Division
meeting here.
	   Samy Vellu added that he would present the final decision to
Deputy Prime Minster Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, who is also the
Finance Minister, on Monday.
	   The supply pipe stretching about 40 kilometres will supply about
99 million litres of water daily to several areas in Kuala Lumpur,
when completed.
	   Samy Vellu also said the move would ensure water supply to those
areas in the event that rains expected from the North-East Monsoon
in September did not come.

	   She was once a cheerful girl and one of the brightest students
in her school. Now the 16-year-old is in a state of shock and
suffering very acute depression.
	   This is the description of the teenager's mother, who with her
daughter, a rape victim in the recent riots, managed to summon the
courage to report the incident to a crisis center.
	   The mother's simple description of herself speaks volumes: ``I
feel terribly sad and I am probably going insane.''
	   Looking scared and frightened, the girl recalls her nightmare.
She was raped by seven men when a mob ransacked homes of many
Chinese-Indonesians at a housing complex in West Jakarta last
month.
	   They grabbed her by the neck, she said, and dragged her out of
the house. ``Then some of them ripped my blouse in front of an
angry mob. I cried for my parents' help, but those immoral guys had
threatened to kill us all,'' she sobbed.
	   She fell unconscious as the assault began. When she woke up,
naked, she was covered in bruises and could only feel pain.
	   The girl is among an unknown number of victims of the recent
riots. She and her mother chose to go to the crisis center run by
the School of Psychology at the University of Indonesia (UI).
	   While some women were killed after being raped and others have
taken their own lives, women like the above teenager will have to
live with the experience.
	   Crisis centers here, which are relatively new, are at hand to
support and give what other help they can to the victims. Such
support will have to continue for an indefinite period, from the
reporting of a case until trial -- if, as in many cases, the victim
does not drop the charges. The victim would still need support
after the experience is exposed to the public.
	   The people in charge of these crisis centers seem to know what
they, and the victims, are up against.
	   Kristy E. Poerwandari, a psychologist at the UI crisis center,
said that victims of rape or other sexual violence are physically
and mentally fragile.
	   Ratna Batara Munti of the Association of Indonesian Women for
Justice (APIK), is uncompromising in her belief that the legal
system here is still ``rich in gender bias.'' The head of the
research division of APIK's legal aid office said one result is
that rape is underreported as a crime.
	   Syndrome
	   Kristy explained that the most frequent aftereffects for the
sexually tortured women are severe anxiety, sleeping disorder,
nightmares, apathy, loss of confidence, depression, and suicidal
inclinations. These are identified as the rape trauma syndrome.
	   The victims need support and empathy from families, friends and
society, and need immediate professional help to reduce impacts
caused by the trauma to a minimum, she said.
	   ``These women and their families should know that there are
still many who are willing to help, to protect them and to fight
for their rights,'' Kristy said.
	   She admitted that many people are ignorant about the current
rape issue, partly because victims are mostly from the minority
group.
	   ``It does not mean that these women deserve less concern from us
and the authorities if they were sexually assaulted,'' she said.
	   She went on to say that the School of Psychology's crisis center
provides professional assistance including psychological counseling
for sexually assaulted women, families who were attacked in the
riots and also victims of mass layoffs.
	   Other organizations are also offering victim support, counseling
and legal representation.
	   Sita Aripurnami, an executive of Kalyanamitra, said a working
group involving a number of non-government organizations and
humanitarian activists was already established to help victims of
rape and other related crimes.
	   Kalyanamitra has been active in promoting the rights of women
through education, information and advocacy.
	   ``But now, we are facing an emergency situation in which women
have become the most weak victims,'' said Sita.
	   Sita acknowledged the opening of hot lines and counseling are
only preliminary efforts to help ease the riot survivors' pain.
	   Kalyanamitra has received a number of reports of rape cases and
will soon carry out integrated actions to deal with them.
	   Dhanie L., coordinator of a fact-finding team, said that the
crisis center where she works, Mitra Perempuan, has also received
reports from several rape victims and their families.
	   ``All phone calls are treated confidentially and are followed up
with prompt action, including visiting women and families of riot
victims,'' she said.
	   Mitra Perempuan is conducting its investigation into the impact
of the riots in cooperation with other non-governmental
humanitarian institutions such as the National Commission on Human
Rights.
	   The team is checking the number of casualties and victims of
rape, other sexual abuse and human rights violations.
	   ``We find it very difficult to collect information both from
victims and witnesses because they are still frightened to report
the real facts,'' Dhanie said.
	   She said that the women's crisis center, set up last year,
received a report from a mother and her 12-year old daughter who
were raped by a group of looters in their own home in North
Jakarta's housing complex. Her husband who tried to help them was
hanged by the mob.
	   ``The mother told us that wives and daughters of her neighbors
were also raped but they did not have any courage to report. We
assume that there are a lot more rape victims in the
neighborhood,'' Dhani said.
	   As soon as they obtain valid data and adequate facts, Mitra
Perempuan plans to legally process all related criminal cases and
even sue the authorities who failed to protect citizens, she added.
	   But legal victories may be very hard to achieve, says Ratna of
APIK.
	   Ratna described how legal actions consume both time and money,
especially those involving women seek justice in the current system
for abuse for their rights.
	   She explained that rape and other violence against women are the
most underreported crimes, while the police and people in the local
legal system do not record such cases as crimes.
	   ``Our legal system is still rich in gender bias against women
due to a lack of understanding and appreciation toward women's
issues,'' Ratna maintained.
	   In a rape case in court, for instance, she said women's accounts
were often disbelieved and undermined. Once a woman reported the
alleged rape, she would be drawn into a process from which she
could not withdraw. This could lead to contempt proceedings and
even possible imprisonment.
	   ``Some rape victims have become defendants because (the court
said) they lacked evidence. This explains why so few alleged
rapists are convicted. Instead they are set free, possibly to rape
again,'' Ratna said.
	   Despite these obstacles, Ratna encourages victims to reveal
their experiences and to allow their cases to be taken to court.
	   ``We hope that women are brave enough to speak out for justice.
We are here to provide them with moral support, legal aid and
protection,'' she said.
	   APIK, set up in 1995, has also been active in promoting the
welfare of female workers, besides protecting and legally
representing victims of domestic violence.
	   APIK's legal aid office can be reached on 872-6343. Mitra
Perempuan can be contacted via P.O. BOX 4113 Jktj-Jakarta 13041.
Their phone and facsimile number is 829-8421. Kalyanamitra's phone
numbers are 790-2109 and 790-2112, while the UI crisis center's
phone numbers are 788-81376 and 786-3523.

	   THE Bank of Thailand said its outstanding swap position as of
May stood at minus US$13.4 billion from a total of $23.4 billion in
August of last year.
	   In addition, the BOT announced it had collected Bt1.5 trillion
from commercial banks which have surplus foreign assets, which they
are required to sell to the BOT. The central bank has collected
only profit in baht terms, based on the July average exchange rates
of Bt30.27 per dollar and the June 30 mid-rate of Bt25.79.
	   Regarding swap positions, a statement released by the BOT showed
the offshore swap position in May amounted to only $1.8 billion,
compared with $2 billion in the middle of the month. The onshore
swap position fell by $300 million to $11.5 billion from $11.8
billion in the previous 15 days.
	   As a result, the country's foreign currency reserves at the end
of May dropped by $400 million to $27.5 million, compared with
$27.9 million in the last two weeks of the month.
	   The figure is still within the $26-$28 billion reserve range set
by the International Monetary Fund as part of the $17.2 billion
bail-out package for Thailand.
	   Jaturong Jantarang, a C6 economist in the BOT's economic
research department, said the central bank is attempting to reduce
its swap position to $9 billion by year's end as required by the
IMF.
	   ''We have to do so as we have already committed to it in the
fourth letter of intent,'' he added.
	   As of May, the monetary base increased by Bt32.5 billion to
Bt448.4 billion from Bt415.9 billion in the middle of the month.
The increase is due to the central bank's injection of liquidity
into the system via financial institutions, the statement said.
	   It added that corporate income tax payments in June plus cash
reserves of the financial institutions helped increase net credit
extensions by the central bank to the institutions in May by Bt35.1
billion to Bt88.5 billion, compared with Bt53.4 billion in the last
two weeks of the month.
	   Jaturong said he is not sure whether there were greater foreign
capital inflows in the second half of May, given that the baht
stabilised for the month. BY ANOMA SRISUKKASEM The Nation

	   Locals will tell you that the springs at Baturaden, where cool
weather, scenic beauty and a choice of cool or hot water, heal any
kind of stress you care to mention.
	   The hot springs are created from geothermal power from Mount
Slamet, on whose slopes Baturaden is located. The original
temperature of the water from the springs is 50 degrees Celsius;
this is adjusted as it flows toward visitors lounging in the pools
and tubs.
	   Baturaden lies 14 kilometers north of Purwokerto, the capital of
the Banyumas regency, at 640 meters above sea level. The average
temperature of the mountain weather here is about 18 degrees to 26
degrees Celsius.
	   Two popular sites are dubbed the Seven Hot Springs and the Three
Hot Springs.
	   Baturaden is also home to the beautiful waterfall called Curug
Gede, 50 meters high and 1.5 kms to the south of the gateway to
Baturaden.
	   Fifty meters south of the Seven Hot Springs is the Sarabadak
cave. This is a natural cave in which two, hot and cold, water
sources, send out streams of water flowing side by side.
	   For swimming enthusiasts, Baturaden also offers a fairly large
swimming pool with pristine natural water. Be careful, though, the
water is freezing.
	   And don't forget to take the cable car to enjoy the view below.
	   There are special facilities for children -- watercycles in a
fairly large pool teeming with fish. There are also three water
slides and three mini-trains.
	   Baturaden is also of interest to botanists; it is home to more
than 3,000 registered species of plants, and rare fruits also add
to the enjoyment.
	   According to the head of the Baturaden tourism office, Andri
Sungkowo, 489,852 people visited the area last year. The
authorities have named it the best tourist spot in Central Java.
	   However only 2,953 were foreigners, mostly from Holland and
Germany.
	   However, if the site maintains its reputation, which includes
cleanliness, the figures should increase.

	   PENANG, Fri. - The plight of thousands of small business owners
on the island who are seeking licences from the Penang Island
Municipal Council will be addressed when the council sets up an
ad-hoc committee soon.
	   Council president Dr Teng Hock Nan said the proposed committee
was aimed at regulating the applications of traders who run
tailoring shops, massage parlours, hairdressing salons, and
printing and cobbler shops.
	   He did not disclose the total number of such traders in the
State although over 2,000 such operators had applied to license
their businesses under the Municipal Council of Penang Island
(Trade, Business and Industry) Bylaws 1991.
	   Such businesses did not require licences until last year when
the by- laws were implemented.
	   ``The ad-hoc committee will streamline the procedures for
applications and will vet any `difficult' applications on a
case-by-case basis,'' he said after a full council meeting.
	   Dr Teng said the ``difficult applications'' included those with
zoning violations such as change of use of business premises.
	   ``We are trying to assist these old businesses in whatever way
possible although there will be no compromise on issues such as
safety,'' he added.
	   Dr Teng also said new business applications would not be vetted
by the committee and were subject to normal planning guidelines.
	   Meanwhile, today's meeting allowed assessment rates on illegal
buildings, illegal renovations and illegal use of business premises
to be struck off when cases involving them were brought to court.
	   Dr Teng said illegal buildings needed to be evaluated for
assessment so that such premises could have access to municipal
services such as garbage collection, drain cleaning and street
lighting.
	   The council today also gave its approval for future buildings
constructed illegally to be given an ``address'' by the council for
reference purposes.

	   IT is unsure whether the Board of Investment's recent measure to
allow foreigners to hold 100 per cent ownership in high-rise
building projects could lure in a hugh capital inflow from foreign
investors, according to participants at a property industry
seminar.
	   The foreign ownership regulation is only one condition. Other
factors that would persuade foreigners to help revive the Thai
property sector include economic recovery prospects, the legal
mechanism, and reasonable prices of the assets, they said.
	   Hemaraj Land and Development Plc president David Nardone said
the government should implement a legal mechanism to allow foreign
investors to hold a majority stake in the project.
	   The BoI measure may partly help revive the property sector.
However, the purchasing power, with regard to domestic investors,
has been shrinking. Consumers are unable to cope with the high
interest rates.
	   The low price asset offering by bankers, the Financial
Restructuring Authority (FRA) and developers have attracted several
investors, he added.
	   Ayuthya Jardine Fleming Asset Management managing director
Reungvit Nandhaviwat said that the BoI measure would overlap the
role of the property fund, which is an instrument foreign investors
use to acquire up to 100 per cent ownership of real estate projects
under the FRA by investing in the fund.
	   The BoI measure would have substantially revived the sluggish
property sector if it had been implemented three or four years ago.
The real estate market is currently inactive with a slump in
purchasing deals, he added.
	   Reungvit said most foreign investors are waiting for the
property price to plunge to 30 per cent of the original project
value.
	   FRA's assistant secretary-general Montri Chenvidakarn said that
the BoI measure would be in addition to the property fund being
mulled for rehabilitating the real estate sector. Investors will
begin investing only after the economy rebounds which will
automatically allow them to gain benefits from the purchased
projects.
	   Foreign investors have several alternatives to invest in the
property sector in the region. The property price in Hong Kong has
plunged by 40 per cent, similar to the high drop of value in Japan.
	   Montri added that the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is
currently considering 91 proposals for establishing the property
fund, which is expected to be completed in the next one to two
months.
	   The FRA has 11,000 corporate, commercial and real estate loans
worth Bt 461 billion. Once the foreclosure law is approved in
October, numerous investors are expected to flood to the country,
he added.

	   President B.J. Habibie assured the country that he ``would take
care of all traders,'' Chinese-Indonesian or not, during his tour
of several Jakarta shopping centers damaged in the May 14 riots.
But the charred ruins of buildings lining Jl. Mangga Dua Raya in
North Jakarta, and Chinatown in Glodok, West Jakarta, tell a
different story.
	   The ground in front of many stores is still grotesquely
decorated with hundreds of broken fragments of glass, almost a
month after the dark days, and traders are still scared.
	   Their fear stems from the ever-deteriorating economy,
threatening to fuel the dormant wrath which 'indigenous' people
here feel towards those of Chinese descent.
	   Traders, particularly Chinese-Indonesians, say that restoring
the ruined buildings, however unimaginable the expense, will be the
``easy part''.
	   Timontis, whose kiosks in Harco Mangga Dua electronics center
was destroyed, said the government has its work cut out if it wants
to attract Chinese traders who fled the riots back into the
country.
	   ``It is not going to be an easy job for the government to get
Chinese traders who fled to Singapore and Hong Kong to come back,''
Timontis said.
	   Given the uncertain economy, traders were expecting another
black day like May 14. ``(The day) could happen again soon, but we
will get our shops renovated. We will start from scratch again, but
we are still very edgy.''
	   About 110,000 Chinese-Indonesian families fled the country
during the riots, according to a new group called the Forum of
Reform Entrepreneurs. Most have not returned, leaving their shops
deserted.
	   From laser-jet printers and automobile spare-parts to the latest
video-cds, Glodok and Harco Mangga Dua were the places to go to
bargain and shop for electronic goods. Shopping centers were
crammed with stores owned by Chinese-Indonesians.
	   Of some comfort is that the Mangga Dua Mall and the
International Trade Center (ITC) in North Jakarta escaped with only
a few broken windows after heavy security was put in place.
	   Parking lots at Mangga Dua and ITC were full last week and the
clothing, shoe and accessories stores on floors three to six in the
Mangga Dua mall were packed with bargain hunters.
	   Nightmare
	   Susanto Lasmin, renovations coordinator in Harco Mangga Dua
electronics center, said that 900 kiosks in the mall were burned
and looted causing Rp 1 trillion in damage, excluding looted and
damaged merchandise.
	   Losses including merchandise in the Harco Mangga Dua area alone
could be over Rp 2 trillion, he added. At least 50 of the 600
shop-houses outside the mall were set on fire.
	   In Glodok, the estimated loss including merchandise is put at
between Rp 5 trillion and Rp 8 trillion, Johannes G., general
manager of PT Multi Plaza Properties which runs Glodok Plaza, said.
He added 350 kiosks in the plaza and 100 of the 400 shop-houses
outside were badly damaged by fire.
	   In Jakarta, more than 5,000 buildings, including 4,204 shops and
shopping malls, 501 bank offices and 12 gas stations were damaged,
burned or looted during four days of rioting last month. Losses
from the city's property sector alone were put at Rp 2.5 trillion
(US$250 million).
	   West Jakarta Mayor Sutardjianto had said that 65 people died and
45 were seriously injured in the fires there.
	   Susanto said renovations started two weeks ago. ``Only Rp 3
billion has been allocated to renovate the kiosks,'' he said.
	   ``Insurance companies will not pay up.'' He claimed the
companies insuring many of the buildings actually covered for
damage caused by riots, but ``they fear they will go bankrupt.''
	   He said that renovations would take one month and it would be a
further two months before owners reopened their kiosks.
	   Susanto said the numerous entrances to the Harco Mangga Dua area
had enabled rioters to enter without difficulty.
	   ``We have now spent hundreds of millions of rupiah on
30-centimeter-thick concrete walls to surround the Harco area,'' he
said. The place doesn't quite look like a fortress, but there are
now only a few entrances.
	   He said that with absolutely no more capital to invest in their
kiosks, and with banks unwilling to provide loans, traders were a
little jittery about starting work again.
	   ``We will fix the kiosks but trading is another story,'' Susanto
said. Even if banks would provide loans, interest rates would be
intolerably high.
	   Johannes said returning things to normal in Glodok would be a
long process.
	   He said his company would forward details of the losses to
Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tandjung and petition the government
for help. He added traders were only asking for leniency with
building permits and taxation.
	   ``If possible, exemption from taxes for three years at least,''
Johannes said, adding that ``credit should be extended to traders
at interest rates of not more than 25 percent per annum.''
	   Despite President Habibie's visit, he said, the government had
yet to make a formal statement asking traders who fled the city to
return.
	   ``This in itself gives traders a negative impression,'' he said,
despite the President's recent assurance that they would not be
discriminated against.
	   ``The government has never said 'we give you (traders who fled)
the assurance of safety. Please come back.' No such efforts have
been made.''
	   ``The new cabinet has promised that it will pay more attention
to small- and medium-sized enterprises,'' of the sort commonly
found in Glodok, he said.
	   Johanan, owner of the charred Sinar Mulya building materials
store on Jl. Mangga Dua Raya, said that he would have to spend
between Rp 200 million and Rp 300 million to repair his shop
premises. He said his losses could be as high as Rp 400 million.
	   ``As long as the building is secure and we have a strong door,
that's fine by me,'' Johanan said.
	   But he believed that it was pointless to expect help to be
forthcoming from the municipality. ``The nation itself is going
bankrupt, so what's the use?''
	   A woman walking through Glodok holding her six-year-old son's
hand stopped in shock in front of the once bustling plaza.
	   ``My husband used to send me here with a list of all sorts of
things ... printing ink, tools. I have passed here so many times
since the burning, and yet I still can't get over the ruins,'' she
said.
	   ``I feel sorry for those computer freaks. Where can they go
shopping now?'' she added.
	   Eeng, an electronic goods repairman, said most of his customers
had stopped buying electronics equipment for the time being.
	   ``We know the Mangga Dua area traders will eventually reopen
their stores and lease shop-houses in the Asemka area, near Pintu
Kecil in Kota, North Jakarta,'' Eeng said.
	   ``My friends usually buy electronics, including computer
equipment, from Pondok Indah Mall in South Jakarta. It has the most
complete range, but it costs a bomb.''
	   He added that an incomplete range was also available at stores
in the Princeton Park area of Lokasari, Mangga Besar.

	   KUALA KANGSAR, Fri. - Kuala Kangsar MP Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz
today set aside apprehensions from prospective investors over poor
access to the soon-to-be-completed Kuala Kangsar MIEL small and
medium scale industrial site at Lubuk Merbau five km from here.
	   Rafidah said she had confirmation from the Works Ministry that
the road linking the North-South Highway interchange at Kuala
Kangsar to Sauk and Grik would be upgraded beginning next year.
	   This should allay investors' fears that their containers would
have trouble reaching the Kuala Kangsar SMI site.
	   Despite 300 enquiries for factories, housing and land at the SMI
site, many prospective investors were worried their big vehicles
would find it difficult to negotiate the narrow and low road
underpath (with a railway track above) at Lubuk Merbau - currently
the only access from Kuala Kangsar to the site.
	   She said this after a briefing on the Kuala Kangsar SMI site by
MIEL chief executive Azmi Thamby Chik at the district office here
today.
	   Touching on another problem Rafidah said the Government had also
agreed to bear the cost of constructing a RM12 million retaining
pond to overcome drainage problems.
	   The construction of the RM435 million Kuala Kangsar SMI site -
jointly undertaken by the MIEL, Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, the Perak Economic Planning Unit and Kuala Kangsar
district office - is expected to create 1,000 jobs and attract 800
residents.
	   After infrastructure work, the first phase of the SMI site - of
which 54.45 hectares have been allocated for industries - will
comprise the construction of 160 factory lots and 18 shoplots.
	   Another 3.7 hectares have also been allocated for commercial
premises.
	   Infrastructure works at a cost of RM17 million which are half
completed, are now being carried out at the site with MITI
allocating RM9 million.
	   On agriculture, Rafidah asked that more research and surveys be
carried out to plant crops suitable for agricultural land in the
constituency.
	   ``Without this information, the potential of the land will not
be fully tapped as the acreage of farming and idle land seem to be
almost equal in the district.''
	   At the briefing by Kuala Kangsar agriculture officer Idris
Ibrahim, it was disclosed that the district had 5,699 hectares of
farm land and 5,214 hectares of idle land.

Nigerian junta frees nine prominent political detainees

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leadership Monday
ordered the immediate release of nine of the country's most
prominent political prisoners to ``facilitate the process of
national reconciliation.''
	   The prisoners to be released include such well-known figures as
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979
and Beko Ransome-Kuti, a pro-democracy activist jailed since 1995.
	   But Nigeria's best known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not mentioned in the statement from
David Atta, the press secretary for Nigeria's new military leader,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   The prisoners were being held in far-flung jails across this
sprawling West African country and it was not immediately clear
exactly when they would return home.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the immediate release of some detainees
and prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation
and reconstruction,'' Atta said adding other prisoners ``would be
given consideration from time to time.''
	   Gani Fawehinmi, an attorney and one of Nigeria's most vocal
critics of military rule praised the move as a ``joyous step
towards reconciliation.''
	   ``This is incredible. This is fantastic,'' said Fawehinmi.
``This gives us hope that something good will begin to happen
soon.''
	   He noted however that a number of prominent political figures
remained behind bars. ``They must go further and release all
detainees and all prisoners still in the gulag.''
	   Abubakar came to power a little less than a week ago, following
the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose five-year-dictatorship became
an international pariah for its human rights record.
	   In announcing the release of the prisoners, the new military
leader urged those granted amnesty to ``cooperate'' with the
government to create ``the country of our dreams.''
	   Abubakar also appealed to the international community to
appreciate the regime's efforts ``at solving our problems and show
greater understanding and sensitivity to our internal affairs.''
	   The prisoners to be freed were:
	   _ Obasanjo, who has served a 15-year treason sentence since his
arrest in 1995, voluntarily relinquished the presidency after an
election and went on to became a formidable critic of the late
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. He was released on compassionate grounds
and will be confined to his farm near Lagos at first.

	   NATIONAL flag carrier Thai Airways International (THAI) is
planning to usher in the year 2000 by presenting the country with
an all-Thai line-up of pilots for its modern fleet of aircraft.
	   ''We are pretty much on course for phasing out the last 11
expatriate pilots in stages over the next 18 months,'' said Captain
Chamlong Poompuang, deputy vice president, flight operations.
	   ''It will be the first time since our founding that all our
pilots will be Thais, a very good testimony to our expertise and
training standards.'' THAI now has 836 pilots. Until about five
years ago, the airline needed several dozen foreign pilots to
operate the many different aircraft types. But now, the
streamlining of the fleet-mix to Boeing 777s, 747-400s and
737-400s, MD-11s and Airbus 330s will facilitate the plan to train
more than enough Thai pilots to fly the aircraft.
	   Chamlong said there was no shortage of applicants every year for
pilot training vacancies. This year, THAI's newspaper advertisement
drew nearly 700 applications for only 20 vacancies. Applicants come
from a variety of different backgrounds -- among them, doctors,
engineers and teachers -- but they can only make it to one of the
coveted posts by passing the airline's rigorous recruitment tests.
	   Converting to an all-Thai pilot fleet will save the airline
millions of dollars in annual expenses, Chamlong said. ''We
normally need about 40 to 45 new pilots every year to support
business growth, replace retiring pilots and replace the
expatriates.
	   ''Of the 11 expatriate pilots we have today, three are flying
the A300-600s and the rest are flying the MD-11s. By January 1999,
the number will be down to only three pilots flying the MD-11s,''
he said.
	   Chamlong said the ratio of civilian to military pilots was now
about 50-50 and the airline wanted to maintain that level. ''In
fact, it's not important what the ratio is. They are all
well-trained, well-qualified pilots. However, drawing upon the
Armed Forces for pilots is good for us because they save us a lot
of money in training costs.
	   ''They already know how to fly. They only need to be trained to
fly commercially, whereas the civilian pilots have to be trained
from scratch, costing up to Bt1.4 million per pilot per year, at
the Hua Hin Civil Aviation Training Centre,'' he said.
	   Chamlong said THAI now has nine types of aircraft in its fleet,
to be pared to six by next year, saving further costs in training.
	   The airline's rigorous training programmes are being bolstered
by the installation of new simulators for the Boeing 777 and Airbus
330, to add to its current line-up of simulators for the Boeing
737-400, the 747-400 and the Airbus 300-600.
	   With the issue of safety very much in the news these days,
Chamlong said THAI pilots have been instructed to take an even more
conservative approach to safety than normal.
	   ''Pilots have been told to divert to other airports if they have
even the slightest hesitation over weather conditions at any
airport, in Thailand or abroad. This means no landing in stormy
weather. They've been told to be passive and conservative. It's
better to be safe than sorry.'' Chamlong said the airline is also
targeting fuel savings of about Bt120 million this fiscal year, or
about one per cent of the airline's total fuel bill.
	   The new fuel-saving campaign emphasises ''No payload without
revenue,'' meaning that pilots are not to take on more fuel than
necessary and to fill up on fuel at airports where it is cheaper
than other airports.
	   ''They also have to work with air-traffic controllers along the
flight path to seek the most direct route. Even on domestic
sectors, the aircraft are to fill up with fuel in Bangkok rather
than at upcountry airports where fuel costs are higher due to the
inclusion of transportation,'' Chamlong said.

	   Feeling utterly exhausted, Karep wheeled his Honda CB motorcycle
into the central room, which also functioned as sitting room,
living room, dining room and garage for his motor vehicle. The
clock on the wall showed the hour was midnight minus a few minutes.
In that room he was welcomed not by his wife, but by his mother,
whom he called Simbok.
	   ``Your wife has not come home, Rep.''
	   ``Oh, where did she go, Mbok?''
	   ``She told me she was going to visit a friend. She said she
wanted to borrow a book about sewing, but she has not returned.''
	   ``What time did she leave?''
	   ``She left at about four. Not long after you went to work.''
	   ``Its late now, Mbok. Why is Tentrem not home yet? What is her
friend's name, her address, Mbok?''
	   ``I did not ask her, Rep. I thought she would only be gone for a
short while. I did not ask her anything.''
	   ``Damn. Her husband works himself to exhaustion to earn a living
and she just leaves home without saying where she's going.''
	   ``Go and look for her, Rep. Kenyut, your child, has been crying
the whole time asking for his mother.''
	   Rep heard his child crying and asking for his mother in the
bedroom.
	   ``She is crazy, Tentrem. If she wanted to leave home why not
take the child with her. He's only three and should not be left
alone.''
	   ``Enough, Rep. Go and look for her!''
	   Karep wheeled his motorcycle back outside. Under the 15-watt
lamp in the room his face looked shiny, tired and haggard. The
motorcycle engine gave a deafening roar as he revved it up and sped
of through the narrow alleys of his neighborhood.
	   He asked all he met if they knew of his wife's whereabouts, even
the night guard.
	   ``I saw her this afternoon, Rep, but I do not know where she was
going. She was wearing shoes and carrying a big bag. She was well
dressed, Rep. I thought she might have been going on a picnic or
returning to her village.''
	   ``Damn her. Did she did not tell you anything, Min?''
	   ``No, she only smiled, Rep. She said nothing,'' said Min, who
was on night watch duty.
	   Karep mounted his motorcycle again and went up of the high
street in the direction of the city, leaving the wooden houses of
the densely populated kampong behind. He looked in every corner of
the city, but without success. Karep could not find Tentrem.
	   ``Any news, Rep?'' his mother asked when she met him on the
threshold of their house.
	   ``It's strange. I found no sign of Tentrem, Mbok. I'm worried,
Mbok. I am afraid Tentrem has left us all!''
	   ``Try to find her in her village. She may have gone to her
parents. Did you have a quarrel with her, Rep?''
	   ``I never quarrel with her, Mbok, but she often complains about
our worsening economic situation.''
	   ``Don't you get enough money from your motorcycle taxi business
and your salary as an errand boy at Bhakti Nusa junior high
school?''
	   ``That's just enough to eat,Mbok. Nothing else.''
	   ``What then?''
	   ``Just nothing. We are lucky to have something to eat.''
	   Tentrem's disappearance, and the responsibility of supporting
Kenyut and his mother were additional problems for Karep. It was
painful to hear Kenyut's crying every day and asking for his
mother. Karep wanted to be close to Kenyut to console him, but had
to leave home to work. In the morning he was an office boy, in the
evening he drove his motorcycle taxi, and now he had the extra task
of finding the wayward Tentrem.
	   Karep went to Tentrem's village but still could not find her.
	   ``You are Tentrem's husband. Why ask me where she is?'' his
mother-in-law said when Karep went to see her, much to the ire of
Karep.
	   ``If Tentrem is not here, I'll go straight home, Mbok.''
	   ``Take some rest. Have a drink, Rep,'' his mother-in-law said,
now with a devil-may-care attitude.
	   Karep did not respond to the offer that was a pure formality.
	   Tentrem had been going for two weeks and Karep had not ceased
looking for her. He had even reported the case to the village chief
and the police. Karep himself did not particularly care about
Tentrem's absence, but the daily lamentations and crying of their
son worried and angered him. If only Kenyut had not been born,
Karep would not give a damn about Tentrem's whereabouts. He even
thought of looking for another wife. The maid who worked in Pak
Sodrun's house on the corner often cast him approving looks. Karep
would think of her.
	   Nevertheless, Kenyut was the apple of his eye and gave him
happiness, and consoled him. He felt a deeper love for him, even
greater than his feelings for Tentrem or himself. His love for
Kenyut was incomparable to what he felt for Brindil, Pak Sodrun's
maid.
	   Karep therefore felt responsible for Kenyut's happiness and
needs, however difficult they were to fulfill, especially in
material matters. If only he could do that, how happy he would be.
But wishful thinking in a situation like this served no purpose and
Karep often suppressed his dreams as soon as they appeared, like
mushrooms in the rainy season. Perhaps only the rich were allowed
to have dreams, Karep often thought pessimistically and cynically.
	   After Tentrem had been missing for almost a month, Karep lost
all energy to look for her. Reports from the police, the village
head, neighbors and acquaintances did not throw any light on her
whereabouts and Karep felt inclined to give up on her. Kenyut's
wails and cries had become less frequent. Maybe Kenyut too had
begun to forget his mother.
	   One evening when he was heading home, Karep took a detour
through the city. He wanted to see the city and the bustle of its
night life.
	   When he stopped at the corner of a darkened alley, a woman in a
short mini-skirt approached him and his heart missed a few beats.
	   ``Come by, Mas?'' said the heavily made-up woman, walking
towards his motorcycle.
	   When she saw his face she started. Karep immediately jumped from
his bike.
	   ``Trem?''
	   ``No! No!!'' the woman ran away, closely pursued by Karep.
	   ``Trem! Tentrem! It's me. Don't forget your child, Trem!'' Karep
seized the woman's arm, but she wrenched it out of his grip and
cried loudly.
	   Two men emerged from the dark alley and attacked Karep, giving
him a severe beating. The woman made her escape as Karep lay on the
ground oozing blood.
	   ``Do not cause trouble at our place, you rascal!'' one of the
men said.
	   ``She's my wife, Mas. Her name is Tentrem. She left our home one
month ago. Honestly, I do not want to make trouble here, Mas. I
want to take my wife home. I pity our son, Mas,'' Karep lamented.
	   ``Many men say such things in places like this. Go away. If you
make trouble here again, we'll give you another thrashing!''
	   His body crushed, Karep left the dark alley. In his heart he was
sure that woman was his wife. There was no doubt that the woman in
the mini skirt was Tentrem!

	   KUCHING, Fri. - Sarawak Industrial Development Minister Datuk
Abang Johari Tun Abang Openg said today he supported the move to
stop the award of Government contracts under the umbrella concept
to build rural roads due to complaints of unfair distribution.
	   ``I support the move because in the very beginning (of its
implementation) there already existed some reservations (among
certain quarters) about its effectiveness.
	   ``This is due to the fact that it has some loopholes.''
	   Abang Johari said this after announcing the temporary closure of
the popular Pasar Tamu in Jalan Satok as it wasfound to be
unhygienic.
	   Sarawak, like other States, had its share of complaints on this
concept from small time contractors.
	   ``What happened was some reputable contractors set up
subsidiaries and passed on the sub-contracting jobs to these
subsidiaries instead of to other qualified small-time contractors.
	   ``So, in the end, we end up with names of a few different
companies but all of these companies belong to the same `towkay'
(owner),'' he said.
	   Abang Johari, however, added that the problem was not as
pronounced as in the peninsula.
	   ``We do have one or two companies doing this (abusing the
umbrella concept) but I can't reveal their identity,'' he said.
	   Abang Johari said reverting to the old practice would be fair to
small- time contractors.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had announced
yesterday that the selection of successful contractors would now be
handled by district offices as was the practice before the umbrella
concept was introduced.
	   Under the umbrella concept, each State had a reputable and
established contractor (normally Class A) handling government
contracts worth up to RM15 million under the Projek Jalan Kampung
of the Rural Development Ministry.
	   The contractor is expected to sub-contract jobs - to build
roads, bridges and related works - to small time or Class F
contractors under their `patronage' who are qualified to undertake
projects worth up to RM100,000.

World Cup: Moeller header puts Germans 1-0 ahead at halftime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A close range header by Andy Moeller after only
nine minutes put three-time champion Germany 1-0 up at half time of
their World Cup game against the United States Monday.
	   The Americans, playing their third World Cup in a row, were
exposed in the air by the well-organized Germans who were rarely
threatened at the back in the opening 45 minutes and created three
clear chances at the Parc des Princes.
	   American goalkeeper Kasey Keller came into the World Cup after
four shutouts but that run ended early.
	   The Germans almost went ahead in the fourth minute when Oliver
Bierhoff climbed to meet a right-wing corner with a powerful header
but the ball was blocked just short of the line by Claudio Reyna.
	   But they hit the target in the ninth when Olaf Thon swung over a
corner from the left, Juergen Klinsmann got above two American
defenders to head into the danger area and Moeller nodded the ball
home from six meters past the slow-reacting defender Mike Burns and
in off the right hand post.
	   Bierhoff should have added a second in the 22nd minute when he
controlled a cross from the right despite the attention of Eddie
Pope, who was grabbing his shirt. But the striker, newly acquired
by AC Milan, shot wide of the goal from no more than six meters.
	   The Americans did little to worry German goalkeeper Andreas
Koepke but Chad Deering unleashed a well-struck shot from 25 meters
in the 30th minute which the Olympique Marseille 'keeper held
confidently.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Olaf Thon; Juergen Kohler, Christian
Woerns; Stefan Reuter, Joerg Heinrich, Jens Jeremies, Thomas
Haessler, Andreas Moeller; Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   United States _ Kasey Keller; Thomas Dooley, Eddie Pope, David
Regis; Chad Deering, Brian Maisonneuve, Mike Burns, Cobi Jones,
Claudio Reyna, Ernie Stewart; Eric Wynalda.
	   Referee _ Said Belqola, Morocco.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Pakistan has assured Israel that it will
not pass on nuclear technology to Iran, the Israeli ambassador said
in an interview published Monday.
	   Ambassador Uri Bar-Ner told the English-language Turkish Daily
News, without elaborating, that Israel had received a ``kind of
assurance,'' from Pakistan.
	   ``I hope, and I think, that Pakistan and India will not transfer
technology to Iran. But you never know ... somebody could smuggle
technology,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Israel fears that Iran is close to developing missiles with
capabilities of striking at Israel and has warned Iran is advancing
its nuclear program
	   ``We have Russia, China. You have North Korea, which has been
helping Iran in long-range missiles. It is a serious matter,'' the
ambassador added.
	   Pakistan and India recently conducted a series of nuclear tests,
prompting threats of economic sanctions by the United States and
other major powers.

	   THE NORTHEASTERN People's Organisation (NPO) and the government
Monday failed to reach an agreement on crucial details of the draft
Farmer Life Rehabilitation Bill, including whether farmers should
be allowed to take part in determining the provisions of the
farmers rehabilitation funds.
	   The NPO, which comprises 11 northeastern farmers groups, Monday
vowed not to call off its mass rally in Bangkok set for next
Wednesday regardless of the conclusion reached at Saturday's
discussions.
	   It is important the executive committee of the farmers
rehabilitation funds be manned by farmers' representatives to
ensure fairness and transparency, said Nakorn Srivipat,
secretary-general of the Northeastern Small-scale Farmers Network,
which also falls under the NPO.
	   The NPO also opposed the appointment of a civil servant to the
secretary-general post of the Office of the Committee on Farmers
Rehabilitation to be set up under the Agriculture Ministry.
	   ''We rather prefer independent people who would avoid
bureaucratic red-tape,'' Nakorn said.
	   While it was agreed the fiscal budget will provide the main
source of the fund, the NPO suggested additional support should
come from other government organisation budgets and from fees
generated by the exports of agricultural products.
	   PM's deputy secretary-general Amnuay Patise, however, said he
must look into the involved agencies and other laws.
	   With regard to enactment of the bill, the NPO has demanded it be
a royal decree. This was opposed by the government which said the
proposal could raise more problems regarding the validity of the
bill.
	   Some participants at Monday's discussion expressed concern over
the lack of a mechanism to monitor the money to be provided to the
farmers group.
	   The government, by discussing the bill with the farmers group,
hoped to reduce mounting pressure over the accusation it had
ignored the plight of the poor.
	   The farmers group, meanwhile, has made more demands at each
discussion. The Assembly of the Poor, for instance, demanded the
farmers' debts, the result of a failed government project be
cancelled absolutely, while those incurred by drought or ''normal''
debts be suspended for five years.

	   KUCHING, Fri. - Curtin University of Technology, Australia, is
offering educational programmes in Sarawak through an agreement
with the State- owned Centre for Modern Management.
	   Students can take up Masters courses in Policy Sciences,
International Business and Accounting as well as a first degree
programme in Commerce majoring in management and marketing.
	   All four programmes are part-time courses. The masters
programmes are over two years while the basic degree programme is
over four years.
	   The programmes are targetted at the public and private sectors
and are geared towards enhancing individual effectiveness and
organisational development to meet the fast industrial development
in Sarawak.
	   CMM chairman Datuk Abdul Aziz Hussain signed the agreement on
behalf of CMM while Curtin University was represented by the
executive dean of its Business School, Professor Kevin Mckenna.
	   Speaking at the signing ceremony last night, Aziz said the
agreement reflected CMM's effort in promoting educational
programmes.
	   Stressing that CMM was always taking new initiatives in areas of
human resource and organisational development, he said it had also
embarked on educational programmes with Universiti Malaysia Sarawak
a year ago and students for the Masters of Science in Human
Resource Development would graduate in August.
	   Besides that 25 students have also graduated with Certificate of
Environmental Management.
	   ``We hope CMM will become the initiator and implementor of top
quality business and management programmes in the State.''

	   This is a story of another of those foreign painters who fell in
love with Bali.
	   The works of Maria Hofker, 95, were among those which brought
Bali to the world, though she has been largely overshadowed by her
husband's art.
	   Her sketches and watercolors have been collected in several
books, including Indonesian Impressions, published in 1994 in the
Netherlands. It is a selection of text and illustrations of four of
her surviving booklets: Bandung and Pangandaran; Bali, Woman at
Work; Remembrances of Legong and Djanger and Ballad of the Farmer.
	   Her works reflect a keen eye for nature's beauty and the life of
hard working farmers. Until now, Hofker has had 35 exhibitions,
mainly held in the Netherlands.
	   Her work was reproduced in book form for the first time,
together with reproductions of some of her husband's work, in 1978
shortly before he died in 1981. The book was titled Bali, published
by the Omniboek in The Hague.
	   Born in 1902, Maria Rueter was maybe a typical child of her time
in a family of artists. As a child she always liked art and nature
but at that time art was not thought of as a career possibility for
a woman.
	   So Maria learned a trade: bookbinding and calligraphy. She
worked commercially from her parents' home for five years after
finishing her education.
	   In 1930, she met and married Willem Hofker and helped him with
his career as a painter. As was expected from a good Dutch woman in
those days, she lived for her husband.
	   But then came Indonesia. In 1936 Willem Hofker got an assignment
to paint a portrait of Queen Wilhelmina for offices in Batavia, the
name for Jakarta during colonial times. In January 1938 they sailed
with the painting to hand deliver it.
	   In Indonesia, Maria found a lot of time on her hands. When in
Bandung, she made her first sketches and watercolors.
	   She sent watercolors of fruits in letters to her parents. These
are still well preserved today. The couple continued to travel to
Bali and stay with a painter in his simple bamboo house in Klandis
Kedaton.
	   The house was on the grounds of the temple well known locally
for famous legong dancers as Ni Sadri and Ni Cawan.
	   The Hofkers got acquainted with the few scientists and artists
staying in Bali at the time, including American anthropologist
Margaret Mead.
	   Artists from all nationalities seemed to be attracted to the
island, such as Walter Spies, Locatelli, Strasser, le Mayeur de
Merpres, Dooijewaard and Rudolf Bonnet.
	   Maria reflected on the fascination with Bali: ``You felt the
wisdom of the East, a wisdom I could not grasp completely, but for
which I opened myself and from which radiated enormous power. It
was a completely new and inspiring experience; we forgot about
returning home.''
	   The couple eventually lived in Ubud. Maria started to write
short stories on life in Bali and these ``impressions'', as she
called them, were published in magazines and a newspaper. She
provided calligraphies and illustrations for some of these stories,
then bound them in Balinese cloth.
	   On Feb. 19, 1942, Japanese forces occupied Bali and the couple
were imprisoned.
	   They were released six weeks later when the Japanese commander
of Bali turned up and said their policy did not include jailing
artists.
	   Before Christmas 1943, Willem and Maria were separated and put
in different civilian camps in Sulawesi. Here, Maria's camp was
bombed and most of her work destroyed. In February 1946, they
returned to the Netherlands, never to see Bali again.
	   Their life was transferred from the open, warm tropics to a cold
brick apartment. However, they felt spiritually enriched and
gradually both succeeded to get new jobs.
	   In 1948, Maria got a garden on the outskirts of Amsterdam. This
much coveted garden, which became the subject of a few of her
books, enabled her to combine her artistic talents developed in
Indonesia with her love for nature.
	   She put a rich choice of plants in her garden, leaving a lot to
nature, not making it too organized. She wrote her observations in
a diary and made beautifully calligraphed and illustrated yearbooks
which were published. She did this as much for commercial reasons
as for herself.
	   She did not sell many of her paintings; the couple lived off the
sales of her husband's works, which has still been a subject of
interest by the Glerum art auction house in the Netherlands.

	   SEA DELICACY ... Shark's fin is popular and its soup can be
found in many restaurants.
	   Seen here is Abdul Razak Misak (front), 28, who sells shark's
fins at the Kota Kinabalu Central Market.
	   Abdul Razak, from Kampung Likas, gets the shark's fins from
local fishermen who supply him with about 40 kilogrammes of the
item daily.
	   He then dries the shark's fins for a day before selling them for
between RM150 and RM500 per kilogramme.
	   Restaurant owners usually buy shark's fins in bulk, said Abdul
Razak adding that business had been brisk over the 15 years that he
has been in operation.

	   A HIGHWAY school bus tragedy Monday morning, killing nine and
injuring eight, took place at exactly the same T-junction in Nakhon
Si Thammarat's Tha Sala district where eleven students were killed
in a similar crash last year.
	   Akkarawut Thabhakij, one of students who survived the accident,
recalled the moment he escaped the tragic accident when a truck,
fully-loaded with animal feed, speeded diagonally across the street
hitting the back of the song taew loaded with about 20 students,
parked at the side of the highway.
	   ''I was hanging onto a bar on the edge talking to my friend,
then suddenly I happened to turn around and saw a ten-wheel-truck
moving towards us. I thought it surely was going to hit us, so I
jumped. The truck was less than a metre away from me when it
collided,'' he said, his voice trembling with fright.
	   The school bus taking students from Ban Don Sai was parked on
the Surat Thani to Nakhon Si Thammarat highway not far from the Wat
Don Sai junction waiting to pick up more students heading for a
school in Tha Sala district.
	   ''The accident happened in such a instant that I could not
manage to tell any friends to escape. The truck just smashed into
the bus. I saw my friends stuck in a pile inside the bus. Some were
thrown outside from the collision. I heard many moaning in pain,''
Akkarawut said.
	   Police are searching for Sanit Kaenkiam, the truck driver who
fled the scene.
	   Pol Lieu Chanyuth Maneesuwan, an inspector at Tha Sala district
police station did not rule out the possibility that the truck
driver had taken amphetamines.
	   ''The driver had driven a long way from Bangkok and might have
taken ya ba to stay alert. After the drug effect subsided, perhaps
he dozed off,'' Chanyuth said.
	   Eight students died instantly in the accident, three primary
school students, three high school students, the school bus driver,
and a parent. One student died later at Maharat hospital.
	   Witnesses said a similar accident occurred at same spot just one
year ago killing 11 students. They said drivers often sped on that
straight part of the highway.
	   Highway accidents are often caused by drivers who are high on
amphetamines, who then drive carelessly or doze off after the
effect of the drug wears off.
	   A recent survey showed that truck and bus drivers mostly buy the
drug from gas attendants and the drug trade is most rampant in gas
stations on highways in the north of Bangkok.

	   The song Dari Sabang Sampai Merauke (from Sabang to Merauke)
reminds one of the expanse of the country, from the westernmost
town to the easternmost place in Indonesia.
	   However, perhaps only a few would take the trouble to think
about the song's title which reflects the striking distances and
differences between the areas of Sabang and Merauke.
	   Reference to the song and the image it portrays introduces us to
the first pages of the book, based on the results of a workshop in
Yogyakarta in 1996 on problems in Indonesia's eastern provinces
	   Its introduction says it is aimed at reviewing the management of
wealth. The purpose of the management of wealth in eastern
Indonesia, it argues, ``should not necessarily mean the
impoverishment and enmity toward those who want to be different
from uniformed modernity.''
	   A quote from a local sums up the tensions in the drive to
modernization: ``before receiving assistance and being loved as the
poor, we want to be recognized and accepted as 'others,' as
different ...''
	   The experts contributing to the book are anthropologist P.M.
Laksono, missionary Theo van den Broek, and researchers at the
Realino Study Institute in Yogyakarta, Budi Susanto and A. Made
Tony Supriatma.
	   The writers highlight historical developments leading to current
conditions in eastern Indonesia and display their insight into
basic assumptions sometimes referred to as ``Jakarta ideas''.
	   They give examples as to how assumptions, mainly those regarding
the necessity to make Irian Jaya, for instance, ``catch up'' with
the rest of the country, are propagated by civilian and military
officials and even academia.
	   Exploitation, as perceived by the concerned scholars, generally
acts in the name of development or modernization of eastern
Indonesia. Local culture is often seen as an obstacle instead of
part of the wealth of the country's cultural diversity.
	   Each chapter reflects the writers' conviction that these ideas
are wrong and will forever worsen conditions in the area.
	   For government people, eastern areas have been considered one of
the best ``test sites'' for career promotion. Inhospitable terrain
with communities far-flung from central authorities pose a
challenge to officials. If they succeed, they could well be
promoted or transferred to a more developed region, usually to Java
or somewhere in western Indonesia.
	   From the business point of view, the eastern islands are
certainly a fertile and competitive area for investors. A number of
foreign companies were pioneers long ago and many of them are now
reaping the harvest. PT Freeport Indonesia boosted its business
through the exploitation of copper and gold at Timika.
	   The Conoco oil company, in cooperation with Ingold, has expanded
its wings in search of oil and minerals. Indonesia's eastern part
is also coveted by many companies for its riches in wood. Two big
plywood companies have been established in Sorong and Biak, while
in the coastal areas of Fak-fak regency similar companies have
arisen.
	   Memberamo was planned to be made into a hi-tech and large-scale
industrial region. According to B.J. Habibie, then minister of
research and technology, the Memberamo region was ideal to be made
a blueprint for the development of industries requiring huge
amounts of energy, like steel, aluminum and fiber.
	   The exploitation of the riches of Indonesia's eastern provinces
is not only focused on natural resources. Under the flags of Visit
Indonesia Year and Visit ASEAN Year, the cultural communities of
Asmat, Baliem and Kei are examples of nonnatural wealth exposed to
tourists.
	   Interests behind ``exploitation'' make international news. One
was the 1 percent trust fund given by PT Freeport to surrounding
communities which became a lengthy conflict among ethnic groups,
resulting in a number of deaths among locals in Timika.
	   With the purpose of launching the government's efforts for
``uniformity'', the writers say, religious institutions hold an
important role as a go-between for the interests of the ``center''
against the wishes of the local community. In general, the local
community has great trust in religious institutions.
	   Van den Broek, chairman of the socio-economic committee of the
Jayapura diocese, writes of the dilemmas of the church and how its
role slowly changed into reflecting more sensitivity to the
diversity of its surroundings.
	   Also interesting is the attached list of commodities including
those in the hands of a few well-connected private business groups.
The writers say the list at the end of the book is an extra
reminder that such monopolies should not be repeated in eastern
Indonesia.

	   KUCHING, Fri. - The popular pasar tamu (wet market) in Jalan
Satok has been declared unhygienic by the Health Ministry and was
closed yesterday for a 14-day clean-up exercise.
	   Satok State Assemblyman Datuk Abang Johari Tun Abang Openg said
the medical department, through its regular monitoring exercises,
had established that the wet market, especially the section selling
chicken and fish, had poor sanitation and was infested with
rodents.
	   ``We have decided to abide by the directive of the Health
Ministry to close the market as it could jeopardise public
health,'' he said.
	   Abang Johari, who is also Industrial Development Minister, said
although the 70 hawkers who trade there had expressed their
displeasure over the closure, public health and safety would assume
paramount importance in such matters.
	   Abang Johari said Kuching North City Hall would conduct a 14-day
cleaning exercise and would only re-open the market for business
when the greenlight is obtained from the medical authorities.
	   In the meantime, City Hall has set aside an area in Taman Sukma,
Petra Jaya, for the affected hawkers to conduct their business.
	   Abang Johari also said a committee would be formed soon to look
into ways to modernise the pasar tamu in Satok and make it more
hygienic.

	   Last month's storm of massive riots that hit Jakarta and several
other provincial cities steered clear of Yogyakarta.
	   How did this ancient city manage to escape the violence? It
certainly was a center of student demonstrations leading to
Soeharto's fall and was a city on edge after the riots in Jakarta.
Maybe Jakartans and residents of other areas hit by the turmoil
should reflect on this question.
	   If we point to student demonstrations as the spark igniting the
violence, then why did Yogyakarta escape the turmoil? Clashes with
security forces did occur in Yogyakarta. A group of radical
students here calling themselves the Committee of the Struggle for
Change viewed violence as the only means to achieve reform. Clashes
with security forces would erupt almost every time this group
organized a demonstration.
	   Dozens of students and a number of security personnel were
injured in such clashes -- one of them fatally. Fortunately, this
was as bad as it got in Yogyakarta.
	   A May 15 demonstration that lasted nearly 24 hours on Jl.
Gejayan did not result in significant property damage, though rocks
and tear gas were exchanged by security forces and protesters. The
mob only targeted public facilities to vent their animosity toward
the government. Not a single store along Jl. Gejayan was damaged.
	   Yogyakarta's economic activities came to a sudden halt once the
May 15 protest began. Store owners along Jl. Urip Sumohardjo and
Jl. Malioboro, most of whom are Chinese-Indonesians, chose to close
their establishments. Every store and building had spray painted
proreform messages or banners. The owners were afraid that the
disturbances that occurred in Surakarta would spread to Yogyakarta.
``Who can guarantee that the disturbances will not spread to
Yogya?'' sighed a store owner.
	   The demonstration that afternoon nearly ignited a riot. More
than 5,000 people took to the streets in the Jl. Gejayan area.
	   Emotions became heated when well-armed security forces started
to surround the protesters. Their very presence provoked some of
the protesters to start to throw rocks and anything else they could
get their hands on.
	   Tires were burned in the middle of the street to slow down the
police advances. The mob also started to lob rocks at Bank Tamara's
glass facade. Fortunately, some level-headed individuals in the
crowd calmed down those who wanted to set the building on fire.
	   As the mob approached a Timor dealership, resentment returned. A
new volley of rocks burst from the crowd, destroying the showroom's
glass walls, though the showroom's contents had already been
evacuated by the owner. The Timor billboard was ripped down from
the top of the building. The combination of this hated symbol of
Soeharto's family along with the presence of security forces stoked
the mob's rage to dangerous levels.
	   Luckily, Sultan Hamengkubuwono X, still a charismatic leader in
Yogyakarta, appeared at this critical moment.
	   The mob's attention suddenly turned to the Sultan who stood on
top of a car, right in the middle of his people. ``I respect your
struggle for reform. But you should not choose violent means. If
you keep order, I'll always be here to support your aspirations,''
the Sultan said, applauded by the mass.
	   The Sultan's plea came too late for some. Several days earlier,
a clash between students and security forces claimed the life of
Moses Gatutkaca, while several others were injured. But more
violence was avoided by the Sultan's move to mobilize every element
of society to support the reform movement and to avoid violence.
	   Later that day, posters and billboards calling for the people to
avoid violence appeared throughout the city reading: ``Yogya is not
a violent city'' and ``Peaceful reform''. Many of the signs were
put up by a group of students actively campaigning against
violence.
	   ``The people will unite when the struggle is based on a clean
heart and nonviolence,'' said Widihasto, a student who actively
campaigned for peaceful reform.
	   The Sultan's plea did much to sway the people against violence.
	   The business community also followed suit. The Yogyakarta
Chamber of Commerce and Industry organized donations from the
business community, mostly from Chinese-Indonesians. The donor's
names were printed in local newspapers, which at least implied
their support for reform. More than Rp 100 million rupiah was
collected through the effort. Community leaders approached security
forces to convince them not to use repressive measures against
demonstrators.
	   The extraordinary result could be seen during the colossal
demonstration on May 20 in front of the Sultan's palace. About one
million people filled the area from the north side of Jl.
Malioboro, which in the past was restricted for demonstrations, to
the north side of the field in front of the palace. They all
arrived on foot from about 40 campuses throughout Yogyakarta.
	   Only a few policemen were deployed. Shop owners provided drinks
and snacks to the demonstrators along streets heading toward Jl.
Malioboro and the Sultan's palace. Hot weather combined with
orations condemning Soeharto's regime were seen as a potent
combination for a riot. Yet, far from violent, the demonstration
turned into a rare display of democracy.
	   ``The people of Yogyakarta fully realized that social
discrepancies have not been caused by the ethnic Chinese, but by
the Soeharto regime,'' said Widihasto.
	   Nasikoen, a sociologist from Gadjah Mada University, said that
the academic environment in Yogyakarta helped nurture a healthy
social environment.
	   Furthermore, unlike Surakarta, Jakarta and Medan, social
discrepancies in Yogyakarta are less apparent. ``As a result, the
social environment in Yogyakarta is more healthy between indigenous
and nonindigenous Indonesians,'' he said.
	   It is hard not to argue that Sultan Hamengkubuwono X's presence
and influence more or less maintains this social dynamic. According
to Nasikoen, the Sultan has always maintained a close relationship
with every social stratum in Yogyakarta, even though politically he
is part of the late regime. During every election in the past,
tension arose between the Sultan, who was the chairman of the
Yogyakarta chapter of the ruling Golkar political grouping, with
elements of the public who support the United Development Party and
Indonesian Democratic Party. When the election ended, the Sultan
returned to his role as a pillar of society.
	   ``The Sultan has cultural authority over his people,'' said
Nasikoen. So, he added, there was little surprise when the people
of Yogyakarta listened to the Sultan's plea for nonviolence.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Fri. - Some 300 flag once graced U.S. Senate
offices
	   Saint Paul, MN -- U.S. senator Rod Grams today returned an
historic state flag to the people of Minnesota to be preserved for
future generations. Grams presented the flag to the Minnesota
Historical Society during a ceremony at the Minnesota History
Center. Since 1940, the flag has graced the offices of seven of
Minnesota's U.S. Senators.
	   ``One month after we celebrated the 140th anniversary of the
admission of Minnesota into the union, I'm happy to be here, at the
beautiful Minnesota History Center, to return an important symbol
of our state's rich history to the people of Minnesota The flag I'm
presenting today is more than an old piece of cloth -it's a symbol
of the people of Minnesota and the history of our state, said
Grams.
	   Minnesotans understand the importance of community, family, hard
work, and personal responsibility, and over the last century,
Minnesota has become a world leader in agriculture. medicine,
business, and technology, From the bluffs of Winona to the
sugarbeet farms of the Red River Valley, Minnesota continues to be
a shining example for the rest of the country and world, And that's
exactly what this flag represents,'' said Grams.
	   The flag is one of five sewn by the Robbinsdale WPA in the
1930's and 40's. The other four are on display at Camp Ripley.
Grams noted that the flag has been on display in the offices of
seven of Minnesota's U.S. Senators since 1940: Henrik Shipstead,
Edward John Thye, Eugene McCarthy, Hubert Humphrey, Muriel
Humphrey, Dave Durenburger, and Rod Grams.
	   ``I hope the preservation of this flag will be a powerful
reminder of Minnesota's political diversity and rich public service
tradition, which have played such an important role in the success
of our representative democracy. As we head into this next century,
I'm confident it will remind future generations of the Minnesota
values that have guided our citizens through the past 140 years.
Its preservation is a testament to Minnesota's success and
prosperity,'' concluded Grams.

	   In just three days, Surakarta was destroyed by fire. Starting as
a peaceful demonstration May 14 at Surakarta Muhammadiyah
University demanding reform, riots followed, with looting,
plundering and fires spreading throughout the town.
	   More than a month has passed since the rioting but the pain
remains and many traumatized victims, mostly Chinese-Indonesians,
have yet to resume their normal activities.
	   This tragedy is added to a long sequence of anti-Chinese riots
in a town well-known for its high culture. In fact, racial
disturbances in Surakarta, popularly known as Solo, have a long
history.
	   According to Javanese cultural observer Suryanto Sastroatmojo,
conflict with Chinese-Indonesians originated in the 18th century.
There was a rebellion against Keraton Kartosuro, supported by
Chinese merchants, which later caused the kingdom to move to nearby
Surakarta.
	   There were at least two other major racial conflicts in
Surakarta. In 1965, there were conflicts between Baperki (a
political party dominated by Chinese-Indonesians) and other
political factions. Another incident happened on Nov. 19, 1983,
when many buildings and vehicles belonging to ethnic Chinese were
damaged.
	   Cultural roots might be one of the reasons that makes people in
Surakarta easily provoked to start a riot against
Chinese-Indonesian, said M.T. Arifin, an employee of the Ministry
of Justice and also a cultural observer. Another thing is the
domination Chinese-Indonesians seem to have in the economic sector.
	   Some Chinese-Indonesians do work hard to develop their
businesses but there are others who enjoy government facilities,
growing big through collusions with officials.
	   The robust business activities of Chinese-Indonesians and the
discriminative attitude of the government bureaucracy in Surakarta
have created a tremendous gap between the indigenous Indonesians
and the Chinese-Indonesians, Arifin said. He added that under the
leadership of Major R. Hartomo (from 1985 to 1994), more problems
arose, such as land disputes, environmental contamination and the
monopoly of many strategic businesses by Chinese-Indonesians.
	   These facts are also acknowledged by H. Muh. Batmanto, 67, a
Chinese Moslem figure in Surakarta. He said some rich
Chinese-Indonesians tend to live exclusively, which made it
difficult for the indigenous people to accept them.
	   Not all Chinese-Indonesians are like that and not all indigenous
people have a dislike toward them. But Batmanto admitted that there
was suspicion between the two groups. ``Therefore, when a mass of
people started to form at the time the students rallied, an
anti-Chinese slogan ignited others to follow,'' said Batmanto, who
has lived in Surakarta since 1956.
	   ``The latest conflict is a mix of economical imbalance, an angry
mob, and an easily manipulated public utilized by factions who rode
over the wave of the student movement,'' added Arifin.
	   As a result, despite attempts by political parties and local
Moslem youth organizations and students, the riots could not be
halted. After restlessness gripped Jakarta following the shooting
of four Trisakti University students on May 12, thousands of
stickers and posters asserting ``Peaceful reform without violence''
were distributed throughout Surakarta. This campaign was done
together with flags at half mast and condolence statements
reflecting the solidarity over the death of reform heroes. But the
reality showed otherwise.
	   On May 14, thousands of people marched through the streets of
Surakarta, as well as Kartosuro. They looted shops and other
buildings, including banks and even houses, and damaged or burned
them down.
	   The riots, which lasted for three days, inflicted economic
losses amounting to trillions of rupiah. In Surakarta, at least 410
motorcycles, 124 cars, 25 department stores and 38 shopping centers
were set on fire. Twelve people were found dead in the Ratu Luwes
department store, which was also burned down.
	   It all started from the peaceful student demonstration at the
university, supported by the community. They were later lured from
the campus by groups who then lead the anarchy and destruction.
	   Incited by these groups, the rioters first set ablaze the Timor
car dealership in Kleco, then spread to shopping and entertainment
centers, including Benteng Plaza, Singosaren Plaza, Sami Luwes,
Ratu Luwes and Atrium 21 Cineplex at Solo Baru, where the house
belonging to House Speaker Harmoko is located. Harmoko's house was
burned down. A number of factories were also gutted by fires.
	   Batmanto and Arifin viewed the riots as incidents organized by
groups with vested interest. They were taking advantage and
manipulating the students' reform movement.
	   ``From the pattern of the rioting, I detected that organized
groups who received military-style training were behind the
riots,'' Batmanto said, while Arifin hinted that a certain youth
organization known to organize hoodlums may be involved.
	   Surakarta's military district commander Col. Inf. Sriyanto
admitted that, congruent with field data, the uprising in Surakarta
seems to have been guided and led by an organized group. After
inciting the public, these people moved to another location.
Surprisingly enough, even though done by a mass, the looting and
arson targets appeared to be selective. ``This only supports our
conclusion,'' he said.
	   What amazed many eyewitnesses was that the military forces
seemed indifferent when the orgy of plundering and arson occurred.
	   ``When one group tried to break into a shopping mall, the
military forces at the location seem to give them the chance. They
should have been the ones to stopped these people,'' said Muh.
Yusuf, an activist of Surakarta Muhammadiyah University who
witnessed the spreading conflagration in his hometown. According to
him, looters even carried gasoline containers and the necessary
equipment needed to set the buildings alight.
	   According to Arifin, to contain this ongoing problem, which may
even contribute to the disintegration of society, there is a
desperate need for a figure who has the cultural authority to act
as a bridge, to integrate assimilation. Unfortunately, even though
Surakarta has the Keraton Surakarta, the kingdom no longer has
cultural territories which may give the needed authority to the
king to be respected by his people -- like the Sultan of
Yogyakarta.
	   With this reality, the potential for racial uprising shall
become an important agenda in the unfinished reform movement. No
one wants this to happen again.

	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Fri. - The Waterworks Department will replace
most of the asbestos water supply pipelines in the State to reduce
leakages which have contributed to RM23 million in lost revenues
annually.
	   State Waterworks Department director Wan Ngah Wan Ali said about
60 per cent of the water supply pipelines in Terengganu used
asbestos pipes of various sizes and most of the pipelines were
about 15 years old.
	   Non-revenue water, which included leakages and pilferages
besides other factors, contributed a total of 24 per cent to lost
revenue.
	   Leakages alone accounted for 20 per cent, he said.
	   He was briefing Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad on
the department's water supply and management activities in the
State at the Kepong water treatment plant today.
	   Wan Ngah said the department would spend RM80 million to replace
220km of water pipelines during the Seventh Malaysia Plan.
	   Also present were Menteri Besar Tan Sri Wan Mokhtar Ahmad,
Deputy Agriculture Minister Datuk Dr Tengku Mahmud Mansor, Deputy
Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Idris Jusoh, State
Executive Councillors and State Secretary Datuk Baharuddin Ismail.
	   Wan Ngah said at the moment, about 86 per cent of the population
or about 787,000 people received piped water in their homes.
	   He said the main source of supply was from major rivers in the
respective districts and underground water.
	   ``The only area receiving underground water supply in Terengganu
is at Pulau Perhentian.
	   ``However, we have sufficient surface water from rivers in other
areas and the only problem faced by the Department in supplying
fresh water was during severe drought,'' he said.
	   He said during such periods, salt water would move further
upstream during high tide and this affected water quality.
	   ``Otherwise, Terengganu has no water supply problem.
	   ``In fact, our 17 water treatment plants have the capacity to
produce 330,000 cubic metres of water a day with a reserve of about
20 per cent.''
	   Wan Ngah also said water demand in Terengganu increased by about
10 per cent per year and the current capacity could meet demands
until the year 2000.
	   He said a new water treatment plant was being built near Tasik
Kenyir which would further increase the reserve capacity to meet
water demands up to the year 2010.

	   STATE Railway of Thailand Governor Saravuth Thammasiri Monday
failed to show up to sign an agreement to allow the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration to develop its golf course behind
Chatuchak Weekend Market into a public park.
	   Bangkok Governor Bhichit Rattakul and Transport and
Communication Minister Suthep Thauksuban, however, insisted that
although Saravuth did not endorse the contract, the agreement was
already effective. The BMA would be able to use the land after 30
days.
	   Under the plan, eight people involved were to sign the
agreement, including Transport and Communication Deputy Minister
Pradit Pataraprasith, the ministry's deputy permanent secretary
Prapol Samuttarapraput, Bhichit, and Deputy Bangkok City Clerk
Kriangsak Lohachala.
	   Only Saravuth failed to show up reportedly because his way was
blocked by protesting caddies who said they would be forced to take
up jobs with the BMA, where they would earn less than half their
present income.
	   Suthep said the ministry will allow the BMA to develop the
ministry's land in other areas such as at Makkasan, and Klong Toey.
	   Bhichit said that the BMA will employ caddies who work at the
SRT's golf course as temporary employees with a starting salary of
Bt4,100.
	   The BMA insists on using the land despite opposition from SRT
workers and caddies reasoning that the land was most suitable with
pools, big trees, and decorative plants ready and the city
administration will only need to construct the walking path.
	   The SRT workers have also opposed the move to allow the BMA to
pay only Bt555 million for the use of the 375 rai of land without a
time limit reasoning that the SRT had underpriced the land value
since the market assessment price of the land was worth more than
Bt20 billion.
	   The workers want the SRT to charge the BMA higher for the use of
the golf course since they said the agency, which was struggling to
survive due to accumulated losses, should seek more income by
raising fees or rents rather than increasing train fares because
that would adversely affect low-income earners.
	   Bhichit said the BMA will continue its effort to increase the
number of parks in Bangkok since the city has four times fewer
parks than the international standard.

Chief inspector: Iraq close to being free from U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more quotes, background. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations could soon lift
sanctions on Iraq if Baghdad fully cooperates with its arms
experts, the chief U.N. weapons inspector said Monday.
	   In another sign of flexibility, Richard Butler said his experts
_ who previously had insisted on conclusive evidence _ are willing
to acknowledge that it is impossible to verify every Iraqi claim
that it has met U.N. demands for the elimination of its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council will allow the lifting of the embargo
only after Butler's U.N. Special Commission certifies that Iraq has
no more illegal weapons. The sanctions were imposed following
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to the Gulf War.
	   ``The light at the end of the tunnel today is more visible than
anytime,'' Butler said at the end of his three-day talks with Iraqi
officials on disarming Iraq of its illegal weapons.
	   Butler announced Sunday that he had reached an agreement with
Baghdad on a two-month timetable to end U.N. disarmament activities
in Iraq. At the end of that period, he and Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz are expected to meet again to review the situation.
	   ``In my view if that work is done satisfactorily ... I believe
we should be in a position'' to prepare for lifting the sanctions,
Butler said at a news conference Monday before leaving for Kuwait
en route to Australia, where he will attend an arms control
meeting.
	   ``I am very positive about it. It is good news,'' Butler added.
	   He said he is optimistic because he felt Iraqi officials were
serious about implementing the deal that U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan signed with Iraq in February _ that granted weapons
inspectors free access to all sites in Iraq, including presidential
palaces.
	   ``The memorandum of understanding not only gave us access to
presidential sites, but actually involved a very serious promise of
full cooperation by Iraq with UNSCOM,'' Butler said.
	   Diplomats in Baghdad said privately that Butler and his
inspectors were under pressure from U.N. Security Council members
France and Russia to end the inspections as soon as possible.
	   They said the inspectors were finding it difficult to prolong
the inspections by insisting on proof of some minor details.
	   U.N. inspectors also rejected Iraqi arguments that it had
unilaterally destroyed _ without keeping any records _ many weapons
before the inspection process began.
	   ``It may be that we won't ever get 100 percent verification
where physical parts have been torn apart and dispersed,'' Butler
said.
	   He said searches for missile and chemical weapons are nearing
their end. Verification of Iraq's past germ warfare program is
cumbersome but the two sides have ``found a new way to deal with
it,'' Butler said without elaborating.
	   During his talks here, Butler presented Iraq with a list of
obligations, which he said Iraq must fulfill to back its claims
that it has dismantled all banned chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.

	   I was upset when I read a letter from Sumarsono Sastrowardoyo
(Your Letters, May 30, 1998). How could I help not feeling so, as
practically everybody knows that from the National Awakening period
up to the proclamation of independence, and from the time Indonesia
was led by Bung Karno up to the time when the country was under
Soeharto many (not all, of course) Indonesians of Chinese descent
fought shoulder to shoulder with indigenous Indonesians. Some
living witnesses to this are still alive.
	   I am said to be an Indonesian of Chinese origin because I am
yellow-skinned and slit-eyed, although my mother's grandmother was
a native Indonesian.
	   I am 25 years old. As soon as I completed university, I chose to
develop my parents' business. I refused job offers from national
and multinational companies. So to speak, I was entrusted to manage
a furniture company, at the time not doing well and with only one
employee. That was two years ago. Now the business has developed
well enough and has a staff of 14.
	   I always try to develop the thinking ability of all my employees
so that we are now a strong team. I always encourage them to
broaden their knowledge. Some of them are sent to an English
course, for which the shop pays. This year I plan to give
scholarships to two of my employees so that they can continue their
studies at university.
	   In addition, I have also given a sort of one-school-year
scholarship to a number of children from poor families.
	   Please, Mr Sumarsono, please note that all that have received my
aid are indigenous.
	   Let me tell you another thing, Mr Sumarsono. Some time ago I
planned to go abroad to obtain a master's degree. When my employees
got wind of it, many of them persuaded me not to leave them.
Likewise, many of my business colleagues, both indigenous
Indonesians and Indonesians of Chinese and Arabic descent, offered
to adopt me as their son.
	   Mr Sumarsono, I am one of the victims of the violent riots,
looting and arson on May 14. If I may be allowed to ask, this is my
question: What is my sin to this beloved nation? If ever I can meet
the rioters, the looters and the arsonists, I, to quote what Anton
Medan said in his recent article in Kompas, would like to put this
question to them: What have you done for this nation?
	   Now, please, Mr Sumarsono, allow me to respond to your
conclusion, which you say came from your wife, that many indigenous
Indonesians of Chinese descent have ugly mentality because they
keep passports which they may use at any time to leave behind this
beloved nation. First, to have passports so that they will come in
handy when needed is not the sole privilege of indigenous
Indonesians of Chinese origin. Second, their fear justifies them
making such preparation and plans, something which is very natural
and human.
	   Yes, please, Mr Sumarsono, imagine that your daughter is
brutally gang raped and your wife stripped naked in public -- these
were real cases in Jakarta and Surakarta. How will you feel, dear
Mr Sumarsono?
	   Please, please, Mr Sumarsono, please put everything in
proportion. Indeed, many Indonesians of Chinese descent have ugly
mentality. However, there are still many more who sincerely love
this nation with all their hearts.

	   CRUDE palm oil futures on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange
(KLCE) closed higher yesterday, lifted by the further weakness of
ringgit against the US dollar.
	   At the close, June gained RM22 to settle at RM2,390, July rose
RM23 to RM2,371, August added RM21 to RM2,346 and September gained
RM19 to RM2,329.
	   Turnover increased to 1,048 lots from 863 lots on Thursday and
open interest decreased to 6,428 contracts from 6,484 contracts.
	   JF Apex Futures Sdn Bhd said ringgit dropped to the 4.04 level
against the US dollar in the morning and that this prompted more
speculative buying in the futures market.

	   THAILAND reiterated Monday that the Thai-Cambodian border would
remain sealed to hamper the entry of the three Khmer Rouge leaders
reportedly hiding close to the border.
	   Foreign Ministry's spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said the Thai
government was still firm on its policy of not dealing with the
Khmer Rouge guerrillas and it would not allow any of the rebels
enter its territory.
	   The Thai government has ordered border forces to guard against
the entry of the three remaining Khmer Rouge leaders, Kobsak said.
	   ''Thai border offices have received the order to definitely not
allow any Khmer Rouge leader to cross into Thailand,'' he added.
	   The three leaders -- the one-legged military chief Ta Mok, who
is also known as ''The Butcher'', the senior ideolgue Nuon Chua and
the nominal political chief Khieu Samphan -- were reportedly hiding
in Cambodia's northern province of Preah Vihear, Kobsak quoted
Cambodian military reports as saying.
	   The spokesman was speaking after the Khmer Rouge movement, whose
rural troops were once powerful enought to occupy and then empty
the capital Phnom Penh, had suffered major blow when five of their
leaders defected to the Phnom Penh government over the weekend.
	   Thailand has long been criticised for supporting the guerrillas,
who once had a stronghold at Anlong Veng close to the border before
it was overrun by Cambodian government forces.
	   The guerrillas then suffered from a massive spate of defections
which started in August of last year..
	   Most of the guerrillas defected to the government after the
death of the Khmer Rouge's paramount chief Pol Pot in April this
year.
	   Their former stronghold of Pailin, where the gem industry was a
lucrative source of income to the group, has since turned into a
busy commercial town.

	   They may not have the mass appeal of news programs broadcast
during the recent turmoil, but television political talk shows have
apparently stolen many people's hearts.
	   The programs provide the audience with differing views on
interesting topics through lively and entertaining debates.
	   Guest speakers include experts and intellectuals not only from
the government's side but also critics, who clearly state their
arguments and objections.
	   They speak bluntly without any hesitation, revealing facts and
ideas.
	   And why not. There is strong demand for freedom of expression in
the spirit of reform and there is no fear of speaking out, as once
was the case.
	   Andreas Ambessa, head of Indosiar public relations, however,
hopes that the speakers will apply self-censorship.
	   ``We have a policy to give every guest the freedom to speak
their mind, although we hope that they don't attack government
institutions, groups or organizations, and avoid discussing SARA
(tribal affiliations, religion, race and societal groups),'' he
said.
	   Some television political talk shows were known for their
critical stance against the government long before the current era
of reform.
	   Host of SCTV's Dibalik Berita (Behind the News), Riza Primadi,
recalled that in January 1997, chief editor of Media Indonesia
daily Surya Paloh called on the people to directly express their
wish to oust former president Soeharto when he was a guest on the
show.
	   ``Why should people use such rhetoric. If they don't like Pak
Harto, why don't they just say so,'' Paloh said.
	   Riza went into hiding for two days after the program was aired.
``I was so scared at the time. It was the most frightening moment
of my life,'' Riza, a former BBC reporter, said.
	   Riza is a fast learner. He was summoned by police following an
earlier program which unveiled alleged dirty business in the police
force.
	   Dibalik Berita is not the station's first critical talk show. In
March 1994 it began to air Perspektif, a program which became both
popular and notorious for the down-to-earth criticism expressed in
dialog between the host Wimar Witoelar and his guests. The program
was taken of the air in June 1995 after the government put pressure
on the station.
	   The show now extends its charm to fans through Perspektif Live,
a version of the show held in hotels, shopping malls, cafes and
campuses. For followers in other parts of the country, the
separately organized Perspektif Baru can be heard on several
private radio stations. A text version also appears in at least
four newspapers and Perpektif On-line can be browsed through by
those with access to the Internet.
	   Wimar now hosts a similar but less serious program called
Selayang Pandang, where he meets his guests in the setting of a
cafe. However, fans of the presenter feel that the relaxed setting
has blunted the edge of Wimar's famously provocative questions
which often cornered his guests into giving controversial
off-the-cuff responses.
	   Finger-pointing, considered taboo in traditional Javanese
society, appears in many talk shows, including Aspirasi (TPI),
which came on the air in January 1997.
	   The live show features a host and various guests, mostly top
government officials such as governors, mayors and prominent public
figures including former ministers. The host invites viewers to
phone in and express their opinions about current issues. Callers
are allowed to condemn bad practice and voice complaints on a whole
range of formerly sensitive issues, including bad service from the
government.
	   The show is very daring because in Indonesia the government is
viewed as being the master to be served, not the public servant.
	   ``My show is very open and free. We have always discussed
everything live. We began having live discussions a long time
before pressure for freedom of speech began to mount, but I never
received calls from government officials,'' Haris Jauhari, who is
responsible for Aspirasi, said.
	   Televised political talk shows are now considered to be a
surefire and inexpensive way to uplift the image of a television
station and boost ratings.
	   Each station in the country, including state-run TVRI,
broadcasts at least one.
	   ``It's just a form of entertainment which allows people to
express their thoughts at the same time,'' Haris, a former Pikiran
Rakyat reporter, said.
	   Haris and Riza agree that talk shows are targeted at an educated
audience and do not cater to mass tastes. The programs, they say,
only help to widen the horizon of people who are already critical
of the status quo.
	   Guests aside, there has not been much change to the format and
content of talk shows since the government relaxed its stance on
the media.
	   Dibalik Berita, which insists on airing the show as it was
recorded or not at all, last year had to drop two programs in which
highly sensitive issues were discussed. One program discussed the
former Portuguese colony of East Timor and the second held a debate
on national succession in which a guest directly called on then
president Soeharto to step down.
	   ``Now we are free to invite critical voices such as Muchtar
Pakpahan, Sri Bintang Pamungkas and Megawati (Soekarnoputri),''
Riza said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The new classification of low-cost houses
into four categories will be a boon to local manufacturers of
building materials, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister
Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayob said today.
	   He said the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday had approved the
classification of low-cost houses into four categories from
RM25,000, RM30,000, RM35,000 and RM42,000 depending on location.
	   As low-cost houses used to be built at a cost of RM25,000 and
below, the move will provide wider choice for buyers and give more
room for mobilising the construction sector, Megat Junid said.
	   He was speaking at the launch of ``Buildmat Malaysia '98'' the
first exhibition to feature made-in-Malaysia building materials, to
be held at the Putra World Trade Centre from Nov 10 to 13.
	   Organised by the Building Materials Distributors Association of
Malaysia, the exhibition will be held in conjunction with the
``Visions Towns and Cities '98'' exhibition and conference.
	   Also present at the launch were Ministry secretary-general Datuk
Mohamad Noor Abdul Rahim, BMDAM president Ricky Lim and
representatives of participating companies.
	   Megat Junid also urged the private sector to emulate the
Government's policy of using local building materials in
construction.

	   My grandmother was an unwavering creature of habit. She ate a
spartan breakfast of strong, unsweetened tea with a splash of milk
every day, watched the evening news on the dot faithfully and voted
Tory throughout her life despite her working class background.
	   And, as we often found out to our cost, she had no time for
Asians.
	   I saw her erratically when I was a child, for my family lived in
South Africa and then the U.S. for most of those years. But in the
short window of time when we resided in England, all of us knew it
was prudent to give her a wide berth when it came to the touchy
subject of ``them''.
	   Venture into this territory where rationality feared to tread,
and the result was likely to be a rambling, emotional diatribe on
what ``they did to our boys in the war''.
	   She actually meant World War II and the Japanese but, at a loss
to tell them apart from the rest of their cousins on the continent,
she conveniently clumped all Asians as one.
	   It was easier to tar them all with the same brush of hatred and
ignorance than deal with having to put gradations on who did what
to whom.
	   Thankfully for her, Asians were few on the ground in small-town
Farnworth, Lancashire, in the 1970s. But the reaction was swift on
those rare occasions when she did come face-to-face with the
``yellow peril'' in restaurants or airport lounges. A raised
eyebrow, disapproving sneer and hurried gathering of belongings
meant it was time to move on. Quickly.
	   She could also spout off a veritable compendium on the traits of
our closest neighbors.
	   Ask her about the Dutch, and she would tell you it served them
right they ended up eating tulips in the war because they were too
cowardly to fight. The French? Arrogant, loathe to bathe and
consumers of funny foods.
	   The Germans? Another subject better left untouched, but she
would grant they had given the world sultry Marlene Dietrich who,
after all, famously gave Abominable Adolf the big brush off back in
the 1930s.
	   Her opinions on the rest of the denizens of Europe -- the
Scandinavians, Mediterraneans, the Balkan peoples -- was a blurred
gleaning of lore from snatches of conversations and BBC 2
documentaries.
	   She sounds like a hideous ogre, someone who would have been out
stumping for Pauline Hanson's campaign in another place or time.
	   But I can say truthfully that my grandmother, now long since
dead, was a kind, hardworking woman who simply knew no better.
	   She was a victim of circumstances, of the poverty which forced
her to work in the local mills from the age of 12, and of the
ignorance which kept her knowledge shuttered in the dark of
untruths about that which she did not know or understand.
	   Her daughter, my mother, engineered her own escape from this
darkness through education, even though some might consider
marrying a South African and living in his homeland were tantamount
to taking two steps backward in the area of respect for other
peoples.
	   But she discarded the nonchalant and insidious stereotypes we
foist on others -- thereby keeping them at a distance, objectifying
them and allowing us to commit unspeakable acts against them -- to
recognize the shared realities of who they, and we, are.
	   The truth of this has hit home to me with the recent reports on
the heinous rapes and sexual assaults of women during last month's
riots.
	   I know that my mother, reading the stories in her living room
thousands of miles away, will feel the same aching sense of disgust
that ties me in emotional knots. I know that she, too, will not
think of whether these women were Chinese-Indonesians, or of Malay
stock, or had blond hair and blue eyes like our family members.
	   She will also not draw distinctions between those people who
stood up to the mobs to step in, at great personal risk to
themselves, to save others in danger. It was, after all, the humane
thing to do.
	   And I know that she will see what happened as the human tragedy
it really is and which we all share, one which defies explanation,
rationalization or unctuous excuses.

trading due to slow demand from overseas. At the close, July
International RSS One rose one sen to 275.0 sen per kg while SMR 20
shed two sen to 258 sen per kg.
	   He said latex intake has just started and stocks are low while
demand for SMR grade is slow and customers (buyers), particularly
from overseas, are seen trying to push down the market.

	   From the cradle to the grave, once a person has been born there
is no way that he or she can avoid administrative procedures.
	   One must have a birth certificate and identity card, often a
driver's license is required and, of course, a death certificate
when this mortal coil has been left behind.
	   Obtaining any of these bureaucratic necessities involves costly
and confusing hassles, the source of enduring headaches.
	   To obtain an identity card in Jakarta one is only supposed to
require a copy of their family card, photos, a copy of the expired
card and a Rp 1,000 fee. The new ID card is issued the same day and
three blissful years pass until the process has to be repeated.
	   This, you may have gathered, is not how things always happen:
``I had to wait two weeks to get my new card,'' said Kristianto
(name changed), a private bank employee who attempted to renew his
identity card.
	   ``Why does it take so long just to renew my card? I can't keep
leaving the office to find out what is going on with it,'' said the
man who lives in Tebet, South Jakarta, and works on Jl. Jend.
Sudirman in Central Jakarta. He paid the statutory fee of Rp 1,000.
	   Kristianto thought by paying the legal amount he was acting as a
model citizen should.
	   But the simple truth is that those who follow statutory
procedures and are either too stupid or too naive to oil the wheels
of the bureaucracy have to be ready to be ignored.
	   Franz Magnis-Suseno, a professor of ethics at the Driyarkara
Institute of Philosophy in Central Jakarta, shares the view that
renewing an identity card or issuing a driver's licenses should be
simple tasks. However, public servants have abused their power and
turned these jobs into lucrative moneyspinning occupations, he
added.
	   ``... they've changed their role from public servants to public
kings that asked to be served. They only serve you if they are
paid,'' he said.
	   This must be stopped, he said, because it completely violated
the spirit of reform.
	   Sociologist Sardjono Jatiman agreed the public was sick of the
government's attitude to public services and questioned the
necessity of some of the bureaucratic procedures.
	   He said that many of the procedures were there simply to give
those who issue the cards more opportunities to profit. Public
servants, he added, had a basic attitude that ``if the process
could be made more complicated then why make it easier?''
	   Assimilating documents and data required by the authorities are
just a small part of the time consuming process which urbanites say
they have no time for.
	   Officials say they are not oblivious to such complaints. Abdul
Kahfi, Jakarta deputy governor for administrative affairs, said the
administration planned to simplify public services ``in line with
the spirit of reform.''
	   Processing identity cards just once in a lifetime would be
ideal, but Kahfi said that it would then be hard to then keep track
of people's movements in a highly mobile society.
	   Jakarta Police spokesman Lt. Col. E. Aritonang said police had
pledged to improve services and kick out driving license touts a
long time ago.
	   A computerized system was introduced but the touts remained.
	   A further complication in the process of issuing licenses exists
in the form of PT Citra Permata Persada, a company owned by former
president Soeharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, which
has a contract with the police to process all driving license
applications.
	   According to a reliable police source, the company claims a
staggering Rp 48,000 of the Rp 52,500 fee charged to issue or renew
every single driver's license.
	   Chief of the National Police Gen. Dibyo Widodo said the contract
would shortly be reviewed.
	   Despite many shortcomings, Ryaas Rasyid, rector of the State
Institute of Public Administration, said bureaucracy was needed to
maintain order. He believed the arrogant attitude of many state
employees could be traced back to the feudalistic culture of bygone
eras.
	   During the period of Dutch colonial rule, officials considered
themselves to be of a higher status than other members of society.
	   But this, along with the argument that bribes were acceptable
because of low civil service pay, was no excuse, Ryaas said.
	   ``They are paid less because there are too many of them there
...'' Ryaas said. He blamed incorrect economic policy which favored
a select group of tycoons and had failed to create enough private
sector jobs. The government then had no choice but to absorb many
of the less qualified and talented people who had been rejected by
the private sector, Ryaas argued, adding that half the present
number of civil service staff would be enough to fulfill the
administrative needs of the country.
	   A 1995 report by the National Board of Statistics revealed that
there are 3,965,778 civil servants in the country.
	   The lowest ranking civil servant earns Rp 80,000 a month, well
below the Rp 172,500 monthly minimum wage for Greater Jakarta.
	   Ryaas and other observers say that reforming the civil service
will take a long time and staff cuts will have to wait until the
economy improves.
	   However, Ryaas said the bureaucracy did not really want to
change the system and would continue to attempt to profit from the
obstacles which they themselves had created.
	   ``Many officials enjoy the status quo and they are not
adequately pressured by the public to change.''
	   Former state minister of administrative reforms Sarwono
Kusumaatmadja said that improving and streamlining the bureaucracy
was not only the government's responsibility, adding that the
public too had a role to play.
	   The lack of support given to government efforts to improve
services has undermined their efficacy, Sarwono said. He referred
to the national drive to improve services under former state
minister of administrative reforms T.B. Silalahi, who replaced him.
	   Sarwono introduced the popular acronym waskat (pengawasan
melekat), which calls for the internal supervision of government
agencies in the absence of public control.
	   Sarwono said change could only happen under a more democratic
political system which gave the public control over the government.
	   ``At present, public control of the government is very weak
because they have no means through which to voice their political
will,'' Sarwono said.
	   The condition would only worsen if nothing was done to encourage
public support for reform of the bureaucracy, he added. People were
generally apathetic and encouraging support was made even harder by
the ``one way communication,'' from the government to the people,
Sarwono said.
	   He said this practice was all pervading and added that, for
example, the Indonesian Consumers Foundation often complained that
government regulations were issued without any public consultation.
	   ``We will need at least 15 years to introduce a democratic
political system,'' Sarwono said, ``Don't expect to the whole
political system to change overnight.''

	   AT the recent Nation Roundtable on ways to prepare the Thai
workforce to meet the needs of the private sector, the participants
identified a number of anomalies that make it difficult to raise
standards and keep industry abreast in a globalised market.
	   Held at the Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit Hotel, the roundtable was
attended by academics as well as top executives in the private
sector, most of whom, to varying degrees, deal with government
agencies or collaborate with them in carrying out the functions of
their businesses or public/private projects aimed at streamlining
cooperation and development.
	   One problem raised at the round table was the lack of data
available on unemployment. Figures issued by government agencies
contradict each other or do not correlate with knowledge of the
work force.
	   Out of half the Thai labour force of 32 million, 16 million are
in agriculture-related fields, but as Chainarong Indharameesup,
chairman of CSN Associates, pointed out: ''That is nonsense. Nobody
knows who is out of work or not. Farming is seasonal, side-line,
not full-time.'' The private sector itself may not understand what
it needs in terms of its own development. A survey on executives
and education needs conducted by Kenan Institute Asia indicated,
according to its executive director Paul Wedel, that executives in
top management did not believe they needed any additional training
but that lower levels did.
	   ''We asked, 'What are your weaknesses? What does your next level
of management need?' Invariably, this came back: 'We don't need
anything. We're great already, but our next level is just terrible.
They need a lot of help.' Somehow I wonder if that's the case,''
Wedel said.
	   Another survey conducted by the Sasin Graduate Institute of
Business Administration of Chulalongkorn University indicated an
extreme weakness in top management, according to Dr Siriyupa
Roongrerngsuke.
	   ''Out of the 6,000 employees I surveyed,'' she said, ''nearly 80
per cent complained that their top management never listened to
them, just issued orders. When the employees realised this, they
developed a defeatist attitude.'' As a criticism of the private
sector, Chainarong pointed out that even though the new generation
is more willing and more qualified than previously to take on
responsibility, top management is unwilling to empower them. ''The
new generation has to start from the bottom, rising through so many
rules, layers, regulations or whatever, even though they know
everything from the computer. Experience doesn't count at all,'' he
said.
	   In modern industry, Wedel observed, most information is in the
hands of the middle and lower levels. ''It's the people upstairs
that don't know, unless they build an organisation that will move
information up,'' he said.
	   Wedel added a comment that another top executive had made to him
recently: ''We're always talking about improving middle management.
Well, middle management didn't cause all the crises. It was the top
management that over-borrowed, so where's the problem?'' At the
same time, however, some participants believed that middle
management was still weak. While Thailand lacks managers with the
capability to make decisions, most people seem to aim for
managerial status.
	   ''Leadership at manager level is very bad,'' said Suchart
Chantranakaraj, managing director of Gold Mine Garment Co Ltd.
	   Yet more managers are needed in the Thai work force. For
Chainarong, the increase in numbers of managers is a matter of
efficiency. With 30 per cent of the work force in management
positions, Singapore has higher productivity than does Thailand
with only around 15 per cent of the work force in management.
	   ''This means we have a lot of unqualified people in our
organisations. That's why our productivity is lower. Only 15 per
cent manage 85 per cent.'' In the drive for a quality work force,
companies will no longer be able to hire by automatically looking
at a person's educational qualifications.
	   ''It is easy to hire a person based on a diploma instead of
experience,'' Chainarong said, ''but if you want to get good
employees, you will have to go for more. Look at our society. We
still have and want formal titles. This will have to change. It's
become nonsense now.'' These changes are being propelled now by
Thailand's present economic crisis. Companies in Thailand,
downsizing personnel to reduce expenses, expect the remaining
employees to cope with additional responsibility as quickly as
possible.
	   Family-owned businesses are disappearing in the pursuit of
foreign investment, and the family-controlled, pyramid structure of
management may also gradually depart. As these families managing
the business continue to send their children abroad for a business
education, they will continue to return with different ideas, ''and
I think the crisis is going to accelerate that'', Wedel said.
	   At the same time, the accelerated needs of industry in a
globalised economy will continue to fuel changes. ''What you learn
in college is going to be out of date by the time you're in your
30s,'' Wedel said. ''Companies will eventually emphasise the need
to re-learn things continually. They won't care what you did in
college.''

	   MOST affluent students nowadays tend to be more laidback than
those of their parents' generation. There is a lack of passion for
the pursuit of knowledge per se. Instead, a growing apathy about
life in general and a certain listlessness seems to insidiously
pervade their world. It is indeed cause for concern. I shall
attempt to unearth some possible reasons for such a dismal scenario
purely from my own observations.
	   The growing affluence of our Malaysian society is like a
double-edged sword. Parents can provide well for their children. It
is common to see students driving to classes in their own cars
which are by no means the beat-up variety Some of these kids would
not be seen dead in an old junk like mine! Another phenomenon is
the emergence of the ``Walkman'' generation. It seems as if without
some background music or ``noise'' (to my untrained ears), these
students cannot function.
	   If anyone were to make an intelligent guess, the type of music
that seems to dominate the souls of these youngsters are of the
alternative/heavy metal or generally frenetic variety. Maybe the
high energy level of the music is able to make inroads into their
souls, minds and spirits. Whatever it is, the effect is quite
disturbing. Since such types of music have such a mass appeal among
the younger generation, we cannot underestimate their influence on
today's youth.
	   It is not uncommon for some students to listen to their Walkmans
while waiting for their next class to commence.
	   To me, the Walkman is a sign of their boredom and possibly their
need to fill the void that is in their spirit. It is also a symbol
of the X generation's need to be entertained. When one is engaged
in serious listening, it is a sign of not wanting to be
interrupted. It is as if one is shutting out the immediate world.
	   Another sign of growing affluence in students is the presence of
mobile handphones among them.
	   One thing's for sure, it has become a status symbol among
students.
	   After all, it beats having to wait in line for the use of the
public phone especially when some inconsiderate user might hog the
line, oblivious to the growing queue.
	   In any case, patience seems to be a forgotten virtue in this day
and age when speed is worshipped and (hey, presto!) we get a lot of
what we want at the press of a button. Waiting, it seems, is hard
work and too much for some of our affluent kids.
	   Another malady that seems to afflict some of our affluent
students is that of taking things easy due to a general lack of
real motivation to excel and a tendency to take things for granted.
	   There is a general disregard for scholarship and as long as they
can get by to the next stage with minimum effort, they wouldn't
fret too much even if their results bear the stamp of mediocrity.
Perhaps, the general lackadaisical attitude could be attributed to
being on the receiving end of their families' newly-acquired
material prosperity. Thus, they are reaping what they did not sow,
i.e. the rewards of their parents' labour.
	   Parents who are rich should be prudent and differentiate between
their children's needs and wants. Succumbing to their every demand
can only perpetuate a `give me' mentality among their children
instead of a `giving' one. Perhaps, if this indulgent trend is not
checked, parents may be perceived as their children's Santa Claus,
always available to bail them out of any and every financial
situation.
	   Students need to be taught how to be accountable for their
money. A student told me that he spent at least RM200 monthly on
magazines, tapes and CDs and he didn't think it was a waste of
money.
	   It will not hurt if students are taught to keep to a certain
budget and send an SOS to their parents only when absolutely
necessary.
	   Perhaps then they will learn to respect their parents' hard work
and carry on their parents' tradition of honest hard work. This is
to ensure the inherited prosperity of the young does not end in
their generation due to high or careless living.

	   Our bureaucracy is such a mess. It's like a huge ship with many
complex systems and networks which is about to sink during a cruise
to an obscure destination.
	   Many parts of the bodywork have been rusted by overwhelming
personal and clique interests. Meanwhile, its battalions of civil
servant sailors cannot stop it from sinking because they simply do
not have the expertise of operating the ship.
	   But just as with any human invention, the rotting bureaucracy
can be repaired. It might take a very long time but at least it is
not unachievable.
	   At the green IIP campus in South Jakarta recently, rising
political observer and rector of the State Institute for Public
Administration (IIP), Ryaas Rasyid, shared with The Jakarta Post
his views on the current state of the bureaucracy, the quality of
public services and possible solutions.
	   Question: Why do you think we need a bureaucracy?
	   Ryaas: First of all, bureaucracy in a political context is the
instrument which only actuates the political policy. It lies in a
unique position because it belongs to both the government and the
people, so it is expected to stay neutral, not become a stooge for
a certain economic or political power.
	   As the executor of the political policy, it must be very
professional. It must have the excellent capability to comprehend
how to specify the policy and actuate it for the benefit of the
public.
	   In this case, the bureaucracy is not in a position to make
policies, it provides services with fairness and executes the
policy indiscriminately.
	   Q: Is that the concept to describe the function of government
officials?
	   R: Yes. That's the guidelines. The public service, empowerment
and development functions are attached to them.
	   Q: Is that the ideal model of bureaucracy?
	   R: Yes.
	   Q: But why do we need the bureaucracy, regulations or officials?
	   R: Because without them you can't uphold order. A regulations is
made. Who would execute it? Who would control the way it is
performed? Who would administer the policy? That needs bureaucracy.
	   Who would handle, for example, the collection of taxes? Should
the police handle all that by themselves? Taxes collected from the
public need to be administered, an activity which could only be
handled by professional bureaucrats.
	   Q: But do the bureaucracy and officials exist for the benefit of
the people or rather for the state?
	   R: For the benefit of the people, of course.
	   Q: Could you distinguish between the benefit of bureaucracy for
the people and for the state?
	   R: In the context of governance, the state and the people are
actually united because the first emerged as a response to the
people's demand. The state can't claim its own existence, which is
distinct to the people's need.
	   So if the bureaucracy serves the state, it means that it also
serves the people.
	   Q: Some people still believe that the bureaucracy exists and
serves more for the benefit of the state and the government...
	   R: That's a debaucher (committed by the bureaucracy) toward the
true meaning of bureaucracy itself. It is a fact that our
bureaucracy is savored more in serving itself than the people.
	   It pleases itself by organizing ceremonies, constructing grand
office buildings and luxury official residences, and getting itself
elegant official cars as well.
	   This defies the public service philosophy.
	   That's why I've always criticized the construction of luxury
offices. I'm against all that because it does not represent the
bureaucracy's function as a public servant but demonstrates the
arrogance and eeriness of power.
	   Q: If we look deeper into the situation, what is the real shape
of our bureaucracy and public services today?
	   R: First, they are dreadfully inefficient. Second, they are not
professional. And third, they just don't have adequate commitment
to serve.
	   But that's not really their fault. They are all legacies from
the Dutch colonial rule, from the feudalistic culture. The status
of the bureaucracy and officials has long been considered as higher
than the class of the common people. That's a perverse perception.
In the context of modern bureaucracy, they are simply public
servants.
	   The bureaucracy itself did not really want to restore the mess
because they like it that way. There is a tendency that many
officials prefer to enjoy the status quo. On the other hand, so
far, there is no adequate pressure from the people (against the
malfeasance) due to a lack of education.
	   Q: The inefficiency within the officialdom, how bad is it
really?
	   R: Oh, that's very easy to see. There is plenty of inefficiency.
Like the shape of Habibie's cabinet of 36 ministers, that's too
much. Had he really responded to the spirit of reformation, the
number of ministers should have been cut down. Even in the Soeharto
era it was too large but now, he (Habibie) enlarged the number
instead. And you still want to talk about efficiency. That will
only make you pay more.
	   Q: So, an institution's level of efficiency can be assessed not
only from its real output but also from its size.
	   R: Right. From the size of its personnel.
	   Q: Is that the problem which impedes our government officials?
	   R: Oh certainly. It has an oversize personnel. Look at those
stacks of people (officials) who have no activities.
	   Q: If you feel that it is too large, then how many do we really
need?
	   R: Maybe half of the current number will do. But then a risk
which has to be taken if we are to repair the bureaucracy will not
be only the reduction of personnel.
	   Intensive training would be needed to make sure that the one
official who now handles five jobs, will be able to handle 10 in
his new capacity.
	   An obstacle which is attached to this ``overpopulation'' problem
is the imbalance in the distribution of personnel within the
regional administrations.
	   Another significant sign of the bureaucracy's inefficiency is
its employees' lack of professionalism.
	   Q: How can the bureaucracy stop its unprofessional personnel?
Does it have something to do with its recruiting process?
	   R: Well, they are connected to each other. There is no solid
system today which puts professionalism as the foundation for
recruitment. That has resulted in amburadul (messy) recruiting
which absorbs unprofessional people who carry out their jobs
unprofessionally, the next thing we get is an unprofessional
system.
	   The Jakarta administration's current yearly recruitment is very
bad. What kind of professionalism can you expect from that kind of
recruiting system?
	   Q: You are suggesting the administration cuts its personnel by
half. How do you think that will be feasible, especially during
this time of crisis?
	   R: Reducing personnel can start with the reassessment of all
officials. They must be retested. Those who cannot fulfill the new
requirements must be given the best compensation before they are
dismissed. It would be better for the bureaucracy to spend a large
amount on compensation money at one time rather than pay for many
inefficient officials forever.
	   It could be done much easier and better when the economic
condition has been restored, so that there will be plenty of work
opportunities in the private sectors to accommodate the dismissed
officials.
	   People now tend to think that it is the government's sole
responsibility to provide jobs. That's a result of an incorrect
economic strategy performed by the government. Privileges were
given to a few conglomerates who focused more on the accumulation
of capital rather than opening more job opportunities. As a
consequence, the government has no choice but to absorb incapable
people who were rejected by the private sector.
	   Q: Some officials claimed that it was low wages which made them
less enthusiastic in doing their jobs...
	   R: That's no excuse. They are paid less because there are too
many of them.
	   I agree, though, that the best governance could be achieved only
if we recruit the best people and pay them the best salary.
	   Our system now is rotten. If the system was good then the people
who get in there would be forced to follow the good system to be
the best personnel.
	   Q: Speaking of the spirit of reform, how can we reform the
bureaucracy. Is it possible? How long would it take?
	   R: It is possible. It will need quite a long time because at the
moment, it is connected to the economic condition. I think the big
plan now is to revamp the economic sector first.
	   After the economic crisis is settled we can select the
employees. Those who fail the reassessment must leave. Those who
stay will follow a new system and procedures, including the system
of promotion.
	   The apparatus' mentality must also be repaired. We have to make
a code of ethics for government officials and a code of ethics for
governance. The people must know what they are so that they can
help control any possible malpractice.
	   At this time, there's no explicit code of ethics to relate to,
for example, a promotion which is given through collusion or
bribery.
	   Our bureaucracy lacks so many things.
	   How long would it take to correct the process? I don't know.
	   Q: Which obstacle must be fixed first?
	   R: The recruiting system. Then the bribery and corruption
cultures. It will take time to eradicate them because the people's
mentality has been damaged for decades. It can't be done within one
or two years.
	   It needs a good mentality. Superiors should be good role models.
I don't think there is any serious effort from the bureaucracy's
executives to fix the problems. It's just lip service because many
of them are taking advantage of this messy condition.
	   The biggest obstacle in reforming the bureaucracy is that our
system is not solid. No ethics. Officials are hardly being taught
about their real functions and how to function.
	   The bureaucracy's structures are too long, they must be cut.
Someday the government administration office should be set at the
district level only. Many officials at lower levels have corrupted
their authority for their own profits.
	   Q: Do you have any words for the Jakarta administration?
	   R: The administration must launch major restructuring.
	   It must be given more autonomy to make the necessary systems and
procedures to suit its condition.
	   Its biggest problem is that it has never really cared to serve
the public. As a government, it should never expect to gain profit
from the services it gives the public. A government is meant to
lose in some sectors, such as transportation, clean water supply,
electricity and so on.

	   DR Supachai Panitchpakdi, Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda and Abhisit
Vejjajiva clashed openly but intellectually at Monday's meeting of
the Council of Economic Ministers over which policy measures were
appropriate to tackle the worst economic recession Thailand has
ever experienced.
	   In a debate that lasted about 30 minutes, Tarrin, the finance
minister, sought to defend the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s
medicines and the high interest rate policy needed to stabilise the
baht, while Supachai, the deputy prime minister and commerce
minister, and Abhisit, the PM's Office minister, teamed up to urge
Tarrin to explore the possibility of salvaging the economic sector
by a liquidity injection, lower interest rates and a weaker baht.
	   In the absence of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who was away at
Lopburi, Supachai chaired the weekly Council of Economic Ministers
meeting and set forth an important agenda over how liquidity should
be improved to boost exports. According to Cabinet sources,
Supachai reflected the academics' concern that the government had
pursued the right path in tackling the economic woes in accordance
with the rescue package prescribed by the IMFund.
	   But Supachai quickly added that the government should also look
more carefully into how liquidity, the interest-rate policy and the
exchange-rate policy should be adjusted to jump-start exports. He
said that the baht should stand at 46 to the US dollar to help the
export sector.
	   Cabinet sources said Tarrin had interrupted immediately to
express his disagreement, arguing that a weak baht might help
exporters but would seriously affect importers. ''If the exchange
rate is to further weaken, how can we be sure that exports will
really pick up? For the factors that are affecting exports are
multi-dimensional, such as the falling purchasing power of this
region.'' Tarrin said.
	   Tarrin has been steadfastly holding to the conservative line and
the IMF's basic prescriptions of restoring the plummeting Thai
currency by keeping interest rates high, containing inflation and
undertaking drastic reforms of the economy while awaiting a return
of confidence and private capital inflows.
	   He said: ''If we depreciate the baht below the Indonesian
rupiah, Indonesia won't be able to buy our goods more than before,
because it won't have the purchasing power. We have been pursuing
the right path and should not let ourselves be distracted. We have
to remain confident and stable.'' According to the Cabinet sources,
Abhisit went against the finance minister by arguing that from his
conversations with academics and businessmen he had gained the
impression that the high-interest-rate policy and export
sluggishness were standing in the way of reviving the Thai economy.
	   ''We should try to discuss this critical issue more openly in
order to come up with a practical solution. A proposal for a weaker
baht is debatable, but we might not be able to pinpoint exactly the
appropriate level,'' Abhisit said.
	   Tarrin also said that the liquidity crunch too could be
attributed to the failure of government agencies to honour their
payments to private contractors doing business with them. ''Several
contractors are going bankrupt because of lack of cash flow since
government agencies have been slow to pay them their money,'' he
said.
	   In the debate over liquidity only Tarrin, Supachai and Abhisit
voiced their opinions. When it appeared that Tarrin would not
compromise on his high-interest-rate policy to defend the baht and
the debate might drag on further without any conclusion, Supachai
brought it to an end by using his power as acting chairman to order
the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand to study the
academics' proposal that the monetary base be expanded, coupled
with liquidity improvements in order to boost exports and revive
the sagging economy.
	   Supachai said the Council of Economic Ministers would review
this issue again over the next two weeks once the study was
completed.
	   But several economists said the IMF prescription for Thailand,
the perfect student, might be wrong because it under-estimated the
crisis of the region and that the high-interest-rate policy was
killing the real sector because private capital might not return to
the region in time to save Thailand from a severe credit crunch.
	   Earlier Tim Condon, regional economist at Morgan Stanley, said
the IMF's programmes to stabilise the regional currencies had
crushed business activity and created deflationary conditions. He
said the crisis-hit economies needed lower real interest rates but
the lack of a framework for monetary policy meant there was no
credible way to reduce nominal interest rates without causing sharp
exchange-rate falls. He also said higher inflation -- not
hyperinflation -- might not be bad for regional economies hoping to
ride out the credit crunch.
	   After the Council of Economic Ministers meeting, most of the
Democrat ministers went upstairs in Government House to lunch.
Supachai and Tarrin went up together wearing broad smiles. After
lunch Savit Bhothivihok, the PM's Office minister, was asked what
the deputy prime minister, the commerce minister and the finance
minister had had for lunch that had kept the smiles in place.
''Yellow noodles were served,'' he said, ''but some stuck to dry
kao lao.''

	   For those who have tired of seeing Leonardo DiCaprio's face
plastered on posters, T-shirts and other Titanic accessories, there
might be a natural inclination to avoid seeing the new film in
which he stars, The Man in the Iron Mask.
	   It is, perhaps, not surprising that the caliber of his
performance in the film does not match up to the size of his fame.
Unfortunately, his double performance as both the cruel King Louis
XIV and Louis' twin brother (the man in the iron mask) doesn't
persuade, not to mention impress, even when not weighed against his
fame. Luckily, the film doesn't consist solely of DiCaprio and the
powerful supporting roles are enough to almost let us ignore his
shortcomings.
	   The plot unfolds in the court of a ruthless young Louis XIV who
squanders money on wars even as Parisians starve in the streets. We
witness various token acts of despotic tyranny before the story
begins to move in a decisive direction. The lecherous king is
struck by the beauty of Christine (Judith Godreche), but she has
already pledged her heart to Raoul (Peter Sarsgaard). Raoul is
shortly thereafter sent off to war by the king, where he is killed.
	   The death infuriates Raoul's father, Athos (John Malkovich), who
plans to avenge his death with the help of two friends, Aramis
(Jeremy Irons) and Porthos (Gerard Depardieu), by switching the
real king with his identical twin who suffers locked away in an
iron mask.
	   Along with the old friends who once served as the original three
Musketeers, they rejoin forces to implement their plan. Standing in
their way, however, is d'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), the fourth
Musketeer, who maintains his oath of loyalty to the king.
	   Byrne gives by far the most fascinating and multidimensional
performance in the film, as we watch him attempt to reconcile his
disparate loyalties to his king, life-long friends and sense of
principles.
	   In scenes where the camera moves between Byrne and DiCaprio, one
almost experiences vertigo, so great is the difference in the range
of their performances. The true strength of the film lies in the
interaction between d'Artagnan and the former musketeers. It is
through the conflict presented in these characters that the deeper
currents of honor, nobility and love flow.
	   Written and directed by Richard Wallace (known for screenplay
work in Braveheart), the directorial work does a nice job of
keeping the viewer's attention throughout the film. The dialog
gives the actors enough material to work, with the exception of a
few clunkers that even Byrne couldn't rescue.
	   In an intimate scene with the queen (Anne Parillaud), he says,
``I know that to love you is treason against France, but to not
love you is treason against my heart.''
	   Almost all of the dialog when coming from DiCaprio's mouth,
unfortunately, sounds flat and unconvincing. The undiluted twang of
his American accent also throws the audience directly out of 17th
century France and into the 1990s America. In fact, most of his
character development comes not through his two-dimensional
performance, but from the screenplay itself.
	   The film offers swashbuckling adventure, trials of honor, and
moments of humor through Depardieu's lustful Porthos. For the
diehard Leonardo fan, the film has enough to offer and this time
you have a choice of a dark Leonardo or a sensitive Leonardo. There
should be enough to keep one and all -- not to mention all and one
-- interested, if not overly impressed.

	   IN trying to solve the unemployment problem, the government is
wrong to under-emphasise social impact and set a lower budget for
manufacturing than for agriculture, an Industry Ministry official
said.
	   ''Solving problems in the manufacturing sector will eventually
help solve social problems. If the government emphasises tackling
the social impact issues and letting the manufacturing industry
stay weak, social problems will follow,'' deputy director-general
of the Industrial Promotion Department Damri Sukhotanand said.
	   A budget of only Bt1 billion has been set for solving the
unemployment problem in the manufacturing sector, where 500,000
workers are expected to be laid off. The government estimates that
more than two million will be left unemployed by the end of this
year.
	   Another factor which may contribute to the government's failure
to solve the problem is the lack of coordination among government
and other agencies, Damri said.
	   The project on manufacturing employment, spearheaded by the
Industry Ministry, is one of the seven main plans that the Labour
and Social Welfare Ministry has made to minimise unemployment.
	   Damri said the project would focus on the survival of
manufacturers, who the ministry hoped would help retain 70 per cent
of the 500,000 workers expected to be laid off. The remaining 30
per cent would he helped through a new job-creation plan.
	   The survival plan would focus on strengthening small and
medium-sized operators, which represent 96 per cent of all
industrialists. To help relieve liquidity problems, the Cabinet has
recently agreed to increase the Small Industrial Finance Corp's
capital to Bt5 billion by next year from Bt750 million and
restructure the organisation.
	   Independent agencies, including the Thailand Productivity
Centre, Thai-German Institute and industry institutes for certain
industries like sugar and sugar cane, automobiles, electronics,
food and textiles would play a role in upgrading the skill of
workers.
	   A training fund will be started next year to help finance
training programmes in factories, but its budget is small, at only
Bt100 million, said Damri.
	   The Board of Investment will take a leading role in creating new
jobs through its promotion of foreign investment. The Industry
Ministry will also be helped by a number of projects like rural job
creation and subcontracting programmes.

	   The young man's name is Comsack. A young poet with an exploding
nature, a little bit eccentric perhaps. On one hand he feels
awkward in the midst of middle class society, on the other hand he
is unemployed yet loves to dine in expensive restaurants.
	   The young woman is Comsack's lover. A very talented illustrator
with an established career. But she has been suffering for a long
time.
	   The two of them meet in Keep the Aspidistra Flying directed by
Robert Bierman. With the old London town as the setting, their love
affair seems awkward, funny yet touching. ``You are a poet, a free
man,'' sighs Comsack's lover.
	   Keep the Aspidistra Flying is one of seven films to be screened
at The British Film Festival, held to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of The British Council in Indonesia.
	   The event will take place at H. Usmar Ismail Film Center on Jl.
HR Rasuna Said, South Jakarta, June 19 to June 26.
	   In addition to feature movies there will be some animated movies
screened.
	   Tickets may be obtained free of charge from the British Council
or at the screening location, according to Gill Westway, The
British Council's English Language and Arts manager.
	   Movies to be shown are mostly contemporary and some, similar to
the story of the eccentric poet previously mentioned, carry the
traditional color of English comedy. Fever Pitch directed by Nick
Horby for example, is a story of an English teacher who is too busy
with himself. He falls in love with a fellow teacher. Their love
affair successfully intertwines with the success of Arsenal soccer
team throughout the competition season.
	   A different touch of comedy appears in The Englishman Who Went
Up a Hill and Come Down a Mountain. The entire population of a
small village near the only mountain on the boarder of Wales has a
peculiar but understandable desire. The mountain they are supposed
to be proud of can not be incorporated into the map, due to a lack
of being 15 feet from the height regulation. Working side by side,
they are determined to place their mountain on the map.
	   Hamlet is the obsession of actor/director Kenneth Branagh, the
filmmaker. Branagh directed the most famous of Shakespeare's dramas
in the four-hour film. He plays Hamlet, while Kate Winslet is
Ophelia.
	   Regardless of its devotion to the script, Hamlet may have a
chance to enter the commercial market. This is very important since
the revival of the British movie industry carries a heavy
predicament from within.
	   The revival of British movies is marked by the increasing
quantity of films and the escalating number of good quality movies
produced. In 1995 for example, 73 titles were produced. In the
following year, production jumped to 121 titles, the highest record
in the past 40 years. Last year, about 80 titles were produced.
	   Recent films worth mentioning are The Crying Game, Four Weddings
and a Funeral, Welcome to Sarajevo, Evita, In Love and War, and The
English Patient. There is a need to realizethat this revival is
also assisted by offshore funding, such as with The English Patient
which was funded by the American producer.
	   However, funding for films is not the real problem, as the
British government donates millions of pound sterling which comes
from the national lottery program. The real problem is the
regulation on British national films' circulation and distribution.
	   Similar to the movie industry in Indonesia, the distribution of
movies in England is regulated through a small yet powerful cartel
which maintains a close relationship withHollywood movie studios.
	   As a result, low to medium budget movies have to compete with
independent American films in second-run cinemas. According to the
yearly International Film Guide, 50 percent of new films never have
the chance to appear on the big screen, but go straight to
television or videotape.
	   The rest have to patiently wait, maybe for months before they
have a chance at the big screen. Without exception is Secret and
Lies which will also be screened in this movie festival.
	   Secret and Lies is a black comedy about humanities. It begins
with Hurtense, a young optometrist of African descent who is
looking for her biological mother, Cynthia. It turns out that
Cynthia is a white female and the presence of her abandoned child
creates a big commotion within Cynthia's family.
	   The most moving scene is Hurtense's meeting with Cynthia in a
restaurant. The static camera uninterruptedly recorded their eight
minutes of touching conversation.
	   Actress Brend Blethyn impressively brings Cynthia's character to
life. Cynthia appears to have a lively humor and can sometimes be
vulgar, but never turns caricatural. Mike Leigh's direction keeps
this 140-minute film from become monotonous dialog.
	   Secret and Lies was inaugurated as the best British film and won
an award at Cannes Film Festival in 1997. At the end, watching
Secret and Lies makes a person feel as though they have just
swallowed bitter, though healing, medicine.
	   The writer is a cinematologist and lecturer at the School of
Films and Television, Jakarta Arts Institute.

	   The Thai Farmers Research Centre summarises opposing and
supporting factors on the devaluation of the Chinese yuan in the
first of a two-part series.
	   Another tide of severe turmoil is taking place in the currency
markets amid a worry that ''a second round of hell'' is shaping up,
the research unit of the Thai Farmers Bank said.
	   Factors that have helped maintain the value of the yuan include:
- China's huge foreign reserves of US$140 billion can sufficiently
serve the country's imports for 12 months. The amount is second
only to Japan's reserves.
	   - Eighty-five per cent of China's foreign debts were medium- and
long-term loans as of the end of 1997, a sharp contrast from the
crisis-hit Asian countries where over half of offshore liabilities
are short-term borrowings.
	   - The country's debt-service ratio is estimated at a healthy 14
per cent rate.
	   - China has had a trade and current account surplus since the
mid-90s. The country's trade surplus surged 230 per cent to $40.3
billion last year. This again is different from South Korea and
Asean countries which had huge trade and current account deficits.
	   - Unlike other Asian currencies, the non-convertible nature of
the yuan has limited the capacity of currency speculators to play
with the currency. The relatively small stock markets have also
helped narrow the channels of capital outflow that would increase
the fluctuation of the currency.
	   - Zhu Rongji announced in March that China would not devalue its
currency. The Chinese premier will have to keep his promise if only
to maintain his political popularity among the world communities,
including Asia, that would support the country's entry to the World
Trade Organisation.
	   - The stability of the yuan is part of China's success in
combatting inflation which, in 1997, rose by only 0.8 per cent. The
government set a target to control inflation at 2 to 3 per cent
this year.
	   - Foreign investment has been a major contributor to the growth
of the Chinese economy. In order not to destroy the investment
climate, China will not devalue the yuan as that would trigger a
loss in foreign investors' confidence over its currency and
economy.
	   Factors that go against the strength of the yuan include: - The
yen crisis. Compared to the end of 1997 when the yen was at YEN 130
to a dollar, the Japanese currency had depreciated by 11.5 per cent
by June 15 this year when it touched YEN 145 to the dollar.
	   - The Chinese witnessed their first negative growth in exports
for the first time in 22 months when the total dropped by 1.5 per
cent in May. Compared to a 21 per cent growth in 1997, the
country's exports increased by a mere 8.6 per cent in the first
five months.
	   - The Chinese economy grew by 7.2 per cent in the first quarter,
the lowest quarterly growth in six years. The growth is lower than
the projected 8 per cent and last year's increase of 8.8 per cent.
	   Every 1 per cent drop in economic growth is estimated to render
two million to four million more workers unemployed. This will
cause political pressure.
	   ''Economic growth of less than 5 per cent is a risk to the
yuan,'' TFRC said.
	   - China's weak banking system. Similar to Thailand, China's
credit growth has been at 20 per cent per annum during the past 20
years. It has been estimated that non-performing loans of its
banking system is at 15 per cent average. NPLs of big banks are as
high as 22 per cent while the loan loss provision rate is set at
only 1 per cent of the total loan.

	   ``There's no need to do it yourself, just pay more and you'll
get it fast.'' That's familiar advice anytime one plans to apply
for a driver's license or an identity card.
	   The advice might be untrue, but it is no secret that one can get
both driver's license and identity card processed faster and easier
if extra rupiah is attached to the documents.
	   ``Once, I got really frustrated when I was told by a subdistrict
official that my identity card would take over a month, even though
I had all the complete documents,'' said Kuntjoro, a marketing
executive.
	   Just to renew an identity card, one should provide a copy of
their family registration card, photos, a copy of the expired card
and the Rp 1,000 fee. With all these documents, it should only take
one day to process.
	   ``But when I told the official that I badly needed the card and
gave him an extra Rp 30,000, he told me I could pick up my card in
three days,'' he said. ``It's really amazing.''
	   It's the same story with applying for a driver's license, or SIM
as it is called here.
	   As soon as one enters the Jakarta license bureau on Jl. Daan
Mogot in West Jakarta -- designed to limit the operations of
brokers and ``bad'' officers -- applicants are instantly surrounded
by touts. All of them raise the same questions: ``Want to get a new
SIM? Want to renew your SIM? Let me help you.''
	   The touts might be annoying, but some people, whose tight work
schedule makes it impossible for them to wait for hours to get a
license, making use of a tout's service may be favorable.
	   ``It's impossible to escape from my office for hours just to
renew my driver's licenses. So I regularly used touts, it's faster
than having to line up and follow each procedure,'' said Linawati,
a public relations officer.
	   Driver's licenses applicants frequently end up paying twice to
five times the official rate of Rp 62,500, which includes Rp 52,500
for application forms and Rp 10,000 for insurance.
	   ``I don't mind paying ... most people do the same,'' Linawati
added.
	   Amid the surge in calls for reform, a tout, who declined to be
identified, said he was sure the police would not kick him out just
because of the need to reform public services.
	   ``We've been long in the business. If they kick us out of here
(the license bureau), we can run our business from home,'' he said.
	   ``I still have some 'friends' at the license bureau anyway,'' he
added, referring to ``bad officers'' involved in the business.
	   Reports claim that most of the extra money gained from
applicants is equally distributed among officials in charge of
different booths.
	   With the help of touts, there is no need for applicants to take
any obligatory tests, including driving tests, or to go through the
tiresome procedures. All they have to do is simply wait, get their
picture taken and wait for their license to be printed.
	   But not all people can afford to pay extra just to obtain their
drivers' license or identity cards.
	   Applicants with little money sometimes have no way of avoiding
the procedures and should also be prepared to be ignored.
	   ``I heard that the bureau is equipped with computers. So, it's
hard to understand why I have to wait for hours just to get my
license renewed,'' complained Suhardji, who has queued for over
three hours.
	   Not difficult
	   Amid all these charges, officials say the procedures to get both
identity cards and drivers' licenses are not as difficult as
reported, as long as one is willing to follow procedures and
complete all the necessary forms.
	   ``Unfortunately, many people tend to seek help from a third
party... Or the documents are incomplete or inaccurate... As a
result, the card has to be reprocessed and its completion takes
longer than it should,'' deputy governor of administration affairs
Abdul Kahfi said.
	   But he admits there is still a need to improve his officials'
attitudes and skills.
	   ``Supervision of officials in charge of giving services to the
public should be improved. Fees should be adjusted as regulated,''
Kahfi said.
	   When asked whether it was possible for identity cards to be
valid for more than three years, or to have one for a lifetime, he
said the present situation made it impossible.
	   ``People's legal awareness is still low... and it's hard to
control people's mobility,'' he said.
	   For residents, an identity card is important as legal evidence
of one's identity and for security, while the administration needs
to know residents' whereabouts, the size of the local population
and to raise locally generated revenue.
	   Under the present regulation, identity cards have to be renewed
every three years. Only those over 60 years old are issued cards to
last the remainder of their lives.
	   Jakarta Police spokesman Lt. Col. E. Aritonang also pointed out
the need for each driver to have his/her license renewed every five
years.
	   ``A driver's license proves that a driver is capable of driving
and will not endanger others, or disturb traffic,'' he said.
	   Licenses, he said, also help officers in investigating
accidents.
	   But he declined to comment on the misuse of procedures for the
processing of new driver's license or their renewal by ``bad''
officers who are after personal profit, or the widespread practice
of touts. ``I don't know about that... let Mabes (the national
police headquarters) explain,'' Aritonang said.
	   He blamed people's ``super busy'' lifestyles for hampering the
police in providing good services.
	   ``People want to process everything fast and even use touts'
services. When they find a problem, they blame it on the police,
even though they don't follow procedures themselves,'' Aritonang
said.
	   Sociologist Sardjono Jatiman says people have tired of the state
of public services and feel it is time to reform.
	   ``People have been waiting long enough for better public
services. But the main question lies with the bureaucrats. Are they
willing to reform public services?'' he asked.
	   Many high-ranking officials, he says, are reluctant to become
regular people. ``Are there any ministers who apply for their own
identity cards?''
	   People, he says, are willing to follow procedures as long as
officials are consistent in implementing regulations.
	   For instance, he says, people are willing to line up in banks
because of the banks' consistency. ``Banks serve those who come
first,'' Sardjono said.
	   If the city wants to raise money from processing identity cards
or driver's licenses, he says he is certain that people would not
mind paying for it as long as ``it's legal and the service is
good.''
	   As public servants, he says, officials should not complicate
procedures. ``But what happens now is that if they can complicate
procedures, why make it simple?''
	   Aside from improving public services, he has also urged the
government to improve officials' salaries, to prevent them from
abusing their power.

	   AS you turn a certain corner on the first level of Suria KLCC, a
wild combination of assorted scents will hit you. Follow these
invigorating smells for about 30 metres or so, and you'll come upon
a brightly-lit store with an intimidating ritzy aura.
	   Welcome to Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn.
	   Almost as soon as you enter the store, your initial reservations
are squashed. To your delight, you will discover a whole range of
prettily- packaged soaps, lotions, bath gels and shampoos. There
are also flowers, shells and fruits adorning bottles and jars and
little square boxes.
	   Further inspection reveals a beautiful selection of jams,
biscuits and teas, packaged with that quintessential English touch.
	   They are pricey, but you'll pay to have anything so pretty.
	   One of Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn's biggest attraction is its fine foods.
Butter cookies and shortbread made in family bakeries in Derbyshire
and Scotland are now available to Malaysians.
	   There is also a wide range of preserves and confectionery. The
liquer, fruit jams, honey and lemon curd are all hand-made.
	   Teas come in the superior flavours of black, herbal or fruit
teas. All teas sold are full-leafed.
	   They also have a huge collection of aromatheraphy that comes in
essential oil blends, shower gel, body lotion, candles, massage
oil, smelling salts and pulse point balm.
	   Another interesting assemblage is their Gardeners range. These
are hand and body care products which the store claims to be
invaluable to all gardeners. The items include the Scrub Bar with
Pumice, a soothing lotion called Hand Therapy, a sunscreen, and an
aloe vera-based gel to relieve skin discomfort and insect bites.
There is also an insect repellent made from natural plant extracts.
	   The made-for-men line is pretty impressive too. Apparently, the
Prince of Wales benefits from a royally-waranted supply of its skin
and shaving products.
	   For home fragrances, select from an array of candles, potpourri
and room sprays that come in such aromas as vanilla and freesia.
	   A novelty feature is its placement of a sink right in the middle
of the shop.
	   Here customers are allowed to test any product, whether a bath
gel or soap, before deciding on a purchase.
	   Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn has only just opened its flagship store in
Malaysia and to celebrate, it has prepared special incentives and
activities for its customers.
	   Visitors to the store this month will be treated to discounts on
certain items, food tasting and an aromatherapy hand massage.
Special gifts will be given with certain purchases.
	   Similar incentives are available at its concession in Tangs
Department Store at Starhill Centre, Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala
Lumpur.

	   As the expiry dates of our personal documents, like identity
cards (IDs), draw near, we are filled with dread. Expatriates come
away with a hell-like impression of the country when dealing
directly with government officials. Wiser locals leave it to the
specialists.
	   Five residents currently based in Jakarta share their views:
	   Guruh Soekarnoputra, well-known choreographer and owner of an
entertainment company: The government should find a better system
for processing identity cards or driver's licenses. If necessary,
it could make a comparative study with systems in other countries.
	   People want to deal with uncomplicated administrative procedures
that are cheap and don't take up a lot of time. It would be much
better if it was enough for people to have either an identity card
or a driver's license (instead of both), their function is the same
anyway.
	   But readiness to streamline such procedures depends on the
government, especially the officials' mentality. Are they willing
to lose their main source of income? It's no longer a secret that
administrative procedures are used to gain personal profit. It
seems like they forget their duty as public servants.
	   Panangian Simanungkalit, property analyst: I do not apply for my
own identity card or driver's license because for me, it is time
consuming and I do not have much time for it.
	   It's also psychological: the slow service and officials'
attitude make me reluctant to do it on my own. So I'd rather pay
more to let others help me get my identity card or driver's license
than having to suffer.
	   Suggestions to streamline procedures are appreciated but it's a
dream. The government tends to pay more attention to political and
economic issues, improving public services would be last on their
priority list.
	   Now, people are so used to bribery practices it's become a
culture ... that's even more difficult to change.
	   Don Kardimas, an employee of privately run Bank Danamon:
	   I was helped by a broker at the police headquarters to obtain my
driver's license several months ago. It cost me only Rp 150,000.
	   I preferred paying three times the official rate of Rp 52,000
than wait for hours for officials to process the documents.
	   Though I still took a written examination, it was just a
formality.
	   If I had applied for the driver's license myself and followed
all the procedures, I would never have got my license. I have heard
that officials have created such a system that no one is able to
pass the exams, so that all applicants use the service of scalpers.
	   But the bottom line is that getting licenses through brokers, no
matter how ridiculous and dirty it is, is still mutually beneficial
for me and the broker.
	   It is as simple as this: The broker's business runs well and I
can get my driver's license quickly.
	   Osvaldo Coelho, a Brazilian expatriate: I think it is difficult
to reform Indonesian bureaucracy. The red tape will remain for a
long time despite the campaign currently launched to reform all
aspects of life.
	   Foreigners are always an easy target for the red tape because,
unlike locals, they lack the knowledge to deal with officials.
	   Two years ago, I tried to apply, by myself, for the birth
certificate of my now two-year-old daughter. I had to go from desk
to desk and spend US$500 in total to obtain the birth certificate.
	   The government should issue a booklet in English on tips to
apply for the Non-Permanent Resident Card (KIMS). The only
available booklet is in Bahasa. You know that not many of us
understand the language.
	   An American expatriate, working for a consultancy firm: I have
been dealing with the people in Indonesia's bureaucracy for three
years due to my job as a consultant for several governmental
projects, including privatization and village development projects.
	   Bureaucracy is bad, even in the United States. But, I think
Indonesia has one of the world's worst bureaucracies. Asian
countries in general have big problems with their bureaucracies. I
think the worst bureaucracy is in India.
	   The current reform campaigns launched by Indonesian people might
change politics and the economy in a relatively short time, but
bureaucracy takes a long time to change.
	   If I return to this country in five years, I will probably see a
more democratic country but the bureaucracy might remain the same.
	   If the bureaucracy is going to change, the National Development
Planning Board has the opportunity to change itself more quickly
than other ministries, including the Ministry of Forestry and
Ministry of Home Affairs, thanks to its officials' high levels of
education. I am impressed that the board's officials, even the
lower ranking ones, are very well educated.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Selangor Waterworks Department is
discussing with the local authorities in the Klang Valley the
possibility of installing handpumps for the public.
	   Its director Che Mohamad Che Jusoh said the idea was mooted
yesterday in a meeting with local authorities of areas affected by
the water shortage.
	   ``The local authorities will help to locate the areas where
these pumps can be installed,'' he told a Press conference at the
department's headquarters today.
	   Che Mohamad said either the department or the local authority
could purchase and install the pumps.
	   ``These are shallow wells and will be mostly for domestic use,''
he said.
	   Che Mohamad also said the groundwater tapped in Olak Lempit,
Kuala Langat, would be connected into the main water supply system
and piped to consumers directly.
	   ``The water has been certified fit for drinking. All we need to
do is add chlorine,'' he said, adding that a contractor had started
work on the project.
	   Che Mohamad said moves to drill for groundwater were being
carried out in other areas such as Klang, USJ and the Sungai Langat
catchment area.
	   The effort was being led by the Geology Department.
	   Meanwhile, Che Mohamad said the water supply situation had not
improved as there had not been any rain in the past week.
	   ``The water levels at the dams have been falling everyday, and
as a result, production levels at the Langat and Semenyih water
supply schemes have been falling too,'' he said.
	   He however, declined to say what steps would be taken if the
dams' critical water levels were reached.

	   Words are not enough to describe the anguish, helplessness and
humiliation of a woman raped.
	   Feelings of their male kin, some of whom saw with their own eyes
the assaults on their wives and daughters, are equally difficult to
put into neat, articulate sentences.
	   Hananto, not his real name, said his wife chose death to end the
pain.
	   Deeply shamed, she refused to eat and speak after her rape.
	   ``When we left her just for a second, she gulped a can of Baygon
(a brand of insecticide) and died instantly,'' he told the National
Commission on Human Rights last week.
	   Another man said: ``Why do people keep intimidating us? We never
feel we are Chinese because we were born in Indonesia and we are
Indonesian citizens.''
	   Terrible tales and the tormented emotions of many
Chinese-Indonesians are only now beginning to trickle out following
the riots which wreaked havoc in Jakarta and other cities on May
14-May 15.
	   Irwanto, a sociologist from Atma Jaya University in Jakarta,
said a broad spectrum of gripes was behind the targeting of
Chinese-Indonesians, particularly women.
	   ``It was obviously seen as having cultural, economic and
political dimensions.''
	   He pinpointed the community's oft-cited scapegoating over issues
of uneven wealth and welfare distribution.
	   ``The mob would not dare to attack the government, which is also
responsible for bringing down their lives ...
	   ``There are only a few people of Chinese origin who are rich and
conduct 'crooked' businesses.''
	   But people have frequently tainted the entire Chinese-Indonesian
community by summarily associating it with a few greedy tycoons.
	   Last Wednesday, a group of Chinese-Indonesians lodged their
complaints with the National Commission on Human Rights. They
demanded the government's protection and a thorough investigation
into the riots, including rapes of their relatives.
	   Irwanto explained that mass rapes and sexual torture of women in
times of crisis were nothing new. Women and children are the most
vulnerable group in a society and their lives can be easily shaken
by crises, including riot and war.
	   He said the sexual assaults, spoken of only in whispers until a
few days ago, were the manifestation of male dominance over women.
	   Symbolic
	   Rape, he explained, was an aggressive act committed by a man or
a group of men which was not meant primarily for sexual
satisfaction but satisfied the perpetrators in their humiliation
and dominance of the victims.
	   ``Since women of Chinese descent were mostly victims of the
rape, the act exemplifies the mob's hatred against this
community.''
	   Violence committed against these women can be regarded as
symbolic rape of the body of that community, Irwanto said.
	   Sita Aripurnami, an executive of the Kalyanamitra women's
organization, said the rapes were not only against the victims
themselves, but symbolically attacked Indonesian women in general.
	   The organization is handling several reports of abuse during the
riots.
	   ``We consider these rapes as serious violations against women's
rights to live in peace in their country,'' Sita said.
	   Most of the reports involved Chinese-Indonesian women.
	   ``But, we are still investigating whether women of other
communities were also affected.''
	   She added an important caveat: ``I hate to say indigenous women
because we are all Indonesian women.''
	   The rapes reflected the degradation and humiliation of women,
she said. The rapes embody patriarchal values toward female
citizens, in which women's rights are not respected, promoted and
protected both by society and authorities, Sita said.
	   It also showed that women, even within their own society or own
cultural groups, run a considerably greater risk of being victims
of bodily harmed than men.
	   ``In a rape, there is a desire to harm and destroy a woman as
'woman' because the essence of her independence and sense of
wholeness as a woman and as a human being is attacked by the
rapist,'' explained Sita, who is active in various antirape
campaigns and the protection of women's rights.
	   The rapists tried to show their power by attacking women's
reproductive organs, symbolically viewed by the society as
representing dignity and sanctity, she said.
	   ``Now, we have to work very hard to restore and to recover the
dignity of victims of rapes.''
	   Irwanto added that it would be a long, difficult process for
rape victims to recover, if they ever do.
	   ``I am glad to see women's crisis centers and humanitarian
activists working hand in hand to help rape victims or other women
who were sexually abused during the May riots. But I don't see any
program launched by the government,'' Irwanto said.
	   ``Many government measures are unclear and confusing. These
victims badly need security guarantees and protection. Therefore,
the government should outline concrete steps.''
	   Lack of sensitivity
	   The State Minister of Women's Affairs has just opened a hot line
service to accommodate complaints of riot victims, particularly
women, but many view the move as coming too late. Moreover, there
was no concrete program announced by the office.
	   Ratna Batara Munti from the Association of Indonesian Women for
Justice (APIK) was incensed by State Minister of Women's Affairs
Tutty Alawiyah's apparent lack of sensitivity to the plight of the
women.
	   ``I am very disappointed that the minister has not shown a sense
of crisis in these rape cases and other forms of violence against
women during the riot,'' Ratna said. ``She (the minister) is
actually the one who has access to power to probe this issue and
who is capable of mobilizing immediate assistance for the victims.
But, she has done very little, or probably nothing.''
	   Sita added that in some rape cases victims were entitled to have
legal representatives, support and professional help in medical and
psychological fields when they report their case to crisis centers
or the police.
	   ``This requires a lot of money and a lot of human resources
which we, non-profit organizations and humanitarian activists,
don't have. The minister of women's roles can actually provide
needed facilities, if she is willing to do so,'' Sita said.
	   More importantly, Ratna said, the minister should be able to
convince her colleagues that rape and other violence against women
were not just a ``sad effect of the riots'', but real problems
faced by women in their daily lives.

	   IPOH, Fri. - A Form Three student of Sekolah Menengah Jenis
Kebangsaan Sam Tet lodged a police report claiming he was assaulted
by several students at the school on Wednesday.
	   A police spokesman said two students were detained this morning
for questioning but were later released.
	   Foo Seong Chun, 16, in his police report said he had a
misunderstanding with a Form Five student over a schoolmate who was
injured during a football game on June 9.
	   Foo said the following day, a student called him out of his
class during a lesson and said someone wanted to see him.
	   He went to the fourth floor and met the student with whom he had
the misunderstanding earlier.
	   Suddenly, a person came from behind and hit him several times on
the head with a broom until it broke in two. Another person also
started kicking and punching him.
	   Foo said the assault lasted about 15 minutes before he could
escape to seek the help of a teacher.
	   Foo's mother, L.K. Ng, said the school should enforce school
rules in accordance with guidelines approved by the Education
Department. The school should not practise ``double standards'' in
handling disciplinary problems, she added.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Elias Hrawi's hometown turned
on him in municipal elections in eastern Lebanon and the militant
Hezbollah lost ground in its main stronghold, results showed
Monday.
	   About 60 percent of the eastern Bekaa Valley's 434,000 eligible
voted Sunday to fill 1,879 city and town council posts. Some 105
people were reported arrested in minor trouble that was contained
by some of the 4,000 soldiers deployed in the area.
	   The Bekaa vote was the last of a staggered local polling that
began May 23 across Lebanon's five provinces. It is the first
municipal elections in 35 years and marked a milestone in Lebanon's
recovery after the 1975-90 civil war between its Christian and
Muslim communities.
	   Zahle, Bekaa's provincial capital and the president's hometown,
elected 16 candidates to its 21-member city council from a ticket
backed by Hrawi's eldest son, George, and the president's arch-foe,
lawmaker Elie Skaff.
	   The other five seats went to a ticket backed by the president,
his younger son, Roy, a legislator nephew and two allied Cabinet
ministers.
	   The press had speculated that the race in Zahle, Lebanon's
largest Christian town of 130,000 people, could have a bearing on
the president's political future as Hrawi, in office since 1989,
may seek another extension when his term expires in November.
	   But what made this race particularly fierce was the fact that
the Christian president and his son were on opposite sides. George
Hrawi, who shied away from politics until recently, has said he
does not agree with his his father's policies.
	   In another key race in the Bekaa, the Iranian-backed Shiite
Muslim Hezbollah group failed to sweep city council in
predominantly Shiite Baalbek.
	   Baalbek, home to world famous ruins and the international
festival of the arts under its towering Roman columns, was
Lebanon's prime tourist attraction before the civil war.
	   But during the conflict the region became a hotbed of Shiite
Muslim extremists who kidnapped Westerners. It was also a haven for
drug traffickers and money counterfeiters.
	   Hezbollah became the de facto ruler in Baalbek since it was
formed in 1982.
	   The pro-Syrian Amal, Hezbollah's main rival for control of the
Shiite community, on Sunday teamed up with Syrian-backed leftist
groups against the militants.
	   Riding on votes of non-Shiites, the coalition advanced to win 16
seats on the 21-member council. Hezbollah picked up the remaining
five seats.
	   Hezbollah had sought to solidify its wartime hold on Baalbek
through controlling its city council.
	   But concerns that a Hezbollah victory may harm Baalbek as
Lebanon's main tourist attraction prompted moderates to launch an
offensive to regain influence.
	   Hezbollah, however, defeated rivals in town councils in
surrounding areas and the remote Hermel region of northeastern
Lebanon, consolidating its emergence as an influential power within
the 1.2 million Shiite community.
	   The mainstream Amal group of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri lost
ground in last week's vote in southern Lebanon to Hezbollah, which
has capitalized on a successful guerrilla war against Israel's
occupation forces.
	   It has since posed a challenge to Berri for leadership of the
Shiites, Lebanon's largest single sect.

	   THE RM25,000 price ceiling on low-cost houses is to be raised to
RM42,000 under a four-tier pricing scheme that has been approved by
Cabinet.
	   Under the new scheme, low-cost units will be priced according to
location, environment, design and building materials used. The four
price tiers approved are RM25,000, RM30,000, RM35,000 and RM42,000.
	   Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Megat
Junid Megat Ayob revealed this when opening the Made-in-Malaysia
Building Materials exhibition in Kuala Lumpur.
	   It was learnt that Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk
Dr Ting Chew Peh will make a detailed announcement on the new
scheme next week.
	   The RM25,000 ceiling for low-cost houses was set by the
Government about 20 years ago, aimed at providing affordable homes
for the lower-income group.
	   There have been several calls by housing developers over the
years for the policy to be reviewed.
	   The cost of building a low-cost house is said to be between
RM35,000 and RM50,000 depending on the land premium. Housing
developers said they been been cross-subsidising low-cost houses
with profits made from the higher- end units.
	   The calls for the ceiling to be raised became more urgent lately
with the increase in prices of building materials and land, as well
as problems associated with the economic downturn.
	   About 140,000 low-cost houses are to be built under the Seventh
Malaysia Plan (1996-2000).
	   The decision to review the ceiling price, it was learnt, was
arrived at based on an in-depth study by the Housing and Local
Government Ministry, carried out upon a directive by the Cabinet to
look into the pricing of the low-cost houses.
	   The National Housing Department completed the study last year.
It had recommended that low-cost houses be priced between RM25,000
and RM42,000.
	   The study also identified the RM42,000 low-cost units for Kuala
Lumpur.
	   In other areas such as Penang and Johor Baru, the prices of the
low-cost houses are likely to be over RM30,000.
	   The National Economic Action Council (NEAC), the body set up to
look into problems brought about by the economic downturn, is
believed to be in support of the tier pricing.
	   The NEAC had also submitted a proposal for a flexibility in
implementing the 30 per cent low-cost housing quota for housing
developers. Under the current policy, 30 per cent of a housing
project must be low cost, depending on location and size of the
project.
	   In his speech at the exhibition, Megat Junid called on housing
developers to use local building materials to reduce cost and lower
the prices of the houses.
	   Due the economic slowdown, he said, there is a surplus of local
building materials. He said these materials can be exported but
marketing strategies needed to be improved.
	   ``Building materials producers should work closely with interior
designers, architects, developers and constractors to market their
product overseas,'' he added.
	   There is an excess of 10 million tonnes of locally-manufactured
cement in the market. Malaysia produced 22 million tonnes of cement
and 14 million tonnes of clinker last year. Clinker is the raw
material used in the production of cement. Malaysia exports cement
and clinker to Singapore, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
	   Between January and April this year, only 2,000 tonnes were
exported.
	   Cement producers also exported about 72,000 tonnes of clinker up
to April this year.
	   The Government, he said, had allowed cement to be exported since
July last year. It has also ceased import of cement through the two
floating silos located in Port Klang and Kuantan.
	   The country exported RM2.536 billion worth of building materials
and imported RM3.248 billion during the first quarter this year.

	   PERDANA Industri Holdings Bhd said its default in payments was
mainly due to the inability of the group to generate sufficient
cash flow to repay its borrowings.
	   In a statement yesterday, Perdana Industri said this was a
result of the poor performance of its footwear manufacturing
business.
	   It added that the group's performance was hampered by rising
production cost and increasing cost competitiveness of emerging
low-cost producers from neighbouring countries, such as Vietnam and
China.
	   Perdana Industri said it is currently in the process of seeking
corporate advice from various professionals to help address these
issues.
	   Referring to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Practice Note No
2/98, dated May 29 1998, with respect to the company's default in
payments, it said they consist of an outstanding amount of RM138.26
million comprising principal and interest owed by Perdana Industri
to MBf Finance Bhd.
	   It said an application for Summary Judgement under Order 14 was
filed by MBf Finance against Perdana Industri on October 23 1997.
	   Judgement was obtained by MBf Finance on April 15 1998 for
RM138.26 million as at September 30 1997, with interest at 14.3 per
cent a year and additional interest of 1 per cent a year on the
amount until full settlement.
	   The company added that it is taking legal action against
respective vendors and third parties for the recovery of advance
payments for the proposed acquisition of Choo Yeang Sdn Bhd, Choo
Yeang Properties and Construction Sdn Bhd, Harvard Heritage Sdn Bhd
and Keris Properties (PK) Sdn Bhd.

	   AFFIN Holdings Bhd will maintain its non-performing loans (NPLs)
below 10 per cent of the total outstanding loans for this year,
says managing director Datuk Lodin Wok Kamaruddin.
	   ``We expect the NPL level to increase by the end of this year,
but we will strive to keep it to a single digit or below 10 per
cent,'' he said after the group's annual general meeting in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday.
	   The NPLs accounted for 6.11 per cent of the bank's lendings in
the first quarter of this year compared with 2.83 per cent in the
last quarter of 1997.
	   Perwira Affin Bank has total financial commitments of RM2.8
billion, in which RM1.3 billion were in the form of bonds or
private debt securities (PDS).
	   ``But the good thing is that only RM78 million of the PDS is due
in 1998 while another RM279 million is due in 1999. All others are
beyond 2000, by which time I think we will get a clear picture of
our financial footing,''
	   he said.
	   Lodin said the group will still give out loans to the productive
sector, but it will be very selective. ``We have to look at sectors
which are recession proof such as the plantation and manufacturing
sectors.''
	   Asked whether the group plans to adjust the loans installment,
Lodin said it has no intention of doing so even though the interest
rate has increased and lengthened the payment period.
	   ``Until today, we have not discussed or taken any move to
increase the loans installment,'' he said.
	   Affin Holdings, which posted a net profit of RM35.08 million for
the first quarter ended March 31 this year, is confident it will be
able to record the same figure for the second quarter.
	   ``However, we are not surprised if there is a slight reduction
in the results (for the second quarter) as we are aware of the
current situation,'' he said.
	   He also said it has just completed the due diligence exercise
for the merger of Affin Holdings' wholly-owned subsidiary, Affin
Finance Bhd, and Asia Commercial Finance (M) Bhd.
	   ``We hope to complete the whole exercise within six months,'' he
said, adding that the merger between Affin Finance and Asia
Commercial will provide a lot of synergy to the group.
	   Through the merger exercise, Affin Holdings will acquire a 33.6
per cent stake in ACF Holdings Bhd. Asia Commercial is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of ACF Holdings.
	   The group's stockbroking arm, Affin-UOB Securities Sdn Bhd, is
expected to begin operations in July or August. It is a joint
venture between Affin Holdings and Singapore's United Overseas Bank
(UOB).
	   Affin owns a 55 per cent equity stake in the joint venture
company, while UOB, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance,
will hold the remaining 45 per cent.
	   To achieve its target of becoming a financial supermarket, Affin
Holdings is looking to acquire a substantial stake in a life
insurance company.
	   It is in an early stage of negotiations with an insurance
company, but Lodin declined to name the party involved. ``We are
not in a position to disclose the matter.''

	   THANKS to World Cup'98 the local media industry is expected to
post a moderate growth of 10 per cent in June -- the first time
this year, as a number of big-time advertisers have allocated over
30 per cent of their annual media budgets for television
advertising during the soccer tournament.
	   The advertising spending in June is expected to rise by 10 per
cent over the same month last year, said Zenith Media Co Ltd
associate media director Parithas Mungtrasittichai. The local media
industry has witnessed negative growth since the beginning of this
year.
	   According to media planners at leading advertising agencies,
placing the advertisements during the World Cup live broadcast is
considered a 'cost-effective' investment. Undoubtedly, the games
are the most-watched programme in Thailand at moment as almost all
households with sets are tuned to the television pool broadcast as
matches kick off.
	   The total media expenditure during France 98 even surpasses the
amount spent during the last World Cup in 1994, according to
Auravadee Ruangsri, general manager of Starcom, a media house
division of Leo Burnett (Thailand) Co Ltd.
	   Soccer enthusiasts have been treated to a number of advertising
spots during the current live broadcasts. Pepsi, Coke, Mama, Nike,
Fuji, Lay's, Esso, Sony, Intel, Sharp, Krathing Daeng, and PTT
Performa Gold are just some of the companies vying for the fans'
attention. A lot of brands have taken the chance to cash in on the
World Cup craze. However, media planners think that the chances are
limited for items such as sport goods, petroleum products and soft
drinks.
	   Pepsi has even drafted in the singer of the World Cup theme song
Ricky Martin to do a spot for them.
	   Normally, June is an inactive month for advertisers since it is
the rainy season and only the start of the second quarter of the
year. But the World Cup has made the difference, drawing
enthusiastic responses from high-spending advertisers during this
time. Leo Burnett's clients such as PTT Performa Gold have
allocated Bt115 million on advertising in June alone. Oglivy &AMP;
Mather's blue-chip client Pepsi has set aside Bt60 million for June
advertising activity directly related to the soccer tournament.
	   ''This is the right time for companies which focus on building
brand awareness to spend on advertising. They have all ignored
balancing the whole-year advertising budget and invest now,'' said
Parithas.
	   Although the World Cup broadcasts benefit the advertising
industry, the most-watched sports programme is not likely to lead
the annual results of the advertising industry into positive
territory, said Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Co Ltd media planning director
Suphanee Dechaburananon.
	   Suphanee said the industry has suffered a 30 per cent plunge
caused by the declining demand from advertisers. Total advertising
spending during the first quarter of this year totals Bt11.5
billion, a 31 per cent plunge over the same period last year.
	   Starcom's Auravadee Ruangsri estimated that more than Bt115
million has been spent by firms to buy media spots during the World
Cup.
	   Both multinational and local firms want to take advantage of the
World Cup to advertise and raise awareness of their products.
However, companies whose products are related to soccer, also use
the World Cup as a special event to promote their goods awareness.

	   SEVERAL stockbroking companies (SBCs) have violated the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) rules regarding exposure to a single
client and a single security, disclosed KLSE executive chairman
Mohd Azlan Hashim.
	   Azlan said this when responding to questions on the results of a
verification exercise undertaken by the KLSE earlier this year
requiring stockbroking companies to disclose their exposures to
Datuk Soh Chee Wen.
	   ``We have got the information we have requested and have
analysed it and taken whatever action we felt necessary based on
the information gathered,'' he said.
	   Azlan was speaking to reporters at the KLSE's media briefing on
protecting investors yesterday.
	   On whether any of the SBCs have exceeded their trading limits on
single client exposuure to Soh, he declined to say Yes or No.
	   Further declining to disclose how many stockbroking firms have
failed to comply with the KLSE rules and who they have over-exposed
themselves to, Azlan nevertheless said the ``appropriate action''
will be taken.
	   This is the first time Azlan has revealed that there are SBCs
which have failed to comply with the trading rules on exposure to
single client and single security.
	   Early this year in January, Azlan had said that none of the SBCs
had breached any of the KLSE rules with regards to their dealings
with Soh.
	   However, he did mention that the KLSE was also seeking
information from SBCs on their exposures to several other
businessmen as well and Soh was not being singled out.
	   These SBCs and all others will continue to be monitored ``in
great detail'' by the KLSE and if companies are found to have
breached the rules over and over again, then more severe action
will be taken.
	   He also said the exercise was part of an on-going process of
information gathering that is part of the exchange's emphasis on
the prudential management of the SBCs.
	   On whether there are investigations by the Securities Commission
on Soh, he replied: ``I am afraid I am unable to comment on any
on-going investigation. The SC conducts various investigations and
we do our part.''
	   He added that the KLSE is investigating if there has been any
breach in its trading rules for member companies.

	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ NATO fighter jets thundered over the
rugged mountains along the border with Kosovo on Monday in a
rigidly choreographed show of force meant to discourage Serb
attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   Eighty-five aircraft from 13 countries took part in the
exercise, which had them skimming the rooftops of Albania's capital
and coming within 10 miles (16 kms) of the border with Kosovo. It
elated American pilots taking part _ but it disappointed refugees
from Kosovo, who said much more was needed to keep Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic from driving them out of their
villages.
	   Milosevic's Serb-led forces hardly paused in their offensive
against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, reportedly attacking
four western villages _ Prilep, Drenovac, Pobrdje and Voks _ with
helicopters, grenades and heavy shelling Monday.
	   The report, from the Albanians' Kosovo Information Center, could
not be independently confirmed because the area is sealed off to
journalists.
	   The maneuvers ``are only a signal and nothing else. Signals are
not enough to stop the violence in Kosovo,'' said Hivzi Hysa, a
Kosovo refugee who trekked over the mountains to arrive in the
Albanian border town of Padesh.
	   After the air power display, U.S. President Bill Clinton called
Boris Yeltsin, hoping that the Russian president could somehow
persuade Milosevic _ in Moscow for a two-day visit _ to stop his
offensive.
	   Although Yeltsin disagrees with NATO over its handling of the
Kosovo crisis, he is expected to join the Western powers in
criticizing the heavy hand Milosevic has used in putting down an
ethnic Albanian uprising.
	   Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on dissent in
Kosovo province, inhabited mostly by ethnic Albanians. More than
300 people have been killed since March and about 65,000 have been
forced to leave their homes.
	   Western leaders want to halt the violence, but do not support
the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for
independence of the province.
	   The aircraft from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries _ including
the United States _ staged hours of aerial exercises Monday morning
over Albania and Macedonia, which border Yugoslavia.
	   Planes in the operation _ codenamed Determined Falcon _ began
departing at 7:50 a.m., leaving from air bases in Italy, Greece,
France, Germany, Britain and the Adriatic Sea. Support planes,
including refueling tankers, already were in the air.
	   ``It was outstanding,'' Capt. Bryan Johnson said afterwards,
climbing down from his sleek, gray airplane at Italy's Aviano Air
Base. ``I think we demonstrated the ability to project power on
short notice.''
	   NATO officials were prepared for a Serb military response
against the planes, but none came. Serb officials in Kosovo would
not even comment on the NATO display _ but Kosovo villagers noticed
their reaction.
	   ``The Serbs are angry because of the NATO maneuvers,'' said Xhem
Shehu, 34, a refugee from Junik who arrived in Padesh. ``That's why
the Serb infantry and their helicopters followed us up to the
border last night.''
	   Shehu said about 3,000 Kosovo refugees had been hiding for the
last two weeks in the mountains along the border with Albania, but
Serb forces tracked them down last night with helicopters with
floodlights.
	   Some 400 Kosovo refugees poured into Padesh on Monday after a
seven-hour hike. Most of them were women with babies and elderly
people.
	   The other Kosovo refugees are still trapped in the mountains, he
and others said, because Serbs are now patrolling some of the goat
paths refugees have taken to cross the border.
	   In the Albanian capital of Tirana, the NATO planes nearly
skimmed the rooftops, startling some residents.
	   ``What the hell is going on?'' said Vjollca Beja, 37, who ran
with her 4-year-old son to take refuge in a Tirana shop, unaware
that the NATO planes were no threat.
	   ``I thought the war started,'' she said later.
	   All NATO members sent aircraft except Iceland and Luxembourg,
which have no air forces, and Canada, which could not deploy planes
to Europe on such short notice.
	   NATO defense ministers ordered the air exercise last Thursday.
They also asked NATO military planners to look at a wide range of
options for future action, including direct intervention in
Yugoslavia with air and ground forces.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement.
	   But since the crackdown began this spring, the Kosovo Liberation
Army has grown more popular. It now controls an estimated 40
percent of the province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1.
	   In Pristina, opinion among Kosovo Serbs was divided. Some were
devoted to the fight to hold on to the province, considered part of
Serbia's historic heartland.
	   ``Let NATO come, let just a single plane fly over our skies _
we'll all be up to our knees in blood,'' said Biljana Mitrovic, an
unemployed 30-year-old.
	   Others were ready to quit.
	   ``I simply don't care. If this keeps on much longer, I'll pack
up my stuff and move to Serbia,'' said Branko Rakic, a clerk.

	   SRI Han Suria Sdn Bhd (SH Suria) has sufficent financial
resources to satisfy full acceptance of its unconditional mandatory
general offer for the 1.17 million Berjaya Prudential Assurance Bhd
(BPrudential) shares it does not own, Commerce International
Merchant Bankers Bhd (CIMB) confirmed.
	   SH Suria is making the mandatory general offer for the 1.17
million shares of RM1 each representing 1.17 per cent of the
paid-up capital of BPrudential at an offer price of RM10.50 per
share.
	   Commerce International Merchant Bankers Bhd (CIMB) had on behalf
of SH Suria served Berjaya Prudential Assurance Bhd with the
mandatory general offer, in compliance with Section 180 of the
Companies Act 1965 and Section 24 (1) of the Securities Commission
Act.
	   CIMB confirms that SH Suria has sufficient financial to satisfy
full acceptance of the offer in cash, and that the company has made
the necessary arrangements for the provision of financial resources
to satisfy full acceptance.
	   In January this year, Berjaya Capital Bhd had entered into
separate sale and purchase agreements with the Prudential Assurance
Co Ltd (PACL), Bumiputera investment company Detik Ria Sdn Bhd, and
Tan Sri Vincent Tan Chee Yioun for the proposed disposal of
BCapital's entire shareholding of 68.83 million shares of RM1 each,
representing 68.83 per cent of the paid- up capital of BPrudential,
for RM722.72 million cash.
	   Under the BPrudential restructuring, PACL will take up 21
million shares of RM1 each representing 21 per cent of the paid-up
capital for RM220.5 million, or at RM10.50 per share.
	   A total of 30 million shares of RM1 each representing a 30 per
cent stake in BPrudential will be acquired by Detik Ria for RM315
million, or at RM10.50 per share.
	   The remaining amount comprising 17.83 million shares of RM1 each
representing a 17.83 per cent stake in BPrudential, or at RM10.50
per share, will be taken up by Tan.
	   Subsequently on April 6, PACL, Detik Ria and Tan entered into
separate share sale agreements with BCapital and SH Suria where the
latter will substitute itself for PACL, Detik Ria and Tan to
acquire the 68.3 per cent equity in BPrudential on the same terms
and conditions of the original sale and purchase.
	   The directors with interests in the deal are Tan Sri Abdul Rahim
Din and Datuk Kamaruddin Jaffar, directors of SH Suria and Detik
Ria. Abdul Rahim is also a director of BPrudential.
	   The two are substantial shareholders of SH Suria by virtue of
each having direct shareholdings of 5,000 shares of RM1 each. This
represents 100 per cent of the paid-up capital of Detik Ria, which
is a shareholder of SH Suria.
	   Mr Ng Keng Hooi is a director of SH Suria and has a direct
shareholding of 150,000 ordinary shares of RM1 each in BPrudential,
representing 0.15 per cent of the paid-up capital of BPrudential.
	   Mr Mark Edward Tucker is a director of BPrudential, SH Suria and

 &UR; `Blame it on Rio' comment draws fire from Brazilian ambassador &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Brazil's U.N. ambassador chided his
Bosnian counterpart Monday after the Bosnian referred indirectly to
Rio de Janeiro as a place where people are condemned ``to a life of
casual sex.''
	   The Bosnian ambassador, Muhamed Sacirbey, made the remark in a
speech to the Security Council, which was meeting to extend the
mandates of U.N. and NATO-led missions in Bosnia.
	   Sacirbey cited the film ``Blame It On Rio'' in trying to
discourage a stereotyping of the Balkans as a region perpetually
afflicted by armed conflict.
	   In the film, which starred a topless Demi Moore and Michael
Caine, the main protagonists ``were inescapably caught up in sex
and lust and promiscuity because they happened to be in Rio de
Janeiro,'' Sacirbey said.
	   ``Are we to blame our own recent war, the genocide and murders,
the fragility of peace, and now even the events in Kosovo because
we are in the Balkans?
	   ``Are we doomed to ethnic hatreds and conflict in the Balkans as
those in Rio are condemned to a life of casual sex?'' he asked.
	   Those remarks enraged the Brazilian ambassador, Celso L.N.
Amorim.
	   In an impromptu rely, Amorim strongly objected to Sacirbey's use
of a formal council meeting ``to disseminate, even if by way of
example, a distorted view about my country and its former
capital.''
	   He said such remarks were ``totally inappropriate'' and
questioned how it could advance the Bosnian cause.
	   ``More generally,'' Amorim said, ``Rio and its people are known
not by the stereotype indirectly mentioned by the ambassador of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but by the traditions of affability, racial and
religious tolerance, love of peace, and openness to foreigners of
all origins and creed.
	   ``We remain ready to share our experience of multiculturalism
and multiethnicty with any country that might find it useful,'' he
added.
	   Sacirbey later apologized for having offended the Brazilian
ambassador and offered to have his remarks about Rio stricken from
the official record.
	   But he stressed that he felt that both the people of Rio and
Bosnia understand the ``common injustice of being stereotyped.''

	   IPOH, Fri. - An idle 0.4ha land which has been designated for
the construction of teachers' quarters has been put to good use by
the administrators of Sekolah Menengah Seri Ampang.
	   About 90 students who are taking the Living Skill subject are
involved in tilling the land to grow lady's finger, sugar cane,
lemon grass and maize.
	   The project was started in February and the students have
succesfully harvested lady's finger which were distributed among
themselves.
	   Living Skill teacher and project supervisor Mohd Noor Mohaidin
said students took charge of the farm on a gotong-royong basis
during school hours and holidays.
	   ``Apart from acquiring farming skills, the students have come to
understand the value of agriculture, more so during the current
economic problem.''
	   He said the school spent about RM1,000 to purchase water
sprinklers, tools and fertilisers.
	   Mohd Noor said maize was expected to be cultivated soon.
	   ``We will not sell the products but allow the students to take
it home.
	   The students must feel that they are being rewarded for their
hard work,''
	   he said.
	   He said the students would experiment with other crops like
nuts, sawi, and pak choy if there was adequate rainfall.
	   One of the students Hairol Azlan said he preferred to be in the
farm rather than the classroom.

	   PERUSAHAAN Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton) has entered into an
understanding with Lotus Engineering Ltd to upgrade research and
design capability of the national car company in the ``ride and
handling'' (R and H) aspect of its production.
	   ``Ride'' refers to the quality of a vehicle's ride which
directly relates to passenger comfort level while ``handling''
refers to the quality of vehicle traction, balance and response
which determines the stability of a vehicle.
	   Lotus Engineering is a subsidiary of Lotus Group International
of which Proton has an 80 per cent ownership.
	   The effort, according to Proton general manager (research and
development and new platform and power train) Encik Kamarulzaman
Darus, is in line with the company's strategic plan to market its
future range of products using ``R and H'' as a main signature for
its vehicles.
	   ``The upgrading of R and H in Proton's product range will not
only improve the performance of its cars but more importantly,
reposition its image by giving the cars a distinct and unique image
in the domestic as well as overseas markets,'' he said in a
statement released in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Proton, Kamarulzaman said, believes that the repositioning of
its products using ``R and H'' as a platform conforms with findings
in market research, indicating that more than often, styling and
unique characteristics rather than safety, emission and performance
measurements predominantly determine vehicle selection.
	   He said Proton's task is very challenging, adding that Proton
has set out to acquire in-house capability in ``R and H'' that is
to exceed Lotus Engineering within the next five years.
	   ``Achieving this goal will require specific planning and
initiatives to be implemented which, in turn, will require critical
investments in manpower, facilities and equipment,'' he added.
	   Specifically, Lotus Engineering's direct involvement in the
effort will include providing relevant training, infrastructure,
software and data to Proton.
	   In terms of training, Proton's personnel will undergo specific
training in vehicle driving assessment apart from other forms of
critical training programmes ranging from chassis engineering and
design to objective measurements and analysis.
	   Within five years, Proton's key engineering personnel
specialising in ``R and H'' are expected to be increased
three-folds.
	   Infrastructure-wise, specialised equipment configured to Lotus'
latest computerised system of which the Suspension Kinematics and
Compliance Measurement system is an example, will be installed
progressively at Proton's main plant based on need and usage of the
infrastructure.
	   Proton's strategic collaboration with Lotus will continue not
only in ``R and H'' but also in other areas which will be mutually
beneficial to both organisations.

	   ALWAYS remember that ``good soil makes good gardens''.
	   Plants are usually not choosy about the soils they grow in but
this is only true as far as weed plants are concerned. This is
evident whenever we pass any wasteground or neglected areas where
there is luxuriant growth of practically all types of weeds. We
often remark that soil in which weeds thrive would also be
appropriate for other plants and flowers, too.
	   This may not be accurate because most of the soils in urban
gardens or for that matter, any soil, can be improved to the point
where it will grow good plants or flowers. How much improvement is
required and of what sort depends largely on the make-up and
consistency of the soil, its mineral content and also what lies
beneath it.
	   Some clay soils are rich in minerals, but they are so dense and
closely packed that even a light rain either runs off or merely
stagnates on top.
	   Heavy rains would remain on top and take days to percolate or
evaporate.
	   In such soils, plants will either die of thirst or their roots
drowned due to waterlogging.
	   On the other hand, when the soil is black in colour, you could
mistake it for black earth thinking it to be a rich soil. However,
such soil often proves to the deficient in minerals, highly acidic
(low in pH value) and so porous that water runs through it. It is
usually quite sandy and has little moisture-retention properties.
	   I have also seen loam which appears to be excellent - neither
too clayey, nor too sandy, yet plants do not grow well in it! This
because a layer of hardpan just below the loam prevented good
drainage and kept the plants from getting their roots to the soil
below.
	   Under certain circumstances, such conditions could also cause
waterlogging. Clay hardpans can prevent water percolating to lower
levels.
	   Good soils almost always have the following qualities: They are
not too hard or compacted They are reasonably deep, at least
20-25cm deep They hold water well, but do not stay wet long after
rain They contain essential elements (minerals) in adequate
quantities to support plant life.
	   They are neither acidic nor alkaline and should have a pH range
of 5.5 - 6.5 or even 6.8.
	   This is the best pH range for most plants to grow healthily.
	   I often get queries about how soils could be improved,
especially in urban gardens. This is fast becoming a common problem
and the reasons are not difficult to pinpoint.
	   Builders and developers often bulldoze the entire area or scrape
the top-soil into a pile before starting to dig the foundation.
They also frequently dispose of this friable top-soil and sell it
and instead, bring in clayey subsoil as a soil-fill to make up the
required levels. This is bad practice, and this has been going on
all the time! At times you find all sorts of building debris just
below the top few centimetres of clay sub-soil. The sub-soil could
also be packed by machinery, making it impervious to water draining
into the ground.
	   Now, top-soil is not really too different from the subsoil that
lies immediately under it. The main difference is that top-soil
contains organic humus which is actually decaying or decayed
vegetable matter or organic debris.
	   Therefore it is relatively easy to improve the soil to a depth
of 20 or 30cm merely by mixing in a lot of vegetable matter and
waiting for it to turn into humus. This is often all that is needed
to make good soil out of a poor one.
	   A little help for the soil ensures you get the best from your
plants.
	   Why do you want to improve the soil?
	   The plants in your garden use a variety of nutrients for their
growth, providing us with the best blooms, vegetables and fruits.
In most cases, your garden soil needs periodic improvements to help
it meet the very heavy demands for nutrients.
	   Soil also requires constant improvement to correct drainage
problems such as in clayey soils (heavy soils), and retain more
moisture as in the case of sandy soils (which are always very
porous and are considered light soils).
	   How to improve the soil The first step is to first determine
what the soil needs. Poor drainage is quite obvious when you see it
on your land, but to detect a nutrient deficiency, you require
proper soil tests. There are garden centres, Government agencies
and specialised nurseries that offer a range of home tests for
nutrients as well as for determining soil acidity. There are also
pH meters or similar gadgets that can give you some indication.
	   You can also provide a soil sample to relevant authorities such
as the Agriculture Department for a small fee).
	   Soil problems are corrected by adding natural organic
`amendments'.
	   These can be any of a number of organic materials, from
well-rotted organic manure to compost.
	   Most improve the soil in a number of different ways, such as
adding the necessary plant nutrients and, at the same time,
improving the physical structure and upgrading soil drainage and
aeration.
	   Soil amendments should be thoroughly blended or worked into the
soil.
	   The traditional method is to use a long-handled garden fork or a
spade.
	   For larger areas, a rotary tiller can do the job more
efficiently. This is often made use of when preparing large areas
of beds in open areas.
	   Good old garden forks and spades (and also cangkuls) are ideal
for blending and distributing amendments into existing areas that
are already planted. The long-handled garden fork is very suitable
for digging and working the organic materials into the top few
centimetres of soil, without doing too much damage to the roots.
	   Improving the soil Use a garden fork to break up the soil. You
may prefer the cangkul. Dig down to 15-20cm of soil. Break up the
chunks. It is also good to sprinkle lime onto the clay soil as lime
disperses clay particles. Next, spread an even layer of coarse sand
up to 15cm thick over the soil that has been dug up.
	   Then add another layer of organic matter or granulated peat
(coarse grade) - a 10cm layer would be sufficient - over the sand
layer. Use the garden fork to blend the amendments into the soil.
Mix well using the fork.
	   If the bed area is large, a rotary tiller is very useful, if you
have one. Mix and blend the amendments well into the soil to a
depth of 15- 20cm.
	   Finally level the soil well. Some gardeners like to give the bed
a good watering. This is good because it will settle the soil and
prepare the new bed (or mixed border) for planting the next day.
	   It must be kept in mind that wet soil is hard to work with and
will not blend well with the newly-added ingredients.
	   When the garden is wet, especially after rain, there should not
be any digging at all as this will cause the soil to compact. This
is very bad as it will destroy soil structure and make (the
original) soil more ``plastic''
	   if it is on the clayey side.
	   Always wait until the soil is reasonably dry before attempting
to improve it. When the large pieces of soil are held in your hand
and crumble when pressed between the fingers, then they should be
dry enough for you to start on the job.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Institute of Information Technology in
New Delhi has expressed strong interest to collaborate with
Malaysian institutes of higher learning, particularly in the fields
of engineering and information technology.
	   The potential collaboration will focus on training in both
disciplines at all academic levels.
	   High Commissioner of India Paramjit S. Sahai said the Indian
Government realised that with the development of the Multimedia
Super Corridor project, Malaysia offered facilities comparable to
that of advanced countries such as Germany.
	   He said the institute will collaborate with local universities
to introduce more engineering and IT programmes.
	   Speaking at the Indian High Commission today, he said this
effort is aimed at producing professionals in these areas, in
support of the MSC project.
	   Also present was IIT director Professor Dr V.S. Raju.
	   ``This is a long term co-operation on the development of a
future generation of academics and researchers,'' said Sahai.
	   He said Raju had met the vice-chancellors of Universiti Malaya,
Universiti Putra Malaysia, Universiti Telekom (Unitel), Universiti
Tenaga Nasional and TAFE College chairman, Works Minister Datuk
Seri S. Samy Vellu and Multimedia Development Corporation executive
chairman Tan Sri Dr Othman Yeop Abdullah to discuss details of the
arrangements.
	   Raju said IIT expected to initiate the collaboration in a few
months' time.
	   He said the details of postgraduate programmes and
joint-research projects were being worked out.
	   He added the programmes would be partly carried out at IIT.
	   IIT which was established in 1952, has five branch campuses. Its
main focus is on engineering and IT education.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Candidates of Egypt's ruling National
Democratic Party won 97 percent of the seats after Sunday's
mid-term elections for the upper house of Parliament, according to
official results announced Monday.
	   In the first round of the elections for 88 seats _ plus two
seats vacant after two members died _ of the Consultative Council,
72 went to NDP members, including 22 that were won unopposed.
	   Fifteen seats, out of the 18 seats contested in Sunday's run-off
went to NDP members and the other three were won by pro-government
independents.
	   President Hosni Mubarak appoints one-third of the Council's 264
seats, with elections for half the others held every three years.
	   Among the victorious NDP candidates was the council president
Mustafa Kamal Helmy.
	   The results were not unexpected as Egypt's 13 opposition parties
boycotted the elections, saying they did not trust the polls to be
fair. The opposition charged widespread vote-rigging in the last
elections in 1995.
	   The council _ or the upper house _ has little power, holding
only an advisory position to the lower house, the People's
Assembly. The lower house also is dominated by the NDP.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Cabinet has allocated 47 new posts for
contract doctors in Goverment hospitals and clinics to cater to the
increasing public health needs, Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng
said.
	   The addition brings Government contract doctors' posts to 751.
However, only 426 places have been filled.
	   Chua said the allocation of the new posts despite a huge vacancy
in contract services demonstrated the acute shortage of doctors.
	   The existing local and foreign contract doctors consist of 241
medical officers and 185 specialists.
	   He said due to the situation, the Cabinet has given the ministry
an exemption from the recent Government ruling of not renewing the
services of contract staff once their term expires.
	   ``We simply do not have enough doctors to serve the public
efficiently, and we face a bigger problem when local doctors refuse
to be assigned in small districts and towns.
	   ``This is where foreign contract doctors come into the picture.
They are more willing to work in isolated areas compared to local
doctors,'' Chua told reporters after opening the final day of the
four-day Third Annual Health Ministry dialogue with the ministry's
internal organisations.
	   He said the contract renewal was only fair as the shortage of
doctors in remote areas was critical and some of them have served
the country for more than 10 years.
	   The majority are from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar.
	   ``We also hope to woo more Malaysian doctors practising abroad
to return to serve the country without putting the pressure on them
to work here permanently,'' he said.
	   He also said long-term plans by the ministry include increasing
the intake of medical students, expanding medical faculties in
local universities, and establishing new private medical colleges.
	   ``At present, medical students in local universities are
approached for interviews even before their graduation, to recruit
them for Government hospitals and clinics,'' he said.
	   Earlier in his speech, Chua said the ministry would continue to
improve the terms and conditions of service for its employees.
	   He said the ministry also encouraged further education by
providing in- house distance learning programmes for its staff.
	   Eighteen of the ministry's internal organisations presented
their memorandums at the dialogue's final session.
	   They included representatives of the Government Midwives and
Nurses Association, Pharmacy Support Organisation, Malaysian
Institute of Food Technology and Malaysian Clinical Biochemistry
Association.
	   The four-day dialogue involving representatives of professional
bodies, industrial organisations, non-Governmental organisations
and the ministry's internal organisations serves to gather input
from health- related bodies to formulate the country's healthcare
policy as well as to evaluate the existing policy's effectiveness.

	   THE Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE)'s notice calling for
claims against the Compensation Fund on Omega Securities Sdn Bhd
will be published on Monday, June 15. In a statement yesterday, the
KLSE said it would like to advise investors wishing to claim from
the Compensation Fund to take the greatest care in their
submissions and ensure full information and documentation are
provided, with all deadlines meticulously observed.
	   Meanwhile, Hwang-DBS Securities Bhd's notice on the
reimbursement scheme to clients of Omega will also be published on
Monday. In a separate statement, Omega said an appeal has been made
to the Minister of Finance against the revocation of the licence of
Omega Securities. The Securities Commission had revoked the licence
of Omega Securities on June 5, while the KLSE had appointed the
receivers and managers on June 9. Omega said it has consulted its
legal adviser, and following their advice will make further
announcement on the action the company will take to safeguard the
interest of its shareholders.

	   THE Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) will announce in July
other parameters that need to be disclosed by stockbroking firms,
in line with moving towards a disclosure-based regulatory
environment for the securities industry.
	   Executive chairman Mohd Azlan Hashim said the exchange is still
discussing the degree and content of financial reporting and
frequency that stockbroking companies need to reveal which attempts
to guide investors in making well-considered decisions in their
dealings with these companies.
	   Thus far, the first step towards this direction has been the
revelation of the stockbroking companies' Minimum Liquid Fund (MLF)
positions as at May 8, where 12 companies were found to be in
deficit.
	   All the companies, except for Amsteel Securities, had been
placed under trading restrictions.
	   Although Azlan could not give an update on these companies' MLF
positions, he did say that there had been improvements in this
aspect with regards to some of them.
	   However, the MLF position is only one of several considerations
for investors to evaluate a stockbroking company's financial
position.
	   The KLSE earlier said it was considering reviewing its rules and
regulations to require stockbroking companies to disclose more
financial information, including relevant information from the
profit and loss account and balance sheet on a periodic basis.
	   Azlan said with emphasis on this, the exchange has held detailed
discussions with the Association of Stockbrokers Malaysia as well
as other industry groups.
	   ``We will continue to have these dialogue sessions and gain
feedback from these people which has been of great assistance,'' he
said.

	   HALF of the things M. Nasir said are not suitable for print. No,
no, we're not talking obscenities here. But they're nonetheless
offensive... to certain people.
	   A little over a year after the ``radio deejay'' controversy -
which resulted in an unofficial ban on his music by several radio
stations - Nasir is understandably cautious about what he says
these days.
	   (At the AIM music seminar last year, Nasir, who was one of the
panel speakers, had alleged that record companies sometimes had to
resort to giving ``incentives'' to radio deejays to get their
artistes' songs aired.) The singer-songwriter-producer found out -
the hard way - that being vocal was just too high a price to pay.
	   So what one gets in an interview with the multi-talented artiste
today is somewhat tame, compared with previous sessions.
	   Nasir manages a wry smile when the subject is brought up. The
smile seems to suggest that he's had it with trying to fight the
system, that things would never change anyway, so why bother
trying?
	   ``No, I was never angry, never...,'' says Nasir of the incident,
which saw his works in ``cold storage'' for the better part of last
year although the bigwigs at RTM denied there was a ban.
	   However, that was about all Nasir would let on about his
feelings. He's not about to engage himself in another lengthy
discussion about the issue.
	   He knows better.
	   Nasir prefers to do the PR thing of promoting his compilation
album, Terbaik M. Nasir, recently released by BMG.
	   It contains 10 songs from his previous albums including Bonda,
Inang Pulau Kencana, Rajawali, Tanya Sama Itu Hud Hud, Mentera
Semerah Padi, Anak-Anak Kita and Mustika.
	   In addition, there are two bonus tracks - Kias Fansuri and
Andalusia.
	   And as with his other hits, the strength of these songs lies not
only in the melody but also the beautiful, poetic lyrics by Loloq.
	   Ask Nasir about his long-time collaboration with Loloq and he
will tell you, quite simply, that the reason they work so well
together is because ``we're of the same age''.
	   ``We went through the same things together. If I talk about the
art movement, say, German expressionism, he can relate to it
instantly. That makes it easier for us to work together.
	   ``But I guess it has also to do with the freedom to express
himself. What I usually do is give Loloq a theme and he will come
up with a storyline.
	   Sometimes we'll work out the storyline together.
	   ``But at the end of the day, the style of writing is his. I
would never write in that kind of language.''
	   Kias Fansuri, says Nasir, is a tribute to 17th-century poet
Hamzah Fansuri.
	   ``You could say it's my interpretation of how the man thinks,
done in story form.''
	   Nasir hasn't released a completely new solo album for a while.
For the past few years, his fans have had to be content with
listening to his songs in other singers' albums or the one or two
new songs inserted in his compilation albums.
	   His last effort - a ``live'' album recorded during his Akar
concert nearly three years ago - was also a compilation album which
features mostly his hit songs.
	   Nasir, however, is in no hurry to put out a new record.
	   ``I know I've been working on it for too long. It's been nearly
two years now. The idea was to make a quick album in, say, two
weeks. But two weeks has turned to two years...
	   ``I really don't know when it will be completed. This is not
just about writing new songs. It's something very personal, a
documentation of my feelings and thoughts.
	   ``Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying it has to be a masterpiece
or anything. I already have all the songs but there's something
that's still missing. It's very difficult for me to explain. I'll
know it when it's there and I won't release the album until I've
got it.''
	   He finds it takes longer for him to produce his own albums these
days.
	   Could it be due to the fact that a certain standard is expected
of him?
	   ``I choose not to think about it. Sure I care about what people
think of my work but I try not to let that bother me when I'm
working.''
	   Part of the reason why he's taking his time, says Nasir, is
because he's trying to improve on the technical aspects of
production.
	   ``Also, I'd like to get more people to listen to my music. Right
now, it only appeals to a certain group of people,'' says Nasir,
who's also working on two English singles.
	   Over the years, Nasir has entertained music-lovers with
beautiful tunes.
	   But it's not all about entertainment. Whether consciously or
not, he continues to steer listeners away from the usual love songs
that dominate the market through his thought-provoking lyrics.
	   ``Musically-speaking, I haven't changed much, except that the
traditional elements are more pronounced. Some people may think
authenticity is not a big deal but I feel very strongly about it.''
	   Songwriter, singer, album producer, painter, film director and
actor.
	   Which does he see himself as, first and foremost?
	   ``Professionally, I'm recognised more for my work in the music
industry because I've been doing it for years. But I also love
theatre and film.
	   ``My interest in film is not new. In fact, it's longer than
music but not many people know that.
	   ``I guess I see myself as an...,'' he hesitates, then laughs
before mumbling ``artiste?'', as if the mere thought of calling
himself an artiste is absurd.
	   ``It's too big a burden... Let's just say I'm a person who likes
and accepts all forms of artistic expression.''
	   Perhaps that's why he doesn't pick and choose who he writes for
or works with. ``And because of that, it becomes a hit or miss
thing,'' says Nasir, who has contributed songs to many artistes -
from newcomers to the more established ones like Wings, Search,
Rahim Maarof, Ella, Ruhil, Ramlah Ram and Jamal Abdillah.
	   He notes that while there is an abundance of folks who see
themselves as artistes, there is still a dearth of real talent.
	   ``Previously, the talents came from nightclubs, people who had
years of experience performing `live' before becoming recording
artistes. You only had to train them to handle recording.
	   ``Nowadays, when a potential talent is spotted, he/she is taken
straight to the recording studio and you have to train them to
sing!''
	   Asked about the progress of his second film venture, Gagak
Kayangan, Nasir says he's ``in the process of writing and
re-writing the script and getting the right cast and crew.''
	   ``I learned a lot while making Merah,'' he says of the film that
marked his debut as a film director and which earned him the best
film award at the Anugerah Skrin TV3 last year.
	   Just how happy was he with Merah?
	   ``I'm never satisfied with what I do. There's always something I
feel I can improve on. But sometimes you have no choice but to be
happy with things, even though you know you can do better.''

	   RINGGIT ended lower yesterday at 4.0100/020 against the US
dollar from 3.9480/998 on Thursday in tight range trading.
	   One dealer said the market was very quiet, adding that the
easier sentiment of the local unit continued to be weighed down by
the weakness of the Japanese yen, which dipped further to around
the 144 level to the greenback in the Tokyo market.
	   ``It is still a yen-driven kind of scenario and as such, the
outlook for both the ringgit and regional currencies in the near
term looks gloomy,''
	   he added.
	   The dealer said so far the Bank of Japan had not taken
definitive measures to support the ailing yen.
	   ``What we can do now is to wait-and-see how the yen moves in the
absence of domestic market-moving factors,'' he said.
	   The ringgit hovered within a narrow band of between 4.00 and
4.05 to the US dollar yesterday.
	   The local unit also eased against the Singapore dollar at
2.2993/309 from 2.2844/292 at Thursday's closing, but was higher
against the Japanese yen at 2.7812/790 from 2.7885/825, lower
against the deutschemark at 2.2180/224 from 2.1958/224 and
depreciated against the pound sterling at 6.5371/557 from
6.4297/515.
	   In Singapore, the US dollar ended mixed against the mark and yen
previously but was higher against Southeast Asian currencies,
dealers said.
	   The dollar closed lower at 1.8080 marks from the opening level
of 1.8090, and higher against the Japanese yen at 144.20 from
144.15 in the morning, according to rates from Banque Nationale de
Paris.
	   The dollar eased to 6.0620 French francs from 6.0670 in the
morning, while the British pound was unchanged at 1.6290.

	   CONTRACT doctors are exempted from the general ruling on the
freeze in intake of government contract staff, Health Minister
Datuk Chua Jui Meng said yesterday.
	   Contract doctors are allowed to continue serving at public
hospitals if their performance meet the Health Ministry's
guidelines, he told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur yesterday
before chairing a closed door dialgoue between the ministry and
in-house unions in the health sector.
	   ``Doctors and health specialists are critical professions and
are directly serving the public.
	   ``As such, they are exempted from the recent Government ruling
to freeze the intake of government contract staff and to
discontinue with the existing service of contract staff, following
the economic problem.''
	   He said the ministry will also consider applications from
foreign contract doctors and specialists to renew their contracts
which are on yearly basis.
	   This is because some of them have worked in Malaysia for more
than 10 years and are willing to work in remote areas such as in
Sabah and Sarawak where local doctors are reluctant to do so.
	   Following the Cabinet`s recent approval for 47 new contract
doctors and specialists, the number of contract professionals in
government hospitals is now at 751.
	   So far, a total of 426 posts have been filled by contract
doctors and specialists from the 704 posts allocated by the Public
Services Department.
	   This makes the vacancies at the ministry for contract posts now
at 325.
	   As part of the Government`s move to overcome the shortage of
doctors in the country and to lure Malaysian doctors who are
working overseas, Chua said the conditions set by the ministry have
been relaxed.
	   For those who want to work in Malaysia, they are no longer
required to work on a permanent basis.
	   ``They are now allowed to serve on contract basis at the
government hospitals or private hospitals, after fulfilling the
three years compulsory service at government hospitals,'' the
minister said.
	   He added that flexibility is also given to doctors above 40
years old to fulfill the three-year compulsory service at the
government hospitals on a part-time basis.
	   Although he could not provide specific figures, Chua said the
trend of Malaysian doctors abroad coming back to work in the
country is encouraging.
	   For instance, he said many Malaysian doctors who have returned
from the UK, the US and Singapore are now working at government
hospitals in Penang and Johor.
	   Chua said currently only 75.8 per cent of the 8,211 posts of
medical officers (doctors and specialists) needed at the government
hospitals have been filled. About 80.1 per cent of the total
109,868 vacancies at various level within the ministry has been
filled, he added.
	   He said the ministry has also introduced various opportunities
for its existing staff to upgrade themselves such as in-house
long-distance courses.

	   JOHOR BARU, Fri. - The Road Transport Department has launched a
major operation to weed out drivers of errant taxis, buses and
other public vehicles in Johor Baru, Klang Valley and Penang.
	   RTD director general Datuk Pahamin Rajab said the department
would be especially tough with taxi drivers who refused to take
passengers, overcharged them or did not use meters.
	   ``Any taxi driver caught committing these three unpardonable
`sins' will have their Public Service Vehicle licences revoked.
	   ``The department has decided not to entertain any appeals by
these errant taxi drivers to reinstate their licences.''
	   He said a total of 800 errant taxi drivers in the Klang Valley
and 30 others in Penang had lost their PSV licences in the last two
years.
	   Pahamin said in Johor Baru there were numerous complaints
against taxi drivers many of whom still refused to use meters.
	   He said there were also many complaints of taxi drivers choosing
passengers and refusing to take short-trip passengers, especially
at the Causeway, bus station and other entry points into the city.
	   Pahamin who was speaking to reporters after meeting with driving
school operators at the State RTD office today said: ``It is time
we got our taxi drivers to measure up with the country's march
towards developed country status.
	   ``A developed society can be measured by the safety,
reliability, comfort and cleanliness of its public transport
service vehicles.''
	   Pahamin said the RTD would also launch a nationwide operation
starting on June 16, to check public vehicles especially those
running on diesel for excessive smoke emission, cleanliness and
road-worthiness.
	   ``RTD is also working on programmes to educate commuters to keep
public transport vehicles clean and also not to damage them.
	   ``There have been many complaints from public transport
operators about passengers vandalising their vehicles.''
	   Pahamin said a total of 16 driving institutes, including four in
Johor Baru had been approved by the RTD to run courses for PSV
applicants.
	   Under the new vocational curriculum for public transport and
commercial vehicle drivers it is compulsory for PSV applicants to
undergo the week- long course.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Fri. - In a move to recover outstanding assesment
rates, the Kota Kinabalu Municipal Council has decided to publish
in the local newspapers the names of defaulters.
	   KKMC president Datuk Dayang Adeline Leong urged defaulters to
pay up to avoid the embarrassment of having their names appear in
the newspaper.
	   Leong, who took over the KKMC presidency on June 1, did not
disclose the amount of the outstanding assessment, but said it was
substantial.
	   She advised those who have since changed their address to
contact Dorin Thomas by telephone at 088-214500 for their record to
be updated.

	   CIVIL servants who wish to obtain their first degree at a
university are now eligible for loans under the National Higher
Education Fund.
	   Those studying at public universities can apply for a RM6,500
loan while those who are pursuing degrees at private universities
are eligible to apply for a RM12,000 loan.
	   ``Those who wish to apply for loans can obtain application forms
straight from the corporation,'' National Higher Education Fund
Corporation chairman Husni Hanadzlah told reporters after
presenting a cheque to Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia's vice
chancellor Datuk Dr Anuwar Ali in Bangi, yesterday.
	   Second-year students pursuing first degrees at the universities
will also receive loans similar to those given to civil servants,
he said.
	   Science students in private universities such as Universiti
Tenaga Nasional, Universiti Telekom and Universiti Petronas, will
receive up to RM12,500 in loans annually while arts students are
eligible for RM12,000.
	   Arts students in public universities will receive RM6,000 in
loans annually and science students, RM6,500.
	   Last year, 9,091 university students received loans after the
fund was set up on October 1, 1997.
	   Loans are available to eligible Malaysian students at the 11
public univerisites and three private universities.
	   Asked about the repayment period, Husni said loans have to be
fully paid back within a 10-year period for arts students, while
those in the science stream have to do so within a 15-year period.
	   ``This is to ensure that it will not be a burden to borrowers
who will be just starting out in their careers,'' he said.
	   Borrowers will have to begin repaying loans six months after
being employed or not later than six months after completion of
their studies - whichever comes earlier, Husni added.

	   AMID the plunge in sales of new vehicles, dealers in Thailand
are forced to find alternative sources of income, such as
servicing, in order to survive the downturn in the Thai auto
market.
	   Gone are the days when dealerships could earn quick money
selling brand-new cars as a large number of potential customers now
opt for used cars instead. Sales of new cars have dropped by at
least 70 per cent in the first five months of this year, causing
many showrooms to down shutters.
	   ''Dealers can't expect to sell the same number of cars
anymore,'' said Chawachart Teparagul, managing director of MAS
Group Co Ltd, a Mitsubishi dealership with four showrooms.
	   According to Chawachart, the low sales figures currently
experienced by dealers are accompanied by low margins of just 3 to
4 per cent. ''That's not enough to survive, especially when sales
are down. This is a time when the market is expected to re-engineer
itself, and only the strongest will survive.'' He said that sales
which touched 200 units per month before the economic crisis, have
now dropped to 20.
	   Like other businesses, the biggest problem for car dealerships
seems to be cashflow. ''Several years ago anyone doing any type of
business was most likely involved in real estate. And as that
sector has collapsed, much of the money is stuck,'' he said.
	   What dealerships should do now, according to Chawachart, is to
closely follow the market direction and prepare for new
opportunities.
	   ''In times like this, car dealers must make sure that they have
a reputable after-sales service and must be able to show their
parent companies that they are able to carry on in order to enjoy
continuous support such as extension of their credit terms, etc.''
He said that many dealers are suffering from high interest on loans
for expansions. However, help does not come easy. ''At the moment,
dealers like Mitsubishi are getting very little help from the
mother company. We just have to solve our own problems first,'' he
said.
	   Chawachart says that his company has a strong after-sales
service team, and that is an advantage. ''Dealers with good
after-sales service are attractive to the Big Three companies
coming to Thailand. The only problem is that at the moment it is
not practical to open up a new dealership as sales stay low.
However, if we can maintain the quality of after-sales service, we
will be ready for new opportunities when the economy picks up.''
''Efficient after-sales service also results in high customer
loyalty, and at MAS it's as high as 80 per cent,'' he said. ''It's
not that we are trying to earn more money from after-sales, but by
providing good services we will be able to gain the trust of our
clients.'' Personnel development is also a key factor for the
future, Chawachart says. ''In order to run a successful business,
you must also have efficient and organised personnel with a sense
of belonging.'' Apart from giving large discounts through campaigns
and customer cards, MAS is also relying on a its new after-sales
service system designed to enhance customer satisfaction.
	   At MAS, a senior technical team is stationed at the front desk,
instead of the garage, to make sure that the car's problem is
defined and cured so that the customer does not return with the
same problem.
	   Customers also have the option to choose if they want a part
replaced or repaired. ''There are sometimes advantages in replacing
rather than repairing a particular component or vice versa, and we
have to clarify these to the customer,'' he said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie fired
Indonesia's attorney general on Monday, putting a new man in charge
of the probe into alleged corruption during former President
Suharto's 32-year regime.
	   Habibie replaced Soedjono Atmonegoro, an old Suharto appointee,
with Maj. Gen. Andi Muhammad Galib, the head of the military's law
office. The government offered no reason for the change.
	   However, Soedjono's departure comes amid growing demands that
Suharto himself be investigated for alleged wrongdoing.
	   Earlier this month, Soedjono announced that he had launched a
broad inquiry into state corruption, but he made it clear that
investigators were not directly targeting Suharto and his family.
	   Critics claim the Suharto family abused its position to amass
billions of dollars and build business empires.
	   Over the weekend, a legal adviser to Suharto said the former
president denies any wrongdoing and that accusations that he had
made a fortune were not true.
	   Habibie, Suharto's longtime friend and his former vice
president, has indicated that he won't intercede to help the
ex-autocrat fend off lawfully made allegations.
	   Since Suharto quit last month, student protesters and democracy
activists have gathered outside the attorney general's office
daily, demanding a full investigation.
	   On Monday, hundreds of East Timorese students demonstrated in
the territory's capital of Dili to press for a vote on independence
from Indonesian control.

	   AS privatisation looms, employees of the Telephone Organisation
of Thailand (TOT) and the Communications Authority of Thailand
(CAT) have started to air their concerns on welfare, salary payment
and job security.
	   But what the managements of the two agencies are expecting,
though, is that their staffs should be preparing to compete with
stronger carriers from abroad, not just Thai companies.
	   The employees let their feelings be known in the second seminar
held by the two agencies in Bangkok. The meeting, attended by 3,000
TOT and CAT employees at a military base in Bangkok, was organised
to ensure the staffs fully understand the organisational changes
that will occur after privatisation.
	   The function was presided over by Transport and Communications
Minister Suthep Thaugsuban and included TOT chairman Mechai
Viravaidya. CAT chairman Dr Srisook Chantrangsu was absent.
	   ''Will our jobs be secure in the future? For me, I think
privatisation is driven by the course of current affairs rather
than need,'' Prakai Ratanamanee, a middle-age TOT employee, said.
	   ''Could you promise that we will not laid off,'' a CAT officer
queried.
	   ''How about our health care expenses and the loan allowances?
Will [the rates] increase. The loan [rate] for the TOT has already
risen by two per cent so far,'' another CAT staff member said.
	   ''Where will the proceeds from selling our organisation go. Will
any portion come back to the employees?'' a TOT employee said.
	   Such questions may sound repetitive, but still received applause
from the audience. Many of those who stood up to question the
management were sensitive about the forthcoming changes.
	   Wattana Iambamrung, a workers' representative, noted that most
of the employees of the two agencies are worried about being
laid-off and that they could not compare themselves to politicians.
	   ''Politicians never fear being unemployed because they can run
again in a new election and make a comeback. However, many
middle-age staff of the two state agencies will find it hard to
find new employment,'' Wattana said.
	   Minister Suthep said no employees of the two agencies, who
number about 50,000, will be made redundant following the
privatisation, except those found to be inefficient.
	   ''Changes are needed and we will change for the better,'' Suthep
said.
	   The minister almost took control of the question and answer
session with TOT management having little chance to take the stage.
He continued to make commitments until a staff officer questioned
his motive.
	   ''Are you trying to win popularity using this stage?'' he asked.
	   TOT executives also complained about Suthep's performance. They
said Suthep was too shallow to answer the questions and he was
probably trying to stage a political campaign before the state
employees.
	   ''He could not explain things in detail as he did not know them.
What he said would make the employees more uncertain about their
future,'' a TOT senior executive said.
	   The TOT and CAT have each budgetted Bt5 million for the series
of 13 seminars in major provinces around the country. They expect
to meet about 16,000 TOT and CAT employees.
	   For the south, the seminars will be held in three venues -- more
than any other provincial region. Suthep, an MP from Surat Thani,
said he would attend every seminar until the series ends on Aug 28.

	   KOTA BARU, Fri. - A double-storey house in Jalan Pengkalan Chepa
was damaged in a fire at 9.45am today. It is believed that the
owner and his family had moved to a new house in Bachok about a
week ago. A spokesman for the Fire and Rescue Department said seven
firemen managed to put out the blaze in five minutes. ``The firemen
managed to prevent the fire from spreading to the other houses in
the area,'' he added. He said the cause of the fire and losses have
yet to be ascertained.

	   EDEN Enterprises (M) Bhd's property and resort development is
not expected to contribute significantly to the group's earnings
for the financial year ending December 31 1998, given the current
slowdown in the industry.
	   The main contributions for this year are expected to come from
its food and beverages and restaurant business.
	   The group has nine restaurant nationwide.
	   They are Eden Seafood Village (Selangor) Sdn Bhd, Eden Village
Sdn Bhd, Eden-Good Food People Sdn Bhd, Eden Airport Restaurant Sdn
Bhd, Eden Seafood Village Sdn Bhd, Eden Seafood Village (Langkawi)
Sdn Bhd, Eden Restaurant Sdn Bhd and Eden Floating Palace Sdn Bhd,
operated by its subsidiaries.
	   Reviewing the group's operations last year, chairman Datuk Chuan
Wooi Cheng says its hotel, Eden Garden Hotel, started operations
last December.
	   Eden Floating Palace, previously located at the Bagan Dalam
shipyard in Butterworth, has been towed to its permanent location
at Zon Johor Baru.
	   Eden posted a group pre-tax profit of RM7.99 million for the
financial year ended December 31 1997. This was a 47.7 per cent
decline from RM15.35 million the previous year.
	   Turnover increased 3.3 per cent to RM74.07 million from RM71.74
million.
	   Profit after tax was RM4.72 million compared with RM11.22
million before, while earnings per share was 11.81 sen against
31.05 sen previously. No dividend has been recommended.

Mighty Ducks coach fired
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Pierre Page was fired on Monday as
coach of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, only 10 months after he was
hired.
	   The Mighty Ducks had a record of 26-43-13 last season and were
eliminated in the first round of the National Hockey League
playoffs. Page was hired in August to replace Ron Wilson, who also
was fired.
	   ``This decision was something I really agonized over,'' said
general manager Jack Ferreira. ``I thought we were on the same
page, but I find out the same issues are here again.''
	   Ferreira would not specify what those issues were. He just said
he and the coach disagreed about the team's direction.
	   Ferreira and Page go back several years. They worked together in
Calgary and Ferreira gave Page his first NHL head coaching job with
the then Minnesota North Stars from 1988-90.
	   The 50-year-old Page was not at the news conference at Anaheim
Arena announcing his dismissal. Ferreira said he notified him of
his decision this morning.
	   ``He was down and emotional about it,'' Ferreira said.
	   The Ducks did not set a timetable for selecting a new coach, but
Ferreira said a search would start immediately. The team was
plagued by injuries this season top player Paul Kariya, who was out
for the season after a concussion Feb. 1.

	   WHEN staff of Pan Pacific Glenmarie visited the Seri Setia Old
Folk's Home recently, they not only brought goodies and gift but
also friendship and good cheer.
	   The visit was in conjunction with the recent Mother's and and
Father's Days celebrations.
	   The hotel's public relation assistant manager Low Mei May said
the hotel contributed RM2,000 worth of foodstuff to the home.
	   ``It is always nice to take time off and spend time with these
old folk,''
	   she said.
	   ``They have no children or relatives to visit them. We feel that
it is our social obligation to spend some time with them and at the
same time bring them joy.''
	   She said the old folk were excited about the visit.
	   The home's vice-chairman Datuk Lim Bock Seng said with the
economic problems, most the private companies had stopped giving
donations.
	   He said another house was being constructed just in front of the
home.
	   ``We have spent RM1.8 million on the house but we are short of
RM600,000.
	   The project will be completed in four months' time,'' he said.
	   ``At the moment, we have 24 residents in the home but after the
construction, we can take in more than 100.''
	   He hoped the public will come forward and give donations in cash
or kind.
	   The hotel staff held a cake-cutting ceremony, distributed
goodies and entertained the old folk.
	   Also present was PJ Selatan MP Donald Lim.

	   IN April 1998, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) comprising 29 economies, including all current
members of the EU, announced their support for a voluntary approach
to corporate governance with government regulation limited
principally to providing a framework for investor protection and
disclosure of information.
	   The OECD report on ''Corporate Government -- Improving
Competitiveness and Access to Capital in Global Markets'' is the
crucial tool for Thai executives and regulators to restore the
confidence to the financial and real sectors.
	   Amid the vulnerable economic conditions, every Thai company with
limited options, has to follow a trend of looking at governance
principles from an international, rather than a country
perspective. The Thai government must emphasise promoting private
sector development, rather than attempting to regulate it. Listed
below are key principles and guidance for consideration:
	   1) Flexibility: Policy-makers and regulators should be sensitive
to companies and state enterprises' need for flexibility in
responding to the changing competitive environment and the related
need for flexible, adaptive governance structures.
	   2) Regulatory impact: Policy-makers and regulators should
consider the impact of any proposed regulatory initiative on the
ability of the corporate sector to respond to the competitive
market environment. They should avoid those regulations that
threaten to unduly interfere with market mechanisms.
	   3) Regulatory focus: Regulatory intervention in the area of
corporate governance is likely to be most effective if limited to:
- Fairness: Ensuring the protection of shareholder rights and the
enforceability of contracts with resource providers.
	   - Transparency: Requiring timely disclosure of adequate
information concerning corporate financial performance.
	   - Accountability: Clarifying governance roles and
responsibilities, and supporting voluntary efforts to ensure the
alignment of managerial and shareholders' interests with the board
of directors and audit committee comprising independent members.
	   - Responsibility: Ensuring corporate compliance with applicable
laws/regulations that reflect the perspective of society's value.
	   4) Clarity, consistency and enforceability: Policy-makers should
provide clear, consistent and enforceable securities and capital
market regulations designed to protect shareholder rights and
create legal systems capable of enforcing such regulations.
	   5) Litigation abuse: Regulations should be designed to protect
against litigation abuse. This can be accomplished through the use
of tests for the sufficiency of shareholder complaints and the
provision of safeguard for management and director actions.
	   6) Corruption and bribery: Policy-makers and regulators should
ensure the corporations function in an environment that is free
from corruption and bribery.
	   7) Regulatory impact on active investors: Policy-makers should
review whether their securities, tax and other regulations unduly
hinder active investors, and whether their regulations concerning
institutional investors inappropriately inhibit them from
participating as active investors.
	   Voluntary aspects of effective corporate governance can be
summarised as follows: - Accurate, timely disclosure; - Consistent,
comparable disclosure; - Ownership disclosure; - Disclosure
improvement; - Corporate governance legal standards; - Shareholder
protection; - Independent corporate boards; - Sound audit
practices; - Investor competition; - Law-abiding corporations; -
Individual welfare; - Income and opportunity divergence; and -
voluntary self-improvement.
	   It is evident that good corporate governance is a key element in
corporate competitiveness and access to capital. The focal point of
corporate governance is the board of directors as a mechanism to
represent shareholder interest, prevent conflicts of interest,
monitor managerial performance and balance competing demands on the
corporation. For the board to play this role in a meaningful way,
it needs to be objective, ethical and capable of acting
independently of management.
	   In addition, an effective corporate governance is an intrinsic
prerequisite structure and practice for any company in pursuit of
intrinsic share-value building, high dividend and good capital
gain.

	   THEY want to remember it well before the landmark Merdeka
Stadium in Jalan Stadium, Kuala Lumpur is demolished after the
Commonwealth Games in September.
	   So in conjunction with its 13th annual school sports meet,
Sekolah Seri Suria (formerly Sekolah Sang Suria) in Hulu Langat
decided to hold the event at the stadium last Sunday.
	   The stadium will be demolished along with Stadium Negara and the
adjacent Changkat Pavillion. In their place will be a world
convention centre, a five-star hotel and apartments.
	   The developers are United Engineers (M) Berhad, who has been
given a piece of premium land along Jalan Hang Jebat and Jalan
Stadium on which these structures stand, in exchange for building
the Bukit Jalil Sports Complex where the Commonwealth Games will be
held.
	   Junior school principal M. Manogharan said for 12 years the
school's sports meet had been held at the school compound but this
year the venue was changed to Stadium Merdeka.
	   ``We want to be part of the history. It is important for the
children, who have been with the school since they were in
kindegarten. Some are now in Form Five,'' she said.
	   She said with the idea in mind, this year's school meet was
given the theme ``Merdeka Lap 98''.
	   She added that with the co-operation of Sukom Ninety Eight
Berhad, the XVI Commonwealth Games was promoted during the sports
event.
	   The school sports meet was launched by Selangor Executive
Councillor Datuk Zainal Abidin Ahmad, who is also the Dusun Tua
State Assemblyman.
	   Also present were Sukom Ninety Eight chief operating officer
Lt-Gen (Rtd) Datuk Seri Abdul Manap Ibrahim and Event Ventures Sdn
Bhd chairman Aziz Tan Sri Bahaman and general manager Ng Yee Hing.
	   EVSB senior operations manager Esther Yong said in conjunction
with the historic event, Sekolah Seri Suria would be purchasing 250
tickets to the Sukom '98 opening in September which will be donated
to seven orphanages in the Klang Valley.
	   The seven homes are Rumah Sayangan and Rumah Kanak-Kanak Tengku
Budriah in Cheras, Rumah Keluarga Kami and Desa Amal Jireh in
Kajang, Rumah Charis and Persatuan Pure Life in Puchong and Rumah
Ozanam SVP in Petaling Jaya.
	   She said the school had come up with RM4,200 and the cheque was
presented to Abdul Manap during the school meet at Stadium Merdeka.
	   Yong said it was part of the school's effort in promoting the
Commonwealth Games.

	   MAXXAM Analytics (Thailand) Co Ltd, which provides analytical
laboratory services for the environment, is expanding in Thailand
as demand grows.
	   With increasing concerns and strict regulations on environmental
issues, as well as a limitation on domestic analytical technology
and services, the firm expects to become a leading player in
analytical services in Thailand. It plans to make its Thai facility
a centre in Asean, general manager Dr Verchart Chaicumpa said.
	   The firm plans to provide high standard laboratory services in
Bangkok which would work in conjunction with environmental and
engineering experts abroad.
	   The services would cover water, air, raw materials, food,
livestock and food products used for exports. The company will
target export-oriented food processing industries, hotels and
high-rise buildings as its major clients.
	   Potential clients will be reached by technical support teams
dispatched to provide technical solutions on the spot, Verachart
said.
	   He said the firm would play a big role in the nation's bid to
turn its economy around by assisting the food and farm products
export industry to match the standards demanded by importing
countries.
	   The company's scientists, trained in Canada which is considered
very advanced in analytical technology, would apply their latest
knowhow and techniques at the Bangkok laboratory, Verachart said.

	   FINDING a solution to current social problems faced by youths
and effectively promoting an ideal family life were among the
issues discussed at a seminar organised by the Women for World
Peace organisation in Malacca recently.
	   Apart from addressing issues prevailing in modern society, it
also served to pinpoint approaches to building ideal, happy
families.
	   The seminar themed The Role of the Family in the Next Millennium
was opened by Minister of National Unity and Social Development
Datin Paduka Zaleha Ismail at the Pan Pacific Legacy Hotel.
	   It was earlier held in Selangor, Penang, Johor, Perak, Pahang
and Kuching.
	   Organising chairman Kian Sit Har, who is also Malacca Wanita MCA
chief, said juvenile delinquency was both startling and worrisome,
as suggested by the figures. A total of 28,623 children were
involved in various forms of crime from 1990 to 1996.
	   According to statistics from the Ministry of National Solidarity
and Social Development, 3,632 delinquent juveniles had been
assigned to eight centres for rehabilitation to date.
	   Universiti Malaya (UM) cultural centre director Prof Dr Rahmah
Bujang, Associate Professor Dr Oo Yu Hock of UM faculty of
economics and administration, Rima College principal Sudesh
Balasubramaniam and WFWP International senior adviser Dr Yoo Chong
Young were among the presenters.

Nigerian junta frees nine prominent political prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout for AMs, ADDS background on Abacha,
Abubakar. TRIMS. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Reaching out to Nigeria's opposition
movement and to its legion of foreign critics, the country's new
military leader on Monday ordered the immediate release of nine of
the country's most prominent political prisoners.
	   The move came exactly a week after the heart attack death of
Gen. Sani Abacha, whose treatment of dissidents during his
five-year-dictatorship left Nigeria an international pariah.
	   The decision sent a clear signal to the opposition that Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, the career military officer who succeeded
Abacha a few hours after his death, wished to distance himself from
his predecessor.
	   The prisoners ordered freed include such well-known figures as
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979
and Beko Ransome-Kuti, a pro-democracy activist jailed since 1995.
	   But Nigeria's best-known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not on the list.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the immediate release of some detainees
and prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation
and reconstruction,'' David Atta, Abubakar's press secretary, said
in a statement. He added that other prisoners ``would be given
consideration from time.''
	   The prisoners were being held in far-flung jails across this
sprawling, poverty-stricken West African country and it was not
immediately clear exactly when they would return home.
	   In releasing the prisoners, the new military leader urged those
granted amnesty to ``cooperate'' with the government to create
``the country of our dreams.''
	   Abubakar also appealed to the international community to
appreciate the regime's efforts ``at solving our problems and show
greater understanding and sensitivity to our internal affairs.''
	   Abacha's treatment of Nigeria's dissidents, particularly the
1995 execution of author and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa,
isolated his country. While still able to sell its oil, Nigeria's
leaders were not even able to get visas to many Western countries.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, an attorney and one of Nigeria's most vocal
critics of military rule praised the move as a ``joyous step
towards reconciliation.''
	   ``This is incredible. This is fantastic,'' said Fawehinmi.
``This gives us hope that something good will begin to happen
soon.''
	   He noted, however, that dozens of political prisoners remain
behind bars.
	   ``They must go further and release all detainees and all
prisoners still in the gulag,'' he said.
	   Moves made by Abubakar's nascent regime have been closely
scrutinized by Nigeria's opposition as well as other nations. He
had already managed to anger the opposition by making only a vague
pledge to follow through on Abacha's highly flawed political
transition program, which is to culminate in an Oct. 1 transition
to civilian rule. His regime also quickly moved to quash
pro-democracy protests during last week's anniversary of the
annulled elections Abiola is believed to have won.
	   But he had also reportedly met with one of Abiola's wives. In
addition, those arrested during the pro-democracy protests were
quickly released, a significant change from the days of Abacha,
when prisoners could disappear for years at a time.
	   The prisoners to be freed were:
	   _ Obasanjo, who has been serving a 15-year treason sentence
since his arrest in 1995, voluntarily relinquished the presidency
after an election and went on to become a formidable critic of
Abacha's regime. He was released on compassionate grounds and will
be confined to his farm near Lagos at first.
	   _ Ransome-Kuti, a doctor, brother of the late Afrobeat music
star Fela, was convicted of being an ``accessory after the fact to
treason'' and was serving a 15-year sentence. He was ordered freed
for health reasons.
	   _ Frank Kokori and Milton Dabibi, leaders of Nigeria's Oil
Workers Union. They have been held in detention since a three-month
oil workers' strike he led in 1994. No charges were filed against
them.
	   _ Ibrahim Dasuki, the deposed sultan of the town of Sokoto and
an Islamic leader. He has been held without charges since 1996.
	   _ Bola Ige, a former state governor, was imprisoned without
charges after violent anti-Abacha riots May 1 in the city of
Kaduna.
	   _ Chris Ayanwu, editor in chief of Quest, an independent
magazine that was frequently critical of the Abacha regime. She has
been held since 1995.
	   _ Olabintan Durojaiye, a lawyer and critic of the Abacha regime.
He has been held since last year. No charges were filed against
him.
	   _ Uwen Udo, a pro-democracy politician, detained since 1997. No
charges have been filed against him.

	   THE Sepang District Council is beautifying Bandar Baru Salak
Tinggi in time for the opening of Kuala Lumpur International
Airport next month and the Commonwealth Games in September.
	   Salak Tinggi is on the doorstep of KLIA and is, therefore, the
first town that will be visited by foreigners coming out from the
international airport. It also provides logistical services to
KLIA.
	   Council secretary Abdul Hamid Hussein said the council was all
set for the opening of the international airport.
	   It has carried out landscaping work on all major roads leading
to the KLIA and the border with Bandar Baru Nilai in Negri
Sembilan.
	   He said the council had received RM50,000 from the Landscaping
Department to beautify major roads in Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi for
the Commonwealth Games.
	   The council has also built a new hawker centre to house petty
traders.
	   He said another RM200,000 was allocated by the Selangor
Government to beautify Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi town centre.
	   ``The beautification programme includes decorating the township
with colour bulbs, improving the drainage system and public
toilets,'' he said.
	   ``The council also has intensive plans to improve the landscape
and cleanliness in Salak Tinggi and areas outside the KLIA under
its jurisdiction.''
	   He said the council had also worked together with the Malaysian
Airport Berhad to determine revenue that would be collected from
holdings inside the airport area.
	   He said as Malaysia Airport will be responsible for the town
services in the airport, the council needed to work out a formula
on the assessment rates to be charged when the airport was fully
operational.
	   Among the commercial units in the airport are shops, hotels,
restaurants, cafeterias, carpark complexes, petrol stations and
many others.

	   PARIS -- The yen is crumbling. The conventional wisdom is that
if it is to crash to YEN 160 against the US dollar, the Chinese
yuan won't stand and the Hong Kong dollar peg will also go. If that
happens, what will be the justifiable value of the baht, which is
now fluctuating between Bt43-Bt44 to the US dollar?
	   A view from Europe is that wilting Asia is facing tough luck.
There is no end in sight to the foreign exchange crisis. But the
European experience in striving for a monetary union might be
useful. Jean-Paul Fitoussi, a well-known French economist and head
of a think-tank, believes that a single Europe will be better off
after it formally adopts the euro at the beginning of 1999 for it
will transform the region into a powerful economic continent.
	   More importantly, by transferring the monetary policy to the
European central bank, European Union member countries will have
less burden, at least on the monetary side, since with the adoption
of the euro, they will not have to be in the business of defending
their currencies like before, Fitoussi says. The European Union
members then can focus more on managing their individual fiscal
policy, which, however, will have to be kept within the broad
criteria framework.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda is almost at his wit's
end over the baht crisis. He has repeatedly come out to talk about
stability, although the baht, floated on July 2 last year, has yet
to find its equilibrium. The appropriate value of the baht, he
says, is defined as a level that boosts the competitiveness of Thai
exports and attracts foreign capital back to Thailand. ''Efforts to
stabilise the baht mean that it should not be too strong nor too
weak. If it's too strong, it will hurt exports. If it's too weak,
it will affect interest rates and lead to capital outflow,'' he
says.
	   Yet so far the baht, which managed to range between Bt38-Bt39/US
dollar over the past two or three months before slipping back to
Bt43 over the past two weeks, is holding some ground because of the
high interest rate policy. The burden or the cost of the monetary
policy is so enormous that it is swiftly killing the real sector or
domestic businesses.
	   Economic growth has been revised to a negative 6 per cent as a
result of the high cost of borrowings. Elsewhere in the region
interest rates have also been kept sky-high to prevent the
currencies from running away.
	   Even countries with sound macro-economic fundamentals -- like
Singapore for instance -- are not immune to the external shocks.
Fitoussi says the European monetary model might be suitable for an
Asia looking for more currency stability. For individual small and
vulnerable economies, maintaining a floating foreign exchange
regime is no answer to achieving macro-economic stability because
the movements in the globalisation of the financial markets,
equally beneficial and destructive, are so unpredictable.
	   Fitoussi says looking into the future there will be very small
room for mistakes a country can afford to make otherwise it stands
to face a financial crisis.
	   While the European economies have reverted to a fixed exchange
rate, the Asian economies have taken a leap of faith into the
floated currency regime. Bank of America's latest research report
(June 1998) on ''EMU: An Asian Perspective'' indicates that it may
be worthwhile for the Asian economies to consider the European
Monetary Union-type arrangement at some stage.
	   ''This is so despite the disruption caused by the Asian forex
crisis,'' the report says. ''Countries in question may include core
Asean economies and those of Greater China -- the People's Republic
of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
	   ''It remains important to differentiate between the likelihood
of significant divergences in the paths of some Asian economies
following the forex crisis and their sound longer-term prospects.
	   ''If anything, imposition of IMF programmes in three Asean
economies, and the process of consolidation in the banking and
financial sectors of Asian countries such as the People's Republic
of China will benefit any future development towards increased
monetary cooperation and coordination.'' In the meantime, Europe
will be relatively immune to the Asia flu because of the fact that
the region is largely driven by domestic-led growth. Fitoussi says
there is a 2 per cent surplus in external trade of gross domestic
product of Western European economies. This means that European
companies won't over-burden themselves with debts for business
expansion but will rely largely on their accumulated earnings.
France, Germany and Italy are also expanding at 2 to 3 per cent in
1998 and 1999. Inflation is also low, 1 per cent in France and 1.4
per cent in 11 other European economies.
	   ''During the past four years, the French business sector has
enjoyed a net creditor position. This has enabled them to prosper.
But it can also be explained by the sound monetary policy in the
past,'' Fitoussi says.

the weakness of the yen.
	   The ringgit hovered within a narrow band of between 4.00 and
4.05 to the US dollar yesterday.
	   It also eased against the Singapore dollar at 2.2993/309 from

	   MALAYSIAN researchers and scientists should be aware of new
discoveries so that they can help industries in the country benefit
from the developments and innovations, International Trade and
Industry Minister Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz said yesterday.
	   Equally important, she said, is the need for Malaysian
researchers and scientists to be integral parts of the global
pioneering research community.
	   They can spearhead efforts in Malaysia to develop new materials
and composites using raw materials available locally and in the
long run, to enable the new materials to replace naturally
depleting available substances.
	   ``As Malaysia moves forward in the process of industrialisation,
the various industrial sectors will need to sensitise to the
on-going developments in technology and processes, and to the
breakthroughs in discoveries of new materials that can complement,
enhance or replace existing materials, in particular the naturally
occuring materials.
	   ``As industries seek for higher levels of efficiency in
production processes and in product performance, the search for new
and advanced materials will become more intensified, and obsolence
will set in much faster with each new discovery,'' she said at the
opening of the Advanced Materials Characterisation Allied
Laboratories (Amcal) and seminar on ``New Materials in High Tech
Industries'' in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   She said innovative effort should be focused on areas in which
Malaysia has already developed competitiveness and where the
application of new materials will be more widespread and their
commercial production viable.
	   The Government, she added, supports efforts to commercialise
Research and Development results such as in the area of new
materials.
	   ``Under the Commercialisation of Research and Development Fund,
operationalised by the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation
(MTDC), grants of between 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the cost of
undertaking the commercialisation of Research and Development
effort can be considered.
	   ``The activities eligible for such grants include market and
feasibility studies, design and development of the product or
processes, and standards conformance and certification and
Intellectual Property Registration,'' she said.
	   Rafidah said to further encourage the development of high-tech
industries, including those in new and advanced materials, the
Government offers special incentives, both fiscal and non-fiscal.
	   ``High-tech companies - engaged in the production of promoted
products in the areas of new and emerging technologies - are
eligible for either the Pioneer Status incentive with full tax
exemption at statutory income level for a period of five years, or
Investment Tax Allowance of 60 per cent on qualifying capital
expenditure incurred within a period of five years.
	   ``This allowance can be offset against the statutory income for
each assessment year without any restriction,'' Rafidah explained.
	   Meanwhile, non-fiscal incentives offered include flexibility in
the employment of foreign scientists and technical experts and the
approval to open foreign exchange accounts.
	   Rafidah said in the advanced material industry, several product
sectors have been identified that can merit consideration of
incentives such as in the application and production of polymers or
biopolymers, specialty polymer materials, artificial organs,
superconductors and fine or advanced ceramics.
	   ``To accelerate the process of technology acquisition and to
benefit from particular expertise and established marketing
network, Malaysian companies can establish joint ventures with
foreign partners involved in the new materials industry,'' she
urged.
	   Between 1994 to April 1998, 22 projects were approved by the
ministry with the high technology incentives, in which total
capital investments was RM20.18 billion with 81.9 per cent being
foreign investments.
	   Meanwhile, 58.5 per cent of the total investments were in the
electrical and electronics sector, 25.6 per cent in the fabricated
metal products sector and 9.9 per cent in the transport equipment
sector.
	   On Amcal, Rafidah urged high tech companies in the country to
establish linkage with Amcal in order to effectively utilise the
facilities and expertise available.
	   ``Amcal, on its part, must undertake aggressive marketing
efforts to reach out to the relevant industry sectors. In this
context, Amcal could participate, together with the ministry and
its agencies in the various promotional campaigns domestically,
using Miti's network to disseminate information about Amcal,'' she
said.
	   ``Amcal is an example whereby the university has already
established a pool of expertise in the area of Research and
Development, testing, calibaration and various areas of analysis
which will be relevant to industry and economy at large.
	   ``Given that there is already a pool of expertise and that
universities have already been approved by the Government to allow
their consultancy staff be compensated based on the jobs they do
for industries, therefore, there is already a mechanism to allow
universities to benefit commercially from the expertise in this
area,'' she said.
	   Rafidah added that what is important now is for Amcal to market
this - to let industry and everybody relevant know what is
available - what machines they have, what is the capacity, what can
they do for the industries.
	   ``Once they market this, then Amcal can become a catalyst for
the upgrading within industries,'' she said.

Eizenstat, Arafat meet to discuss peace process, economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart
Eizenstat said after meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Monday that he hoped the stalled Mideast peace process would not
continue to harm the struggling Palestinian economy.
	   Eizenstat has spent two days in the region meeting with Israel
and Palestinian officials to discuss the impact of the 15-month
impasse on their economies.
	   ``I realize that we cannot isolate the economic issue and the
political issue but while there are difficulties on the political
side, we hope that the economic side will move fast,'' Eizenstat
told reporters after a 90 minute meeting with Arafat.
	   The United States has suggested a proposal to restart peace
talks frozen last year after Israel began construction of a Jewish
housing project on a disputed hilltop in east Jerusalem where the
Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a future state. The
Palestinians have accepted the plan, but Israel has not.
	   ``The peace process now is at a real impasse because until now
there is no response from the Israeli government to the American
initiative,'' Arafat said.
	   Eizenstat pledged continued American efforts to find solutions
to the Israeli-Arab conflict.
	   Sunday, Eizenstat announced American plans to organize a
conference to collect billions of dollars in aid for the
Palestinian Authority.

Spanish police say English soccer fans not as bad as reported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAGALLUF, Spain (AP) _ Dozens English soccer fans poured into
the streets of this resort town shouting and singing following
their country's World Cup victory on Monday. Police were called to
the scene, and the crowd dispersed peacefully.
	   After watching England beat Tunisia 2-0 in the bars, about 100
joyful fans rushed outside. Some residents got worried, but no
incidents were reported, a police spokesman said.
	   While English tourists were celebrating on the holiday island of
Mallorca off Spain's eastern coast, more hardened fans and French
police fought running battles in Marseilles.
	   Mallorca is also a particularly popular destination for German
tourists who ``also get happy when their (soccer) team wins and
take to the streets'' the spokesman said.
	   ``Our (the Spanish) team tends to lose, so we just stay home and
get depressed'' he added in reference to Spain's 3-2 defeat by
Nigeria Saturday.

World Cup: Klinsmann strikes again as Germany wins 2-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Juergen Klinsmann maintained his amazing World Cup
first round scoring record Monday with a goal in Germany's 2-0
victory over the United States.
	   Klinsmann, who scored four times in Germany's three opening
round games in the U.S. four years ago and twice in 1990 group
matches, was fast off the mark again at the Parc des Princes.
	   He fired home in the 65th minute after Andy Moeller's ninth
minute header had given the Germans an early lead and that means he
has scored in six of Germany's last seven first round games.
	   The Americans, playing their third World Cup in a row, were
exposed in the air by the well-organized three-time champions who
were rarely threatened at the back and created three clear chances
in the opening half.
	   American goalkeeper Kasey Keller came into the World Cup after
four shutouts but that run ended early.
	   The Germans almost went ahead in the fourth minute when Oliver
Bierhoff climbed to meet a right-wing corner with a powerful header
but the ball was blocked just short of the line by Claudio Reyna.
	   But they hit the target in the ninth when Olaf Thon swung over a
corner from the left, Juergen Klinsmann got above two American
defenders to head into the danger area and Moeller nodded the ball
home from six meters past the slow-reacting defender Mike Burns and
in off the right hand post.
	   Bierhoff should have added a second in the 22nd minute when he
controlled a cross from the right despite the attention of Eddie
Pope, who was grabbing his shirt. But the striker, newly acquired
by AC Milan, shot wide of the goal from no more than six meters.
	   The Americans did little to worry German goalkeeper Andreas
Koepke but Chad Deering unleashed a well-struck shot from 25 meters
in the 30th minute which the Olympique Marseille 'keeper held
confidently.
	   The Americans sent on Frankie Hejduk for Burns for the second
half and, after he received a yellow card for a foul, he almost
leveled in the 53rd minute with a close range header from a David
Regis cross. Keeper Koepke reacted well to save at the foot of the
post and concede a corner.
	   But Klinsmann went close to increasing the German lead in the
60th minute when Juergen Kohler got down the left to deliver a low
cross and the veteran striker prodded the ball just wide of the
near post.
	   But Klinsmann, who scored five times in the last World Cup in
1994, hit the target in the 65th. Bierhoff broke down the right and
measured a well-struck cross onto his co-striker's chest. Klinsmann
shrugged off defender Thomas Dooley and volleyed the ball home from
12 meters.
	   Substitute Tab Ramos, who replaced Chad Deering 20 minutes from
the end, fired a low, long-range shot that flashed past Koepke's
post.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Olaf Thon; Juergen Kohler, Christian
Woerns; Stefan Reuter (Christian Ziege, 69th), Joerg Heinrich, Jens
Jeremies, Thomas Haessler (Dietmar Hamann, 50th), Andreas Moeller
(Markus Babbel, 90th); Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   United States _ Kasey Keller; Thomas Dooley, Eddie Pope, David
Regis; Chad Deering (Tab Ramos, 70th), Brian Maisonneuve, Mike
Burns (Frankie Hejduk, 46th), Cobi Jones, Claudio Reyna, Ernie
Stewart; Eric Wynalda (Roy Wegerle, 65th).
	   Referee _ Said Belqola, Morocco.

	   WHAT can be more irritating than to have customer service
assistants pestering shoppers to buy their products.
	   However, with the launch of Clinique's service centre in Parkson
Grand in Suria KLCC, customers can now shop with ease, minus the
annoying ``hounding''.
	   ``The Clinique service centre promotes a more informal way of
shopping and getting the best value for money,'' said Clinique
brand manager Sue Ong.
	   ``It is designed to accomodate individual needs and purchasing
style of our customers.''
	   She said customers were free to move about and try the products
using the testers available but Clinique consultants would be
readily available if they ever needed help.
	   The service centre give customers the chance to explore and
experiment.
	   Customers can play with the make-up collection. They can sample
the lipsticks and try on the eye shades.
	   The counter is equipped with cotton buds, cotton pads and
tissues that customers can use to sample the make-up.
	   It also has information that customers can take into account
before trying out the testers, for example, to pick a product that
suits a particular skin type.
	   ``However, if customers need any help on product selection,
make-up application or on the products available, Clinique
consultants will be on hand to answer all questions,'' she said.
	   ``We feel individual attention is also important as it is more
informative and our customers will be in the hands of our
experienced consultants.''
	   Ong said Clinique currently operated about 30 over-the-counter
centres in Malaysia.
	   She hopes that more customers will be encouraged to make use of
the service centre with the ``Touch and Discover'' concept offered
at the Suria KLCC.

	   BOOKER Cash and Carry (M) Sdn Bhd, operating on a ``trade-only''
business concept, has set aside RM300 million for investment as
part of its five- year expansion plan.
	   Managing director David Boner said the investment includes its
proposed warehouses in Johor, Malacca and Pahang.
	   At present, he said, Booker which sells products directly to
small traders and not end-consumers, operates only in Johor Baru.
It is likely to open a new branch in Batu Pahat next month.
	   Small traders need to be Booker members to avail of the firm's
facilities, but Boner said, ``unlike other stores, our membership
is free and this gives us an added advantage.''
	   He was speaking at a press conference in Johor Baru on Wednesday
to announce the official opening of the Booker Cash and Carry depot
in Johor Baru. Johor Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman opened
Booker's depot yesterday.
	   ``We expect to spend some RM125 million on the proposed
construction of warehouses in Malacca and Pahang,'' he said.
	   Boner said the company, which started operations in 1996, plans
to develop a network of 20 to 25 depots throughout the country.
	   Booker's grocery wholesale warehouses serve the needs of traders
and do not welcome end-consumers into their trading premises.
	   ``We cannot compromise on our concept because we want to focus
on efforts to serve only a select group of target customers,'' he
said.
	   Boner said the booming small trading and catering services in
the country inspired the company to expand its network.
	   ``We are here to assist small traders and caterers in improving
their businesses in the face of changing customer needs and
ever-increasing competitive pressures,'' he said.
	   Booker promises a new lease of life for small and independent
traders to counter the increasing retailing presence of hypermarket
and supermarket chains.
	   Booker Malaysia, opened its first trade-only grocery warehouse
in the country for business in Johor, in August 2 1996 and is using
the state as its launch pad into the Asian market.
	   Malaysia was chosen because of a number of factors, including
its stable government, adequate finance infrastructure, sound legal
system and low market entry volumes.
	   British Booker plc holds a 40 per cent equity in the joint
venture while Malayassets Sdn Bhd and Prinsip Intan Sdn Bhd each
hold 30 per cent.
	   Booker, which has done away with overheads such as costs of
delivery credit and sales representatives, offers a far cheaper
wholesale price on a cash and carry basis for small businesses.
	   Small retailers, caterers and hawkers will therefore be able to
buy their goods at more competitive prices.
	   Boner said traders also stand to benefit from Booker's buying
power through its international sales network with the goods being
procured at competitive prices for resale to small retailers.
	   He said the firm will also launch a ``Pelanggan Ria'' range of
Malaysian- made products, adding ``we will have about 20 products
to start with''.
	   The products will be of good quality and competitively priced so
that traders can enjoy higher profit margins.
	   In addition, he said, to foster good relations with its
customers and to help them keep their businesses viable, Booker
offers many value-added services.
	   These include promotional materials, product and merchandising
advice and training, he said. At present, Booker has established a
strong customer base of close to 11,000 members.
	   Booker has been trading in Europe for over 160 years and had
sales of over RM30 billion worldwide last year.
	   ``Food distribution is the largest division in the Booker
Group,'' Boner said.
	   The Johor Baru branch carries about 6,000 lines of grocery food
and non- food products.
	   ``Customers are kept informed on promotions and activities as
well as introduced to new products through mail,'' he said.
	   Booker has also developed the Management Information Depot
Application System or Midas which provides the branch management
team with a comprehensive range of management information to help
with decision- making.
	   Despite the economic downturn in Malaysia, the Johor Baru depot
is the top performer in Booker's network of over 250 depots
worldwide, in terms of business volume, averaging one million
crates monthly.
	   On its expansion plans in the region, Boner said, Booker will
enter the Thai market and its first depot in Bangkok is scheduled
for opening in September. The firm is expected to enter the Chinese
market next.

	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ The first day of the Heineken
Trophy grass court tennis tournament was an almost total washout
Monday, with only three first-round singles matches possible.
	   Belgian Filip Dewulf ousted compatriot Johan van Herck 7-6
(7-2), 6-3 while Czech Slava Dosedel scored a straight sets victory
over Romanian Andrej Pavel 6-2, 6-4.
	   This Wimbledon warm-up tourney is running both men's and women's
singles for the first time but the only women to finish a match
were American Corina Moriariu and Slovenian Tina Pisnik.
	   No. 7 seed Moriariu stormed through 6-3, 6-0. Three other
matches were interrupted and will be continued Tuesday.
	   Top seed Patrick Rafter of Australia and second-seeded Russian
Yevgeni Kafelnikov are among the stars waiting to hit their first
ball as organizers strive to make up time.

	   WOOD-BASED furniture manufacturer Len Cheong Holdings Bhd
expects to see its turnover grow 10 to 15 per cent this financial
year as the company expands to China.
	   However, profit is expected to be maintained due to stiff
competition from other furniture manufacturers and exporters from
countries like Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, executive director
Lo Chee Kong said.
	   Speaking to reporters after Len Cheong's annual general meeting
in Kuala Lumpur yesterday, he said the company is about to make its
entry into the China market.
	   It has already received orders as a result of its participation
at an exhibition in Shanghai last year.
	   ``At the moment Japan is our biggest export market, contributing
more than 70 per cent to group turnover. We trade with Japan in
ringgit, yen and US dollar,'' Lo said.
	   He said exports to Europe account for 5 per cent of Len Cheong's
turnover, while the remaining 25 per cent is from the local market.
	   Len Cheong manufactures wooden furniture items such as table
tops, tables and chairs, and table and chair parts.
	   The company also manufactures other wood-based products,
including kiln- dried timber, laminated board, veneer and frames.
	   On a proposed joint venture to manufacture furniture and
furniture components in Seremban, Lo said it will include local
investors as well as buyers from Japan.
	   ``We are still negotiating and expect to sign a joint venture
agreement by the end of 1998 or early 1999. The products made at
this plant will be for export to Japan,'' he added.

Nigerian junta frees nine prominent political prisoners

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Reaching out to Nigeria's opposition
movement and to its legion of foreign critics, the country's new
military leader on Monday ordered the immediate release of nine of
the country's most prominent political prisoners.
	   The move came exactly a week after the heart attack death of
Gen. Sani Abacha, whose treatment of dissidents during his
five-year-dictatorship left Nigeria an international pariah.
	   The decision sent a clear signal to the opposition that Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, the career military officer who succeeded
Abacha a few hours after his death, wished to distance himself from
his predecessor.
	   The prisoners ordered freed include such well-known figures as
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979
and Beko Ransome-Kuti, a pro-democracy activist jailed since 1995.
	   But Nigeria's best-known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not on the list.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the immediate release of some detainees
and prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation
and reconstruction,'' David Atta, Abubakar's press secretary, said
in a statement. He added that other prisoners ``would be given
consideration from time.''
	   The prisoners were being held in far-flung jails across this
sprawling, poverty-stricken West African country and it was not
immediately clear exactly when they would return home.
	   In releasing the prisoners, the new military leader urged those
granted amnesty to ``cooperate'' with the government to create
``the country of our dreams.''
	   Abubakar also appealed to the international community to
appreciate the regime's efforts ``at solving our problems and show
greater understanding and sensitivity to our internal affairs.''
	   Abacha's treatment of Nigeria's dissidents, particularly the
1995 execution of author and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa,
isolated his country. While still able to sell its oil, Nigeria's
leaders were not even able to get visas to many Western countries.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, an attorney and one of Nigeria's most vocal
critics of military rule praised the move as a ``joyous step
towards reconciliation.''
	   ``This is incredible. This is fantastic,'' said Fawehinmi.
``This gives us hope that something good will begin to happen
soon.''
	   He noted, however, that dozens of political prisoners remain
behind bars.
	   ``They must go further and release all detainees and all
prisoners still in the gulag,'' he said.
	   Moves made by Abubakar's nascent regime have been closely
scrutinized by Nigeria's opposition as well as other nations. He
had already managed to anger the opposition by making only a vague
pledge to follow through on Abacha's highly flawed political
transition program, which is to culminate in an Oct. 1 transition
to civilian rule. His regime also quickly moved to quash
pro-democracy protests during last week's anniversary of the
annulled elections Abiola is believed to have won.
	   But he had also reportedly met with one of Abiola's wives. In
addition, those arrested during the pro-democracy protests were
quickly released, a significant change from the days of Abacha,
when prisoners could disappear for years at a time.
	   The prisoners to be freed were:
	   _ Obasanjo, who has been serving a 15-year treason sentence
since his arrest in 1995, voluntarily relinquished the presidency
after an election and went on to become a formidable critic of
Abacha's regime. He was released on compassionate grounds and will
be confined to his farm near Lagos at first.
	   _ Ransome-Kuti, a doctor, brother of the late Afrobeat music
star Fela, was convicted of being an ``accessory after the fact to
treason'' and was serving a 15-year sentence. He was ordered freed
for health reasons.
	   _ Frank Kokori and Milton Dabibi, leaders of Nigeria's Oil
Workers Union. They have been held in detention since a three-month
oil workers' strike he led in 1994. No charges were filed against
them.
	   _ Ibrahim Dasuki, the deposed sultan of the town of Sokoto and
an Islamic leader. He has been held without charges since 1996.
	   _ Bola Ige, a former state governor, was imprisoned without
charges after violent anti-Abacha riots May 1 in the city of
Kaduna.
	   _ Chris Ayanwu, editor in chief of Quest, an independent
magazine that was frequently critical of the Abacha regime. She has
been held since 1995.
	   _ Olabintan Durojaiye, a lawyer and critic of the Abacha regime.
He has been held since last year. No charges were filed against
him.
	   _ Uwen Udo, a pro-democracy politician, detained since 1997. No
charges have been filed against him.

	   THE Spices are here! Not the Spice Girls but Spices Restaurant
and Wine Bar of the Concorde Hotel Kuala Lumpur.
	   The hotel too is catching up with the latest food concept in
which Oriental is married with Western cuisine when the eatery was
relaunched recently.
	   Formerly noted for Asian cuisines, the restaurant's new concept
was mooted as a place for people to meet and relax over fine
selections of wine and cigar.
	   Guests can also relish in good food and snacks that blend the
best of both western and Eastern flavours.
	   Concorde Hotel Kuala Lumpur general manager Gary Lee said the
idea to blend the flavours of the two cultures was to provide
better selection of food and to attract more people.
	   ``Some people enjoy Western food but some prefer Asian. So, why
not blend the best of both to satisfy everyone's craving,'' he
explained.
	   The relaunch of the Spices Restaurant was jazzed up with a
fashion show by local designer Andrew Gan.
	   It showcased his latest collection of office, evening and casual
wear.
	   Also present were Jardine Wines and Spirit managing director
Chew Ah See as the company was one of the supporter of Spices
Restaurant.
	   Guests also had the chance to sample sous chef Bernard Lee Then
Kit's East Meets West fusion creations. Judging from their endless
nodding and demands, the contemporary menu that he prepared was a
sure winner.
	   The young and inspiring Lee will head the kitchen team at the
Spices Restaurant. At 31, he has acquired extensive experience in
the food industry.
	   He graduated from the Hotel Catering Institutional Management
Centre in 1989. After completing his studies, he worked with
several hotels in Kuala Lumpur and Johor Baru.
	   In line with the Spices' new concept, he will also introduce to
the guests, fusion style snacks to complement their drinks.
	   Meanwhile, amid the cosy atmosphere, guests can enjoy a wide
selection of premium wines.
	   Snacks will include prawns in jackets, lobster ragout,
otak-otak, honey glazed chicken, crabmeat cigar and Oriental spiced
beef.
	   Lee has also created several sweet desserts such as featherlight
jack fruit fritter, espresso cream brulee with spiced red wine tea
and dumpling.
	   Spices Restaurant and Wine Bar is located on the first floor of
Concorde Hotel Kuala Lumpur.
	   It is open from 5pm to 1am Mondays to Saturdays and is closed on
Sundays and public holidays. For reservations, call 03-2443682.

	   HOSPITAL Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia will build a special
centre in Beranang under its public health programmes in the Hulu
Langat district.
	   Hulu Langat MP Badrul Hisham Abdul Aziz said the centre will
benefit residents in the district as all Government clinics and
health centres in the district will receive help from the hospital
(HUKM) specialists and post-graduate doctors.
	   He said he had recommended to HUKM that Beranang was a suitable
site to locate the centre.
	   Badrul said this after launching a safety campaign to encourage
secondary school pupils to use helmets at Sekolah Menengah Jalan
Reko, Kajang. The campaign was jointly organised by HUKM and Belia
4-B.
	   About 300 pupils from four secondary schools in the Hulu Langat
district, who participated in HUKM's research programme on the
effectiveness of wearing helmets to reduce the number of fatal
accidents involving cyclists, received free helmets from the
hospital.
	   In his speech earlier, Badrul said the programme was timely as
the Hulu Langat district had the highest road accident rate in
Selangor and ranked ninth (among districts) with the highest
accident rate in the country.
	   ``With this campaign it is hoped pupils who cycle to and from
school will be better protected,'' he said.
	   He added that the programme also stressed the importance of road
safety education for pupils to raise awareness on caution on the
road.
	   HUKM deputy director Datuk Dr R. Sarvananthan and Barul
presented the helmets to pupils from Sekolah Menengah Perimbun,
Sekolah Menengah Pandan Jaya, Sekolah Menengah Cheras Perdana and
Sekolah Menengah Jalan Reko.
	   Dr Sarvananthan said with the establishment of HUKM in Jalan
Tenteram at Bandar Tun Razak, the hospital had chosen Hulu Langat
under its research project because it was close to the hospital.
	   She said under this project, HUKM would also help upgrade health
facilities in the Hulu Langat district.

	   THE Malaysian rubber prices closed mixed yesterday on quiet
trading due to slow demand from overseas.
	   At the close, July International RSS One rose one sen to 275.0
sen per kg while SMR 20 shed two sen to 258 sen per kg.
	   A dealer said the market was unpredictable and inconsistent.
	   He said latex intake has just started and stocks are low while
demand for SMR grade is slow and customers (buyers), particularly
from overseas, are seen trying to push dow the market.
	   This made some sellers slightly panicky, he said.
	   The dealer said the uncertainty in the market sentiment was due
to concerns over the Al Nina effect on the weather and fluctuations
of the ringgit apart from conditions of regional markets.
	   The Inro daily market indicator price for June 11 fell to 189.76
Malaysian/Singapore cents from 190.03 cents on June 9.
	   The five-day moving average dropped to 193.76 cents from 195.80
cents previously.

Third day of clashes as England beats Tunisia

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Stade Velodrome in Marseille was the calm eye
of a terrible storm Monday, as England defeated Tunisia 2-0 in
peaceful sunshine even as fans fought with police in the southern
resort city for the third straight day.
	   There were clashes before, during and after the game, leaving
the streets smelling of tear gas. Fifteen people were slightly
injured, police said, and another, hit on the head by a bottle, was
hospitalized. Twenty seven people were detained.
	   Tension ran high Monday night in the Old Port, where English
fans were buying alcohol in supermarkets and some bars, despite a
post-match ban. Bars were ordered to close hours earlier than
normal and not sell alcohol.
	   Earlier, riot police lobbed tear gas on a beach to break up
clashes between English and Tunisian supporters watching the
afternoon match on a huge TV screen set up for people who lacked
tickets to the game.
	   Monday's disturbances followed street violence Sunday night that
cut a path of destruction through downtown Marseille and left 36
people hospitalized, three of them badly hurt, and some 50
Englishmen, Tunisians and Frenchmen in jail. One Englishman had an
artery cut in his neck, and a policeman suffered multiple
fractures.
	   French courts acted quickly. Two postal workers from Liverpool
were jailed Monday for three months for inciting Sunday night's
violence and burning a car. Graham Whitby and Christopher Anderson,
both 26, also were banned from France for one year after their
release. Four other fans were ordered held for further court
hearings next month.
	   ``England seems to be intent on being world champion at this,''
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``It is not exclusively an
English problem, but again and again the English are involved.''
	   In other games Monday, Romania downed Colombia 1-0 at Lyon and
Germany defeated the United States 2-0 at Paris.
	   Cooper said some of England's hardened hooligans appeared to
head to Marseille just to stir up more violence, with little
interest in following the game.
	   ``(It) shows that they are not interested in the football, only
in what comes after,'' Cooper said. ``... We are determined not to
allow a small group of idiots spoil the party.''
	   Inside the stadium, the game took place oblivious to the
troubles outside. Alan Shearer scored late in the 42nd minute and
Paul Scholes in 89th in a game dominated by the heavy favored
English in their first game of the tournament.
	   ``We could have scored three or four goals,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said. ``We could have taken them to the cleaners.''
	   At Lyon, Adrian Ilie's 15-meter chip shot in first-half injury
time kept Colombia from avenging a 3-1 defeat to Romania in the
1994 World Cup.
	   ``We repeated history from four years ago at USA World Cup '94,
but with a different score,'' Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu
said.
	   At Parc des Princes in Paris, Andreas Moeller and Juergen
Klinsmann scored as the three-time world champion Germans gave a
soccer lesson to the Americans, who have been shut out in three
consecutive World Cup games.
	   Violence first erupted in Marseille on Saturday night in the Old
Port entertainment district, when fans clashed with police and
Tunisian supporters. Several English fans were arrested in the
melees.
	   The hooliganism was universally condemned.
	   ``What these fans are doing is that they come to a game to
fight, to cause trouble, to make war,'' said former Brazilian star
Pele. ``This is disgusting. The security, the police, should act
quickly to put these people in jail as an example to others.''
	   In England, Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned as a ``complete
disgrace'' the rampaging English fans.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and they have just got to put a stop to it.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that the job of bringing
stability to Bosnia is incomplete, the Security Council approved a
one-year extension Monday of the NATO-led peacekeeping force and
the separate U.N. civilian mission there.
	   The 15 members agreed unanimously to a resolution extending the
mandates of the two missions until June 21, 1999. Their current
mandates expire at the end of this month.
	   ``Regardless of all the progress in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
preconditions for durable and sustainable peace have not yet been
firmly put into place,'' German Ambassador Antonius Eitel told the
council.
	   ``It is our historic responsibility before the people of
Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain fully focused on the goal of lasting
peace in that country which has suffered so much.''
	   Germany is not a council member but wields considerable
influence over international policy in the Balkans as a member of
the six-nation ``Contact Group'' which coordinates diplomatic
efforts there.
	   Others in the Contact Group include the United States, Russia,
France, Britain and Italy.
	   Several speakers in the council session Monday cited concerns
about the continued problem of the return of refugees _
particularly ahead of Bosnian general elections scheduled for
September.
	   ``This process is slow complex and often dangerous,'' America's
deputy U.N. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, said. ``But the goals of
minorities can be achieved.''
	   He said elections set for September ``provide an opportunity for
the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise their democratic
right to vote in support of Bosnia's future and to reject the
poitics of the past.''

	   MORE than 300 residents from Kampung Pasir Dalam in Kuala Lumpur
had a pleasant surprise when Tetra Pak (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, the
country's leading supplier of processing, packaging and
distribution systems for the liquid industry, carried nutrition
screening for them.
	   The three-hour session was held with the help of 15 members from
the Nutrition Society of Malaysia.
	   They conducted a series of tests, ranging from blood sugar to
cholesterol tests, weight and height measurements, general
check-ups as well as nutritional counselling.
	   The exercise was organised at the request of the Lembah Pantai
Parliamentary Member Datuk Sharizat Abdul Jalil.
	   It provided residents with the opportunity to seek free medical
and nutritional advice.
	   Tetra Pak Malaysia marketing director Anne Asha said the
volunteers came armed with relevant nutritional tips for the
residents aged between 10 and 60.
	   ``Awareness of healthy eating and living habits is just as
important for these residents as for everyone else in Malaysia,''
she said.
	   ``The objective of this nutrition screening exercise was to
check on the nutritional and health status of rural children.
	   ``Milk being the complete body food necessary for growth was
specially donated by Tetra Pak Malaysia for this purpose and was to
encourage parents to give this nutritious drink to their children
daily.''
	   Tetra Pak Malaysia, together with its milk manufacturing
customers, namely Dutch Baby Milk Industries, F&AMP;N Dairies, Malaysia
Milk, Nestle Products, Sama Industrial Products and Yeo Hiap Seng,
donated 200 trays of longlife milk as well as T-shirts to the
residents who attended the exercise.
	   This was part of the annual nationwide Longlife Milk campaign
launched in early May to educate consumers and help them realise
better milk- drinking habits.

	   JOHOR BARU, Fri. - General medical practitioners have been told
to carry out malaria screening tests on Indonesian workers seeking
treatment at their clinics for fever.
	   Johor acting senior health officer (vector control division) Dr
Khebir Verasahib said this was in view of the high number of
Indonesians found infected with malaria since the beginning of the
year.
	   He said GPs should take blood samples to test for malaria
parasites when the Indonesians sought treatment for common fever.
	   ``The GPs must make it a point to carry out blood tests for
malaria. If the results are positive, they must alert the nearest
health office for preventive action to curb the spread of the
disease.
	   ``We also advise GPs to carry out blood screening for malaria on
local people as well, especially if the patients have been
complaining of intermittent fever.''
	   Johor recorded a 130 per cent increase in malaria cases for the
first five months of this year with 161 cases compared to 70 for
the corresponding period last year.
	   Two deaths were reported this year compared to three in 1997.
	   About 90 per cent of the malaria cases this year involved
foreign workers, with a majority of 85.7 per cent comprising
Indonesians working in Felda schemes undergoing replanting.
	   Kota Tinggi topped the list with 117 cases (72.7 per cent) and
one death, followed by Johor Baru with 29 cases (18 per cent) and
one death.
	   He said estate owners and contractors should also inform the
nearest district health office if they recruit new workers,
particularly Indonesians.
	   ``They should notify us irregardless if the workers are from
other estates or new from Indonesia and especially if the workers
fall sick.
	   ``The increase in cases is mainly due to the movement of these
workers who are infected with the malaria parasite.
	   ``Palm oil replanting areas have pools of fresh water. With
enough sunshine, they make ideal breeding grounds for the anopheles
mosquitoes which are the vectors of human malaria,'' he explained.
	   Dr Khebir said the district health offices had conducted various
control and preventive measures such as distributing free
chemically-treated mosquito nets, fogging, regular mass blood
screening and giving radical drug treatment.
	   ``Following these preventive measures, there has been no cases
reported for the last two weeks.''

	   THE Government is confident the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)
is the best means of ensuring the country has the required economic
structure to compete more effectively at the international level.
	   Information Technology (IT), the focal point of the MSC, plays a
crucial role in the development of a country as the current
economic growth trend needs the latest technology to boost
productivity and efficiency, Information Minister Datuk Mohamed
Rahmat said.
	   ``On the pathway towards becoming a developed country, Malaysia
should be ready to compete with other countries especially in the
IT field,'' he said.
	   His speech was read by his deputy Datuk Suleiman Mohamed at the
launch of the Electronic Multimedia Advertising System (Emas) in
Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Mohamed said that every individual needs information. From the
very beginning when man acquired information through conservative
and conventional ways till the present, information has always been
valued as an asset in education, administration as well as the
business world.
	   ``From the economic perspective, the MSC project is dynamic and
can steer Malaysia towards Vision 2020,'' he said.
	   He added that according to certain studies in the past few
years, however, the current economic structure is not capable of
accelerating the country's growth to reach the expected economic
status for the year 2020.
	   Various analyses have shown the methods applied by current
industries can only realise per capita income of RM10,000. To
achieve Vision 2020, he said, the country needs to reach RM22,500
in per capita income.
	   Suleiman yesterday launched Emas, a joint-venture project
between Interconnect Communication Sdn Bhd and the Malaysian
National News Agency (Bernama).
	   The Emas system provides a new alternative to the corporate
world, especially for advertisers where they can reach target
groups through panel screens located at strategic public places in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Interconnect Communication director Mr Pradeep said, so far RM2
million has been spent on the joint venture project and advertising
screens have been located at four points in the city - Ampang Park,
Kota Raya Shopping Complex, Wisma HLA and Plaza Metro Kajang.
	   He added that another RM10 million will be spent on extending
the project nationwide and the company expects it to be completed
by early 1999.

	   TWO lakes in Bangi are providing an additional 19 million litres
of water a day to boost the supply during the current water
shortage in the Klang Valley.
	   Selangor Waterworks Department (Hulu Langat) district engineer
Mohd Wahid Mohd Nor said his department pumped about 16.7 million
litres of water every day in the past few weeks from the 17ha pond
in the Kolej Islam Selangor (Kisdar) construction site in Bangi
Lama to Sungai Semenyih.
	   The river supplies water for the Sungai Semenyih water treatment
plant near Dengkil, Sepang district which supplies piped water to
most parts of Petaling Jaya, Bangi, Sepang district and parts of
Kuala Lumpur.
	   He said four pumps had been installed to draw water from the
lake to Sungai Semenyih to provide the much-needed untreated water
and for the water treatment plant.
	   He said water from another pond in Bandar Baru Bangi near
Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia also had been used for factories in
the Beranang Industrial Estate and Bandar Baru Bangi.
	   About 2.3 million litres of water drawn from the pond was
processed before supply was transported in water tankers to
factories.
	   On other measures to reduce the burden of water shortage
problems faced by residents in Hulu Langat district, Mohd Wahid
said six contractors had been appointed to provide on-call service
to repair pipe bursts, besides two department teams for the
maintenance of the piped water supply system in the district.
	   He said his office carried an inspection every morning to ensure
all the valves were open after it was closed for repair.
	   ``Closed valves have been identified as one of the main causes
for the shortage of piped water supply in the district,'' he said.
	   Mohd Wahid said the department also got help from other States
such as Pahang with Johor supplying water tankers and static tanks
for the residents facing water supply problems.
	   On complaints from the public, he said the operations room in
Kajang received about 100 calls per day.

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A U.S. Coast Guard cutter returned
103 Haitian boat people Monday, the latest in a steady stream of
refugees, this time found on an overcrowded sailboat in the
Bahamas.
	   The Haitians were jammed into a 30-foot (10-meter) boat when the
cutter sighted them Friday near Great Inagua. It is just 60 miles
(100 kilometers) from Port-de-Paix, the northern port from which
they set out Thursday and a popular departure point for boat
people.
	   A 1981 U.S.-Haiti treaty permitting the United States to
repatriate Haitians found in international waters expired in 1996,
but the repatriations have continued, as have the attempts to flee
from the poorest country in the Western hemisphere.
	   ``Before our leaders get around to solving our problems, me and
my six children will have had time to die,'' said Lavictoire
Compere, a 31-year old widow who was among the refugees.

	   SHARES on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) closed lower
yesterday as players sidelined amid continued worries over the
weakening of the yen.
	   The KLSE Composite Index (KLCI) lost 10.63 points to close at
472.37 while the Emas Index fell 2.33 points to 122.02.
	   The Second Board Index lost 0.28 point to 106.36.
	   The broad-based BT Ordinaries eased 1.45 points to 115.79 while
the 30- share New Straits Industrial Index slipped 27.83 points to
end at 2,875.05.
	   The yen passed the 144-level to the dollar, an eight-year low,
dragging down regional market sentiment.
	   US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told a US Senate Finance
Committee that the yen could not be rescued without first restoring
economic strength in Japan.
	   With th yen's relentless fall, the impact on the region could be
quite intense, said one analyst adding that there were some buying
interest coming in yesterday but it was not strong enough to offset
the weak market sentiment.
	   On the scoreboard, losers led gainers 376 to 167 while 209
counters remained unchange.
	   Volume leaders, Maybank slipped 22 sen to RM4.60 with 24,841
lots traded, Magnum shed 11 sen to RM1.55 and AMMB Holdings fell 9
sen to RM2.52.
	   Among blue chips, Tenaga added 10 sen to RM5.55, Genting to
RM8.55 while Sime Darby eased 4 sen to RM2.83.
	   Total turnover was 119.684 million shares valued at RM268.279
million compared with 130.017 million shares worth RM297.037
million traded on Thursday.
	   Turnover on the Main Board was 106.570 million shares worth
RM257.709 million while trade on the Second Board was 6.175 million
shares valued at RM8.700 million.

	   PORTS are more than gateways to the country, they are also the
barometer of the nation's economic health, Transport Minister Datuk
Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said.
	   ``Malaysia is a trading nation - the 16th largest in the world.
Trade is our lifeblood and 98 per cent of the country's
international trade is by sea,'' he told guests at the first
anniversary of the Federation of Malaysian Port Operating Companies
(FMPOC) last night.
	   He added that it is beyond doubt that the current economic
situation will affect the throughput handled by the country's
ports, and therefore the challenge ahead for federation members is
to be resilient and resourceful in facing these difficulties.
	   The minister said it is an opportune moment for Malaysian ports
to review their strategy from one of growth to one of consolidation
through increased productivity and efficiency.
	   The economic situation has its plus points as well, Dr Ling
said, adding that ``with the cheaper ringgit, Malaysian ports,
their services and products have become more competitive and
attractive''.
	   ``This in turn will translate into higher volumes of export
through local ports. Ports on their part must be ready to handle
the expected increase in exports effectively and efficiently,'' he
added.
	   Dr Ling also said that the number of main line operators (MLOs)
calling at Port Klang had increased from 10 in 1990 to 47 in 1997
while the volume of transshipment container traffic through Port
Klang to final destinations had soared to 277,120TEUs (twenty-foot
equivalent units) in 1997, a 91 per cent increase over the previous
year.
	   He also urged the federation and other industry players to
jointly embark on an aggressive marketing programme to increase the
utilisation of Malaysian ports and develop a wide network of
shipping connections for Port Klang.
	   The FMPOC groups the three terminal operators in Port Klang,
namely Kelang Multi Terminal, Kelang Container Terminal and Klang
Port Management, with Penang Port Sdn Bhd, Johor Port Bhd, Bintulu
Port Sdn Bhd and Lumut Terminal Sdn Bhd.
	   The federation's objective, as a port development agency, is to
further improve the management and operational efficiency of
private ports and to promote Malaysian ports globally.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Soccer fans gripped by the World Cup 1998
fever can rest easy in the knowledge that Tenaga Nasional Berhad
has reinforced its stand-by operations for power breakdowns during
the soccer tournament.
	   The operations began on June 10, the first day of the World Cup,
and will continue till the tournament ends. Soccer fans can now
look forward to quick and efficient service in case of power
interruptions during matches.
	   Tenaga Nasional maintenance manager for Kuala Lumpur and the
Federal Territory Shaharim Ngah Marzuki said the plans were
initiated by its senior general manager Datuk Fuad Jaafar.
	   ``We have upgraded our usual stand-by operations by increasing
our manpower on stand-by, equipment and standby generator sets,''
he said. ``We have increased our manpower by about 50 per cent and
have more executives on 24-hour stand-by.''
	   He said the team responded well to the first supply breakdown
since the World Cup began in the Federal Territory at Segambut,
Jinjang and Kepong at midnight last night.
	   ``It took our team about 10 minutes to reach the area, and they
solved the problem with a few sub-stations in the area within 30
minutes.''
	   He said Tenaga Nasional was using the World Cup as a test of its
ability to respond to emergencies during the 1998 Commonwealth
Games in September and to generally improve its services.
	   ``We will have a similar team during the Commonwealth Games.''

	   ALTHOUGH Malaysia ratified the International Labour Organisation
(ILO) Convention 100 on Equal Remuneration for Men and Women for
Work of Equal Value in September 1997, the public sector had
implemented the concept as far back as 1970.
	   Deputy Human Resources Minister Datuk Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir
said the private sector has also responded positively to the
practice in the public sector by eliminating any discrimination or
discrepancy in wage structure for men and women for work of equal
value.
	   He said Malaysia's policy in giving equal opportunity and access
to education since the early days of independence has borne fruit.
	   ``Today, a Malaysian woman holds the rank of assistant
secretary-general at the United Nations headquarters in New York
and I am particularly proud to mention that the coordinator of this
programme, Dr Lin Lean, is a PhD holder from Malaysia,'' he said
when addressing a special sitting on ``More and Better Jobs for
Women'' in Geneva on Wednesday.
	   The special meeting, which is part of the ILO's programme to
promote more and better jobs for women, was held in conjunction
with the on-going 86th session of the International Labour
Conference in Geneva.
	   In the text of his speech which was released in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday, Abdul Kadir said the Seventh Malaysia Plan 1995-2000
contains specific provisions regarding measures to provide more and
better jobs for women in every field.
	   He said an amendment to the Employment Act 1955 to specifically
provide for and promote flexible working arrangements for women
such as housework and part-time work, had been passed by Parliament
recently.
	   ``This is in addition to measures to encourage employers to
provide childcare facilities to facilitate women to enter the
labour market.
	   ``We believe these measures will help enhance the earning
potential for Malaysian women who make up 50 per cent of the
country's population but whose labour force participation rate is
47.2 per cent, which is somewhat low compared to the more developed
countries,'' Abdul Kadir added.
	   He said since pre-independence, Malaysian women have struggled
alongside men in the quest for independence.

Japanese adventurer on long walk nears Prudhoe Bay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANCHORAGE (AP) _ A Japanese adventurer has reached the Brooks
Range on his 850-mile (1,370-kilometer) walk from Anchorage to
Prudhoe Bay.
	   Masatoshi Kuriaki, who climbed to the top of Mount McKinley by
himself late last winter, was reported camping just south of Atigun
Pass on Friday night. That's the highest highway summit in Alaska,
4,800 feet (1,460 meters) elevation.
	   He had walked 675 miles (1,090 kilometers) to get there, pulling
his cart up the highway and making inroads into people's hearts
along the way.
	   ``My tripping speed very slow, but I have very good experience
for me, so I have many, many friend. Local people and tourists
also,'' Kuriaki said last weekend by telephone from Coldfoot.
	   Kuriaki decided on his epic walk because, while he has visited
Alaska several times before, it was to climb McKinley and its
sister peaks. The ``north place,'' he has said, remained unknown to
him.
	   He left Anchorage on April 3, pulling 120 pounds (55 kilos) of
gear in a two-wheeled cart, camping along the road, making about 15
miles (24 kilometers) a day. He eats rice, noodle soup,
freeze-dried camper food, but also grayling and char that he
catches and cooks with garlic butter.
	   He buys groceries and occasionally has them shipped ahead.
	   On the Dalton he made arrangements for truckers to pick up
pre-packed supplies and deliver them to him farther up the road.
Drinking water is a major concern.
	   ``Some drivers stop and invite me into their house,'' he said.
``They take me and my cart to the house and I stay one or two days
and come back to the same point on the highway, and I walk again to
the north.''
	   Word that he's coming advances up the road and people get ready
for him. Truckers, bus drivers and others slow down and swing wide
to give him room on the gravel Dalton, he said.
	   ``Many drivers _ Alyeska Pipeline and (state Department of)
Transportation workers and special crews and some tourists _ give
me food, juice, water.
	   ``Very important _ I was walking from Anchorage to Fairbanks, so
sometimes I talked to 20 drivers some days, some days 15 drivers,
some days 13 drivers. They stop and talk to me about my winter
climbing and my walking,'' Kuriaki said.
	   Last Monday he had dinner with Jack Reakoff and his family, who
live a subsistence lifestyle in the old mining town of Wiseman on
the south flank of the Brooks Range.
	   ``He's right up there with the hardiest individuals to come
through here,'' Reakoff said. ``He hadn't had meat for a while, and
we ate meat. We gave him leftover meat _ duck.''
	   With all the stopping and talking, it's a wonder Kuriaki is
making any progress. Of the 64 days between April 3 and June 5,
when he arrived in Coldfoot, he spent 40 days putting shoe rubber
to the pavement, he said.
	   When it snows or rains, he fishes or visits people.
	   He said he expects to be in Deadhorse at the end of this month
or the early part of July.

	   THE International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World
Bank Group, will invest US$247 million (US$1  &QC;  RM4.10) of loan and
equity capital in the South Korean financial sector.
	   According to an IFC statement, four investments have been
designed to strengthen the country's private sector and are a mark
of IFC's confidence in the recovery and long-term potential of
South Korea's economy.
	   IFC will invest US$25 million in subordinated convertible bonds
of Korea Long Term Credit Bank (KLB) to help strengthen its capital
base and develop it into a more diversified financial institution.
	   KLB, which is South Korea's only private sector development
finance institution, focuses on corporate lending and long-term
financing, mainly to private sector companies.
	   IFC helped establish KLB in 1967 and has been a shareholder
since.
	   Another US$152 million will be provided for Hana Bank to help it
build its capital base and improve its foreign exchange liquidity.
	   The package includes a direct equity investment of up to US$22
million, a quasi-equity investment of US$30 million in the form of
subordinated convertible bonds; a US$20 million loan for IFC's own
account; and an US$80 million syndicated loan for the account of
commercial banks.
	   A third investment involves the Korea Trade Enhancement Facility
(KTEF), a US$100 million trade enhancement facility established by
IFC with Sumitomo Bank Ltd to expand trade finance to South Korea.
	   IFC will guarantee Sumitomo 40 per cent (US$40 million) of the
US$100 million exposure taken by Sumitomo.
	   The facility will support the growth of South Korean exports by
broadening the availability of short-term trade finance to import
capital goods and raw materials.
	   The facility will be available for up to three years with
individual transactions limited to six months. It will give
selected South Korean banks better access to letters of credit,
confirmations and bankers acceptances.
	   IFC's board also approved US$30 million as venture capital to
support long-term investments in small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in South Korea's technology sector.
	   Together with other investors, the project expects to commit
US$5 million to US$15 million to each of approximately 20
high-growth South Korean SMEs.
	   IFC said the approval of the four projects marks a resumption in
the corporation's investment activity in South Korea for the first
time in 10 years.
	   The projects will underpin IFC's effort to help recapitalise and
restructure South Korean corporations and financial institutions
and promote international best practice models.
	   The investments are intended to attract other lenders and
investors to South Korea.

World Cup: Klinsmann strikes again as Germany wins 2-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Sampson quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Juergen Klinsmann maintained his amazing World Cup
first round scoring record Monday with an expertly-taken goal in
Germany's 2-0 victory over the United States.
	   Klinsmann, who scored four times in Germany's three opening
round games in the U.S. four years ago and twice in 1990 group
matches, was fast off the mark again at the Parc des Princes.
	   He fired home in the 65th minute after Andy Moeller's ninth
minute header had given the Germans an early lead and that means he
has scored in six of Germany's last seven first round games.
	   ``The early goal hurt us quite a bit, put us on our heels a
little bit,'' said U.S. coach Steve Sampson.
	   ``In the first half we played conservatively. We talked things
over in the locker room and came out aggressively in the second
half.''
	   After three shutout losses in a row at the World Cup, going back
to defeats 1-0 by Romania and Brazil in 1994, Sampson is looking
for something better against Iran at Lyon on Sunday.
	   ``Rest assured, we have to put some people on the field that can
get behind their defense,'' he said.
	   The problems were also at the back.
	   The Americans, playing their third World Cup in a row, were
exposed in the air by the well-organized three-time champions who
were rarely threatened at the back and created three clear chances
in the opening half.
	   American goalkeeper Kasey Keller came into the World Cup after
four shutouts but that run ended early.
	   The Germans almost went ahead in the fourth minute when Oliver
Bierhoff climbed to meet a right-wing corner with a powerful header
but the ball was blocked just short of the line by Claudio Reyna.
	   But they hit the target in the ninth when Olaf Thon swung over a
corner from the left, Juergen Klinsmann got above two American
defenders to head into the danger area and Moeller nodded the ball
home from six meters past the slow-reacting defender Mike Burns and
in off the right hand post.
	   Bierhoff should have added a second in the 22nd minute when he
controlled a cross from the right despite the attention of Eddie
Pope, who was grabbing his shirt. But the striker, newly acquired
by AC Milan, shot wide of the goal from no more than six meters.
	   The Americans did little to worry German goalkeeper Andreas
Koepke but Chad Deering unleashed a well-struck shot from 25 meters
in the 30th minute which the Olympique Marseille 'keeper held
confidently.
	   The Americans sent on Frankie Hejduk for Burns for the second
half and, after he received a yellow card for a foul, he almost
leveled in the 53rd minute with a close range header from a David
Regis cross. Keeper Koepke reacted well to save at the foot of the
post and concede a corner.
	   But Klinsmann went close to increasing the German lead in the
60th minute when Juergen Kohler got down the left to deliver a low
cross and the veteran striker prodded the ball just wide of the
near post.
	   But Klinsmann, who scored five times in the last World Cup in
1994, hit the target in the 65th. Bierhoff broke down the right and
measured a well-struck cross onto his co-striker's chest. Klinsmann
shrugged off defender Thomas Dooley and volleyed the ball home from
12 meters.
	   Substitute Tab Ramos, who replaced Chad Deering 20 minutes from
the end, fired a low, long-range shot that flashed past Koepke's
post.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Olaf Thon; Juergen Kohler, Christian
Woerns; Stefan Reuter (Christian Ziege, 69th), Joerg Heinrich, Jens
Jeremies, Thomas Haessler (Dietmar Hamann, 50th), Andreas Moeller

Canadian dollar again sets record low against U.S. dollar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Canadian dollar fell to another record low
against the U.S. dollar Monday, trading at one point during the day
at 67.84 U.S. cents.
	   The currency ended the day at 67.85 cents, the first time it had
ever closed at below 68 cents. Last Thursday, it fell to 67.98
cents before rallying sightly at day's end.
	   The Canadian currency has been weak for months because of the
impact of the Asian financial crisis on Canadian commodity exports
such as lumber, coal and minerals. Canada's central bank has
resisted raising interest rates to protect the currency.

	   THE Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) is working on
gaining recognition for the Malaysian Institute of Taxation (MIT)'s
qualification under Section 153 of the Income Tax Act 1967.
	   Once this recognition is obtained, members will be able to apply
to the Ministry of Finance for a tax agent's licence. In a
statement issued in Kuala Lumpur, MIA said the institute has also
prepared another memorandum to have the MIT qualification
accredited by the Public Services Department (PSD).
	   Although the qualification is generally recognised by the
private sector, recognition by the PSD will provide an opportunity
for MIA graduates to be employed in the public service.
	   MIT was incorporated on October 1 1991 under the Companies Act
1965. It comes under the sponsorship of the national accountancy
body, the MIA.
	   MIT aims to provide an organisation for all accountants, tax
agents, academicians and persons in commerce interested in or
concerned with taxation matters in Malaysia.
	   To date, there are 1,480 members, of which 1,161 are associate
members and 319 are fellow members. MIT's membership comprises
approved company auditors under the Companies Act, approved Tax
Agents under the Income Tax Act 1967, advocates and solicitors as
well as those who are in practice or employed by the Inland Revenue
Board. MIT is run by the Council of the Malaysian Institute of
Taxation comprising 16 members made up of eight MIA appointees and
eight MIT elected representative members.
	   Secretarial support of the activities and projects of the
institute is provided by the MIA which has a staff strength of
about 50.
	   The council delegates much of its detailed work to its
committees and some of them are: Technical and Public Practice
Committee - responsible for monitoring official statements and
issuing tax information circulars to members. It also acts as a
consultative body for tax practitioners to channel their views and
maintain dialogue with relevant revenue authorities.
	   Examination Committee - responsible for ensuring the smooth
conduct of the professional examination of the institute.
	   Educational and Research Committee - responsible for all matters
relating to the publication of the institute's journal, Tax
Nasional and to carry out research on tax matters.

Australian test player cleared on technicality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds reason for clearing, suggests NRL may stop weekend games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby league international
Robbie O'Davis had his drug case thrown out on a legal technicality
at Monday's National Rugby League tribunal.
	   The NRL may also be powerless to impose any disciplinary action
after the tribunal accepted it had no jurisdiction to rule on the
case because O'Davis' player registration form had been signed
before the new competition was incorporated.
	   Later, the NRL threatened to call off this weekend's round of
club matches because its drugs policy has been ruled ineffective.
	   O'Davis and Newcastle officials Ian Bonnette and Dave Morley
entered the closed hearing to argue the Queensland State of Origin
winger's defense for having elevated levels of epitestoserone in
his system.
	   If he had been found guilty by the panel, O'Davis would have
faced a mandatory two-year ban.
	   After hearing more than two hours of evidence as to whether
O'Davis was guilty of steroid abuse, tribunal chairman Sir Laurence
Street said the NRL could not make a ruling.
	   Published reports last week said O'Davis has recorded an
epitestosterone level greater than 6 to 1 and will have to undergo
further tests to track his personal level.
	   O'Davis, who was a late inclusion in the Queensland State of
Origin team for Friday's series-deciding game, was tested a month
ago as part of a random check by the Australian Sports Drug Agency.

	   RAM has also reaffirmed Sarawak Oil Palms Bhd (SOPB)'s P2
rating, indicating the company's strong financial fundamentals
evident by its low reliance on debt, profitability and strong cash
generating ability.
	   It said the rating also takes into consideration SOPB's
continued emphasis on estate maintenance and cost controls.
	   With external borrowings, SOPB plans to triple its plantation
hectarage.
	   RAM said it believes this will increase SOPB's credit risk
profile to a manageable level.

	   SHARES on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) fell victim to
the regional stock market sell-down last week, as blue-chip shares
were pressured sharply lower with investors throwing in the towel
due to the region's increasingly negative outlook.
	   Adverse sentiments were triggered by the yen's sharp decline to
the near 145 level to the US dollar by late week, representing an
eight-year low for the yen.
	   Bearish market perceptions that the weak yen may ultimately
pressure China to devalue its yuan, hence adding further pressure
to dislodge the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar, sent
investors scurrying to the sidelines.
	   The pressure to devalue the yuan increased as China's exports
may soon be unable to compete with cheaper Japanese exports due to
the weak yen.
	   This situation could be translated to other regional markets, as
the export-driven regional economies will be under intense pressure
to compete in the export markets with cheaper Japanese products.
	   A possible eventuality which worried regional markets is the
emergence of a second round of regional currency devaluation, which
would include bigger northern Asian markets such as Japan, China
and Hong Kong, thus compunding the already negative sentiments on
the region's fragile markets.
	   In reaction to these fears, the KL Composite Index fell 32.68
points, or 6.47 per cent, week-on-week to close at 472.37, while
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plunged 654 points, or 7.63 per cent,
to 7,915.44 and Singapore's Straits Times Index slumped 76.97
points, or 6.59 per cent, to 1,091.49.
	   On the performance of the KLSE's sub-sectors last week, the
construction, trading &AMP; services, and finance sectors were heavily
bashed and lost 9.29 per cent, 8.18 per cent and 8.06 per cent
respectively.
	   The sharp losses relected heavy falls in construction, blue
chips and finance stocks, as regional funds further reduced their
exposure on a negative regional outlook.
	   Looking at the 10-year KLCI monthly charts, we had seen that the
crucial support of 470, the five-month low seen on January 12 this
year had given way to another low of 468.76 last Friday.
	   This low now represents an eight-year low, with the next
significant low at 459 which was last seen in September 1990.
	   The 459 low will be the first downside target for the KLCI,
which is likely to be met soon. The next downside target will only
be at 420, which was last seen in June 1989 and will be a major
nine-year low.
	   It remains to be seen whether the 420 low can act as a
significant bottom in current negative market sentiments and limit
downside potential.
	   Meanwhile, the present downtrend channel remained intact,
indicating that the KLCI may continue to trend downwards in a slow
and protracted fashion.
	   As long as the bleak reginal outlook fails to improve and the
yen continues to weaken, chances of a significant near-term market
recovery are remote.
	   Hence, we recommend investors maintain cash and stay out of
stocks for the moment. The other viable option to hedge your
existing stock portfolio would be to short the Kloffe's KLCI stock
index futures and profit from a market decline.
	   As seen on the KLCI index futures daily chart, the futures
market trend is still downwards and trapped in the down channel
which began in March.
	   Market momentum remained weak with short-sellers still getting
the upper hand on the market.
	   We are still bearish on the KLCI stock index futures, as
downside pressure from overbearing negative regional sentiments
should continue to dampen KLSE market sentiment.
	   We would favour maintaining short positions and look for a
continuation of the present downtrend. However, be conservative and
get ready for downside targets at 458 and 420 to take profits.

State drops investigation of government financing of settlers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with state comptroller's response, CLARIFIES lead and
other grafs, RECASTS, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's state comptroller dropped an
investigation into allegations of irregularities in government
financing of Jewish settlers who have been buying up property in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, an opposition legislator said
Monday.
	   Lawmaker Haim Oron of the opposition Labor party has petitioned
the Supreme Court to force State Comptroller Miriam Ben Porat to
renew the investigation. Oron told The Associated Press that Ben
Porat wrote him last week that she called off the probe in response
to a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, head of the
ruling Likud party.
	   Netanyahu's aide Shai Bazak said he had ``no comment,'' on the
matter. Ben
	   Porat's spokeswoman Shlomit Lavi said Ben-Porat ``received
information from the Prime Minister on the basis of which she
ordered a halt to the investigation.'' Lavi said she could not
divulge the information because it was confidential.
	   It was former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who asked Ben-Porat
to conduct the probe in response to a 1992 report by former justice
ministry official Haim Klugman regarding the activities of two
Jewish settler groups, Ateret Cohanim and El-Ad, and their
government backers during a previous Likud government.
	   ``We found evidence of impropriety in the matter of housing, and
allocation and distribution of real estate in the dealings of
government offices with Ateret Cohanim and El-Ad. Those offices
included the Israel Land Administration and the Housing Ministry
headed at the time by Ariel Sharon,'' Klugman told the AP.
	   Both Ateret Cohanim and El-Ad are active in buying up properties
and settling Jews in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed.
	   When Rabin came to power he cut off government aid to the two
settler groups, but after the Oslo agreement he asked Ben-Porat to
drop the investigation, on the grounds that ``the situation had
changed'' Lavi said.
	   Sharon now serves as infrastructures minister and has renewed
his support for El-Ad and Ateret Cohanim. The Palestinians want
east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
	   On Sunday, Oron and an Israeli peace group which opposes Jewish
settlement
	   of east Jerusalem jointly petitioned the Supreme Court to force

	   DESPITE the economic woes in Malaysia, Allied-Link Express Sdn
Bhd is going full steam ahead with plans to build a 30,000 sq ft
warehouse in Shah Alam, Selangor, scheduled to be completed by the
end of this year.
	   In an interview with Business Times, its founder and managing
director Helen Kok said the new warehouse is to provide facilities
for the company's customers who require warehousing space.
	   ``Under the present economic slowdown, we see opportunities for
good returns in the warehousing business. The reason for this is
that companies are trying to reduce costs and cutting warehouse
space and storekeepers is one way to do that,'' she said.
	   She added that the company is also going into supply chain
management, where it will take care of customers' inventories and
delivery of their goods to desired destinations.
	   ``This concept is relatively new in Malaysia, but the potential
is huge because this is another way for companies to reduce fixed
costs,'' she added.
	   A total of RM8 million has been set aside for building the new
warehouse, which includes investments in automation. ``We hope to
link up directly to our customers' computers to facilitate the
movement of goods.''
	   Kok said nonetheless, Allied-Link Express' headquarters will
remain at the present site in Petaling Jaya.
	   Like most small- and medium-sized industries, Allied-Link
Express' performance has been adversely affected by the region's
downturn since the second half of 1997.
	   ``Cargo volume from overseas has dropped by about 30 per cent to
40 per cent, but luckily, exports have picked up, and this helps to
reduce the impact of the current sluggish market,'' she said.
	   Kok said the company has been growing at a healthy 10 per cent a
year in terms of turnover and profits. ``But this year, the returns
are not going to be as great as in the past.''
	   However, the business balance sheet is still healthy, looking at
last year's turnover of RM52 million. The company forecasts 1998
turnover at RM60 million.
	   ``All the same, our management team is looking into all areas to
see how we can improve and survive in this situation. We plan to
review our forecast turnover sometime in July,'' she said.
	   The company has also begun consolidating its business to shorten
development time and boost productivity.
	   Allied-Link Express is involved in total integrated logistics
business.
	   It was incorporated in 1983 and started out with international
freight forwarding activities.
	   It then extended its business activities to international
exhibition logistics and container consolidation to Sabah and
Sarawak the following year.
	   ``These three activities are presently the core businesses of
the company,'' Kok said.
	   However, its international air- and sea-freight forwarding
activity contributes a major portion of the company's revenues.
	   Kok also said at the moment, 52 per cent of Allied-Link Express'
equity is held by Bumiputera partners, while 10 per cent is held by
two of the company's general managers. ``The remaining 38 per cent
is held by a Singapore partner and myself.''
	   She said the company expanded its business through the
acquisition of an industrial packing business in 1995 and since
then, it has formed strategic alliancec with foreign partners
throughout the world.
	   ``This means if customers want to send their goods to Malaysia,
we will then team up with our overseas partners to arrange for
those goods to be sent over here,'' she said.
	   Through its strong worldwide network partnership in
international air- and sea-freight forwarding, Kok said, the
company has gained an excellent competitive advantage which has
resulted in its international business growth over the past years.
	   ``We have been representing one of the top Swiss forwarders in
Malaysia successfully till today. This makes Allied-Link Express
prominent in the freight forwarding industry,'' she said.
	   Kok said the company pursues innovative concepts of total
integrated logistics and so far, it has ventured into other niche
businesses such as specialised and industrial packing and
relocation, door-to-door delivery, warehousing and supply chain
management among others.
	   ``To ensure wide strategic geographical coverage in Malaysia,
Allied-Link Express has set up its strategic business units in
Penang, Ipoh, Port Klang, the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International
Airport at Subang and also in Muar, Johor Baru and Kota Kinabalu.
	   ``At the moment, we have a fleet of 22 vehicles ranging from a
16-tonner to a one-tonner,'' she said. To date, Allied-Link Express
employs some 200 people.
	   Kok said about 80 per cent of the company's business comes from
the corporate market. ``Our customers include multinational
companies such as SGS Thompson, Nestle and Reckitt and Coleman,
just to name a few.''
	   ``And about 80 per cent of our cargo involves overseas
assignments while the remaining 20 per cent is local,'' she said,
adding that its overseas market include Europe, the US and Asian
countries.
	   Last year, Allied-Link Express was successfully ranked 30th
among the top 50 most enterprising privately-owned companies in
Malaysia and was awarded the Enterprise 50 by the Small and Medium
Industries Development Corp.

Graveyard of champions awaits U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Hopes for a U.S. Open victory by Ernie Els,
Tiger Woods and Colin Montgomerie could be tempered by the demands
of The Olympic Club, the graveyard of champions.
	   The three previous Opens at this course were remarkable for
their unlikely winners and superstar runners-up.
	   Those fighting for No. 1 in golf _ Justin Leonard, David Duval
and Davis Love III along with Els, Woods and Montgomerie _ better
recall the fates of Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson this
week. Each let a U.S. Open slip away at Olympic.
	   In 1955, Hogan thought he had won a record fifth U.S. Open when
an unknown club pro named Jack Fleck birdied No. 18 to force a
playoff that Fleck won the next day.
	   Hogan finished with Fleck walking on No. 14 and everyone was so
certain The Hawk had won that TV went off the air and Hogan
presented his ball to a USGA official saying, ``This is for Golf
House,'' the USGA museum.
	   Hogan never got that fifth U.S. Open, ending his career with
nine major titles.
	   The Palmer era essentially ended at Olympic in 1966 when the
King blew a seven-stroke lead with nine holes to play and then lost
a playoff to Billy Casper.
	   Palmer, only 36 at the time, ended with seven majors. Hogan won
six of his after he was 36.
	   And in 1987, Watson _ the dominant player of the era _ held the
lead after 54 holes only to finish one stroke behind Scott Simpson.
	   Watson won once in 1987 then did not win again on the PGA Tour
until 1996. He won this year at Colonial but returns to Olympic
still looking for that ninth major.
	   When Fleck bogeyed No. 14 the outcome seemed no longer in doubt.
What were the chances he could play the last four holes 2 under par
and force a tie with the man who had won four of the previous six
U.S. Opens he played?
	   But Fleck got a birdie on No. 15, then hit a knockdown 7-iron to
8 feet (2 1/2 meters) on the final hole and made the putt to force
an 18-hole playoff.
	   Fleck made three consecutive birdies beginning on No. 8 to go
three strokes ahead. But Hogan fought back and stepped to the 18th
tee one stroke down and hitting first.
	   Hogan's back foot slipped and he pulled the ball into knee-high
rough. It took three shots just to get back to the fairway and he
made a 35-foot (10 1/2 meters) downhill putt to save a 6.
	   Fleck was able to play the hole conservatively and made a 4 to
win the playoff with a 69 to Hogan's 72.
	   Palmer was trying to fight off Jack Nicklaus for dominance in
golf when the 1966 U.S. Open came to Olympic.
	   Arnie's Army was delighted when Palmer took a three-stroke lead
into the final round and victory seemed certain when a 32 on the
front nine sent Palmer to the 10th tee with a seven-stroke lead
over Billy Casper and a nine-stroke lead over Nicklaus.
	   ``I'm going to have to play like hell or I'm not going to finish
second,'' Casper told Palmer on No. 10.
	   Palmer made two bogeys on the first five holes of the back nine
and Casper shaved two strokes off the lead.
	   As they stepped onto the tee at the 15th hole, Palmer was still
five strokes ahead. But Palmer made a bogey from the right bunker
and Casper rolled in a 25-foot (7 1/2-meter) birdie putt and the
lead was down to three.
	   A bad hook by Palmer on the next hole and another birdie by
Casper brought the lead to a single stroke.
	   Palmer hooked badly again on No. 17 and made another bogey,
leaving the score tied going to the final hole. Only Palmer's great
strength salvaged a par _ and forced a playoff _ when he hooked
again on No. 18.
	   The playoff was a replay of the final round. Palmer was two
strokes ahead through 10 holes but made bogeys on Nos. 11, 14 and
15 and a double bogey on No. 16. _ again hooking his drives _ and
ended with a 73 to Casper's 69.
	   Watson took a one-stroke lead into the final round in 1987 and
maintained that advantage going to the back nine.
	   But Simpson birdied Nos. 14 and 15. Then a 15-foot (4 1/2
meters) birdie putt on No. 16 gave him a lead he never surrendered
as Watson left a 35-footer (10 1/2 meters) on the final hole just a
few turns short.
	   The Olympic Club will be all the test the premier players will
want. In three U.S. Opens there, only Casper, Palmer, Simpson and
Watson finished 72 holes under par, with the 3-under 277 by Simpson
the best. And if none of the marquee players is up to the test,
then surely there is another Jack Fleck lurking among the 156
starters waiting to steal another U.S. Open at The Olympic Club.

	   DATOK Lim Ah Lek and Mr G. Rajasegaran ought to get serious and
stop their meaningless war of words this very moment. At a time
when the country needs every leader to motivate the people and help
them deal with economic problems, the Human Resources Minister and
the Malaysian Trades Union Congress secretary-general have chosen
to trade insults and accusations over things that can't possibly
have much relevance in the face of difficulties the country now
faces. Since both these gentlemen, leaders in their own right, sit
on the National Labour Advisory Council, they can sort out their
differences at the council. As minister and chairman of the
National Labour Advisory Council, the highest tripartite body on
labour matters, Lim should be advising any employer or union leader
whose actions could tarnish the image of the country. If his advice
is unheeded, the minister can then reprimand the person or have him
charged.
	   On his part, Rajasegaran as a veteran trade unionist should have
kept his cool and maintain a respectful stance when dealing with a
minister.
	   Even if he were unhappy with how Lim runs the show, there was no
reason to turn things into a circus. The MTUC, the body he has
helped lead for decades, is a respectable organisation that
represents more than half a million Malaysian workers in the public
and private sectors. The congress is the national trade union
centre, the umbrella body for over 100 trade unions, big and small,
throughout the country. It exists to champion the course of
Malaysian workers. Given its affiliations with the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the International Labour
Organisation, the MTUC is responsible for defending this cause
internationally as well.
	   At this hour, the MTUC is an organisation answerable to members,
many of whom are having sleepless nights because of the prospects
of becoming unemployed as a result of the economic downturn.
Already, economic problems have claimed the jobs of more than
20,000 workers this year.
	   Everywhere, companies are comtemplating cost-cutting measures to
survive.
	   Some workers of some companies will suffer more than others, but
very few will come out of this difficult period unscathed.
Increasingly, more will begin to depend on the congress to deliver
them from the hard times.
	   Instead of being engaged in personal battles that will not
benefit the masses, Rajasegaran should be spending his energy and
time on finding ways to help Malaysian workers face the tough
months - maybe even years - ahead of them. There is a lot of work
to be done to protect their welfare and ensure that the interests
of every worker is safeguarded.
	   Similarly, the Human Resources Ministry also has enormous tasks
at hand.
	   Some employers have been trying to take the easy way out of the
economic doldrums by retrenching staff without compensation, and on
several occasions we have seen how the ministry has come into the
picture to resolve matters amicably for both employers and
employees. There will be more cases like these in the coming weeks
and months, going by the economic situation now. The last thing the
ministry or minister needs is a distraction of the kind that Lim
and Rajasegaran have indulged in. The implications of Lim and
Rajasegaran's stand-off could be serious. Foreign investors already
jittery about the economic situation may begin to read too much
into it, what with some foreign media showing their consistent
willingness to help spread bad news. We have seen in the last few
days how a foreign news agency had concluded, from the arrests of
several Opposition leaders, that the country was heading towards
political tensions. The same can be reported about the state of
industrial relations in this country, if Lim and Rajasegaran
continue with their antics. They can argue by all means. However,
both the minister and trade union leader, it seems, need to be
reminded that the war we all should be fighting as a nation and as
a people is still raging out there, and threatening to rob us of
everything we have.

English, Tunisian fans clash, thwarting police measures

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England beat Tunisia 2-0 in the
Velodrome Stadium on Monday, but less conclusive battles flared
outside, with tear gas grenades, riot police charges, and
ambulances wailing through this rough port city.
	   Fifteen people were slightly injured, police said, and another,
hit on the head by a bottle, was hospitalized. Twenty-seven people,
about half of them English fans, were detained.
	   Two English fans were sentenced to three months in jail,
meanwhile, after being found guilty of criminal damage and inciting
other fans to riot a night earlier.
	   At the Old Port Monday night, most bars and all businesses were
locked up, and heavy cordons of riot police with dogs filtered all
traffic. Groups of young delinquents from the northern suburbs and
curious passers-by stood around, occasionally throwing bottles at
passing English fans and police.
	   At one point, police formed a tight circle around about 50
English fans to keep them in one place, and protect them.
	   Some of the English were trying to get to the train station, but
Tunisian kids with bats and knives were blocking access. Police
surrounded them and got them onto a train to Calais.
	   There were sporadic skirmishes. Police chased one group of
Englishmen down a narrow street, and when charging police officers
hit a passerby with sticks, he was knocked down and had an
epileptic seizure.
	   The latest clashes came after a night of window-smashing
violence at the Old Port which left 36 people in hospital, three of
them badly hurt, and at least 50 Englishmen, Tunisians and
Frenchmen in jail.
	   One English fan had an artery cut in his neck, and a policeman
suffered multiple fractures before sporadic rioting petered out in
the early morning hours.
	   Graham Whitby and Christopher Anderson, both postmen aged 26
from Liverpool, were sentenced to three months in jail and also
banned from France for one year after their release.
	   French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who has warned
hooligans they will be dealt with swiftly and harshly, said Monday
the offenders should be deported.

Palestinians complain about civil guards at Jewish settlements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Palestinian observer mission at the
United Nations called Monday on the Security Council to pressure
Israel to cancel an order allowing ``civil guards'' at Jewish
settlements on the West Bank.
	   The Palestinian representative at the United Nations, Nasser
al-Kidwa, alleged that the guards would be made up of ``extremist
and fanatic settlers'' and would constitute ``a private army''
within the occupied territories.
	   ``All of these illegal actions must be strongly condemned by the
international community and the Security Council in particular ...
must ensure that the occupying power reverses such actions and
conform with international law,'' al-Kidwa said in letters to the
council and the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Al-Kidwa said he was responding to an order issued Thursday by
the Israeli army allowing establishment of civil guards to protect
Jewish settlers against attacks by Palestinian militants.
	   Al-Kidwa argued that the plan violates provisions of the Fourth
Geneva Convention on treatment of civilians in territory occupied
by a foreign military power.
	   The General Assembly considers Israel an occupying power in
areas it captured during the 1967 Mideast War. Israel has never
formally accepted that interpretation although successive Israeli
governments have adhered to most of the condition of the Geneva
agreement.

World Cup: Klinsmann strikes again as Germany wins 2-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Vogts quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Juergen Klinsmann maintained his amazing World Cup
first round scoring record Monday with an expertly-taken goal in
Germany's 2-0 victory over the United States.
	   Klinsmann, who scored four times in Germany's three opening
round games in the U.S. four years ago and twice in 1990 group
matches, was fast off the mark again at the Parc des Princes.
	   He fired home in the 65th minute after Andy Moeller's ninth
minute header had given the Germans an early lead and that means he
has scored in six of Germany's last seven first round games.
	   ``The early goal hurt us quite a bit, put us on our heels a
little bit,'' said U.S. coach Steve Sampson.
	   ``In the first half we played conservatively. We talked things
over in the locker room and came out aggressively in the second
half.''
	   ``Klinsmann made an exceptional move to free himself and then it
was a clinical finish with great poise,'' Sampson said.
	   German coach Berti Vogts said he didn't really care who scored
the goals _ as long as they came.
	   ``The team is important and the team has to create chances. Who
scores doesn't matter, as long we win,'' Vogts said.
	   ``We lost our order a little bit in the second half and I am not
entirely happy with our performance, but I am happy with the
result,'' he said.
	   ``We were able to change pace, but we still have to do things
better,'' said Vogts, whose team now plays Yugoslavia June 21 in
Lens. The Yugoslavs beat Iran 1-0 Sunday.
	   After three shutout losses in a row at the World Cup, going back
to defeats 1-0 by Romania and Brazil in 1994, Sampson is looking
for something better against Iran at Lyon on Sunday.
	   ``Rest assured, we have to put some people on the field that can
get behind their defense,'' he said.
	   The problems were also at the back.
	   The Americans, playing their third World Cup in a row, were
exposed in the air by the well-organized three-time champions who
were rarely threatened at the back and created three clear chances
in the opening half.
	   American goalkeeper Kasey Keller came into the World Cup after
four shutouts but that run ended early.
	   The Germans almost went ahead in the fourth minute when Oliver
Bierhoff climbed to meet a right-wing corner with a powerful header
but the ball was blocked just short of the line by Claudio Reyna.
	   But they hit the target in the ninth when Olaf Thon swung over a
corner from the left, Juergen Klinsmann got above two American
defenders to head into the danger area and Moeller nodded the ball
home from six meters past the slow-reacting defender Mike Burns and
in off the right hand post.
	   Bierhoff should have added a second in the 22nd minute when he
controlled a cross from the right despite the attention of Eddie
Pope, who was grabbing his shirt. But the striker, newly acquired
by AC Milan, shot wide of the goal from no more than six meters.
	   The Americans did little to worry German goalkeeper Andreas
Koepke but Chad Deering unleashed a well-struck shot from 25 meters
in the 30th minute which the Olympique Marseille 'keeper held
confidently.
	   The Americans sent on Frankie Hejduk for Burns for the second
half and, after he received a yellow card for a foul, he almost
leveled in the 53rd minute with a close range header from a David
Regis cross. Keeper Koepke reacted well to save at the foot of the
post and concede a corner.
	   But Klinsmann went close to increasing the German lead in the
60th minute when Juergen Kohler got down the left to deliver a low
cross and the veteran striker prodded the ball just wide of the
near post.
	   But Klinsmann, who scored five times in the last World Cup in
1994, hit the target in the 65th. Bierhoff broke down the right and
measured a well-struck cross onto his co-striker's chest. Klinsmann
shrugged off defender Thomas Dooley and volleyed the ball home from
12 meters.
	   Substitute Tab Ramos, who replaced Chad Deering 20 minutes from
the end, fired a low, long-range shot that flashed past Koepke's
post.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Olaf Thon; Juergen Kohler, Christian
Woerns; Stefan Reuter (Christian Ziege, 69th), Joerg Heinrich, Jens
Jeremies, Thomas Haessler (Dietmar Hamann, 50th), Andreas Moeller
(Markus Babbel, 90th); Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   United States _ Kasey Keller; Thomas Dooley, Eddie Pope, David
Regis; Chad Deering (Tab Ramos, 70th), Brian Maisonneuve, Mike
Burns (Frankie Hejduk, 46th), Cobi Jones, Claudio Reyna, Ernie
Stewart; Eric Wynalda (Roy Wegerle, 65th).
	   Referee _ Said Belqola, Morocco.

Bulls' big question: Who'll stop the reign?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Scottie Pippen stood in the locker room, his
championship T-shirt drenched with champagne, a smoldering cigar in
his hand.
	   He smiled as he remembered the other five times he has been
there. And for the first time in a long while, the man who almost
everyone agrees holds the key to the Chicago Bulls' fate smiled
when he talked of the future.
	   ``I know I've said some things in the past,'' Pippen said. ``If
these guys want to come back and try it again, I'll be open-minded
to what's going on.''
	   For months now, the Bulls have said this was absolutely,
positively the Last Dance. Pippen, a free-agent-to-be who has a
long history of bad blood with Bulls management, was never, ever
going to wear a Chicago uniform again. Coach Phil Jackson was going
to go meditate in Montana. Michael Jordan was headed for the
nearest golf course.
	   And Dennis Rodman? Well, who knows what kind of mischief he'd
find.
	   But now that the Bulls have that sixth gleaming gold trophy,
leaving may not be so easy.
	   ``You hate to see it come to an end and you don't want to see it
come to an end,'' Pippen said, a wistful look in his eyes. ``We
feel like we're dominant.''
	   They are. Despite being old _ Rodman is 37, Jordan 35 and Pippen
32 _ the aging Bulls are still better than anything else the
National Basketball Association has to offer. They have six
championships in eight years. Rodman, who won his seventh
consecutive rebounding title, hops around the floor like a man half
his age. Not even a bad back can thwart Pippen's smothering
defense.
	   And Jordan? Just look at his 45-point effort in Game 6, complete
with yet another Michael Moment. With 5.2 seconds left, he left
Bryon Russell on the floor and hit a pullup jumper, his hand
hanging in the air for just a second as the game-winner dropped
through the net.
	   ``Michael has probably got another five years left before we see
a decline in him,'' Pippen said. ``There's other things that he
knows that is waiting in his game that he can always pull out.
Right now, we're seeing him probably at the top of his game.''
	   So how do you let these guys go? If you're Chicago chairman
Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause, maybe you've
realized you can't.
	   ``We hope that this is not the end of this run,'' Reinsdorf
said. ``I don't want to be the person that breaks up the Chicago
Bulls as long as they're winning championships.''
	   Sure, bringing back the biggest of the Bulls could swell
Chicago's payroll to dlrs 80 million. But the five-year leases on
80 percent of the United Center's 220 luxury boxes come up for
renewal next year, and Toni Kukoc and Ron Harper aren't the reason
Chicago has sold out every home game since November 1987.
	   ``Certain people high up in the organization said, `See you next
year,' as we left the arena,'' Dwight Manley, Rodman's agent, said
Monday. ``So that's a positive thing.''
	   For now, the Bulls can't do much. With Jordan, Pippen, Rodman
and nine others on the playoff roster being free agents, Chicago
can't have any discussions _ not officially, anyway _ with anyone
until July 1.
	   Agents for Jordan, Jackson and Pippen all were traveling Monday,
and did not return phone calls from The Associated Press.
	   But July 1 is also lockout day. The league's collective
bargaining agreement expires June 30, and NBA commissioner David
Stern has threatened a lockout unless a settlement is reached.

Hezbollah loses ground in stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The militant Islamic movement Hezbollah
lost ground in its main stronghold in municipal elections in
eastern Lebanon that pitted the Christian president against his son
in the region's biggest town, results showed Monday.
	   About 60 percent of the eastern Bekaa Valley's 434,000 eligible
voters went to the polls Sunday to fill 1,879 city and town council
posts. It was the last stage of staggered polling that began May 23
across Lebanon's five provinces.
	   Lebanon's first municipal elections in 35 years marked a turning
point in the country's recovery after the 1975-90 civil war between
its Christian and Muslim communities.
	   Unlike previous rounds, Sunday's vote was not a Christian-Muslim
competition.
	   It was Christians against Christians in Zahle, Bekaa's
provincial capital, and Shiite Muslims versus Shiite Muslims in
Baalbek, which was a hotbed of militants who kidnapped Westerners
during the civil war.
	   Hezbollah, which became the de facto ruler in Baalbek after it
was formed in 1982, had sought to solidify its wartime hold on the
city through control of the city council.
	   But non-Shiite votes enabled a coalition of the pro-Syrian Amal,
Hezbollah's main rival for control of the Shiite community, and
Syrian-backed leftist groups to win 16 seats on the 21-member
council. Hezbollah picked up the remaining five seats.
	   Baalbek, home to world famous ruins and the international
festival of the arts under its towering Roman columns, is one of
Lebanon's prime tourist attractions and many were concerned that a
Hezbollah victory could harm that reputation.
	   Hezbollah, however, defeated rivals in town councils in
surrounding areas and the remote Hermel region of northeastern
Lebanon, consolidating its emergence as an influential power within
1.2 million Shiite community nationwide.
	   The other key race saw President Elias Hrawi's hometown turn
against him.
	   Zahle, Bekaa's provincial capital and Lebanon's largest
Christian city with 130,000 residents, elected 16 candidates to its
21-member city council from a ticket backed by Hrawi's eldest son,
George, and the president's rival, lawmaker Elie Skaff.
	   The other five seats went to a ticket backed by the president.
	   The press had speculated that the race in Zahle could have a
bearing on the president's political future. Hrawi, in office since
1989, may seek another extension when his term expires in November.

Yzerman takes his licks, awaits champagne
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ His face has been shoved in the ice, he has
been cross-checked in the back, slammed into the boards and knocked
to the ice countless times.
	   Every time the Washington Capitals have had the opportunity to
hit Steve Yzerman in the Stanley Cup Finals, they've done it.
	   The Detroit Red Wings captain has gotten up every time and made
the Capitals pay, much like he has made every opponent pay in the
playoffs this season.
	   Yzerman's play has put the Red Wings within a game of capturing
their second straight Stanley Cup on Tuesday night. His
league-leading 24 points (6 goals, 18 assists) also has put the
33-year-old on the verge of winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the
MVP of the playoffs.
	   Typically, Yzerman downplayed the possibility of winning the
award on Monday, noting that goaltender Chris Osgood and defenseman
Nicklas Lidstrom were also good candidates.
	   That's the kind of response defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov's
expects from the teammate he calls a ``class act.''
	   ``You can see how he is willing to compete and fight on every
shift on the ice,'' Fetisov said. ``Even when he makes a mistake,
you can see the expression on his face, everyone knows he is
unhappy and will fix it.
	   ``It's tough to shut down these kinds of guys,'' Fetisov added.
``They never stop. They never quit. It's amazing, he is not the
biggest guy in hockey but his heart and his soul everybody in this
room feels, and we try to follow him.''
	   Yzerman has been the best player on the ice in the finals. His
two goals and two assists are tied for the series points lead with
teammate Tomas Holmstrom and his plus five rating is the best on
both teams.
	   Not only is Yzerman scoring, but he is also working on the power
play and penalty kill and he has been a force on defense against
whatever Capitals line has been on the ice.
	   ``There is so many ways he can beat you,'' Red Wings defenseman
Bob Rouse said. ``That's one of his strong points. You can't just
shut down one facet of his game. He'll find a way to beat you.''
	   For the first 13 years of his career, Yzerman had the label of
not being able to lead his teams to victory in the big ones. He
could always score, posting six 100-point seasons, but his teams
never won championships, that is until the Red Wings ended a
42-year Cup drought last season.
	   All the perceptions about Yzerman changed after that, from being
a loser to one of the great captains.
	   Part of the credit goes to coach Scotty Bowman, who convinced
Yzerman to become more of a two-way player. But even that took time
to change the image.
	   Before sweeping Philadelphia last year, Yzerman joked that
people would not sit down next to him at a craps table in a casino.
It was that bad.
	   Teammates insist Yzerman has always been a leader.
	   ``He is not a rah-rah type,'' fellow center Kris Draper said.
``He just goes out and leads by example. That's why he is a great
guy to have on your dressing room. If he feels something needs to
be said, he says it. But most of the time, he just goes out and
leads by example and those are the guys that are irreplaceable.''

Israel demolishes three Arab homes in east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel brought bulldozers to a neighborhood in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem Monday and demolished three Arab
homes it claimed were built illegally.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
the demolitions sent the ``wrong signals,'' at a time when the
Mideast peace process is so fragile.
	   The three homes in the Jabel Mukaber neighborhood housed 30
members of three families. Family members stood outside and watched
the destruction of their homes on Monday.
	   Israel's Army radio said the families had begun rebuilding the
homes after dark. The radio said the families had paid a Jerusalem
municipality fine for building without a permit but did not expect
the city to knock down their homes.
	   Israel rarely issues permits to Arabs to build in east Jerusalem
or other West Bank areas Israel has controlled since it captured
the land from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War.
	   A statement from the Orient House, home to the PLO in east
Jerusalem, said Israel has destroyed 40 Arab homes in east
Jerusalem since the beginning of the year, a significant increase
from the 17 homes destroyed during all of 1997, according to Orient
House figures.
	   ``At the time when we are trying to bring the parties together,
these house demolitions send the wrong signal,'' Rubin told
reporters in Washington.
	   The United States has offered a proposal to help restart talks
which broke down over 15 months ago after Israel announced plans
for a Jewish housing project in east Jerusalem.
	   ``At this delicate moment in the talks, where we are still
hopeful that we can re-establish the peace process that has been
unable to succeed in the recent year, we renew our call on both
sides to refrain from provocative acts, which only make the task of
reaching agreement more difficult.''
	   Sunday, Israel demolished the home of a Palestinian family in
the West Bank city of Hebron.

Iraq rejects resolution stipulating longterm oil-for-food program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Hamdoon meeting with
non-aligned countries, RECASTS lede, Portuguese ambassador saying
he didn't think draft had problematic language. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq warned the Security Council on Monday
that it would cease oil exports if council members approve a
resolution which Baghdad claims would transform the U.N.
oil-for-food program into an ongoing operation.
	   ``I warned them that if this draft is to be passed by the
Security Council, this whole program would collapse,'' Iraq's U.N.
ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon said after meeting with non-aligned U.N.
member states.
	   ``If the program collapses, there will be no purchasing and no
selling,'' he told reporters.
	   Iraq was barred from freely exporting oil in 1990 following its
invasion of Kuwait. After U.S.-led forces drove the Iraqis from
Kuwait in 1991, the council decided to maintain sanctions until
Baghdad destroyed all illegal weapons.
	   In 1996, the council approved the oil-for-food program, which
allows limited exports of Iraqi oil to fund humanitarian supplies
and to compensate Gulf War victims.
	   Last month, Iraq was exporting about 1.6 million barrels a day.
	   The United States had hoped to transform the deal, which must be
renewed by the Security Council every six months, into an ongoing
program as long as the sanctions remain in place.
	   Last month, the United States tried to link that proposal to the
approval of a dlrs 300 million shipment of spare parts for Iraq's
oil industry. But the proposal ran into resistance from Britain and
other council members.
	   But Hamdoon said a compromise resolution being circulated by
Britain, Portugal and Sweden is also unacceptable.
	   ``Such a resolution which keeps the whole program open ended,
keeps it an ongoing scheme, isn't going to be accepted by Iraq,''
Hamdoon said.
	   Hamdoon met earlier Monday with the Security Council president,
Antonio Monteiro of Portugal, and warned that passage of the
resolution ``would mean disengaging Iraq from the program.''
	   Monteiro said he didn't interpret the draft as having an ongoing
provision. There was no indication when the council, headed by
Monteiro, would take up the issue.
	   In February, the council increased the amount of oil Iraq can
export through the program from dlrs 2 billion to dlrs 5.26 billion
over six months.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan then asked the council to
approve the dlrs 300 million in spare parts to help Iraq's poorly
maintained oil industry increase output.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England beat Tunisia 2-0 in the
Velodrome Stadium on Monday, but less conclusive battles flared
outside, with tear gas grenades, riot police charges, and
ambulances wailing through this rough port city.
	   Fifteen people were slightly injured, police said, and another,
hit on the head by a bottle, was hospitalized. Twenty-seven people,
about half of them English fans, were detained.
	   Two English fans were sentenced to three months in jail,
meanwhile, after being found guilty of criminal damage and inciting
other fans to riot a night earlier.
	   At the Old Port Monday night, most bars and all businesses were
locked up, and heavy cordons of riot police with dogs filtered all
traffic. Groups of young people from the northern suburbs and
curious passers-by stood around, occasionally throwing bottles at
passing English fans and police.
	   At one point, police formed a tight circle around about 50
English fans to keep them in one place, and protect them.
	   Some of the English were trying to get to the train station, but
Tunisian youths with bats and knives were blocking access. Police
surrounded them and got them onto a train to Calais on the English
Channel.
	   There were sporadic skirmishes. Police chased one group of
Englishmen down a narrow street, and when charging police officers
hit a passerby with sticks, he was knocked down and had an
epileptic seizure.
	   The latest clashes came after a night of window-smashing
violence at the Old Port which left 36 people in hospital, three of
them badly hurt, and at least 50 Englishmen, Tunisians and
Frenchmen in jail.
	   One English fan had an artery cut in his neck, and a policeman
suffered multiple fractures before sporadic rioting petered out in
the early morning hours.
	   Graham Whitby and Christopher Anderson, both 26 and postmen from
Liverpool, were sentenced to three months in jail and also banned
from France for one year after their release.
	   French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who has warned
hooligans they will be dealt with swiftly and harshly, said Monday
the offenders should be deported.

	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ Capt. Bryan Johnson stepped out of
his Air Force F-16 fighter Monday with a smile from ear to ear.
	   ``It was outstanding,'' the American pilot said, exuberant at
the end of a four-hour demonstration of NATO's ability to project
power far and fast over Albania and Macedonia.
	   The exercise was aimed at making Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic think again about his violent crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
	   Johnson's fighter was one of 85 aircraft _ 68 fighters and 17
support planes _ from 13 of the 16 NATO nations that participated
in Exercise Determined Falcon.
	   ``I think we demonstrated the ability to project power on short
notice,'' he said.
	   Lt. Gen. Michael Short, commander of NATO air forces in the
alliance's southern division, agreed, saying Monday's maneuvers
showed just how quickly the alliance could react to events outside
its traditional territory.
	   ``This is a model for the NATO of the 21st century,'' he said.
	   Taking off from this NATO air base at the foot of the Dolomite
Mountains, the aircraft flew down the Adriatic coast, then into
Albanian airspace, turning a circle into Macedonia and back across
Albania in what Short called a ``wagon train'' 200 kilometers (120
miles) long.
	   In all, NATO jets took off from bases in Italy, Greece, France,
Germany, Britain and the Netherlands and from carriers in the
Adriatic Sea. Support planes, including refueling tankers, already
were in the air.
	   Aboard the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault carrier, a live video
feed from AWACS aircraft hovering over Albania showed the jets
speeding at more than 460 mph (740 kph) along a narrow corridor as
close as 20 kilometers (10 miles) from Serbia's southern border.
	   Altitude near the border ranged from 4,300 meters (14,000 feet)
_ about half the normal cruising altitude of an airliner _ to 6,700
meters (22,000 feet).
	   Jets were provided by all NATO members except Iceland and
Luxembourg, which have no air forces, and Canada, which could not
deploy aircraft to Europe on such short notice.
	   ``We in the military know we can do certain things,'' said Lt.
Col. Dennis Prokopowicz, an American F-16 pilot. ``Sometimes we
have to demonstrate that.''

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England beat Tunisia 2-0 in the
Velodrome Stadium on Monday, but less conclusive battles flared
outside, with tear gas grenades, riot police charges, and
ambulances wailing through this rough port city.
	   Fifteen people were slightly injured, police said, and another,
hit on the head with a bottle, was hospitalized. Twenty-seven
people, about half of them English fans, were detained.
	   Two English fans were sentenced to three months in jail,
meanwhile, after being found guilty of criminal damage and inciting
other fans to riot a night earlier.
	   At the Old Port Monday night, most bars and all businesses were
locked up, and heavy cordons of riot police with dogs filtered all
traffic. Groups of young delinquents from the northern suburbs and
curious passers-by stood around, occasionally throwing bottles at
passing English fans and police.
	   At one point, police formed a tight circle around about 50
English fans to keep them in one place _ and protect them.
	   Some of the English were trying to get to the train station, but
Tunisian kids with bats and knives were blocking access. Police
surrounded them and got them into a bus, and then onto a train to
Calais.
	   There were sporadic skirmishes. Police chased a group of
Englishmen down a narrow street. When charging police officers hit
one passerby with sticks, he was knocked down and had an epileptic
seizure.
	   On the Canebiere, the city's main avenue, one lone Englishman
was jumped by Tunisians, who started beating him. French police
jumped to his rescue.
	   There were also minor disturbances in Paris, where German fans
tried to muscle their way through police barricades before the game
with the United States. Four people were detained, police said.
	   The latest clashes in Marseille came after a night of
window-smashing violence that left 36 people in the hospital, three
of them badly hurt, and at least 50 Englishmen, Tunisians and
Frenchmen in jail.

	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ The first day of the Heineken
Trophy grass court tennis tournament was an almost total washout
Monday, with only three first-round singles matches possible.
	   Belgian Filip Dewulf ousted compatriot Johan van Herck 7-6
(7-2), 6-3, while Czech Slava Dosedel defeated Romanian Andrej
Pavel 6-2, 6-4.
	   This Wimbledon warm-up tourney is running both men's and women's
singles for the first time, but the only women to finish a match
were American Corina Moriariu and Slovenian Tina Pisnik.
	   Moriariu, the No. 7 seed, downed Pisnik 6-3, 6-0. Three other
matches were interrupted and will be continued Tuesday.
	   Patrick Rafter of Australia and Russian Yevgeni Kafelnikov are
the top two men's seeds.

Biotech companies developing sci-fi vaccines to ease immunization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Biotechnology companies are closing in on new
ways to vaccinate _ with a glass of transgenic milk for malaria, a
banana for hepatitis, even Star Trek-like nasal sprays and ``gene
guns.''
	   This sci-fi innovation promises not only to ease the 15 vaccine
shots an average child gets by age 4, but to lower production costs
and allow protection against diseases that conventional vaccines
simply can't tackle.
	   ``Vaccines will be more than just dead pathogens injected in
your arm,'' Gregory Milman, pathogenesis chief at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday.
	   Most are still in early development, he cautioned. But companies
backed by millions of dollars in new National Institutes of Health
funding are developing everything from edible vaccines to vaccines
made of disease DNA simply shot through people's skin cells with
needleless hyposprays. ``It's very exciting technology,'' Milman
said.
	   Aviron Inc. will ask the Food and Drug Administration later this
year to approve the first of these novel vaccines, a nasal-spray
flu vaccine for children, who are the main spreaders of influenza.
Aviron is completing testing in adults, and reports that FluMist is
more than 90 percent effective.
	   It doesn't just take the ouch out of flu shots. Injections only
produce antibodies against flu in patients' bloodstreams, while a
nasal spray produces a powerful but different reaction _ mucosal
immunity _ inside the nose where influenza strikes, Aviron
President J. Leighton Read told some 4,000 scientists and companies
at the biotechnology industry's annual meeting here.
	   ``Someday we may be able to deliver all vaccines via mucosal
surfaces'' like the nose or gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Myron
Levine of the University of Maryland, who is helping develop what
he calls ``vaccine cuisine.''
	   Plants can be genetically engineered to grow with an antigen
against human disease inside them. The idea: Eat the plant and be
vaccinated. The concept just won legitimacy when the first human
experiment showed people who ate raw potatoes with a diarrheal
vaccine showed a protective immune response.
	   Raw potatoes aren't exactly appetizing, and any raw produce will
rot before enough people can be vaccinated, said Iain Cubitt of
Britain-based Axis Genetics PLC.
	   But California researchers recently discovered they could cook
potatoes grown with cholera antigen without destroying the
medicinal spuds. Now Axis is working on vaccines against diarrhea
and hepatitis B that it foresees selling in preserved foods like
pureed bananas for babies, dried tomatoes or banana chips. That
way, doctors can carefully control the vaccine dose, Cubitt said.
	   Growing complex antigens inside living creatures can be far
simpler than synthesizing them in huge factories, said Harry Meade
of Genzyme Transgenics, which breeds goats and cows with special
genes so they produce drugs in their milk.
	   Now the company is working with NIH to milk a malaria vaccine.
Scientists think a protein called MSP-1 is vital for malaria
protection but until now couldn't synthetically produce enough to
test. Genzyme essentially built a gene that produced the protein,
bred mice with that gene, and found the mice secreted the protein
in their milk. If it proves effective, goats would be bred to
produce the vaccine, Meade said.
	   ``Our goal is to use transgenic dairy animals as bioreactors,''
he explained.
	   People might one day actually drink vaccine milk, some experts
predicted, but Meade said the animals make a cheap factory, too _
pulling vaccine antigens out of transgenic milk could cost a
fraction of conventional vaccine manufacturing.
	   But the newest technology would let the human body manufacture
its own vaccine. Called DNA vaccines, scientists would inject
people with small DNA fragments from a disease. Somehow, body cells
absorb this DNA and let it manufacture the protein needed for
immune protection. So far, it has worked mostly in animals,
cautioned Dr. Margaret Liu of Chiron Corp., but a handful of early
attempts against the AIDS virus found people show signs of an
immune response. Some HIV vaccines are in Phase II testing, and
companies are seeking DNA vaccines against flu, hepatitis and
herpes.
	   Companies hope to use Star Trek-like hyposprays as ``gene guns''
to send DNA vaccines through skin pores without a needle. One
company is creating a helium-driven gun that promises to drive DNA
particles into the skin faster than the speed of sound.
	   ``We have a lot of work to do,'' Liu stressed. But if it works,
simply culling DNA ``would let us target diseases ... that today
are unconquered.''

	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Uncertainty in St. Vincent's
banana industry and 45 percent unemployment drove many voters to
the polls Monday to decide whether to keep or oust the man who has
led this Eastern Caribbean nation for 14 years.
	   Prime Minister Sir James Mitchell has said he will retire from
politics if his New Democratic Party loses the election in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines.
	   The opposition Unity Labor Party says joblessness and banana
woes give it the best chance yet of wresting Parliament from
Mitchell's control. His party controls 12 of the body's 15 seats.
	   Monday's elections was for the 15 seats in Parliament. Under a
system inherited from British colonizers, the party that wins the
majority of seats chooses the government and its leader becomes
prime minister.
	   Both parties promised to boost tourism and help the banana
industry weather a 1997 World Trade Organization order to eliminate
preferential treatment from the European Union for Caribbean banana
producers.
	   Bananas and tourism are key industries in St. Vincent, a
collection of islands with a total population of 107,000.
	   Voters appeared split Monday, with some citing a need for change
and others calling it unwise to switch governments while many
projects, including a new 300-room hotel, are unfinished.
	   ``I feel they should be given the chance to complete the
projects they have started,'' said taxi driver Kingsley de Freitas.
	   Unity Labor Party leaders said some voters had been been left
off registration rolls by mistake, but said they hoped to have the
problem cleared up by the time polls close.
	   Despite heavy rain, election officials said tens of thousands of
the country's 76,400 registered voters lined up to cast their
ballots. Preliminary results were expected late Monday.
	   Labor parties won the country's first elections after it gained
independence from Britain in 1979, but they lost to Mitchell's
party in 1984.
	   On June 2, a Unity Labor Party supporter was wounded in the leg
in a drive-by shooting. He had just returned from a party meeting,
and friends said the attack was politically motivated.

Iraq explains misunderstanding on Iraq-Kuwait border comments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq said Monday it recognized the
Security Council's authority to determine its border with Kuwait,
despite reports that the Iraqi vice president claimed the council's
post-Gulf War demarcation had no legal standing.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said the remarks,
attributed to Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, had been
misinterpreted and ``politicized.''
	   Hamdoon delivered a letter from the foreign minister, Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahaf, to the Security Council president, Antonio
Monteiro, and ``straightened out the misunderstanding.''
	   Ramadan was reported to have told a group of Arab journalists in
the Moroccan capital Rabat that a U.N. resolution ``that demarcated
the border between Iraq and Kuwait does not have any legal value.''
	   He was quoted as saying the United Nations has no mandate to fix
borders of its member states.
	   The remarks were published June 4 by Abu Dhabi's Al-Ittihad
newspaper.
	   Hamdoon said the letter explained Iraq's position and
``reaffirmed our recognition of the borders under the United
Nations Security Council resolution.''

Israel demolishes three Arab homes in east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel brought bulldozers to a neighborhood in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem Monday and demolished three Arab
homes it claimed were built illegally.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
the demolitions sent the ``wrong signals,'' at a time when the
Mideast peace process is so fragile.
	   The three homes in the Jabel Mukaber neighborhood housed 30
members of three families. Family members stood outside and watched
the destruction of their homes on Monday.
	   Israel's Army radio said the families had begun rebuilding the
homes after dark. The radio said the families had paid a Jerusalem
municipality fine for building without a permit but did not expect
the city to knock down their homes.
	   Israel rarely issues permits to Arabs to build in east Jerusalem
or other West Bank areas Israel has controlled since it captured
the land from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War.
	   A statement from the Orient House, home to the PLO in east
Jerusalem, said Israel has destroyed 40 Arab homes in east
Jerusalem since the beginning of the year, a significant increase
from the 17 homes destroyed during all of 1997, according to Orient
House figures.
	   ``At the time when we are trying to bring the parties together,
these house demolitions send the wrong signal,'' Rubin told
reporters in Washington.
	   The United States has offered a proposal to help restart talks
which broke down over 15 months ago after Israel announced plans
for a Jewish housing project in east Jerusalem.
	   ``At this delicate moment in the talks, where we are still
hopeful that we can re-establish the peace process that has been
unable to succeed in the recent year, we renew our call on both
sides to refrain from provocative acts, which only make the task of
reaching agreement more difficult.''
	   Sunday, Israel demolished the home of a Palestinian family in
the West Bank city of Hebron.

Capitals' MVP? So far it's Kolzig
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The most valuable player award in the Stanley
Cup finals will likely go to a member of the winning team. The
Washington Capitals already know who their MVP is.
	   Olaf Kolzig.
	   Kolzig was often spectacular in goal while winning in the
earlier rounds and has remained the same even while losing the
first three games of the finals to the Detroit Red Wings.
	   ``I think Olie has been great,'' Capitals coach Ron Wilson said
Monday. ``The goals (the Detroit Red Wings have) scored, they've
earned them. He hasn't let any soft goals in. It's so easy to say
the goalie should be stopping everything, but if that happened, all
the games would be 0-0.''
	   The Capitals have been outshot by a wide margin in the finals
(125-68), yet have lost the three games by a total of three goals.
	   ``He's lost three games by one goal,'' Wilson said, ``and under
no circumstances could you say in any way that it was Olie's
fault.''
	   Kolzig's performance in the finals reached its peak with a
55-save effort in a 5-4 overtime loss in Game 2 at Detroit. The
Capitals were outshot 60-33.
	   ``I don't think he's feeling the pressure,'' Wilson said. ``He
hasn't lost his temper. I think he's enjoyed this.''
	   Win or lose throughout the playoffs, Kolzig has been
even-tempered. One league official called him ``gold _ he's just a
great person.''
	   After losing a tough one Saturday night, 2-1 on a late goal by
Sergei Fedorov, Kolzig came out to talk to the press as usual and
stayed until the last question was asked, as usual.
	   Kolzig shrugged off the loss philosophically.
	   ``(One-goal losses) just show our team has a chance to win every
game,'' he said.
	   Coming into the finals, Kolzig had put on one of the greatest
goaltending performances in playoff history with four shutouts and
a 1.69 goals-against average. Overall, he has now stopped 662 of
702 shots in 20 games _ by far the most shots faced by any goalie
in the playoffs.
	   Nicknamed ``Godzilla'' for his 6-foot-3 (1.88-meter), 225-pound
(100-kilogram) size, the Johannesburg, South Africa-born Kolzig was
the MVP of the AHL playoffs in 1994 while leading Portland to the
league championship. He was expected to be a backup to Bill Ranford
this year, but got his chance when the Capitals' No. 1 goaltender
was injured.
	   Kolzig wound up playing in 64 games this season, finishing with
a 33-18-10 record and 2.20 goals-against average.
	   So far he is 12-8 in the playoffs with an 1.86 goals-against.
The Capitals' season will hinge largely on what Kolzig does in Game
4 Tuesday night. His team is one game away from losing the finals.
	   ``We can't look at (the series) like we have to win four
straight,'' Kolzig said. ``We have to relax and try to win, and
then see what happens.''

Jazz must endure another summer without a ring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG BEACHAM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The Utah Jazz are sick of being minor
characters in the ongoing story of Michael Jordan's greatness.
	   The Jazz cleaned out their lockers at the Delta Center and said
their goodbyes Monday, hours after the Chicago Bulls reigned on
their parade. Jordan's 45 points led the Bulls to an 87-86 victory
and a sixth title.
	   That's six more than the Jazz have won, if you're counting _ and
the Jazz are.
	   ``It's the same thing, over and over, every year,'' Karl Malone
said. ``I'm tired of it.''
	   John Stockton and Malone are now 1-2 on the list of players who
have played the most NBA playoff games without winning a
championship.
	   ``Last night wasn't a terrific night,'' Stockton said. ``I don't
think anyone slept very well.''
	   How could they, with visions of Jordan dancing in their heads?
Jordan turned in another in his long run of clutch performances,
culminated by a jumper with 5.2 seconds to play that gave the Bulls
the win.
	   ``I woke up thinking, `Did that really happen last night?' ''
Jeff Hornacek said. ``We had so many opportunities. They just made
the plays, and we didn't.''
	   The 36-year-old Stockton ended any thoughts of a possible
retirement. Stockton missed 18 games at the start of the season
after knee surgery, but his performances were above average during
Utah's playoff run.
	   ``I don't feel a sense of relief (with the season being over),''
Stockton said. ``I enjoy work, I enjoy coming to practice every day
and I look forward to coming back and doing it next season.''
	   As for Malone, he arrived at the Delta Center on one of his
seemingly endless collection of motorcycles. This one was a
chrome-plated Harley-Davidson complete with elaborate Wild
West-themed illustrations on the gas tank, tooled leather seats and
large sequined saddlebags.
	   The Mailman's mood was much less festive than his bike. He
ripped into two talk show hosts on the Jazz-owned flagship radio
station, at one point saying, ``Either they shake that situation up
with those two so-called experts, or there's going to be a problem.
... It's going to be them or me next year.''
	   He said his plans for summer include fishing trips to his lodge
in Alaska and time at home in Louisiana. The grind of the playoffs
still weighs heavily on his mind.
	   ``I don't want to sign a basketball, I don't even want to see a
basketball this summer,'' Malone said.
	   But life goes on for the league's most stable franchise.
Hornacek is moving into a new home in two weeks. He started
building it last summer, right before he signed a two-year contract
extension with Utah.
	   ``It's kid time now,'' he said.
	   Even though the Jazz are one of the oldest teams in the league,
there aren't likely to be many changes during the off-season.
Utah's management has made only two trades in the past three
seasons, and only 14 players made it onto the Jazz roster all year.
	   ``We feel like we have a good bunch of guys here, and if we stay
together, there's no reason we can't make another run at this next
year,'' Stockton said.

Ducks coach Page fired after 10 months
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Ducks failed to make playoffs last season;
UPDATES with details &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Pierre Page, hired as Anaheim Mighty
Ducks coach just 10 months ago, was fired Monday.
	   ``This decision is something I really agonized over,'' said
Mighty Ducks general manager Jack Ferreira, who as recently as
three weeks ago said he expected Page to be back. ``I thought
there'd be a big improvement with the team during the season and
there was not.''
	   The Ducks were 26-43-13 and failed to make the National Hockey
League playoffs under Page, who was hired Aug. 9, 1997, to replace
the fired Ron Wilson, who guided the Washington Capitals to this
year's Stanley Cup finals.
	   Ferreira said he would immediately begin searching for a
replacement, but he declined to name possible candidates.
	   Page, 50, did not attend a news conference at Anaheim Arena,
where Ferreira said he told his old friend of the dismissal.
	   ``I know he was down and emotional about it,'' Ferreira said.
	   Ferreira said differences about the team's direction arose,
including player personnel _ who would be traded and what roles
specific players would fill next season.
	   The Ducks finished next-to-last in the Western Conference and
23rd out of 26 NHL teams overall. They were hampered by injuries to
stars Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, and forwards Steve Rucchin,
Travis Green and Scott Young.
	   Kariya sustained a concussion when he was cross-checked by
Chicago's Gary Suter on Feb. 1 and he missed the final 28 games.
Prior to getting injured, Kariya was a holdout at the start of the
season in a contract squabble and missed 32 games.
	   Selanne, who missed nine games due to injury, recovered and went
on to tie Washington's Peter Bondra as the NHL's leading goal
scorer with 52.

Japanese adventurer on long walk nears Prudhoe Bay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) _ A Japanese adventurer has reached the
Brooks Range on his 850-mile (1,370-kilometer) walk from Anchorage
to Prudhoe Bay.
	   Masatoshi Kuriaki, who climbed to the top of Mount McKinley by
himself late last winter, was reported camping just south of Atigun
Pass on Friday night. That's the highest highway summit in Alaska,
4,800 feet (1,460 meters) elevation.
	   He had walked 675 miles (1,090 kilometers) to get there, pulling
his cart up the highway and making inroads into people's hearts
along the way.
	   ``My tripping speed very slow, but I have very good experience
for me, so I have many, many friend. Local people and tourists
also,'' Kuriaki said last weekend by telephone from Coldfoot.
	   Kuriaki decided on his epic walk because, while he has visited
Alaska several times before, it was to climb McKinley and its
sister peaks. The ``north place,'' he has said, remained unknown to
him.
	   He left Anchorage on April 3, pulling 120 pounds (55 kilos) of
gear in a two-wheeled cart, camping along the road, making about 15
miles (24 kilometers) a day. He eats rice, noodle soup,
freeze-dried camper food, but also grayling and char that he
catches and cooks with garlic butter.
	   He buys groceries and occasionally has them shipped ahead.
	   On the Dalton he made arrangements for truckers to pick up
pre-packed supplies and deliver them to him farther up the road.
Drinking water is a major concern.
	   ``Some drivers stop and invite me into their house,'' he said.
``They take me and my cart to the house and I stay one or two days
and come back to the same point on the highway, and I walk again to
the north.''
	   Word that he's coming advances up the road and people get ready
for him. Truckers, bus drivers and others slow down and swing wide
to give him room on the gravel Dalton, he said.
	   ``Many drivers _ Alyeska Pipeline and (state Department of)
Transportation workers and special crews and some tourists _ give
me food, juice, water.
	   ``Very important _ I was walking from Anchorage to Fairbanks, so
sometimes I talked to 20 drivers some days, some days 15 drivers,
some days 13 drivers. They stop and talk to me about my winter
climbing and my walking,'' Kuriaki said.
	   Last Monday he had dinner with Jack Reakoff and his family, who
live a subsistence lifestyle in the old mining town of Wiseman on
the south flank of the Brooks Range.
	   ``He's right up there with the hardiest individuals to come
through here,'' Reakoff said. ``He hadn't had meat for a while, and
we ate meat. We gave him leftover meat _ duck.''
	   With all the stopping and talking, it's a wonder Kuriaki is
making any progress. Of the 64 days between April 3 and June 5,
when he arrived in Coldfoot, he spent 40 days putting shoe rubber
to the pavement, he said.
	   When it snows or rains, he fishes or visits people.
	   He said he expects to be in Deadhorse at the end of this month
or the early part of July.

Spencer will show visitors home movies of Princess Diana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Earl Spencer says he has put together old home
movies of his late sister Princess Diana for the exhibition that
will open to the public this summer at his country estate.
	   ``We are not trying to make it a morbid experience,'' he said,
according to a magazine interview published Tuesday. ``In the last
film and the last room that people go into she is presented as
really happy.
	   ``We don't want people to come here and just be miserable,'' he
is quoted as telling Radio Times in an article about an upcoming
BBC-TV film on Spencer and Althorp House. The princess was buried
on an island at Althorp after the Aug. 31 car crash that killed
her, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver.
	   ``It was really sad, really sad, to see this little girl running
around and to know what happened to her when she became older,''
Spencer was quoted as saying, describing the home movies.
	   There was a shot in slow motion of her laughing in a boat with
her sons at an amusement park.
	   ``Although it was silent, I could really hear the laugh,''
Spencer was quoted as saying. ``It was such a joyous laugh and I
will never hear that again.''
	   ``Remembering Diana,'' to be broadcast Wednesday, includes some
of the footage from the exhibition.
	   Some critics oppose Spencer's plans for the opening of Althorp
July 1 and have said the Diana museum project is in bad taste.
	   Paula Trafford, producer of the television film, is quoted as
saying, ``What he felt was that no-one would create an exhibition
as her own family could, because they are the ones with the
memories.
	   ``There will be Diana exhibits all over the world, but at least
this is the one he could decide on. He wants to let the world know
it is tasteful.''
	   Spencer is charging visitors 9.50 pounds (dlrs 15.60) each to
enter the Althorp estate and also is staging a June 27 memorial
concert on the grounds, which some have criticized because Diana is
buried nearby.
	   But Spencer said in April that, far from raking in money as some
have alleged, he has borrowed several million pounds (dollars) to
finance the transformation of the ancestral estate into a shrine to
his sister.
	   He also pledged to make public the accounts of the memorial
museum he is building.
	   Only people with pre-purchased tickets will be able to enter
Althorp.

Lloyd-Webber cancels previews of new musical over safety concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Andrew Lloyd-Webber on Monday canceled four
preview performances of his latest musical, ``Whistle Down the
Wind,'' because of concerns about safety of the stage set.
	   ``After an accident in rigging on the set last week, I was told
that there was a one in a million chance that it could be
repeated,'' Lloyd-Webber said. ``These odds were not good enough
for me. Therefore I decided that over the past weekend additional
safety work should take place.''
	   The musical was due to begin previewing June 17, but that will
be delayed until June 22. Details of the accident were not given.
	   Opening night remains July 1 at the Aldwych Theatre in London.

Not-so-easy riders: women cyclists race in Idaho

<TEXT>
	   BOISE, Idaho (AP) _ Nicole Freedman grinds out hundreds of
kilometers each week on her featherweight racing bicycle and has
even lived out of an old van as she pursues a world championship.
	   Now comes the tough part.
	   She'll have to race 274 miles (438 kilometers) and ascend 25,000
feet (7,500 meters) in the mountains starting Tuesday in Boise at
the International Women's Challenge, the world's premier event in
women's cycling.
	   ``For us, it's a phenomenal opportunity to race against the
biggest competition in the world in our back yard,'' said Freedman,
entering her third Women's Challenge. ``The European races favor
the strongest climbers. In Idaho, you have to deal with the climbs,
time trials, strategy, everything.''
	   The race, which ends Sunday, began in 1984 and is now billed as
the richest women's cycling event, offering dlrs 100,000 in prize
money.
	   Among the 140 cyclists is 12-time world champion and Olympic
medalist Jeannie Longo of France, and 16 of the other top 25
riders. Rasa Polikeviciute of Lithuania is the defending champ.
	   With all that tough competition, the race is truly a challenge
for Freedman, of Wellesley, Mass.
	   To prepare, she has crisscrossed the continent competing and
training on grueling hill climbs and sprints toward the finish
line. The 26-year-old cyclist with Team Shaklee is first in the
individual national standings.
	   To pursue her dream _ and save money _ she's even lived out of
an old van with green carpeting at her manager's house in Palo
Alto, California. When she's not competing she designs bike paths
for Stanford, her alma mater.
	   ``It becomes a lounge when the bucket seats are turned around,''
she said of the van, which was recently replaced by an apartment.
	   Besides enduring the utter exhaustion of racing day after day,
Freedman and the other racers risk injuries in pileups of expensive
bikes and multicolored uniforms.
	   Freedman was knocked unconsciousness in one race. She spent some
fearful moments after she came to, testing whether her limbs were
still working.
	   Women's Challenge director Jim Rabdau has mapped out the
strenuous stages over the years, including this year's signature
race on Thursday. That 79-mile (126-kilometer) course begins along
the Payette River, rises precipitously to a dash across the
Sawtooth Valley and ends in another climb to Galena Summit at an
altitude of 8,600 feet (2,600 meters).
	   The six-day race, sponsored by electronics giant
Hewlett-Packard, is sandwiched between other World Cup events in
Montreal and Italy as the racers try to win enough points for the
world championship.
	   ``The Idaho race is the highlight of everyone's season,''
Freedman said. ``They treat us like superstars. For one to two
weeks out of the year, we're really treated like professional
athletes.''
	   Other challenge racers over the years have included pharmacists,
microbiologists, engineers, lawyers, teachers and, of course,
mothers.

Thousands of Canadian paper-mill workers go on strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of dispute, background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Some 5,000 employees at Canada's largest pulp and
paper company walked off the job Monday in a contract dispute.
	   The strike affected 11 of Abitibi-Consolidated's paper mills in
eastern Canada.
	   Issues in the walkout are wages, benefits and pension plan
improvements. Strikers said they were intent on maintaining a
tradition of negotiating a single contract for all the company's
eastern Canadian mills, while Abitibi-Consolidated said it would
seek separate contracts for each mill.
	   ``We cannot afford to be the only North American producer which
negotiates labor contracts at a multi-mill, multi-region bargaining
table,'' said the company in a statement.
	   Affected by the strike are four paper mills in Ontario, five in
Quebec and two in Newfoundland. Seven other mills in Canada, the
United States and Britain remained in operation, according to the
company.
	   Abitibi-Consolidated, the world's No. 1 producer of newsprint,
said its newsprint production would be at least 60 percent of
normal despite the strike.
	   In North America, the company normally controls about 16 percent
of newsprint production.
	   The Communication, Energy and Paperworkers Union is seeking a
wage increase of dlrs 1.50 (dlrs 1.02 U.S.) an hour in each year of
a three-year contract. An average worker makes about dlrs 25 (dlrs
17 U.S.) an hour.
	   The overall supply of newsprint is not expected to suffer a
major impact, in part because another big newsprint producer,
Fletcher Challenge, is just resuming production in British Columbia
after a nine-month strike.

British Columbia politician a step closer to unprecedented recall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) _ Voters in a British Columbia
legislative district took a big step Monday toward achieving the
first successful recall campaign of a Canadian elected official.
	   The target of the recall effort is Paul Reitsma, a member of the
provincial legislature who has admitted _ after initial denials _
that he wrote self-serving letters about himself to local
newspapers, using false names.
	   Reitsma refused to resign after his actions were exposed, so
citizens in his Vancouver Island district began seeking signatures
on petitions demanding that he be forced from office.
	   British Columbia is the only province that allows recall
campaigns, and it requires signatures of at least 40 percent of the
voters.
	   On Monday, organizers submitted petitions with 25,599
signatures, well over the 17,000 required.
	   If enough of the signatures are verified by authorities over the
next few weeks, Reitsma will be forced to resign and a new election
for his seat will be held. Reitsma would be eligible to run again;
he has not commented on his plans.
	   Reitsma, 50, was elected to the legislature in 1996. In April,
he admitted writing a self-congratulatory letter to a weekly
newspaper and signing it with the fictitious name Warren Betanko.
	   The letter said Reitsma was doing an ``excellent job'' as a
legislator and criticized rival politicians. It wasn't published,
but sent to a handwriting expert who concluded Reitsma wrote it.
	   Days later, Reitsma admitted writing several similar fake
letters during the last 10 years.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One man has been killed and another presumed dead
after a Royal Air Force Tornado fighter plane crashed into the
North Sea, coastguards said Monday night.
	   The wreckage of the F3 fighter was found 20 miles off the coast
of northeast England seven hours after the aircraft, which had been
on a routine training flight with two other Tornados, vanished from
radar screens.
	   Rescuers found one body, but boats were still searching for the
second crew member late Monday night after the air search was
called off because of bad weather.
	   ``It is too early to say what caused the accident,'' said a
spokesman for RAF Kinloss, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The crew of the plane were named as pilot Squadron Leader
William Michael Vivian, 33, and navigator Flight Lieutenant Derek
Stuart Lacey, also 33. The spokesman said it has not been possible
to identify the recovered body yet.

	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ NATO fighter jets thundered over the
rugged mountains along the border with Kosovo on Monday in a
rigidly choreographed show of force meant to discourage Serb
attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   Eighty-five aircraft from 13 countries took part in the
exercise, which had them skimming the rooftops of Albania's capital
and coming within 10 miles (16 kms) of the border with Kosovo. It
elated American pilots taking part _ but it disappointed refugees
from Kosovo, who said much more was needed to keep Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic from driving them out of their
villages.
	   Milosevic's Serb-led forces hardly paused in their offensive
against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, reportedly attacking
four western villages _ Prilep, Drenovac, Pobrdje and Voks _ with
helicopters, grenades and heavy shelling Monday.
	   The report, from the Albanians' Kosovo Information Center, could
not be independently confirmed because the area is sealed off to
journalists.
	   The maneuvers ``are only a signal and nothing else. Signals are
not enough to stop the violence in Kosovo,'' said Hivzi Hysa, a
Kosovo refugee who trekked over the mountains to arrive in the
Albanian border town of Padesh.
	   After the air power display, U.S. President Bill Clinton called
Boris Yeltsin, hoping that the Russian president could somehow
persuade Milosevic _ in Moscow for a two-day visit _ to stop his
offensive.
	   Although Yeltsin disagrees with NATO over its handling of the
Kosovo crisis and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev publicly
complained NATO had not adequately briefed Russia on Monday's
exercise, Moscow is expected to join Western powers in criticizing
the heavy hand Milosevic has used in putting down an ethnic
Albanian uprising.

British-Chinese police operation frees five kidnap victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A police operation involving more than 200
officers freed five Chinese kidnap victims in London on Monday,
Scotland Yard said. Forty-four suspects were arrested.
	   The victims, described by police as ordinary, poor men from
Fujian province in China, were taken to a hospital for treatment of
beating injuries.
	   None of the suspects has yet been charged. Their nationalities
were not revealed but police said the Chinese language was used in
communicating with the suspects.
	   The victims were kidnapped June 4 from a London house soon after
they arrived from China, and their captors made ransom demands of
250,000 yuan, or 20,000 pounds, (dlrs 32,600) each from their
families, police said.
	   The families would have had to raise the money from moneylenders
and would then have been in their debt for the rest of their lives,
said Detective Chief Superintendent Jeffrey Rees of the Organized
Crime Group at Scotland Yard.
	   The captors threatened to mutilate and kill the victims if their
demands were not met, and during telephone calls to the families,
the hostages were tortured, Rees said.
	   ``Police mounted a massive operation and Chinese authorities
requested our assistance there in China,'' he said. He sent three
officers to help them with their side of the operation. Chinese
police arrested one man there apparently trying to collect a
ransom.
	   Officers from Kent and Essex counties, north and south of
London, took part in raids on one London house, two houses in Kent
and four in Essex.
	   The hostages were found in the early hours of the morning at an
address in Acton, west London, sitting on the floor. Waiting
ambulances took then to a hospital where four were released after
treatment. One man remained hospitalized.
	   ``They've been through a terrible ordeal. They've suffered
dreadfully and we're now looking after them,'' Rees said.
	   No ransom money was paid, he said, adding, ``There was a major
coordinated response involving close liaison between police here,
and in China.''

South Korea's richest man to herd 500 cows into hungry North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with convoy moving into demilitarized zone awaiting
transfer, other details &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Sixty-five years ago, a 17-year-old
boy sold one of his impoverished family's cows, stole the money,
fled home and went on to become the richest man in South Korea.
	   On Tuesday, Chung Ju-yung, 82, founder and owner of the giant
Hyundai group, was to return to his hometown in North Korea,
herding 500 head of cattle as a gift across the world's most
heavily guarded border.
	   ``I always feel sorry for my father for that,'' Chung said in a
recently published autobiography, recalling the day he fled his
home in 1933. ``My heart is always filled with longing for my
father.''
	   After stealing the money from the sale of the family cow, Chung
fled to the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with the thought
of studying to become a lawyer.
	   Instead, he went into business and built Hyundai, South Korea's
largest conglomerate with more than 50 subsidiaries producing
everything from cars and computer chips to ships and steel.
	   The cattle _ 250 cows and 250 oxen _ is part of a gift Chung has
offered in exchange for an eight-day visit to North Korea. He
already has shipped 10,000 tons of corn and is committed to provide
an additional 500 cows and 40,000 tons of corn.
	   The total value of Chung's gift is estimated at 12 billion won
(dlrs 8.5 million).
	   After a nine-hour journey from Chung's ranch on the west coast,
a convoy of 50 Hyundai trucks loaded with the cattle drove into the
border village of Panmunjom awaiting transfer.
	   Each truck flew the Red Cross and Hyundai flags and carried huge
placards showing that the cows were donations from Chung.
	   Domestic television networks frequently interrupted their
regular programming to broadcast live the passage of the convoy
through Seoul and along Highway One leading to the border. People
along the streets clapped and shouted encouragement as the convoy
moved past.
	   Although the cattle will do very little to ease chronic food
shortages in North Korea, their cross-border trip was seen as a
symbolic effort to open the reclusive nation to the rest of the
world.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945 and they fought a devastating, three-year
war that ended in 1953 without a peace treaty. Their sealed border
is guarded by nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   It will be Chung's second trip to North Korea. When he visited
in 1989, his father had already died years earlier. During that
trip, he agreed to several joint venture projects with the North,
including a tourist resort.
	   Chung will be the first South Korean civilian to cross the
border into North Korea unaccompanied by government officials.
North Korea usually insists that visitors enter via Beijing or
Tokyo, almost never from South Korea.
	   Even former U.S. President Jimmy Carter had to enter North Korea
via Beijing when he traveled to the Stalinist state to meet with
its late president, Kim Il Sung, in 1994.
	   Chung will be accompanied by nine family members. Six other
members of his entourage, mostly Hyundai executives, flew to North
Korea via Beijing Monday to join the Chung family later.
	   Chung's trip comes as South Korea's new government of President
Kim Dae-jung is trying to induce its northern rival towards
reconciliation and peace.
	   Under its ``sunshine policy,'' the Kim government has pledged to
promote non-governmental exchanges between the two sides. It has
lifted virtually all restrictions on civilian business exchanges.
	   In North Korea, Chung plans to discuss, among other things, a
project to develop scenic Diamond Mount on the east coast as
another tourist destination, Hyundai officials said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ NATO fighter jets thundered over the
rugged mountains along the border with Kosovo on Monday in a
rigidly choreographed show of force meant to discourage Serb
attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. Eighty-five aircraft from 13
countries participated in the exercise, which had them skimming the
rooftops of Albania's capital and coming within 10 miles (16 kms)
of the border with Kosovo. The exercises, however, disappointed
refugees from Kosovo, who said much more was needed to keep
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from driving them out of
their villages. Milosevic's Serb-led forces hardly paused in their
offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, reportedly
attacking four western villages with helicopters, grenades and
heavy shelling. (ALBANIA-KOSOVO)
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau soldiers and rebellious
troops traded artillery and machine-gun fire in their battered
capital Monday, while thousands of refugees fled toward the borders
of the West African nation. The renewed fighting in Bissau, capital
of the former Portuguese colony, came a day after the rebels said
they were willing to end their week-long revolt if the president
steps down. A spokeswoman for the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said
loyalist troops and rebels fought in the city's downtown, but no
casualties were immediately reported. The Portuguese news agency
Lusa quoted a Bissau resident as saying 100 corpses were strewn on
the streets. The report couldn't be independently confirmed.
(GUINEA-BISSAU)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A top U.S. senator on Monday accused President
Bill Clinton of letting Beijing stage manage his upcoming visit to
China. The White House denied it and in turn called Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott's remarks ``intemperate.'' Lott, who has been
critical of the June 25-July 3 trip and of Clinton's role in
technology transfers to China, said he is ``really worried that the
president is being finessed or maneuvered by the Chinese.'' Lott
suggested pressure from the Chinese government was responsible for
Clinton's going to Tiananmen Square, for not visiting other Asian
countries on his trip and for forgoing a visit with Chinese
dissidents. Clinton's visit is the first visit of a U.S. president
since the 1989 government crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators
in Tiananmen Square. (US-CHINA)
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Within months of adopting a single
currency, European Union leaders acknowledged Monday that their
union has become an overbearing monolith to the 370 million people
under its purview. It called a summit to bolster national autonomy.
The October summit in Vienna will seek to address a problem often
voiced by previous British governments and recently taken up by
France and Germany. This week's summit in the Welsh capital,
Cardiff, was set to adopt programs to maintain low deficits and
create jobs. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the current EU
president, said that was particularly necessary now and that Europe
and the United States need to be ``twin pillars'' of stability
because of the Asian financial crisis. (EU-SUMMIT)
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England beat Tunisia, 2-0, in World Cup
soccer Monday, but less conclusive battles flared off the field,
where English and Tunisian fans brawled on the beach and outside
the stadium of this rough port city. At least 15 people were
slightly injured in Monday's violence, police said, and another,
hit on the head by a bottle, was hospitalized. Twenty-seven people
_ mostly Englishmen _ were arrested. Sporadic violence broke out
throughout the evening in the heavily policed Old Port, where
English fans were buying alcohol in supermarkets and some bars,
despite a post-match ban. The clashes came after a night of
window-smashing violence at the Old Port left 36 people in the
hospital, three of them badly hurt, and at least 50 Englishmen,
Tunisians and Frenchmen in jail. (FRANCE-WORLD CUP-STREET BATTLES)

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials plunged more than 200 points
Monday, hitting a three-month low, as an increasingly grim outlook
on Japanese recovery efforts spurred another jittery exodus from
world stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial average sank about
207 points to 8,627, its biggest point loss since early January and
the lowest finish since March 13. Broader stock indicators also
tumbled as nervous currency traders sent the Japanese yen down to
an 8-year low against the dollar, further complicating efforts to
revive Japan's economy, the second biggest in the world. Monday's
loss sliced the Dow's gain for 1998 to 9 percent, down from a peak
of 16.5 percent at May 13 record close of 9,211.84. (US-CLOSING
STOCKS)
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ EU governments pledged Monday to stick
with high-growth economic policies as British Prime Minister Tony
Blair warned that turmoil in Russia and Asia present the global
economy with ``its greatest risk for two decades.'' While Japan's
recession will hurt European exports, finance ministers meeting in
the margin of an EU summit saw a positive side: Stagnation
elsewhere will help keep European interest rates and import prices
down, boosting domestic demand and investment. The finance
ministers urged Russia and Japan to quickly restore market and

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Negotiations resumed Monday at two General Motors
Corp. parts plants in an effort to end strikes there and avoid a
virtual shutdown of the automaker's vast North American assembly
operations. About 9,200 workers at the Flint Metal Center and
Delphi Flint East plants in Flint, Michigan, are on strike over
fears that GM wants to reduce jobs at both plants or eventually
close them. The first strike began June 5 at the Metal Center, a
stamping plant that makes sheet-metal body parts for GM's full-size
cars and light trucks. It and the Delphi strike, which began
Thursday have led to the layoffs of more than 56,000 GM workers at
13 assembly plants and 65 parts plants in the United States, Mexico
and Canada. (US-GM-STRIKE)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Goldman, Sachs and Co., Wall Street's last major
private investment bank, is ending its 129-year partnership by
selling as much as 15 percent of itself to the public. Goldman
Sachs' executive committee decided unanimously to propose the
initial public stock offering and its partners expressed
overwhelming support for the idea over the weekend, according to a
statement released Monday. The offering will probably occur this
fall and represent 10 percent to 15 percent of the firm's stock. No
price was disclosed in the announcement, but it has been estimated
that a public offering could value the company somewhere between
dlrs 20 billion and dlrs 30 billion. A public offering would give
Goldman the currency it needs to buy other companies and strengthen
areas where it is weak, leveling the playing field with rapidly
expanding competitors. (US-GOLDMAN SACHS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will chair an expanded
Cabinet meeting next week on measures to combat Russia's financial
crisis and stabilize the markets, the presidential press service
said Monday. The June 23 meeting will also be attended by members
of both houses of parliament, the press service said, according to
the Interfax news agency. On Monday, Yeltsin discussed the measures
with the speaker of parliament's upper house, Yegor Stroyev,
Interfax said. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko will
present the government's anti-crisis program at an economic forum
in St. Petersburg on Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted
the speaker of the parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov, as
saying. The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, had earlier
been scheduled to discuss the anti-crisis program on Wednesday, and
Kiriyenko was expected to attend. But the debate has been called
off, Seleznyov said. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

	   LONDON (AP) _ Brooke Shields accepted ``very substantial'' libel
damages and a public apology over a newspaper article that falsely
reported she was questioned by police about drugs as she left the
Cannes Film Festival.
	   During a court appearance Monday, lawyers for the actress and
The Mail on Sunday said her lawsuit over the May 24 story had been
settled.
	   The amount of the damages was not disclosed.
	   The story said Shields' luggage was searched and her flight at
the Nice Airport delayed while French police questioned her.
	   After the actress sued, the newspaper published a front-page
apology and retraction. The retraction said the story was false and
conceded Miss Shields had not even been stopped.

	   SANTA CLARA, California (AP) _ Patrick Stewart, who plays Capt.
Jean-Luc Picard on ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' sent
graduating seniors at Santa Clara University into the real world
with this advice: ``Make it so.''
	   During his commencement speech Saturday to the 920 students, the
actor cautioned against focusing strictly on success and results.
	   ``The path is complex and sometimes hidden,'' he said. ``Only by
responding to that inner voice can one's life and worth be
authentic.''
	   His three parting words _ usually reserved for the Picard
character in the midst of an interstellar crisis _ drew a whooping
standing ovation.

	   LONDON (AP) _ When Nelson Mandela told Queen Elizabeth II on
Monday she was looking very well, the 72-year-old monarch replied:
``I'm my mother's daughter.''
	   Queen Mother Elizabeth entered the record books Monday as the
oldest royal in British history _ 97 years and 315 days _ passing
the longevity record held by Queen Victoria's granddaughter
Princess Alice, who died in 1981.
	   Mandela visited the queen at Windsor Castle en route to the
European Union summit in Cardiff, Wales.
	   The South African president started the day at a breakfast to
raise money for the Nelson Mandela Children's Home Fund, which
provides education and training for homeless and abused youngsters.
	   The 60 guests included entrepreneur Richard Branson, boxers
Lennox Lewis and Chris Eubank, singer Joan Armatrading and lyricist
Sir Tim Rice.
	   ___
	   ROSEBURG, Orgon (AP) _ A jury verdict handed down in Douglas
County sends this stern message to would-be gardeners: Don't drink
and mow.
	   Jereme Quinten Pinedo, 22, was convicted Friday of piloting his
green 15-horsepower Craftsman lawn mower under the influence of
alcohol. He was also found guilty of driving with a suspended
license.
	   Two sheriff's officers testified that they were on patrol the
night of Feb. 7 when they came upon Pinedo and a friend.
	   ``We came around the corner and saw two sets of headlights real
close together,'' Sgt. Dan Hoy said. ``When we got close, it was
two gentlemen _ each on a riding lawn mower.''
	   Pinedo testified that he and his friend were just turning their
mowers around, but deputies said they watched the pair for at least
10 seconds before pulling them over.
	   That's when they said they smelled alcohol on Pinedo's breath.
Pinedo refused a field breath test, but a test taken an hour later
showed a blood alcohol content of 0.15 percent, said Hoy's partner,
Deputy Ben Kempke.
	   Oregon's legal standard for intoxication is .08 percent.
	   Pinedo will be sentenced on Wednesday.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ It was a dream date for entomologists _ and a
nightmare for the squeamish.
	   At the 12th annual Insect Fair _ billed as the largest insect
event in the United States _ thousands of adults and children got
up close and personal with our creepy friends.
	   Tracy Hamel, 6, favored a tarantula. ``It's furry. I could scare
my brother with it,'' she said with a laugh.
	   Said 7-year-old Breeana Rhone as she squirmed in front of a bug
collection: ``I don't mind looking at them but I don't want to
touch them.''
	   The two-day event at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County ended Sunday. Among the displays were hundreds of preserved
butterflies and beetles, 2.5 million dead mosquitos in a gallon
container, frogs and an emperor scorpion.
	   John Valentine, an exhibitor, offered visitors a chance to
handle his two large millipedes from Africa _ named Milli and
Vanilli. He also put his creatures to the test in a foot race
across the table.
	   Vanilli won by default _ Milli stopped to groom himself.

Nigeria's new military leader reaches out to opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leader has sent a
clear signal to the opposition and foreign critics that he wishes
to distance himself from his predecessor by releasing nine of the
country's most prominent political prisoners.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar's order Monday for the immediate
release of the prisoners came exactly a week after Gen. Sani Abacha
died of a heart attack.
	   Abacha's treatment of dissidents during his
five-year-dictatorship left the oil-rich west African country an
international pariah and Abubakar's decision signaled that he was
reaching out to Nigeria's opposition and foreign critics.
	   The prisoners were being held in far-flung jails across this
sprawling, poverty-stricken country and it was not immediately
clear exactly when they would return home.
	   The prisoners ordered freed include such well-known figures as
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979
and Beko Ransome-Kuti, a pro-democracy activist jailed since 1995.
	   But Nigeria's best-known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not on the list.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the immediate release of some detainees
and prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation
and reconstruction,'' David Atta, Abubakar's press secretary, said
in a statement. He added that other prisoners ``would be given
consideration from time.''
	   In releasing the prisoners, the new military leader urged those
granted amnesty to ``cooperate'' with the government to create
``the country of our dreams.''
	   Abubakar also appealed to the international community to
appreciate the regime's efforts ``at solving our problems and show
greater understanding and sensitivity to our internal affairs.''
	   In Washington, the White House applauded the prisoners' release.
	   ``We hope this important step will lead to further releases and
will help all Nigerians come together to work to support a credible
and open transition to civilian democratic government,'' national
security spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
	   Abacha's treatment of Nigeria's dissidents, particularly the
1995 execution of author and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa,
isolated his country. While still able to sell its oil, Nigeria's
leaders were not even able to get visas to many Western countries.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, an attorney and one of Nigeria's most vocal
critics of military rule praised the announcement as a ``joyous
step towards reconciliation.''
	   Moves made by Abubakar's nascent regime have been closely
scrutinized by Nigeria's opposition as well as other nations.
	   He recently angered the opposition by making only a vague pledge
to follow through on Abacha's highly flawed political transition
program, which is to culminate in an Oct. 1 transition to civilian
rule. His regime also quickly moved to quash pro-democracy protests
during last week's anniversary of the annulled elections Abiola is
believed to have won.
	   But he also reportedly met with one of Abiola's wives, and those
arrested during the protests were quickly released, a significant
change from the days of Abacha, when prisoners could disappear for
years at a time.
	   The prisoners to be freed were:
	   _ Obasanjo, who had been sentenced to 15 years for treason.
Obasanjo voluntarily relinquished the presidency after an election
and became a formidable Abacha critic. He was released on
compassionate grounds and will initially be confined to his farm.
	   _ Ransome-Kuti, who had been sentenced to 15 years for being an
``accessory after the fact to treason.'' A doctor and a brother of
the late Afrobeat music star Fela, Ransome-Kuti was ordered freed
for health reasons.
	   _ Frank Kokori and Milton Dabibi, leaders of Nigeria's Oil
Workers Union. They have been detained since an oil workers' strike
in 1994. No charges were filed against them.
	   _ Ibrahim Dasuki, the deposed sultan of the town of Sokoto and
an Islamic leader. He has been held without charge since 1996.
	   _ Bola Ige, a former state governor imprisoned without charges
after anti-Abacha riots May 1 in the city of Kaduna.
	   _ Chris Ayanwu, editor in chief of Quest, an independent
magazine critical of Abacha's regime. She has been held since 1995.
	   _ Olabintan Durojaiye, a lawyer and critic of the Abacha regime
held without charge since last year.
	   _ Uwen Udo, a pro-democracy politician detained without charge
since 1997.

World Cup: Romania beats Colombia 1-0

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Romania isn't lacking fresh talent. Adrian
Ilie proved it with a superb goal for a 1-0 victory over Colombia
in their Group G opener.
	   Ilie's goal gave the Romanians a solid chance to qualify for the
second round in the group that also includes England and Tunisia.
	   The former Steaua Bucharest star, who exploded onto the scene
this year as a forward both in Spain and for his country, placed a
magnificent chip shot in the 44th minute from some 15 meters
(yards) that sailed over goalkeeper Farid Mondragon into the net.
	   ``It was important for us to start with a win. Our team has a
good balance of experienced and young players who bring boldness
and life. I hope to score more goals (in France),'' said the
24-year-old Valencia striker.
	   Ilie's goal poured cold water over Colombian efforts to avenge
their 3-1 loss to Romania at the '94 World Cup.
	   ``The victory has a great psychological importance for us,
because this was the opening game and also because we fielded
several young, less experienced players. This implied certain
risks,'' Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu said.
	   He replaced veteran midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, 32, with
25-year-old Lucian Marinescu of Rapid Bucharest, because of Hagi's
poor showing. He was only a shadow of the player who enchanted the
fans at the '94 World Cup in the United States. The Romanian has
already announced that he will retire after France.
	   The Romanians set the pace for much of the match. In contrast,
Colombia struggled to maintain possession despite occasional
flashes of technical excellence.
	   Colombia nearly tied the game in the 85th minute when
replacement Adolfo Valencia stretched Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan
Stelea for a diving save to his right with his shot from 30 meters
(yards).
	   Colombia started the game briskly but its passing was ragged and
easily intercepted by the Romanians, who quickly established
midfield dominance.
	   ``Despite losing, we are happy with the game. We felt good when
we were in posesssion. Our team did its best,'' midfielder Freddy
Rincon said.
	   In the other Group G game Monday, England beat Tunisia 2-0.

World Cup: With Klinsmann red hot, Germany strong
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Juergen Klinsmann is one of the German veterans,
Jens Jeremies is the youngest players on the oldest team in the
tournament. Two brilliant moves by Klinsmann and the solid work of
Jeremies paced Germany to a 2-0 victory over the United States.
	   Klinsmann, the 33-year-old German captain, was red hot at the
start of his third and last World Cup tournament as Germany won its
opener Monday.
	   He set up one German goal and scored the other. Jeremies, 24,
effectively marked U.S. play maker Claudio Reyna out of the game.
	   ``We started very well but failed to keep the early pace,''
Klinsmann said. ``I am feeling very good because I feel fit,
aggressive and lively. I feel confident and the proof is that I set
up one goal and scored another.''
	   Germany scored in the ninth minute when Olaf Thon swung over a
corner from the left, Klinsmann got above two American defenders to
head into the danger area and Moeller nodded the ball home from six
meters past the slow-reacting defender Mike Burns.
	   Somewhat against the run of play, Klinsmann made it 2-0 in the
65th.
	   The German captain, who scored five goals in the 1994 World Cup,
chested down a perfect cross from Oliver Bierhoff and volleyed home
from 12 meters.
	   Klinsmann also had two goals in 1990, when Germany won the World
Cup for the third time.
	   But he's had a rough season behind him. Struggling with injuries
and form, Klinsmann was even dropped from Germany's friendly
against Nigeria in April.
	   But coach Berti Vogts is loyal to his veteran players and
Klinsmann proved worth the trust.
	   ``Surely it wasn't our best game, but the important thing are
the three points,'' Klinsmann said. ``Before the game, we weren't
really sure where we stood. But the victory makes us optimistic
about the future.''
	   Jeremies, who was born in former East Germany and only made the
team this year, knocked down Reyna early in the game and never
really let the American have much space to create. That was exactly
the German game plan.
	   Sometimes a bit too enthusiastic in his tackling, Jeremies
earned a yellow card in the 28th minute.
	   ``It was his first World Cup game and he got carried away. I
warned him to remain calm and to try to block Reyna, not attack him
directly in the second half. And it was such blocking that led to
our second goal,'' Vogts said.
	   Vogts found faults with his team. ``We lost our order a little
bit in the second half. We have to be able to change pace even more
and to close the space better.''
	   Germany, seeking to match Brazil's four World Cup titles, next
plays Yugoslavia on Sunday in Lens in a match likely to decide the
winner of Group F.

World Cup: Akita says Mboma better than Batistuta, Croatia
</HEADLINE>
beatable &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Defender Yutaka Akita had quite an
initiation at Japan's World Cup debut, going one-on-one against
Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta.
	   His impression? No sweat, he said Monday.
	   ``I did not feel Batistuta was someone you couldn't stop,'' he
told reporters after returning to training camp from Toulouse,
where Japan lost 1-0 on Batistuta's goal Sunday.
	   In fact, he added, Batistuta wasn't anywhere as quick as
Cameroon's Patrick Mboma, who plays for J-League's Gamba Osaka.
Akita, who plays for J-League's Kashima Antlers, has played against
Mboma often.
	   ``And he wasn't all that big,'' he said of Batistuta.
	   Obviously proud that Japan had not allowed Batistuta more than
one goal, Akita said he was able to do so well because he had
studied the Argentine.
	   ``I knew what he was going to do, so he couldn't do it,'' he
said. ``My approach is to erase my opponents' strengths. If he
can't carry out his best plays, he just becomes another player.''
	   Like the rest of his team, Akita has now switched to thinking
about the next game, against Croatia on Saturday.
	   ``They have many talented players, but it's not a team we can't
beat,'' he said.
	   Akita noted that Japan had beaten Croatia once, 4-3 at the Kirin
Cup in Japan last year. But that Croat team was missing Davor Suker
as well as Zvonimir Boban.
	   Japan opened its practice to reporters and fans at the training
camp for the first time in days.
	   But most of the starters took it easy, jogging and volleying the
ball. The reserves spent most of the time on shooting practice.
	   Toward the end, coach Takeshi Okada took some shots himself,
drawing cheers from the stands when he made a goal.
	   After practice, Okada said that Japan would slightly change the
offensive lineup against Croatia, although it would keep the same
basic strategy.

World Cup: Racial slurs, abuse, taunts, spittle; anything goes for
</HEADLINE>
provocation &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When superior play cannot beat an opponent, there
is always provocation. And it continues to pay.
	   Over the years, even some of the calmest players have lashed out
after the flood of racial slurs, abuse, taunts or spittle became
simply unbearable.
	   Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert is serving a two-match suspension
at the World Cup after he was sent off for thumping his elbow in
the chest of Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens on Saturday, unable
to resist a personal insult even though a World Cup game was on the
line.
	   ``This was the worst that I have ever heard,'' said Kluivert.
	   It has driven men to worse things than a thump in the chest.
	   Two years ago, former world player of the year George Weah
headbutted an opponent after the Liberian faced two games of racial
slurs during a European Cup competition. Weah was served a six game
suspension, his opponent went unpunished but for a broken nose.
	   Weah called it ``a moment of craziness through provocation.''
	   It's a scenario that repeats itself time and again, almost
always victimizing the victim of foul-mouthed provocation.
	   ``It's a scandal,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet, siding with
victims like Kluivert. ``The provocateurs are the winners,'' he
said.
	   He should be so lucky to have a cool defender like Marcel
Desailly on his squad. In a vital European Championship game two
years ago, Ghanian-born Desailly was racially taunted for the whole
game by Bulgarian star Hristo Stoichkov.
	   Desailly didn't get mad, didn't get even. He controlled himself
and France beat Bulgaria on its way to a semifinal place.
	   ``The only point was to destabilize the player, and if Desailly
would have reacted, he would have been sent off,'' said Jacquet.
For Stoichkov, it was little more than a shoulder shrug _ ``It is
normal,'' he said.
	   Unfortunately, he is right. It still happens in the world's most
prestigious league, Italy's Serie A.
	   Veterans like Dutchman Aron Winter and Paul Ince have complained
about it and Weah continues to face it. At a recent league game
though, it wasn't him but the abusing defender who cracked,
elbowing Weah and being sent off.
	   Insults and provocation are no stranger to the World Cup too.
	   At an especially bad-tempered Germany-Netherlands game at the
1990 World Cup, insults galore flew between Germany's Rudy Voeller
and Frank Rijkaard, culminating with the Dutchman spitting into
Voeller's hair. Both were thrown out of the game.
	   Now Rijkaard is assistant coach of the Dutch and supervises
Kluivert.
	   ``You must learn from these things,'' he said of Kluivert's
reaction. ``The most important thing is that it doesn't happen
again,'' he said.
	   But for Kluivert, much of his World Cup might be over by the
time he is allowed back in.
	   Indications from Kluivert and Staelens are that the offending
comments centered on the Dutchman's private problems.
	   The controversial AC Milan striker has already been convicted
for killing a driver in a vehicular homicide and has had to face
accusations of gang raping a woman. The latter case never came to
court.
	   ``It had nothing to do with racism,'' said Staelens, implicitly
recognizing his provocations.
	   When Kluivert walked toward him wagging his finger, Staelens
waited and plunged to the ground writhing in pain after Kluivert
lightly shoved his chest.
	   The referee consulted his linesman and sent Kluivert off. It
gave Belgium a dozen minutes of breathing room to escape with a 0-0
draw.
	   Hearing that Kluivert earned a two-game suspension on top of the
red card, Staelens said ``I'm sorry that I fell so theatrically...
I'm willing to apologize for it.''
	   However, Staelens said, the insults were hardly one-way traffic
Saturday night. ``I'm not going to take all blame for this. It came
from both sides.''

World Cup: Shearer, Scholes open World Cup accounts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By MORLEY MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLES, France (AP) _ England captain Alan Shearer has
already established himself among the goal-scoring giants. So it
was no surprise when the 27-year-old Newcastle striker launched
England's Group G World Cup campaign by adding to his tally in a
2-0 victory over Tunisia on Monday.
	   But the player who scored England's other goal, Manchester
United's Paul Scholes, is still comparatively unknown, having made
just eight international appearances.
	   However, he has already culled four goals in an England shirt,
compared to Shearer's 18 from 50 appearances, and is seen as a
potential star of this World Cup.
	   Scholes' buzzing performance against the Tunisians could have
been stamped by a hat-trick, but the 23-year-old striker was twice
foiled by goalkeeper Chokri El Ouaer in the first half.
	   That was all forgotten in the 89th minute, however, when he
netted with a fiercely driven, curling right-footer.
	   ``It is the highlight of my career,'' Scholes said. ``I was
disappointed at missing the other two chances, but when I scored it
made up for all of that.''
	   Scholes' performance earned plaudits from no less of an expert
than teammate Shearer.
	   ``He scored from the most difficult chance. Another day, he'd
get a hat-trick. He's a tremendous little player. He's got great
quality. If he needed to prove anything, he did it today,'' the
England captain said.
	   When England's flawed soccer genius Paul Gascoigne was dropped
from the World Cup squad, Scholes was given the vacant spot in
midfield.
	   ``People are looking at him to fill Paul Gascoigne's role and if
this was a test, he came through it with flying colors,'' Shearer
said.
	   ``He's a smashing little player. He loves to get into the hole
and go at people. He can cause problems to any defense and I hope
he can cause more problems than anyone else in the tournament. I
don't want to put him under pressure, but he's a great little
player.''
	   As for Shearer himself, it was business as usual. Shearer, the
top goal scorer in the 1996 European Championships, had one scoring
chance and took it brilliantly with a 43rd minute header.
	   ``It takes a bit of pressure off me,'' Shearer said.
``Everyone's saying I'll score the goals. It's nice to get off the
mark, that's one out of one. That will take a bit of pressure off
for a couple of days.''
	   Against Tunisia, Shearer, Scholes and their teammates too much
for a team expected to go home after its three first-round matches.
	   ``If we lost, it is because England has a very good midfield
with a strong link with the two strikers,'' said Tunisia's coach,
Henry Kasperczak.

World Cup: Fans clash as England beats Tunisia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The scoreline read England 2, Tunisia 0. Outside
the stadium it was Injured 15, Arrested 27.
	   What happened inside the Velodrome in Marseille gave England's
coach, players and peaceful followers plenty to be pleased about.
	   What happened outside was nothing to do with soccer but
everything to do with a World Cup.
	   The English, armed with their reputations as soccer louts, were
in town to meet Tunisia in a Group G game and that meant frequent
clashes with northern Africans from the rough areas of Marseille
with rows of French police battling to get in between.
	   On a day Germany downed the United States 2-0 in Paris and
Romania edged Colombia 1-0, England was making the headlines for
the wrong reasons.
	   After Sunday nights clashes, it was tense all day in the Old
Port Monday as English fans bought alcohol in supermarkets and some
bars despite a post-match ban. Bars were ordered to close hours
earlier than normal and not sell alcohol.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas on a beach to break up clashes
between English and Tunisian supporters watching the afternoon
match on a huge TV screen set up for people who lacked tickets to
the game.
	   As fans arrived at the game, English and Tunisians began
taunting each other, fighting broke again and police moved in to
arrest the ringleaders.
	   Over two days of street violence 36 people have been
hospitalized, three of them badly hurt, and some 50 Englishmen,
Tunisians and Frenchmen were detained in jail. One Englishman had
an artery cut in his neck, and a policeman suffered multiple
fractures.
	   The hooliganism was condemned all around.
	   ``What these fans are doing is that they come to a game to
fight, to cause trouble, to make war,'' said former Brazilian star
Pele. ``This is disgusting. The security, the police, should act
quickly to put these people in jail as an example to others.''
	   In England, Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned as a ``complete
disgrace'' the rampaging English fans.
	   ``It may be a very small minority of English fans and it may be
that other people were involved, but there is absolutely no excuse
for it,'' Blair said. ``They are a complete disgrace to England ...
and they have just got to put a stop to it.''
	   There was no trouble inside the stadium where Alan Shearer put
England ahead three minutes before halftime and Paul Scholes fired
a long-range second in the final minute.
	   ``We could have scored three or four goals,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said. ``We could have taken them to the cleaners.''
	   That goal put England atop the Group G standings ahead of
Romania on goal difference. The Romanians edged Colombia 1-0 with a
goal by Adrian Ilie in first half injury time.
	   Romania also downed the Colombians 3-1 at the last World Cup in
the United States four years ago.
	   Germany had the ideal start with a ninth-minute Andy Moeller
headed goal against the Americans at the Parc des Princes. Juergen
Klinsmann, currently without a club after leaving Tottenham at the
end of the season, set up the first and then fired the second in
the 65th minute to maintain his astonishing record of scoring in
World Cup first round games.
	   Klinsmann, who scored four times in Germany's three opening
round games in the U.S. four years ago and twice in 1990 group
matches, has hit the target in six of Germany's last seven first
round matches.
	   The second round of group games started Tuesday with cup
favorite Brazil facing Morocco in Nantes and Scotland meeting
Norway at Bordeaux.
	   A Brazilian win, after its 2-1 success over Scotland on the
opening day, would clinch a second round place. Wins for Brazil and
Norway would mean that Scotland would go out in the first round for
the eighth time. The Scots have never made it to round two.

France, Nigeria impress in opening games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ They've all played one game and, if early results
are a clue, France or Nigeria will score a first World Cup triumph.
	   Brazil has the talent but needs more consistency if it is to
make it two titles in a row and five overall. Otherwise sure-footed
Germany looks in the mood to tie Brazil's record of four.
	   Of other contenders, Spain's confidence likely will be shattered
by a 3-2 loss to Nigeria having led twice. Argentina and Yugoslavia
labored to 1-0 victories over comparitive minnows and don't look
like title candidates yet.
	   Italy has made its usual shaky start and, fortunately for the
Azzuri, Roberto Baggio, who fired in a late penalty for a 2-2 tie,
has resumed where he left off in 1994, when he almost
single-handedly got his team to the final.
	   England, playing against a distracting background of rioting
fans outside the stadium, should have hit Tunisia for five instead
of 2-0 and needed a last minute strike by Paul Scholes to make the
scoreline look respectable.
	   England captain Alan Shearer led his team to a 2-0 victory over
Tunisia in Marseille Monday but it will face bigger foes in Romania
and Colombia before its potential as titlists is known.
	   The Dutch missed a slew of chances against the Belgians in a 0-0
tie and continue to look lightweight contenders while neither
Romania nor Colombia impressed in a 1-0 win for the Romanians.
	   Bulgaria, a fourth place finisher four years ago, doesn't look
like going close to that after a 0-0 tie with Paraguay, whose only
threat came from a free kick by goalscoring goalkeeper Jose Luis
Chilavert.
	   Of the outsiders, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Japan,
Scotland and Morocco look tougher to beat than expected but will
struggle to make it to round two.
	   South Africa, beaten 3-0 by the French, appears out of its depth
and Jamaica, a 3-1 loser to Croatia, needs to shore up a flimsy
defense.
	   As expected, Croatia looks the strongest of the four debutants
and looks capable of beating stronger teams than Jamaica.
	   Only five goals in three games Monday slowed the scoring spree
of the previous five days. But Brazilian star Pele says the signs
remain good.
	   ``We have a lot of teams who are prepared to play open
football,'' said Pele, who won three World Cup titles with Brazil
in 1958, '62 and 70 and is regarded as the finest player of all
time.
	   ``We have seen a lot of goals which is good for the fans and for
the game. People go to see goals and we have seen some surprises.
	   ``Spain has shown it was one of the strongest teams in the world
but it was beaten by Nigeria which wasn't expected to be as strong
as before,'' Pele said.
	   ``Another surprise was Japan's performance against Argentina
which was expected to win by many goals.''
	   The French played some sparking soccer against debutant South
Africa in Marseille and the 3-0 victory didn't look flattering.
That result and performance have lifted a lot of the initial
pressure placed on coach Aime Jacquet and his players by an
expectant French public.
	   Defending titlist Brazil has a huge array of talent and coach
Mario Zagallo can't fit them all in. Substitute Denilson had a
dazzling last 15 minutes against the Scots after he entered the
game in the 2-1 win over Scotland and his dribbling skills even
eclipsed the ever menacing Ronaldo.
	   ``We don't have the pattern right yet,'' Pele said. ``The team
has three great attacking players on the bench and I think he
should start Edmundo, Ronaldo and Denilson.''
	   With Juergen Klinsmann scoring for the sixth round round game
out of seven to maintain his amazing scoring record, the Germans
cruised to a 2-0 victory over the United States who will struggle
to make it to round two.
	   Mexico was helped hugely by an expulsion as it turned around a
1-0 deficit to beat the Koreans 3-1. Tougher tests against Belgium
and the Netherlands are to come.
	   Norway's confidence will be dented by a 2-2 tie with Morocco and
can't afford to lose to Scotland and Denmark must sharpen up its
strikeforce after relying on defender Marc Rieper's header to down
the Saudis 1-0.
	   After the first wave of games, the only clear group leaders on
points are Brazil, Nigeria and Mexico.
	   France leads Denmark on goal difference in Group C and Germany
edges Yugoslavia in Group F. England is above Romania in Group G
while Croatia has a goals advantage over Argentina in Group H.
	   The most complicated group in B with all four teams, Italy,
Chile, Cameroon and Austria all tied on one point after two tied
games.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A soccer fan could win 1.2 million pounds (dlrs 2
million) if the Netherlands wins the World Cup.
	   A spokesman for bookmaker William Hill said two 60,000-pound
(dlrs 98,400) bets had been placed at odds of 10-1 at separate
William Hill shops.
	   William Hill and rivals Ladbrokes both said England fans were
not putting money on England to win the World Cup even though the
2-0 win over Tunisia on Monday shortened the odds from 10-1 to 8-1.
	   In more betting news, British Sports Minister Tony Banks placed
a 1,000-pound (dlrs 1,640) bet on England to win the World Cup. The
money for the bet was supplied by Ladbrokes, and the money will go
to charity if England wins.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Iran has sent five generals of the Pasdaran
revolutionary guards to France for the Iran-United States soccer
match on June 21, according to a fax released by Iran's top exiled
armed opposition group, Iraqi-based Mujahedeen.
	   ``The generals are accompanied by a group of special forces from
the guard corps. By sending them to France, the regime seeks to
prevent extensive participation of Iranian refugees and supporters
of the Mudjahedeen in the World Cup games,'' said the fax from
Mudjahedeen's France based national council of resistance.
	   The statement also alleged that Iranian diplomats had met with
French authorities to demand that opponents of the Iranian
government be banned from going to games.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian officials were puzzled by reports
that Joao Havelange criticized the referee who awarded Italy a
decisive penalty kick in last Thursday's World Cup match against
Chile.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA on Monday quoted Havelange as
saying that referee Lucien Bouchardeau made ``an unlucky mistake''
ruling that Chile's Ronald Fuentes deliberately played the ball
with his hand. Bouchardeau awarded Italy the late penalty,
converted by Roberto Baggio for a 2-2 draw.
	   ``I can't believe he made such remarks, he's a very cautious
man,'' said Italian Federation president Luciano Nizzola.
	   Havelange is retiring as president of world soccer governing
body FIFA at the end of the World Cup.
	   ``The Chilean defender clearly hit the ball inside the penalty
area,'' said Italian captain Paolo Maldini. ``It was a kind of
hands that 50 percent of referees usually punish.''
	   Maldini also said that the referee, on his World Cup debut,
``was more nervous than we players before the kickoff.''
	   Midfielder Dino Baggio said he was afraid that the controversy
may have negative effects on Italy.
	   ``I'm afraid that Italy risks a penalty against in the next
match as a compensation for the alleged favors received in the
match with Chile,'' Dino Baggio said.
	   Christian Vieri said the controversy was groundless.
	   ``It was penalty, without any doubt. I can't understand
criticism on the referee,'' he added.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British Telecom lines went quiet during Monday's
World Cup match between England and Tunisia.
	   BT said 16 million fewer calls were made in a 2 1/2-hour span
before and during the game than were made during the same period a
week ago.
	   However, the number of calls jumped by 100,000 when Alan Shearer
scored England's opening goal in the 2-0 victory.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Rescuers have found the body of a second
victim drowned when a boat carrying American tourists sank off the
coast of the Galapagos Islands last week, authorities said Monday.
	   The search for two more passengers continued, said Lt. Jacinto
Trivino, the captain of the port of Puerto Ayora, one of the
Galapagos Islands.
	   The body of Donna Robert, 75, was found Sunday after it washed
up on a beach on Isabela island, part of island chain 110
kilometers (70 miles) from where the boat sank Wednesday night,
said Trivino.
	   Rescuers had earlier found the body of Diane Sayre, 70, and are
looking for Lyon Zeiler, 75, and Richard Sayre, 80, he said.
	   U.S. Embassy officials said they would not confirm the victims'
names or home towns until their families have been notified.
	   One of the 11 passengers who was rescued from the shipwreck
suffered serious injury, Trivino said. Eight crewmen also survived.
	   The chartered boat, called the ``Moby Dick,'' sank after sea
conditions changed suddenly and two large waves swamped the boat
near the island of Santa Fe, part of the Galapagos archipelago, the
country's major tourist attraction.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Residents of a small
Indian village in southern Mexico have jailed their mayor and two
of his top aides, angry that no public projects have been completed
since he took office last year.
	   About 1,000 residents of San Miguel Mitontic, 55 kilometers (35
miles) west of San Cristobal de las Casas, locked up Mayor
Sebastian Rodriguez Jimenez and his aides on Sunday night.
	   The villagers demanded the mayor explain why none of the public
works projects planned for the municipality have been completed.
	   They also wanted to know what he had done with the state and
federal money given to the municipality, according to Francisco de
Mesa Hernandez, an indigenous justice official of the Mexican
government.
	   De Mesa said members of the state legislature would visit
Mitontic to negotiate the mayor's release.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's Pacaya volcano has spewed ash
and lava as high as 1,200 meters (4,000 feet) into the air over the
weekend, but officials said Monday that a small cloud of gas
remaining in the crater posed no danger.
	   Winds carried the debris southward over three towns Sunday, but
the eruption was not serious enough to prompt evacuations, said
Eddy Sanchez, director of the local Seismological Station.
	   A yellow alert signaling caution was in effect for the region
Monday and emergency crews were on hand to help residents if
necessary.
	   Pacaya, 20 kilometers (15 miles) south of Guatemala City and
2,560 meters (8,420 feet) above sea level, erupted violently on May
20, spewing tons of sand and ash which blanketed nearby cities and
the capital.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Quito's conservative mayor, Jamil Mahuad,
leads banana tycoon Alvaro Noboa by more than 30 points in the
runup to the second round of Ecuador's presidential elections,
according to a poll released Monday.
	   Mahuad was the choice for president of 60 percent of those
polled, compared to Noboa, who had 29 percent support, according to
a poll by the private company Market. The vote will be held on July
12.
	   Mahuad topped five other candidates in the first round of voting
on May 31, receiving 35 percent of the votes. Noboa received 26
percent. Since no candidate won an outright majority, a runoff vote
was called.
	   The candidacy of Noboa, a populist who has promised to create
jobs for the poor and give ``a kick in the pants'' to the country's
political elite, has generated fears of more political chaos in
Ecuador.
	   Noboa is the scion of Ecuador's richest family, and has the
backing of the Roldosista party of disgraced former President
Abdala Bucaram.
	   Bucaram, known as ``El Loco'' or ``The Crazy One'' for his
eccentric behavior, was removed from office by Congress in February
1997 for ``mental incapacity'' amid street protests and charges of
corruption.
	   Market polled 1,200 people in Ecuador's four largest provinces
last week with a margin for error of plus or minus three percent.

New Zealand, Australian markets lower after Wall Street drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Shares in New Zealand and
Australia fell in early trading Tuesday, weighed down by the sharp
fall in U.S., European and Asian stock markets, brokers said.
	   In New Zealand, at 11:00 a.m. (2230 GMT Monday) the NZSE-40
capital index was down 31.86 points at 1966.85, compared with
Monday's close of 1998.71.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at
8,627.93 Monday, down 207.01 points from 8,834.94 Friday and
hitting a three-month low. Prices were driven down as investor
pessimism over the outlook for Japanese recovery efforts.
	   In Australia, the all ordinaries index was 41.7 points lower at
2525.8 shortly after opening at 10:00 a.m (0000 GMT).
	   Brokers predicted the drop on the Dow overnight would further
weaken local sentiment that has already been depressed by continued
regional currency and stock market softness.
	   ``It's a pretty gloomy market at this stage ... we've already
had evidence of a bit of panic selling from some smaller
investors,'' broker Jon Hancock said.
	   Turnover on both markets was boosted Monday by the debut of
insurance and funds manager AMP Ltd. on the New Zealand and
Australian stock exchanges Monday.
	   But ANZ Securities (NZ) Ltd. broker Mark Coxon said the New
Zealand market opened weaker after Wall Street's decline and buying
of AMP stock had dried up along with it.
	   ``Its looking pretty ugly,'' said Peter Lynds of Cavill White
Securities in New Zealand. ``With Wall Street down ... buyers just
stepped away. It was just a knee-jerk reaction.''
	   Both the Australian and New Zealand dollars also fell, to new 11
1/2 to 12-year lows Tuesday morning.
	   The Australian dollar Tuesday morning traded at a new 12-year
low of 58.1 U.S. cents. The New Zealand dollar was at an 11 1/2
year low of 48.97 U.S. cents.

Military shows what it can do, now politicians must decide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos AVI103,104, BAJ101-103, TIR101,, MOSB107-108. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ With air exercises near the
Yugoslav border, NATO showed emphatically what it can do in the
Balkans. The question now is what it will do.
	   The answer doesn't depend on the military.
	   The first goal of the massive show of allied air power Monday
over Albania and Macedonia was to give Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic a preview of what could happen if he persists in his
violent campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province.
	   Past evidence shows Milosevic is not easily frightened.
	   Now the rest of the world, especially Europe, must decide what's
next.
	   NATO defense ministers last week ordered the military to study a
range of options, ranging from further exercises in Albania and
Macedonia to direct military intervention in Yugoslavia. Those
studies should be ready soon.
	   On the face of it, stepped up military maneuvers in neighboring
countries don't seem likely to change the mind of a man bent on
crushing a rebellion by ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs in
Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   NATO's capability of striking far and fast was never really in
question, though as Lt. Col. Dennis Prokopowicz, a U.S. fighter
pilot put it: ``We in the military know we can do certain things.
Sometimes we have to demonstrate it.''
	   The decision to use that military might rests in the hands of
the politicians, and if the politicians want to use force, they
have to make their objectives clear.
	   In Kosovo, that's not easy.
	   NATO warplanes can take out specific targets, either in Kosovo
or throughout the rest of Yugoslavia. That raises a question: Do
you hit just the Serb-led Yugoslav military and police forces, or
do you also target the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting
for independence.
	   NATO leaders oppose independence for Kosovo, preferring a return
to some semblance of the autonomy the province enjoyed until 1989.
	   In Bosnia, air strikes were very successful in ending the
fighting, and ground forces separated the warring factions.
	   NATO can also move in ground troops in Yugoslavia, either as a
force to protect territory or in mobile units to deal with specific
problems.
	   How successful that would be depends on the quality of NATO's
intelligence about what is actually happening in the province.
Reconnaissance teams are in the border area, and satellites are
taking pictures. But it's not known how accurate a picture NATO has
of the ground situation.
	   NATO could also enforce a no-fly zone over Kosovo, but just what
that would accomplish is unclear.
	   During the NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg last
month and the defense ministers discussions last week in Brussels,
officials said repeatedly that they will not allow another to
emerge in Kosovo. While everyone agreed that a diplomatic solution
is certainly the best, there was no consensus on what direction to
take should that fail.
	   Russia's adamant opposition to military intervention, even to
Monday's exercises, doesn't make it easier.
	   There is little enthusiasm for committing allied troops to
another Balkan conflict. At the same time, there is the gnawing
fear that the same sort of horror that developed in Bosnia could be
happening again. Nobody wants to be held responsible for doing
nothing again.
	   Lt. Gen. Michael Short, commander of NATO air forces in southern
Europe, called Monday's exercise ``a model for the NATO of the 21st
century'' showing its ability ``to rapidly mass power where it's
needed.'' Still, somebody has to decide what, if anything, to do
with it.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar continues to rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO AP) _ Japanese stock prices fell to their lowest level
this year in early trading Tuesday after an overnight plunge on
Wall Street. The U.S. dollar continued to rise against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 175.52 points,
or 1.18 percent, to 14,649.65 points in the first hour of trading.
On Monday, the Nikkei lost 197.16 points, or 1.31 percent.
	   The dollar bought 146.66 yen, up 0.22 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of 146.15 yen
overnight.
	   Traders said sentiment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange remained weak
amid investor concern over a possible resurgence in Asia's economic
crisis. The yen's continued weakness was also discouraging
investors.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 207 points _ its biggest point loss since early January _
on pessimism over Japan's economy. It closed at 8,627 points.
	   On Monday, former premier Li Peng, a senior leader in China's
ruling Communist Party, urged Japan to stabilize its economy,
insisting that the weak yen was putting increased pressure on
Asia's already battered economies.
	   Finance Ministers of the European Union, meeing in Cardiff,
Wales, also urged Tokyo on Monday to take new measures to
strengthen and reform Japan's economy, as the yen fell to an
eight-year low against the U.S. currency.
	   A weak yen helps Japanese exporters, but those gains come at the
expense of the rest of Asia. As the yen weakens, Japanese exports
become cheaper in key markets like the United States, grabbing
market share from Asian competitors.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 14.32 points, or 1.23 percent, to 1,152.89.
The TOPIX closed down 10.04 points, or 0.85 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.160 percent from Monday's finish of 1.185 percent,
driving its price up to 112.31 yen from 112.12 yen.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Gunmen from the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army walk around openly in this bustling market town,
greeted by an occasional salute from grizzled old men in domed
white fezes.
	   A man standing on a wheelbarrow was covering the Cyrillic
lettering of the Serbian street signs with yellow paint Monday;
Albanian is the only language spoken.
	   Situated on a crossroads some 20 kilometers (10 miles) from the
Albanian border, Malisevo remains technically part of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's dominant republic. But it already is functioning as a
supply hub and refugee center for ethnic Albanians fighting for
independence in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.
	   ``Those guys with guns and uniforms are fighting for our
rights,'' Aziz Mazreku, a high school gym teacher sipping tea at a
cafe, said when asked about the mix of fighters and shoppers on the
dusty streets.
	   As the Serbs continue their anti-insurgency campaign, evidently
undaunted by Monday's show of force by NATO planes flying nearby,
some fear it's just a matter of time before they turn their sights
to towns like Malisevo.
	   Already, fighting is creeping closer. Spent bullet casings
littered the road just a few kilometers (miles) north of town, the
remains of weekend clashes.
	   Not much farther along, Serb forces amassed at roadblocks and
positioned their heavy guns and armored vehicles up in the hills.
	   NATO's exercises in neighboring Albania and Macedonia were meant
to convince Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that the West was
serious about its demand for him to change his hard-line policy,
which has sent tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
fleeing their homes. More than 300 people have died since March.
	   Villages attacked by the Serbs, such as Komorane, halfway
between Malisevo and the provincial capital of Pristina, are now
ghost towns.
	   The streets were empty except for Serb police and stray animals
after a Serb attack a few days ago. The burned-out shell of a truck
was crumpled on the side of the road. Windows were smashed and
stores looted. Walls of houses were covered with freshly painted
Serb nationalist graffiti. A dead dog lay splayed out on the
street. Other dogs gnawed at the carcass of a dead cow just outside
town.
	   The Yugoslav government was conspicuously silent about the
West's military display _ perhaps because Milosevic was off to
Moscow, a traditional Serb ally. for talks Tuesday with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   In Pristina, opinion among Kosovo Serbs was divided. Some were
devoted to the fight to hold on to the province, considered part of
Serbia's historic heartland.
	   ``Let NATO come, let just a single plane fly over our skies _
we'll all be up to our knees in blood,'' said Biljana Mitrovic, 30,
who is unemployed.
	   Others were ready to quit.
	   ``I simply don't care. If this keeps on much longer, I'll pack
up my stuff and move to Serbia,'' said Branko Rakic, a clerk in a
state-owned company.
	   Mahmut Bakali, a member of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating
team set up to talk with Serbian authorities, said he hoped
Milosevic would heed NATO's warning so that ``serious negotiations
on the status of Kosovo can begin.''
	   But at the Express Cafe in Malisevo, residents held out little
hope for a negotiated settlement.
	   Despite its stepped-up attacks on Serb forces, the militants
remain for the most part an unknown quotient. Some drive around in
flashy all-terrain vehicles, carrying automatic weapons and
miniature walkie-talkies. Others ride in hay carts pulled by
tractors, holding on to decades-old rifles. Some wear new
camouflage, others rag-tag uniforms with sewn-on patches.
	   None of the KLA fighters would agree to be interviewed. The
shadowy group named a spokesman last week, but he has yet to make
any public statement.
	   Many customers at the cafe say they continue to respect their
elected leader, Ibrahim Rugova, but they say the KLA calls the
shots now _ at least in their town.
	   ``We are very determined about the war,'' said Mazreku. ``We are
fighting for our rights. We want independence.''

Agassi, Graf get boost in Wimbledon seeds

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon is the only one of the four
Grand Slams tournaments that strays from the world rankings in
making its seeds.
	   The All England Club factors in skill on grass, a surface seen
only at Wimbledon and during warmups leading up to the classic.
	   The chief beneficiary of Monday's seeding was former champion
Andre Agassi and, to a lesser extent, seven-time champion Steffi
Graf.
	   Agassi, the 1992 winner, was seeded No. 13 _ six spots higher
than his world ranking of 19. Just a year ago he withdrew from
Wimbledon with a wrist injury in the midst of a slump that saw him
drop to No. 122 when last season ended.
	   Graf, the seven-time champion who has dropped to No. 91 while
recovering from injury, was seeded No. 4.
	   The 29-year-old German underwent reconstructive knee surgery a
year ago and missed Wimbledon. She dropped out of the WTA Tour
rankings two weeks ago after playing only two tournaments in the
space of a year.
	   Graf re-entered the rankings this week at No. 91 after reaching
the semifinals of the DFS Classic in Birmingham. The tournament was
abandoned Monday due to rain.
	   As expected, four-time champion and defending titlist Pete
Sampras was seeded No. 1, while defending champ Martina Hingis was
the top-seeded woman.
	   The Wimbledon seeding committee stayed with the men's rankings
for the first seven players, with Sampras followed by Marcelo Rios,
Petr Korda, Greg Rusedski, Carlos Moya, Patrick Rafter and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov.
	   Rusedski sprained ankle ligaments last week at the Queen's Club
tournament and is less than 50-50 for Wimbledon.
	   Cedric Pioline, last year's losing finalist, was bumped up two
places to No. 8 seed, and 1996 champion Richard Krajicek moved up
three places to No. 9.
	   Alex Corretja, a Spanish clay-court player who lost to Moya in
last month's French Open final, was seeded No. 10 _ two places
below his world ranking.
	   Agassi has shot back up the rankings in recent months and was
rewarded with the No. 13 seeding, although his form is uncertain
after his first-round loss at the French Open.
	   Goran Ivanisevic, a crowd favorite, also got a favor. The
two-time finalist has dropped to No. 24, but Wimbledon seeded him
No. 14.
	   American Michael Chang got no favors. He was unseeded despite
his No. 14 ranking. Chang lost in the first round at Wimbledon the
past two years and has never advanced past the fourth round.
	   Britain's Tim Henman, ranked No. 17, was seeded No. 12. Albert
Costa, ranked No. 15, was unseeded, while fellow Spaniard Alberto
Berasategui (16) has not entered.
	   On the women's side, Wimbledon stayed with the rankings in all
but the case of Graf.
	   Graf is seeded behind Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and Jana
Novotna. After Graf comes Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Monica Seles and
Venus Williams. Anna Kournikova is seeded No. 12.
	   The Wimbledon draw is set for Tuesday, with the tournament
starting Monday.

EU back to the drawing board to make itself more people-friendly

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ The European Union, one of the world's
great bureaucracies, is trying to make itself more relevant to
Europeans _ who will soon have a single currency, but are said to
feel detached from the people who run their superstate.
	   Meeting here Monday, EU leaders agreed to fix a problem British
politicians have long stressed: The EU's bureaucracy is often
viewed as a faceless force that issues edicts, but has little
contact with the 370 million who live in the EU.
	   French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl are recent converts to that view.
	   At their suggestion, the EU leaders will meet in Vienna in
October to discuss ways how the union can become more
people-friendly, and also not take the place of national, regional
and local governments.
	   ``I hope there can be strong agreement that we need a
decentralized Europe, not some European federal superstate,'' Blair
said in opening the two-day summit, which was ending Tuesday.
	   Since this is not an exact science, some participants had
trouble grasping the significance. Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok,
for one, said it was fine if ``some people feel a great need to
have a conversation about that (but) I find it rather vague.''
	   Kohl and Chirac complain the EU executive Commission issues too
many directives. Some, they say, are better left to other
organizations, such as a recent edict on animal welfare conditions
in zoos.
	   Domestic politics are also involved. Kohl, who is trailing the
opposition Social Democrats ahead of September elections, is eager
to make the EU an election issue.
	   As Europe's biggest economy, Germany pays more into the EU than
it gets in return. Kohl wants that ``net payment'' of 10.9 billion
European currency units (dlrs 11.9 billion) reduced by a third.
	   Other ``net'' payers _ the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden _
also want to pay less.
	   ``We have reached the upper limit,'' Kohl said in a German radio
interview Monday. ``We will not spend more. We are not talking
about our popularity here (but) our money.''
	   The money squabble is part of a larger debate on how to revamp
the EU finances and institutions before the union takes in Cyprus
and 10 East European newcomers in the years ahead.
	   That requires reallocating funds, with northern EU nations keen
on austerity and southern members fearing that special development
aid will be diverted from them to poorer newcomers from East
Europe.
	   The leaders were expected to conclude their meeting Tuesday by
committing to low deficits and job creation. The job programs
include tax breaks for employers, state-subsidized training
programs and changing welfare regulations to make taking low-paid
jobs more attractive than welfare.
	   On Monday, the leaders banned flights by Yugoslav commercial
airlines to their nations to pressure President Slobodan Milosevic
to stop ``indiscriminate violence'' against ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   Their summit was ending with a farewell lunch for South African
President Nelson Mandela, who is leaving office soon.

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian coach Rod Macqueen named
an unchanged lineup Tuesday for Saturday's second rugby union test
against Scotland at Ballymore.
	   Props Richard Harry and Andrew Blades were named in the team but
both are questionable with injuries _ Blades has a calf strain and
Harry the flu.
	   Macqueen said both should play but as a precaution reserve front
rower Dan Crowley was withdrawn from the Queensland side to play
Scotland's second-string lineup in Brisbane on Tuesday.
	   Macqueen said the Wallabies still had a lot to do despite
beating the Scots 45-3 in Sydney last Saturday after thrashing
England by a record 76-0 in Brisbane a week earlier.
	   The Australian team:
	   Matthew Burke; Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan, Joe Roff,
Stephen Larkham, George Gregan; Toutai Kefu, David Wilson, Matt
Cockbain, Tom Bowman, John Eales (captain), Andrew Blades, Phil
Kearns, Richard Harry. Reserves: Chris Whitaker, Nathan Grey, Jason

New president moves quick to dismantle authoritarian legacy
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ For years, B.J. Habibie was former
President Suharto's friend, protege, adviser and Cabinet minister.
	   But in three turbulent weeks since his mentor quit after a wave
of deadly riots and protests, Habibie, who took over the
presidency, has moved swiftly to dismantle Suharto's authoritarian
legacy.
	   Because of his close links to Suharto, many presumed that
Habibie, 61, would try to carry on with the old ways. They have
been surprised by the speed and scope of change.
	   He has freed political prisoners, lifted bans on labor unions,
ended restrictions on the formation of opposition political parties
and promised free and fair elections next year.
	   He has vowed to make sweeping reforms to fix the economy, which
has been hit hardest by Asia's financial meltdown. Runaway
inflation and mass unemployment fueled riots in which almost 1,200
people died in May. The violence made Suharto's 32-year grip on
power untenable, forcing him to resign in favor of Habibie.
	   Habibie even says he is happy to see protests against himself.
``It's part of living in a democracy,'' he said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
	   Although he has known Suharto for 49 years, Habibie has vowed to
clean up corruption that riddled the old regime and said he won't
stand in the way of lawful investigations into alleged wrongdoing
by the Suharto clan.
	   Deals and benefits that allegedly made Suharto's family rich
over the years are being canceled by the government and business
partners, who now regard once lucrative ties to old leader as a
liability.
	   ``We're still friends,'' Habibie insisted. ``He may defend
himself. But I am not his lawyer, I am the lawyer of the
people...for the poorest and the weakest.''
	   Inside the whitewashed walls of Jakarta's presidential palace a
revolution of style has taken place.
	   Many likened Suharto, a 77-year-old retired army general, to an
ancient Javanese monarch _ aloof, reserved and autocratic.
	   Habibie could not be more different.
	   ``I am an ordinary man and not a king,'' he said during the
interview that was punctuated by smiles, giggles and fast-moving
hand gestures.
	   Unlike the old leader, Habibie has gone out of his way to
consult legislators, talk to journalists and conduct
meet-the-people walkabouts through the streets and markets of
Jakarta where the poor have been hit hard by recession and rioting.
	   ``I don't like to use the word `power' because the power is not
in the president it is the people's power,'' he said.
	   Suharto ruled since 1966. Habibie says he has no plans to remain
in office past next year, when elections are to be held.
	   His down-to-earth approach has won plaudits, but he says some
establishment figures have accused him of insulting the institution
of the presidency.
	   Despite his sweeping agenda, criticism also has come from those
who say reform is not happening fast enough.
	   Student protests have called on Habibie to quit immediately,
saying his plan for parliamentary elections by May 1999 and a new
presidential ballot by December that year is too slow.
	   Critics have suggested a special assembly of lawmakers and
government appointees be convened to select a new president next
month. Others have called for elections now.
	   Speaking in his self-cast role as a midwife for change, Habibie
says embryonic democracy needs time to develop. At least a year is
required to enact new electoral laws and allow new parties to be
formed.
	   ``I know if you want a baby, you need nine months and 10 days.
You cannot ask me to have it in one month,'' he said.
	   Opponents of Indonesia's rule of the former Portuguese territory
of East Timor have been disappointed as well. Like Suharto, who
ordered Indonesia's invasion of the half island territory in 1975,
Habibie maintains that East Timor is an integral part of Indonesia.
	   Back in the capital Jakarta diplomats and other observers
maintain that Habibie's real test will be in his dealings with the
International Monetary Fund which is now assessing how to revive a
dlrs 43 billion bailout plan, derailed by the recent political
upheaval.
	   He's promised full cooperation, even some reforms will prove
painful.
	   Yet some doubts remain. For 20 years as Suharto's research and
technology minister, Habibie established costly and ambitious
projects such as an aircraft building plant and ship building
industry.
	   Last year Habibie protested when the IMF demanded that some of
his pet endeavors lose government funding.
	   In his interview with the AP, Habibie defended the establishment
of the projects as being strategically important for development,
but he conceded that all need to be economically feasible.
	   Still, he's not distancing himself completely from his high-tech
past.
	   ``I am the first Indonesian president to use e-mail,'' he
boasts.

Lawsuit prompts the question: Is `polo' a shirt or a sport?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ There's big trouble in label-conscious corporate
America. Trouble with a capital ``P'' _ or maybe a small ``p'' _
and that spells ``polo.''
	   The word has meant many things over the years _ sport, attitude,
shirt, fragrance. Now a dispute between Ralph Lauren's fashion
house and a long-established magazine has made it a lawsuit as
well.
	   At issue: Whether a redesign by Polo Magazine, a journal for the
horsy sport, has turned it into an upscale fashion-lifestyle
periodical whose name capitalizes on _ and competes with _ Lauren's
popular Polo products.
	   ``It's just audacious. He's trying to co-opt the name for
himself,'' says Tom Godbold, the attorney representing Dallas-based
Westchester Media, which purchased the 23-year-old Polo Magazine
last year.
	   The issue grows ever more pressing in these days of omnipresent
consumerism. Where does the language end and the brand name begin?
And, given that companies have valid interests in safeguarding
their brand names, what is reasonable protection and what is
advertising run amok?
	   Polo was a game long before it was a shirt, and the Lauren
products themselves _ some were once advertised in the magazine _
rely on the now-familiar logo of a polo player atop a horse.
	   Last month, Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. sent the magazine a letter
asking that it give up the name. The magazine responded with a
lawsuit and Lauren countersued. A trial is scheduled for December.
	   The company has not commented publicly on the lawsuits.
	   In its countersuit, the company said it trademarked the term
POLO for apparel a decade ago. It said the dlrs 6 magazine, as
redone, shifted its focus from sport to ``sophisticated fashions
and elegant lifestyles'' to compete for business from Lauren
customers.
	   Lauren says the publisher sent copies of the first redesigned
issue last fall to customers of Neiman Marcus, a major Polo Ralph
Lauren retailer, and featured Claudia Schiffer, who has modeled
Lauren fashions, on the cover. Later covers featured model
Stephanie Seymour and Britain's polo-playing Prince Charles.
	   Such situations aren't new. All things Elvis are guarded
zealously by trademarks. A Dutch businessman has trademarked terms
like ``Route 66,'' ``Wall Street'' and ``yellow cab'' in European
countries to profit on interest in Americana, though he has
obtained no such licenses within the United States.
	   Then, of course, there was Groucho Marx. In 1946, threatened
with a lawsuit by ``Casablanca'' maker Warner Bros. for his comedy
``A Night in Casablanca,'' he wasted no time putting umbrage to
paper.
	   ``I had no idea that the city of Casablanca belonged exclusively
to Warner Brothers,'' he wrote. ``I am sure that the average movie
fan could learn in time to distinguish between Ingrid Bergman and
Harpo.''
	   Then Groucho petulantly claimed the term ``Bros.'' for himself
and his brethren. The Warners eventually went away.
	   Polo Ralph Lauren's maneuver isn't earning the company many
friends among polo aficionados. On one Internet polo site, a
cacophony is calling for Polo to get off its high horse. Many want
a boycott.
	   ``Somebody needs to take a mallet to his ego,'' wrote one polo
fan. ``Are chaps going to be renamed next?'' said another. Wrote a
third: ``The corporate logo, for all intents and purposes, has
taken precedent over the will of the people or the common good.''
	   ``Polo dates back to Persia thousands of years ago. For him to
claim he's got a lock on the word polo is a little ridiculous,''
said Chuck Elmes, president of Blue Sky Polo Club in Middletown,
New York. ``The ambience of polo has made him a multimillionaire,
and he's slapping the hand that feeds him.''
	   Monika Laws of the New York City-based International Trademark
Association sees both sides and blames a public ill-educated about
brand names. ``Trademark owners don't distinguish,'' she said.
``They see their mark as their mark.''
	   Then there was lawyer Richard Dooling, who wrote an op-ed column
for The New York Times last week about the brouhaha. Mocking
Lauren, he carefully referred to polo as ``pxxx.''
	   ``The Association for members with an upscale life style
hereafter shall be referred to as the United States Horse-Hockey
Association,'' he wrote. ``The association for lower-class,
ill-bred sorts of members may still be called the United States
Pxxx Association, but only by lower-class, ill-bred members, who
may use the Pxxx name without causing people to view Pxxx as a
product of Ralph Lauren.''

	   MARTIN, Kentucky (AP) _ Sitting between a hammered tin crucifix
and a plastic icon of the Hindu god Mahavir, Deloise Blevins is
feeling doubly blessed.
	   For the first time in seven years, the only pain she has is from
the thin surgical scar on her abdomen. Pain used to keep her in bed
some days _ pain so bad it shot up into her shoulders and sent her
to the emergency room.
	   ``I was a very sick lady,'' the 50-year-old woman says.
	   She had been to doctors in Lexington 2 1/2 hours away, but they
weren't much help. They said she needed a dlrs 1,300 CAT scan, dlrs
600 of that to be paid upfront. But with no insurance, she and her
husband, Earnest, a disabled coal miner, couldn't pay. She would
have to live with the pain.
	   That's when Mrs. Blevins learned about the free, once-a-month
clinic in this two-stoplight Appalachian town. That's when she met
Dr. Chandra Varia.
	   The Indian-born physician quickly diagnosed Mrs. Blevins with
ovarian cysts and endometriosis. Varia performed a hysterectomy and
even persuaded Mrs. Blevins to kick her 1 1/2-pack-a-day smoking
habit.
	   Diana Hamilton, Mrs. Blevins' daughter, has high praise for the
doctor's skills and her willingness to listen and care. ``What
she's done for my mom, I thank the Lord for her,'' she says. ``We
need more doctors like her.''
	   ``Whether they're foreign or American or whatever,'' adds
Earnest Blevins.
	   ___
	   Graduates of foreign medical schools make up about one-fifth of
the medical residents in the United States, and their numbers have
been rising: 26,763 in 1996 compared with 11,556 in 1988, according
to the Council on Graduate Medical Education.
	   With a physician glut on the horizon, some in medicine are
debating whether to limit the number of non-citizens training in
this country. The council has recommended that Congress cut back
special visas.
	   Although the idea of the visas was to train doctors to serve
their own countries, many earn waivers to remain here by working in
areas where physicians are in short supply.
	   Some 1,100 special visas were issued last year. That compares
with 950 U.S.-trained physicians placed in underserved areas by the
National Service Corps. One study found a greater proportion of
foreign-trained physicians planted roots in these communities than
did their U.S. counterparts.
	   When Varia, now 61, arrived in Appalachia, such debates did not
exist.
	   ___
	   She comes from a well-to-do family in Jamnagar, India. Nearing
the end of her obstetrics residency in New York, she came to
eastern Kentucky to visit a friend in this town of 690 in the heart
of coal country.
	   The friend took Varia to Our Lady of the Way Hospital, a 39-bed,
not-for-profit facility then run by the Sisters of Charity of
Cincinnati. On the spot, Sister Loretta, the hospital's
administrator, offered her a job.
	   The town seemed too small then. ``I could hardly breathe,'' she
recalls. The hospital where she trained in New York ``has more beds
than the population of this town.''
	   Besides, Varia had a sweet offer on New York's Long Island: Two
partners, a home by the beach, flexible hours. But Sister Loretta
wouldn't take ``no'' for an answer. Varia decided to give Martin
six months. That was 19 years ago.
	   ``The first day I came and I worked almost 14 hours,'' she says.
``And I love it. People are so nice. Everybody appreciates me, even
all the physicians. Every morning they ask me whether I need
anything, (whether) I am happy or not. Because they all wanted to
keep me.''
	   ___
	   Not all foreign doctors and indigenous patients take to each
other so readily.
	   Consider this scene in a rural doctor's office. It's part of a
play but it's based on real-life community focus groups in
southwest Virginia.
	   ``Dr. Assibehmen,'' says the patient, a local woman, ``I ...
don't think that these pills are really working for me. They say
they're for nausea, but I have a backache. (These foreign doctors,
they never understand.)...''
	   Doctor: ``What sorts of symptoms are you experiencing? Nausea?
Headaches? Vomiting? Perhaps this time I can get some specifics.
(These mountain people. I just can't understand her.) I'm sorry.
What did you say?''
	   Woman: ``I just can't understand him.''
	   Doctor: ``Is she speaking English?''
	   Woman: ``Is he speaking English?'' ...
	   Doctor: ``You're not very much like me.''
	   Woman: ``You're not very much like me.''
	   The author, Pamela Teaster, an assistant professor at Virginia
Tech, says the play reflects a lack of familiarity with other
cultures that's typical of many out-of-the-way places.
	   But she adds: ``I don't think it's so ingrained that nobody's
going to trust anybody because they're foreign.''

	   ___
	   The cross-cultural learning process between doctor and patient
is becoming more common.
	   The U.S. General Accounting Office found that foreign-trained
physicians seeking visa waivers to work in underserved areas
increased from 70 in 1990 to 1,300 in 1995.
	   It is hard to imagine where some areas would be without these
transplants.
	   After a brief residency in southern Illinois, Dr. Rup Nagala, a
native of Madras, India, wound up in Oakes, North Dakota,
population 2,000. A committee made up of the mayor, a grocer and
others recruited the family practitioner in 1978.
	   ``I guess I saw the town in the summertime, so I was very
impressed,'' he says with a laugh.
	   In North Dakota, foreign-trained doctors comprise 40 percent of
the primary-care physicians in doctor-shortage counties, according
to a study by the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services
Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
	   ``They all want to service rural North Dakota,'' says Mary
Amundson of the University of North Dakota's Center for Rural
Health. Why? They know most local graduates aren't interested, and
so it's a sure foothold in America.
	   ``They don't even know rural North Dakota,'' she says. ``I know
where they want to be.''
	   Recruiting Nagala was like building a doctor factory. He and his
wife, Vani, an internist, have opened seven rural clinics as
satellites to the 28-bed Oakes Community Hospital. They have
brought in five physicians from India, Sri Lanka and Jordan with
specialties ranging from oncology to psychiatry. Three plan to stay
beyond their visa commitments.
	   And the town could get another physician: Nagala notes his
14-year-old daughter wants to become a doctor and return to Oakes.
That makes him proud.
	   ``Because, you know, if she's a graduate from this country,'' he
says, ``she could go anywhere she wants to, theoretically.''

	   Chandra Varia and her husband, Mehandra, a veterinarian, chose
not to have children. But in 1993, they set up a dlrs 25,000
scholarship fund for the hundreds of children Chandra Varia
delivered before quitting obstetrics in 1992. They also gave dlrs
100,000 to a local community college program that helps single
mothers on welfare.
	   Since January, Varia has blocked out one day a month for her
free clinic. She likes to limit it to 15 patients; 22 are signed up
on a recent day.
	   ``When they call, you cannot say no,'' says Varia, who is
darting from room to room in running shoes, a white lab coat over
traditional Indian paisley-print dress.
	   American citizens now, the Varias have become part of the local
landscape. He is on the board of Mountain Christian Academy, a
private school. A nursing laboratory at the community college has
been named for them.
	   They've even found that local foods, like cornbread and pinto
beans, fit nicely into the vegetarian diet prescribed by their
Jainist faith.
	   ``We are not leaving the mountains,'' says Mehandra Varia. ``We
are hillbillies and we are going to retire here. ... We have never
felt out of home here.''

Former atomic bomb fuel complex becoming industrial park

<TEXT>
	   OAK RIDGE, Tennessee (AP) _ Behind the security gates and
corrugated steel facades of aging buildings, the faint pulse of
private enterprise can be felt on a 1,500-acre (600-hectare)
government complex where uranium was enriched for nuclear weapons.
	   Until recently, this place was known simply by its World War II
code name of K-25, part of the top-secret Manhattan Project that
created the first atomic bomb.
	   It continued to provide uranium for weapons after the war, and
later for nuclear power stations, until falling demand brought
K-25's closure in 1987.
	   Now this ghostly vestige of the Cold War some 50 kilometers (30
miles) west of Knoxville is being reborn. Its new name is the East
Tennessee Technology Park and its mission is
``reindustrialization.''
	   ``Our vision is to turn this into a commercial industrial park
by 2010 and be totally occupied by private business,'' said Jim
Hall, the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge manager. ``And it would
be cleaned up and our job would be done.''
	   Nowhere in the DOE's vast-but-diminishing string of weapons
complexes stretching from the Savannah River Site in South Carolina
to Hanford Reservation in Washington is reindustrialization being
done on a grander scale.
	   ``There have been bits and pieces,'' Hall said. '' ... This is a
massive kind of effort.''
	   Last month, Hall was recognized by Vice President Al Gore, who
gave him the Presidential Meritorious Rank Award for his leadership
and efforts to find new uses for Oak Ridge's facilities.
	   But reindustrialization has its critics, too. There are
environmental concerns about controlling the flow of recycled
radioactive metals _ particularly nickel _ into the marketplace.
And there are economic concerns about whether the new jobs will pay
as much as the old ones, and whether displaced workers will get
them.
	   The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union is suing the energy
department and others over those issues in an attempt to block a
cleanup contract at the Oak Ridge site.
	   K-25 and the rest of the city of Oak Ridge were built by the
government in 1942. Thousands of workers were brought in, but the
area was closed to the public. Locals dubbed it ``the Secret
City.''
	   Oak Ridge was opened to the public in 1949 and K-25 kept
enriching uranium for nuclear weapons until 1964, when it began
providing the material for nuclear plants.
	   There are 13 million square feet (1.21 sq. meters) of industrial
space here, most of it needing decontamination from radioactivity,
chemicals or asbestos.
	   DOE had estimated it would cost dlrs 3 billion to clean up the
K-25 site and generations to finish the job. That was before
reindustrialization.
	   Hall now hopes to shave decades and as much as dlrs 2 billion
off those estimates by involving the private sector.
	   During a 30-year career with DOE and its predecessors, Hall has
experienced his share of shutdowns, most recently managing the 1994
closure of the Superconducting Supercollider Project in Texas.
	   Hall wanted to do more for K-25, where as many as 5,000 people
worked during the Cold War. But he didn't have the money.
	   The DOE was spending dlrs 75 million a year on K-25 just to make
sure the roofs didn't leak, its 500 buildings didn't burn and
nobody got in or out without permission.
	   He decided DOE had ``to look at these buildings in a new light,
as assets that could become valuable to business.'' He would make a
sales pitch to the private sector.
	   DOE held a workshop on the future of K-25 in April 1996.
Representatives from 133 companies came.
	   A month later, the first tenant of the new East Tennessee
Technology Park moved in to what had been K-25's main machine shop.
The company, American Technology Inc., makes metal boxes for
hazardous and radioactive material.
	   ``The building was a ready-made facility so we could move in and
start to work almost immediately,'' ATI spokesman Joel Garber said.
	   Fifteen companies have now joined ATI _ from freight haulers to
industrial tool fabricators. More have signed leases. And DOE
continues to give 50 to 60 tours a month to prospective tenants.
	   Only 340 or so jobs have been created by new businesses or
contractors taking over government functions, such as management of
the site's utility services.
	   But the real value to DOE is the willingness of tenants to pay
to clean up their new space.
	   DOE has offered plenty of incentives _ cheap rent, free
machining equipment for use or resale, and access to
still-classified manufacturing technologies.
	   DOE carried this bartering idea to its furthest extent in a deal
with British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. for the cleanup of three massive
uranium processing buildings, including the K-33 Building, which
houses more than 600 machines the size of motor homes under one
66-acre (27-hectare) roof.
	   DOE estimated the K-33 cleanup alone would cost more than dlrs 1
billion and wouldn't begin before 2050. The British company agreed
to do it for dlrs 238 million and the rights to all the metals it
could salvage. The area should be clean by 2002, the company says.
	   Environmentalists worry about the thoroughness of the cleanups,
and whether the materials produced at the industrial park will be
contamination-free.
	   Even a DOE inspection team wrote in July that ``although this
program is well-intentioned and appears to have long-term
potential, the initial approach and rapid pace with which it is
proceeding are cause for concern.''
	   Hall responded with tighter controls, stepped-up monitoring and
new safety policies.
	   But the tenants appear pleased and eager to grow.
	   ``There is only one down side to the whole place,'' said Mike
Carroll, president of Machine Kinetics Corp., which uses old K-25
equipment to make machines that make auto parts. ``It is those
little yellow-and-magenta radiation signs.''
	   Those warnings, posted for worker protection, have scared off
some clients. But Carroll said he and his 17 employees, some of
whom worked for the government in the same shop where they work
today, like their location.
	   ``DOE in Oak Ridge has really stepped outside of their normal
way of doing business to try to make a commercial venture that is
viable,'' Carroll said. ``These guys are sort of plowing new ground
for DOE. I am impressed.''

In Microsoft case, government asks 'What if?'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TED BRIDIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Rich Schinnell bought his first home computer
in 1981 for dlrs 6,000, an IBM that by today's standards is more
akin to an abacus than a powerful desktop machine.
	   These days, he says, even a high-end computer loaded with
software that lets a person surf the Internet, play the latest
games and track household finances costs half as much _ or even
less when that 1981 price tag is adjusted for inflation.
	   ``The price of software is, in my estimation, pretty darn low,''
said Schinnell, a retiree who lives in Rockville, Maryland, near
Washington and helps run the Capital PC User Group. ``And there's a
lot of competition.''
	   For the U.S. Justice Department and the 20 states suing
Microsoft Corp. in one of the most far-reaching antitrust cases in
decades, the sentiments of many of the nation's computer hobbyists,
like Schinnell, represent a formidable legal hurdle.
	   The case, scheduled for trial Sept. 8 in U.S. District Court,
will require government lawyers to argue convincingly that
Microsoft, whose Windows software is used on 90 percent of the
world's desktop computers, illegally used its market muscle to
stifle innovation and keep prices artificially high.
	   ``The government case probably seems misguided to most Americans
because they see that the high-tech industry is the most
competitive, most dynamic and most innovative industry in
America,'' Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said.
	   Indeed, the government makes its case at a time when the
computer industry is booming, as prices for midrange computers dip
below dlrs 1,000 for the first time and software aisles overflow at
the nation's stores.
	   So, why sue?
	   In simple terms, the Justice Department and the states are
asking America to picture an ``alternate reality,'' to imagine how
much cheaper and more innovative the computer industry might be if
Microsoft were not quite so powerful.
	   The mantra that innovation ultimately will suffer _ and that
prices ultimately will rise without competition _ is a cornerstone
of U.S. antitrust theory.
	   ``A single company that is a monopolist is never going to
produce the degree of innovation that a competitive industry would
produce,'' argued Robert Bork, a former federal judge who is a
lobbyist for one of Microsoft's biggest rivals, Netscape
Communications Corp.
	   The government also argues that, while computer prices continue
to fall, the price of software remains relatively constant.
Microsoft's critics note that the retail price of Windows 95 when
it was introduced in August 1995 was dlrs 90 _ about the same price
as today.
	   As the price for a complete computer, including software, has
dropped, Windows has thus made up a greater percentage of the cost
of an overall computer.
	   ``It is worth noting that in the past few years, as computer
prices have fallen at the shelf ... you'll find that the computers
indeed are cheaper, all the while that the cost of Microsoft's
software has gone up,'' said New York Attorney General Dennis
Vacco, whose office is coordinating the states' case against the
software maker.

World Cup: English fans celebrate in Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAGALLUF, Spain (AP) _ Dozens English soccer fans poured into
the streets of this resort town shouting and singing following
their country's World Cup victory on Monday. Police were called to
the scene, and the crowd dispersed peacefully.
	   After watching England beat Tunisia 2-0 in the bars, about 100
joyful fans rushed outside. Some residents got worried, but no
incidents were reported, a police spokesman said.
	   While English tourists were celebrating on the holiday island of
Mallorca off Spain's eastern coast, more hardened fans and French
police fought running battles in Marseilles.
	   Mallorca is also a particularly popular destination for German
tourists who ``also get happy when their (soccer) team wins and
take to the streets'' the spokesman said.
	   ``Our (the Spanish) team tends to lose, so we just stay home and
get depressed'' he added in reference to Spain's 3-2 defeat by
Nigeria Saturday.

Kings land Predrag Stojakovic, one of Europe's best
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SETH HETTENA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SACRAMENTO, California (AP) _ The National Basketball
Association draft is nine days away yet the Sacramento Kings signed
a first-round pick Monday.
	   Predrag Stojakovic, a 6-foot-9 (2.03-meter) forward whose
accuracy from 3-point range made him one of Europe's top players,
signed a three-year contract with the Kings _ the team that drafted
him in 1996.
	   Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but the deal is
reportedly worth dlrs 3.9 million.
	   ``Finally, my dream came true. I'm here in the NBA,'' Stojakovic
said at a news conference at Arco Arena.
	   The Kings believe he was worth the wait. A native Serbian who
lives in Greece, Stojakovic was named MVP in the Greek League after
leading PAOK to the finals last season. He averaged nearly 24
points per game and shot about 41 percent from 3-point range.
	   But Stojakovic, 21, made the Kings work for his signature.
	   ``Peja,'' as he's known to fans, was the 14th overall pick in
1996. The Kings offered him a three-year, multi-million dollar
contract, but he signed a two-year, dlrs 800,000 contract with a
Greek team instead.
	   His father, Miodrag, kept him from signing with the Kings,
saying he was too young.
	   For the past two years, the NBA was never far from his mind,
Stojakovic said. And when he injured his leg last season, he
accepted an offer from the Kings to recuperate in Sacramento _ one
of the reasons he later decided to join the team.
	   The Kings hope Stojakovic will join a team that includes
unsigned free agent Corliss Williamson and Chris Webber, whom they
acquired in a postseason trade with the Washington Wizards for
Mitch Richmond. Stojakovic's ball-handling and shooting skills
often draw comparisons to Toni Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls.
	   ``We need his type of skills,'' Kings vice president Geoff
Petrie said.
	   The Kings set an NBA record with their 15th consecutive losing
season in 1997-98, losing 26 of their final 29 games _ including
seven straight to end the season. They lost their last 10 games on
the road and their last three at home.

Martin gets off to sputtering start

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Casey Martin's week at the U.S. Open got
off to an ominous start. His cart broke down _ twice.
	   Martin, who has been granted the use of a cart because of a
circulatory disorder in his right leg, started out in a
single-person cart like the one he used at the U.S. sectional
qualifying earlier this month in Cincinnati.
	   It died after he reached his drive on the 533-yard (485-meter)
opening hole.
	   ``It didn't work at all,'' Martin said. ``It wouldn't start.
Then, when it started, it wouldn't stop. I had to take the key out
to get it to stop. Then, I put the key back in and it wouldn't
start.''
	   Martin wound up walking to the first green before USGA officials
brought him another cart.
	   He hit his drive on No. 2, but the cart didn't have enough juice
to get up the hill. So, Martin walked the rest of the way on the
hole, and he walked No. 3, a 223-yard (203-meter) par-3.
	   The USGA brought him a standard cart on No. 4 and he used it the
rest of the way.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GONE FISHING: &LR;  How did David Duval prepare the week before the
U.S. Open? Fly fishing for trout in Montana and Idaho.
	   Duval, the runner-up at the Masters and a five-time winner since
October, was the guest of ESPN's ``Fly Fishing the World,'' a show
which was taped last week in Montana.
	   Duval grew up in Jacksonville, Florida and still fishes for bass
in the inland marshes and intercoastal waterways, so this was a new
experience.
	   How did he do?
	   ``About like the amateurs I usually play with in pro-ams,''
Duval said. ``I was like a 15-handicapper, and that was with some
cheating. But I learned quick. I was down to single digits by the
end of the week.''
	   Duval is playing in his sixth U.S. Open. His best finish was a
tie for 28th at Shinnecock Hills in 1995.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BOOK AWARD: &LR;  PGA champion Davis Love III has won the 1997 USGA
International Book Award for ``Every Shot I Take,'' a first-person
look at the relationship between a father and son whose world is
built around golf.
	   Love shared the wisdom and advice he learned from his father,
Davis Love Jr., a former tour player and golf pro. His father died
in a plane crash in 1988.
	   ``We are proud to have my father's legacy live on to influence
future generations of golfers,'' Love said.
	   The book was written with assistance from Michael Bamberger of
Sports Illustrated and was the unanimous choice of three judges.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Bill Glasson, who grew up about three hours away in
Fresno, withdrew Monday with an elbow injury. He was replaced by
Perry Moss, who tied for 51st at the Nike Cleveland Open last week.

Violence flares again after England beats Tunisia

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ This shaken port city picked up the
pieces Tuesday after two days of street fights between English
soccer thugs and young Tunisian delinquents from the rough northern
suburbs.
	   Running battles with police left the Old Port an eerie no man's
land, with smashed windows and broken bottles in the streets.
Violence flared again after England beat Tunisia, 2-0, in a first
round World Cup match.
	   More than 50 people were injured, including an Englishman whose
neck artery was cut by a bottle. Police detained nearly 80
Englishman, Tunisians and Frenchmen, and two of the Englishmen were
sentenced to three months in prison.
	   ``It was ludicrous, the way the two sides provoked each other,''
said Rob Spence, 29, a London financial specialist with no sympathy
for English hooligans. ``Usually, the English supporters start
these things. But today it was not all their fault.''
	   Monday's melee started after Tunisians waved red flags _ their
national colors _ at English fans drinking beer at a sidewalk cafe
outside the stadium. A bottle flew, and bitter fights erupted. Riot
police charged and fired tear gas.
	   Then several thousand supporters for both teams settled into
bleachers in front of a large screen set up on Prado Beach for
people without game tickets. When England scored its first goal,
chairs and bottles flew down from the Tunisian section.
	   Immediately, English fans charged the Tunisians, and police
flailing batons swept in to break up the fight. The whiff of tear
gas reached the stadium a mile (1.5 kms) away.
	   ``At first it was all laid back and friendly, and the Tunisians
were as docile as nursery school kids,'' said Melanie Flynn, a
London civil servant, who found herself fleeing over fences to
escape violence at the beach. ``Then they just erupted.''
	   After the match, crowds gathered around the Old Port where riot
police with shields and tear gas launches stood shoulder to
shoulder to head off new violence.
	   Police said young delinquents joined the Tunisians, taking
advantage of the uproar to vandalize shops and taunt police.
	   ``They throw a few rocks, and we charge a little, and then it's
calm for a while,'' said one police officer, who by regulations
could not be identified. ``Tonight it's not the English who worry
us.''
	   Most of the Englishmen stayed together in small groups, lunging
at anyone who threatened them. Reporters saw one straggler beaten
badly by Tunisian youths until police rescued him.
	   Zealous riot troops poured out of vans at the slightest sign of
a fight. At one point, police chased a group of Englishmen through
a narrow street. One burly officer beat a young French bystander
with his baton and left him moaning in pain on the ground.
	   Late in the evening, police formed a protective cordon around 50
English fans who wanted to catch a special train to Calais but were
prevented from reaching the train station by young toughs armed
with bats and knives.
	   They were eventually loaded into a bus and escorted to the
station, bellowing last insults and gesturing rudely as crowds
jeered.

South Korea's richest man herds 500 cattle into hungry North Korea

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ South Korea's richest man drove 500
cattle across the world's most heavily guarded border into North
Korea on Tuesday in a goodwill gesture to promote peace on the
divided peninsula.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 82, founder of the giant Hyundai group, walked
into the North at this tiny village inside the 4 kilometer
(2.5-mile)-wide demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
	   A North Korean woman in a flowing, traditional gown presented a
bouquet of flowers to Chung as several dozen northern soldiers and
civilians looked on.
	   Chung's crossing came a few minutes after a convoy of 50 Hyundai
trucks loaded with 250 cows and 250 oxen drove past the border into
the northern sector of Panmunjom.
	   ``I'm delighted to go back to my hometown through Panmunjom, the
same passage I took when I left for Seoul ... while I was young,''
Chung said in a statement.
	   Chung hoped that his visit would lay ``the cornerstone of
reconciliation and peace'' between the two rival Korean states.
	   South Korean officials hailed Chung's cattle drive as opening
``a sluice gate of unification'' on the peninsula.
	   ``We hope that an era of peace and mutual cooperation will come
as early as possible, allowing millions of separated family members
in the two sides to go and come through Panmunjom,'' chief
presidential spokesman Park Ji-won said in Seoul.
	   The cattle drive comes as South Korea's new government of
President Kim Dae-jung is trying to induce the North's Stalinist
government toward peace. Under its ``sunshine policy,'' the Kim
government already has lifted virtually all restrictions on
non-governmental exchanges.
	   It was a nostalgic trip for Chung, a native of what is now North
Korea. Sixty-five years ago at the age of 17, Chung sold one of his
family's cows, stole the money and fled to the south with the
thought of studying to become a lawyer.
	   Instead, he went into business and built Hyundai, South Korea's
largest conglomerate with more than 50 subsidiaries producing
everything from cars and computer chips to ships and steel.
	   ``I always feel sorry for my father for that,'' Chung said in a
recently published autobiography, recalling the day he fled his
home. ``My heart is always filled with longing for my father.''
	   In the statement issued at Panmunjom, Chung said that in South
Korea, he ``has lived my whole life with sincerity and diligence,
which I consider the trademark of a cow.''
	   ``I am now returning back to my hometown to pay back the debt
owed to my father,'' he said.
	   The cattle are part of a 12 billion won (dlrs 8.5 million) gift
Chung has offered in exchange for an eight-day visit to North
Korea. He already has shipped 10,000 tons of corn and is committed
to provide an additional 500 cattle and 40,000 tons of corn.
	   Twelve years after Chung left home, the Koreas were divided in
1945 into the communist North and the capitalist South. They fought
a devastating, three-year war that ended in 1953 without a peace
treaty. Their sealed border is guarded by nearly 2 million troops
from both sides.
	   Domestic television networks interrupted their regular
programming to broadcast live the passage of the convoy of Hyundai
trucks through Seoul and along Highway One leading to the border.
People along the streets clapped and shouted encouragement as the
convoy moved past.
	   Each truck flew the Red Cross and Hyundai flags and carried huge
placards advertising the cattle as donations from Chung.
	   It was Chung's second visit to North Korea since he fled in
1933. When he visited in 1989, his father had already died years
earlier. During that trip, he agreed to several joint-venture
projects with the North, including a tourist resort.
	   Chung was the first South Korean civilian to cross the border
into North Korea unaccompanied by government officials. North Korea
usually insists that visitors enter via Beijing or Tokyo, almost
never from South Korea.
	   Even former President Carter had to enter North Korea via
Beijing when he traveled to the Stalinist state to meet with its
late president, Kim Il Sung, in 1994.
	   Chung was accompanied by nine family members. Six other members
of his entourage, mostly Hyundai executives, flew to North Korea
via Beijing Monday and will join the Chung family later.
	   Hyundai Motors Co., a Hyundai subsidiary, said Chung would
discuss with North Korean officials the possible relocation of some
of its subcompact car assembly lines to the North.

World Cup: English fans celebrate in Spain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped word `of' in lead graf; fixes spelling of
Marseille to conform with style.

<TEXT>
	   MAGALLUF, Spain (AP) _ Dozens of English soccer fans poured into
the streets of this resort town shouting and singing following
their country's World Cup victory on Monday. Police were called to
the scene, and the crowd dispersed peacefully.
	   After watching England beat Tunisia 2-0 in the bars, about 100
joyful fans rushed outside. Some residents got worried, but no
incidents were reported, a police spokesman said.
	   While English tourists were celebrating on the holiday island of
Mallorca off Spain's eastern coast, more hardened fans and French
police fought running battles in Marseille.
	   Mallorca is also a particularly popular destination for German
tourists who ``also get happy when their (soccer) team wins and
take to the streets'' the spokesman said.
	   ``Our (the Spanish) team tends to lose, so we just stay home and
get depressed,'' he added in reference to Spain's 3-2 defeat by
Nigeria Saturday.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Steve Waugh will captain the side while
brother Mark will be his deputy when the Australian cricket team
travels to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in September for the Commonwealth
Games.
	   Australia will play Canada, Antigua and India in its four-team
group with only the top side qualfying for the semifinals of the
16-nation limited-overs tournament.
	   Leading paceman Glenn McGrath will make his return to

Dollar falls, stocks slip in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell sharply against the Japanese
yen Tuesday morning amid profit-taking by U.S. funds and comments
by Japanese officials expressing concern about the yen's recent
slide. Tokyo stocks fell moderately.
	   The dollar bought 143.82 yen, down 2.84 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of 146.15 yen
overnight.
	   The previous day, growing concerns about the state of the
Japanese economy sent the U.S. dollar above 146 yen in Tokyo for
the first time in eight years.
	   Government officials hinted Tuesday that Japan may take action
to stem the yen's dramatic decline, but analysts said the central
bank hadn't yet intervened directly to boost the yen.
	   The dollar fell mainly on profit-taking by U.S. investors,
traders said.
	   Early Tuesday, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka
made a rare comment on the exchange rate, saying that he is worried
about the yen's sharp decline.
	   ``I have strong concerns about the excessive weakness of the
yen,'' Muraoka said. ``It is necessary to coordinate with other
nations to take proper steps on it.''
	   The head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Koji Omi, also
expressed concern Tuesday that too much weakness in the yen could
have a negative impact worldwide.
	   Omi said he believes the government will take action to bolster
the yen. But he didn't comment on when and what that action may be.
	   On Monday, former premier Li Peng, a senior leader in China's
ruling Communist Party, urged Japan to stabilize its economy,
insisting that the weak yen was putting increased pressure on
Asia's already battered economies.
	   Finance Ministers of the European Union, meeting in Cardiff,
Wales, also urged Tokyo on Monday to take new measures to
strengthen and reform Japan's economy.
	   A weak yen helps Japanese exporters, but those gains come at the
expense of the rest of Asia. As the yen weakens, Japanese exports
become cheaper in key markets like the United States, grabbing
market share from Asian competitors.
	   Meanwhile, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed
63.68 points, or 0.43 percent, to 14,761.49 points to end the
morning session. On Monday, the Nikkei lost 197.16 points, or 1.31
percent.
	   Traders said sentiment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange remained weak
amid investor concern over a possible resurgence in Asia's economic
crisis. The yen's continued weakness was also discouraging
investors.
	   But Tokyo share prices erased some of their losses by midday
Tuesday on buying by public and pension funds, which were
encouraged by the yen's sharp rebound.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 207 points _ its biggest point loss since early January _
on pessimism over Japan's economy. It closed at 8,627 points.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 10.51 points, or 0.90 percent, to 1,156.70.
The TOPIX closed down 10.04 points, or 0.85 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.175 percent from Monday's finish of 1.185 percent,
driving its price up to 112.20 yen from 112.12 yen.

Work begins on Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Construction of Australia's first new
uranium mine in a decade was under way Tuesday, after a protracted
legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing
environmental protest.
	   A single bulldozer entered the Jabiluka mining lease in northern
Australia late Monday and began clearing the site ahead of actual
construction, miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. said.
	   Chief executive Phillip Shirvington said construction of the
mine will take up to 18 months.
	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium
oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium
ore bodies in the world.
	   It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian
dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an
about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world
uranium market.
	   Australia has about 30 percent of the world's recoverable
uranium reserves, but only about 14 percent of the world market
because of a previous government's restriction on the number of
uranium mines.
	   The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several
other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
	   Work began on site despite the company not having final approval
for its preferred plan for the project.
	   The company wants to truck uranium ore from Jabiluka to its
existing mine and plant at Ranger, about 13 miles (20 kms) away,
for processing. The plan has been approved by government but is
opposed by key Aboriginal landowners, who don't want Jabiluka to
proceed.
	   A more expensive option is building processing facilities at
Jabiluka. ERA has a 1983 agreement signed by the landowners
approving this plan, but does not have environmental approvals from
the federal government.
	   Landowners have disputed the 1983 agreement and their attempts
to have the mining lease declared invalid have failed in the
courts.
	   Shirvington said Tuesday the contractor currently working on the
site agreed to work for ERA after protesters blockading the site
chained themselves to his truck as he was trying to reach a
different job.
	   ``He was pretty angry, we saw the opportunity and negotiated
with him to start working for us; he agreed and started straight
away,'' Shirvington said. ``The protesters delivered him right into
our hands.''
	   Kate Lecchi, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said they didn't
believe the contractor was not going to work on the Jabiluka site,
and that demonstrators will continue to try to stop construction.
	   ``We believe that because of our actions ERA is a year behind
schedule on this mine and we hope to delay them even more,'' she
said from the protest site, about 220 miles (350 kms) from Darwin.

Orioles end Wells' winning streak, Royals beat Indians in 10
</HEADLINE>
innings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ The Baltimore Orioles ended David Wells'
eight-game winning streak Monday night, scoring the go-ahead run on
a close play at the plate in the sixth inning of a 7-4 victory over
the New York Yankees.
	   The game also featured the ejection of Yankees reliever Mike
Stanton in a scene eerily similar to the one that started a brawl
between the teams in New York on May 19.
	   Stanton hit Eric Davis with a pitch immediately after allowing a
seventh-inning solo homer to Rafael Palmeiro that made it 6-4. Last
month, Orioles reliever Armando Benitez hit Tino Martinez with a
fastball after yielding a home run to Bernie Williams.
	   Wells (8-2) allowed five runs and 10 hits in six innings.
	   Erickson (7-6) allowed four runs and seven hits in seven innings
and Jesse Orosco got his fifth save.
 &UR; Royals 7, Indians 6, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Jeff King hit a two-run homer in the 10th inning
as Kansas City handed the Indians their fourth straight loss.
	   Hal Morris singled off Jose Mesa (3-3) to open the 10th. King
followed with his 12th homer into the center field bleachers.
	   Jeff Montgomery (1-3) got the win despite allowing three runs in
the ninth for his third blown save. Matt Whisenant allowed one run
in the 10th before picking up his first save.
 &UR; White Sox 3, Red Sox 2 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Rookie Jim Parque pitched seven strong innings and
the White Sox scored three runs in the fifth to halt Boston's
four-game winning streak.
	   Parque (2-0), making just his fifth major league start, gave up
one run and four hits in seven innings _ the longest outing of his
career. Matt Karchner got his eighth save.
	   Chicago broke open a scoreless game in the fifth inning with
four straight singles and a sacrifice fly off Bret Saberhagen
(8-4).
 &UR; Tigers 3, Twins 2 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Brian Moehler remained unbeaten at home and Bobby
Higginson homered as the Tigers snapped a six-game home losing
streak.
	   Moehler (6-5), who is 6-0 with a 1.98 ERA at home, pitched 7 2-3
innings, giving up solo homers to Todd Walker and Matt Lawton. Todd
Jones got his 10th save.
	   Brad Radke (8-5) lost for only the second time in his last seven
decisions. He allowed three runs on eight hits, struck out four and
walked none in eight innings.
 &UR; Devil Rays 8, Blue Jays 7 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Kevin Stocker's sacrifice fly capped
a three-run eighth inning for Tampa Bay, which came back after
squandering a five-run lead.
	   Quinton McCracken homered twice to drive in four runs and Wade
Boggs celebrated his 40th birthday with a solo homer for the Devil
Rays.
	   Rick White (1-3) pitched a perfect inning for the victory and
Roberto Hernandez got for his 13th save.
	   Paul Quantrill (0-3) took the loss.
 &UR; Angels 8, Rangers 5 &QC; 
	   In Arlington, Texas, Steve Sparks got his first victory in
almost two years, and Phil Nevin hit a two-run homer as the Anaheim
Angels beat the Rangers.
	   Sparks (1-0) gave up four runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings for
his first major league victory since July 1, 1996, when he played
for the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   Garret Anderson and Tim Salmon hit solo homers, and Gary
DiSarcina went 3-for-3 as the Angels narrowed the Rangers' lead to
a half-game in the AL West. Anaheim won three of four games in the
series.
	   Sparks, who missed all last season following surgery on his
pitching elbow, struck out five and walked one.

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Derek Bell drove in three runs with a pair of
doubles and Jeff Bagwell hit a two-run homer Monday night as the
Houston Astros finished a successful road trip with a 13-2 victory
over the Cincinnati Reds.
	   The Astros went 5-2 in Detroit and Cincinnati to gain sole
possession of first place in the NL Central. The Astros have won
seven of nine overall, matching the 1970 club for best start in
Houston history at 42-26.
	   By splitting the four-game series, the Reds remained at a
season-low 10 games under .500 (30-40). Cincinnati has lost 10 of
its last 13 games.
 &UR; Phillies 2, Pirates 1 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Matt Beech struck out a career-high 11 and
limited Pittsburgh to four hits in eight innings.
	   Desi Relaford extended his hitting streak to 10 games, tops
among NL rookies this year, and drove in the go-ahead run with a
two-out single in the sixth.
	   Beech (3-3) topped his career high of nine strikeouts, set in
his previous start against Baltimore on June 9. Mark Leiter pitched
the ninth for his 13th save.
 &UR; Cubs 6, Brewers 5 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa had the second three-homer game of his
career to power the Cubs past the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   Sosa hit solo homers off Cal Eldred in the first, third and
seventh innings for his 26th career multi-homer game and fourth
this year.
	   Terry Adams (6-3), working in relief of starter Kerry Wood,
pitched two-thirds of an inning for the victory. Rod Beck pitched
the ninth for his 17th save.
	   Wood, the celebrated Cubs' rookie, gave up five runs, three hits
and six walks in 7 1-3 innings. He struck out nine.
