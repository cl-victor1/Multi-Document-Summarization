<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 204 people were
killed in 11 air crashes in Russia over the first 10 months of
1996 against 69 in nine crashes in the same period of 1995, the
Russian Federal Aviation Service (FAS) said today.
</P>
<P>
FAS attributed the accidents to "the human factor," saying that
errors by flight crews, air traffic controllers and technicians
accounted for 66 percent of the accidents while mechanic failure
in flight made up for 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Straying from established air corridors and landing approaches
is a common element in disasters, FAS said. Besides, there have
been continuous breaches of aircraft loading rules, dangerous
maneuvering at altitude close to the ground, total fuel exhaustion
in flight and refueling lower quality oil.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Presidents, Donors Adopt Peace Consolidation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's three presidents and
the international donor countries for Bosnia today adopted a peace
consolidation plan calling for an accelerated re-settlement of
refugees driven from their homes during the 1991-1995 Bosnian War.
</P>
<P>
The guarantee of freedom of movement and putting on trial of
war criminals were also parts of the peace consolidation process
to be implemented in the next two years, signed by Bosnia's Muslim
Alija Izetbegovic, Croat Kresimir Zubak and Serb Momcilo Krajisnik
in Elysee Palace, Paris.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing progress in peace implementation and
"military and civilian stabilization" of Bosnia since the Dayton
peace agreement was signed one year ago, the sponsors of Dayton
treaty said that "only modest progress has been achieved on the
return of refugees and displaced people."
</P>
<P>
The donor countries said that the Bosnians themselves must take
the bulk of peace-making and consolidation work, in order to win
further international aid.
</P>
<P>
"Without compliance and active participation in rebuilding a
civil society, they cannot expect that the international community
and major donors will continue shouldering the burden of
implementation and reconstruction efforts," the plan said.
</P>
<P>
The international community has not decided when to withdraw
the Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia, while most of the
villagers in Bosnia are resisting resettlement plans for displaced
people of other ethnicities.
</P>
<P>
The international ministerial board, consisting of major
Western donor countries and representatives from the Organization
of Islamic Conference and some U.N. organs, today met with the
three presidents of Bosnia before reaching the guiding principles
on peace consolidation plan.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia is also required to continue the control of armaments in
the country to a minimum level, re-establishing law and order,
protecting human rights, pushing forward democratic process,
conducting elections in 1997 and 1998, building a market economy,
re-establishing schools and removing land mines.

<HEADLINE> Santer: "No Retun to 19th Century Dickensian Sweat-Shops" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- European Commission(EC)
President Jacques Santer today strongly expressed himself in
favor of the 48-hour work rule upheld by the European Court of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 7th European Day of Commerce in Brussels, Mr.
Santer said: "Yes, we need more flexible labour markets but not a
return to the Dickensian sweat-shops in the 19 century."
</P>
<P>
The EC President interrogated: "Those who seem to say the less
social regulation, the better it is for competitivity, do they
mean no regulation at all?"
</P>
<P>
He said: "a 48-hour week was a very long week, a minimum
standard, which allows those who want to work more if they so
wish."
</P>
<P>
A European court overrode Tuesday British objections and
ordered Mr. Major's government to comply with an European Union
law limiting the working week to 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Calling the decision an unacceptable intrusion into Britain's
free-market economy, Mr. Major warned fellow EU leaders that he
would block constitutional reforms designed to enable the EU to
expand into Eastern Europe unless they agree to exempt Britain
from the working-time law.
</P>
<P>
Senior European officials quickly condemned Mr. Major's
tactics,, however, and insisted that Britain's 14 EU partners were
unlikely to support his request.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian president
Kenneth Kaunda said today that his party is collecting voters
cards across the country to pass a vote of no confidence in the
government.
</P>
<P>
He indicated at a public rally in Chingola in Copperbelt
Province that his United National Independence Party (UNIP) would
call for an interim government if it collects more than 50
percent of the voters cards, the Zambia News Agency (ZANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said that the UNIP would count all the cards it had
collected and compare them to those cast for President Frederick
Chiluba in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Should the surrendered cards outnumber those cast, his party
would demand the chief justice form an interim government while
preparing for fresh elections, Kaunda told the rally.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP and several other opposition parties have declared
their election boycott in protest against the government
insistence that the elections be held under the new constitution,
which in fact bars Kaunda from contesting the presidency because
his parents are foreign immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: MENA Three in Cairo Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here today that the third Middle East and North
Africa Economic Conference (MENA Three) has turned out to be
a success.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the comment at a press conference held at the
Cairo International Conference Center, where the MENA Three has
undergone sessions for three days and is drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the conference was featured with three new
elements, compared with two previous conferences held in
Casablanca, Morocco, in 1994 and in Amman, Jordan, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The first was Arab-Arab cooperation, a feature which went
through many sessions, presentations and workshops at the MENA
Three, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second was the Mediterranean participation and
Euro-Mediterranean-Middle East cooperation. He cited a number of
examples such as "building on Barcelona and building on
Mediterranean forum" as new dimensions of the economic conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Moussa, the third was the participation of a
large number of businessmen and officials from African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, citing unconfirmed reports, said that the business
talks between Egyptian and Arab business people with their
foreign counterparts would exceed 10 billion U.S. dollars at
the conference.
</P>
<P>
"As President (Hosni) Mubarak said, peace is the foundation
of sustained and successful regional cooperation," Moussa noted
in an euphemistic indication to urge Israel to proceed on
the track of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, some Western and Middle East countries signed
a series of preliminary agreements that could pave the way
for major regional business contracts, including a 2-4 billion
dollar deal under which Egypt will export liquefied natural
gas to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Observers here maintain that the agreements were evidence of
the business community's confidence in the economic potential of
the region and its willingness to support the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"These signings are the manifestation of increased commercial
activity in the region," said U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey
Kantor, who was present at two signing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,500 people, including 2,000 businessmen, from
some 90 countries and regions participated in the three-day
economic gathering.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Increases in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Consumer Price Index
(CPI) rose by 0.3 percent in October resulting from the continued
surge of food costs and the gain of gasoline prices, the U.S.
Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department reported that the increase in October's CPI
matched the September advance. But excluding the volatile food and
energy sectors, the so-called core rate of inflation in consumer
level was up by only 0.2 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices were up by 0.7 percent overall as gasoline prices
rose by 0.7 percent, the first time since May. Home heating prices
soared by 7 percent, the biggest one-month gain since an 8.8
percent increase last January.
</P>
<P>
Food prices increased by 0.6 percent in October, the fourth
time in the past five months. They were driven higher by sharp
increases for dairy products, fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent increase in the so-called core rate prices
excluding food and energy reflected a drop in the price of new
cars, which declined by 0.2 percent in October following a 0.5
percent jump in September.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said so far they see no worrisome signs that
inflation in the U.S. is getting out of hand despite the fact that
unemployment has fallen to near a seven-year low.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) also decided to keep the short-term
interest rates unchanged Wednesday, apparently believing that the
inflation poses no threat to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of this year, U.S. consumer inflation
has been rising at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, faster that the
2.5 percent increase recorded for all of 1995. All of the
acceleration has come from higher food and energy costs.
</P>
<P>
But excluding the volatile food and energy cost, the so-called
core rate of inflation has risen by just 2.8 percent so far this
year, better than last year's 3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe the core rate gives a better reading of
underlying price pressures facing the U.S. economy.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Vows to Rescue Ex-KGB Officer Detained by U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 14 (Xinhua) -- In an all-out effort to rescue
its former KGB agent recently jailed by the United States, Russia
today threatened to hit back by "taking corresponding actions" if
the United States does not agree to a release.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is trying all diplomatic approaches to pressure the
United States into freeing Vladimir Galkin, a retired officer for
the now defunct Committee for State Security in the Soviet Union,
or KGB, a senior Foreign Ministry official said under anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"If Galkin's case does not end peacefully and he is not allowed
to freely leave for Moscow, the Russian side will take adequate
response measures," said the spokeswoman for the Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR) Director Tatyana Samolis.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, former SVR chief, is
personally supervising the rescue work, the official said. Under
the instruction of Primakov, Russian Ambassador to the United
States Yuly Vorontsov met with a U.S. Department of State senior
official on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Galkin, 50, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) on October 29 on charges of trying to obtain confidential
materials on the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, better known
as the Star Wars, in a third country as soon as he landed at New
York.
</P>
<P>
Russia said the arrest was a designed "entrapment" and an "open
provocation" as the United States issued the detention warrant at
virtually the same time it granted Galkin the entry visa.
</P>
<P>
Now a deputy general director for a Russian-U.S. company,
Galkin had never concealed his previous occupation when applying
for a U.S. visa.
</P>
<P>
"The longer this case lasts, the more it turns from a Galkin
case into a problem in mutual relations between the SVR and CIA
(Central Intelligence Agency) and finally, into a slap for the
Russian state," Samolis said.
</P>
<P>
She said Moscow is waiting for news from Washington, hoping for
the prudence of U.S. authorities. "Political methods have not yet
been exhausted," she added.
</P>
<P>
The official said the United States has to sort its way out of
the deadlock as the U.S. Department of State and CIA seemed to
have different opinions with the FBI and its patron, the
Department of Justice, over the ex-spy's arrest.

<HEADLINE> Speakers Emphasize Food Security, Hunger Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Delegates speaking at the Rome
World Food Summit have all emphasized the importance of food
security and hunger eradication and some of them pinpointed
specific problems relating to the two goals.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said that not only a
dramatic contrast exists between some nations battling with
shortages causing famine while others are struggling with
surplus, but in one country some people have plenty of food while
others have to struggle with hunger and famine.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was the first head of state to speak at the general
meeting. His southern African nation is one of the few sub-Saharan
countries that enjoy a relatively high degree of food security.
Sub-Saharan Africa is the region worst hit by hunger and
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe specificly shared his country's experience in helping
the small-holder farmers as one of the government measures to
realize food security.
</P>
<P>
Because of the imbalances in the land ownership structures
inherited from past colonial policies, Zimbabwean small-holder
farming areas are characterized by low rainfall and poor soils and
are located far from the market and transport networks. To correct
these imbalances, the government is pursuing a policy of land
re-allocation and resettlement of vast sections of communal
smaller-holder farmers. The government is also increasing
investment in infrastructure such as roads, water supply,
irrigation, electricity and social services.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Vice-Premier Tran Duc Luong told the summit that
increase in food output serves as a fundamental and decisive
factor for a poor and low-income country to ensure national food
security.
</P>
<P>
He said that although his country is a food exporting country,
10-15 percent of the Vietnamese population are still threatened by
food shortage and more than 40 percent of the under-five children
remain undernourished because of inadequate access to food.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Minister of Agriculture and Food Supply Arlindo Porto
said that hunger eradication is an imperative need in order to
ensure to all human beings their most elementary right--the right
to food.
</P>
<P>
"The full compliance with this right must become a priority for
the international community," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He said that further agricultural trade liberalization is
essential for enhancing world food security. "Restrictions on
trade would force countries to count only on their own domestic
production, thus reducing their average revenue and the
availability of a wide-range of products and worsen the existing
problems of malnutrition," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales in U.S. Increases Slightly in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in the U.S.
rose a slight 0.2 percent in October, much slower than the gain in
September, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that retale sales in the month
totaled a seasonally adjusted 206.6 billion dollars, up from a
revised 206.2 billion in September.
</P>
<P>
The sales slowed from the 0.8 percent advance in September when
the gain was revised up from the initial estimate of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that sales of durable goods -- items expected
to last more than three years -- were flat in October following a
gain of 0.9 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods such as food and fuel increased by
0.3 percent, less than half the 0.7 percent advance in September.
</P>
<P>
Retale sales in the U.S. were sluggish during the first two
months of the July-September quarter, including a 0.1 percent dip
in August, due in part to heavy debt burdens for consumers.
</P>
<P>
But they began to pick up in the final month, raising hopes for
a successful holiday season at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Retale sales amount to about one third of U.S. economic
activities and the government said today that it watches closely
for signs of any momentum leading to the all-important Christmas
shopping season.
</P>
<P>
The Christmas shopping season usually accounts for as much as
half of total retale sales and profits in a year.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Rises to 2.7% in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Annual headline inflation rate
in Britain rose sharply to 2.7 percent last month from 2.1 percent
in September, putting new pressure on the Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke for another pre-election rise in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), the underlying inflation rate, which excludes
the effects of changes in mortgage interest payment, was unchanged
last month.
</P>
<P>
But in year-on-year terms, it jumped to 3.3 percent from the
2.9 percent rate seen in September, reaching its highest level
since September 1993.
</P>
<P>
This compares with the Chancellor's underlying inflation target
of 2.5 percent by next April.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party seized the chance and mounted a new
attack on the Conservative Party with Labor's economics spokesman
Gordon Brown saying that the figures made a mockery of the prime
minister's claim that he had conquered inflation.
</P>
<P>
But John Major dismissed the rise in inflation as a blip,
saying that the leap in the annual rate last month was
artificially high because of an exceptional fall in October 1995
and promising that over the next few months it would correct
itself.
</P>
<P>
However, economists agreed that the figures had narrowed
Clarke's room for maneuver and would make it hard for the
government to hit its inflation target without raising interest
rates again.
</P>
<P>
Britain raised interest rates from 5.75 percent to 6.0 percent
on October 30 for the first time in nearly two years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Political, Economic Situation in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China enjoys political stability, economic
prosperity, unity among various ethnic groups, social progress and
the Chinese people are confident about the future.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Latin American Economic System (SELA), the
Chinese premier said China has maintained rapid economic growth in
the 18 years since 1978 when China introduced the policy of reform
and opening up to the outside world, with the annual growth rate
of the gross national product (GNP) averaging more than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic development has helped improve substantially
the living standards of the Chinese people and its national
economic strength, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Venezuela Tuesday on a three-day visit on the
last leg of his three-nation Latin American tour. He earlier
visited Chile and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that China's current foreign exchange
reserves are close to 100 billion U.S. dollars, and its huge
economic potential, broad market prospects and fine investment
environment have helped China absorb 160 billion U.S. dollars in
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
He said China's cooperation and exchanges with other parts of
the world have also been expanding so rapidly that its import and
export volume has been growing at an average annual rate of more
than 16 percent to 280 billion dollars in 1995 with a basically
balanced international payment.
</P>
<P>
All these have been made possible under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said any unbiased person in the world can see that
China is marching in a stable way along the road of developing
Socialist market economy and building Socialist democratic
politics, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China formulated early this year its development blueprint and
set the development targets for the last five years of this
century and through 2010.
</P>
<P>
Li quoted the document as saying the country's annual GNP will
grow at an average rate of 8 percent during the five years and the
country's planned per capita GNP for the year 2000 will be
increased by three times on the basis of that of 1980 while a
Socialist market economic system will be set up at its first stage.
</P>
<P>
China's economy will maintain the momentum of rapid development
during the first decade of the next century, which will lay a
solid foundation for China's modernization, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the current economic situation in China, the
targets can be realized, the premier noted.
</P>
<P>
He said China attaches great importance to both material
civilization and ethical and cultural progress in the
modernization drive and described the two aspects as being
complementary, representing the achievements of social progress of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
"We are vigorously promoting the transformation from the
traditional system of planned economy to that of socialist market
economy, and from the extensive pattern of economic growth to the
intensive pattern," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is also pursuing two strategies, the strategy of
invigorating China through scientific upgrading and education and
the strategy of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
He explained that China will carry on the fine traditions of
the Chinese nation while absorbing all positive accomplishments of
human civilization, and strive for the realization of a
coordinated social and economic development and all-round social
progress.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident and are capable of building China into a
strong and prosperous, democratic and civilized country of
modernization through arduous efforts in the decades to come," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the general international situation is gradually
relaxing, but the world is full of contradictions and human
subsistence and development are faced with serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
Safeguarding world peace, strengthening friendship and
cooperation and promoting common development have become the
common aspiration of the people of various countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China, which has always been pursuing an independent and
peaceful foreign policy, is an important force in the safeguarding
of world peace, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are willing to work together with the people
of other parts of the world and bring a new world of peace,
security and prosperity into the 21st century, the Chinese premier
said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Principles Guiding Development of Sino-Latin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today put
forth five principles guiding the development of relations between
China and Latin America and outlined the focus in enlarging economic
and trade cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the headquarters of Latin-american Economic
System here this morning, Li Peng said China attaches great
importance to the development of its relations with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The five principles put forth by the Chinese Premier for
guiding the development of relations between China and Latin
America are:
</P>
<P>
-- strengthening political dialogue between countries to
increase mutual understanding and trust;
</P>
<P>
-- engaging in economic and technological cooperation in
various forms to promote common development;
</P>
<P>
-- increasing people-to-people exchange to enlarge the areas
for exchange and cooperation;
</P>
<P>
-- supporting each other in international affairs to
safeguarding the interests of developing countries;
</P>
<P>
-- and seeking to establish normal state relations with those
countries which have not established diplomatic ties with China on
the principles of peace and co-existence.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Li also proposed four areas of priority for
enlarging economic and trade cooperation between China and
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean Region.
</P>
<P>
The four aspects of priority for enlarging cooperation include:
</P>
<P>
-- enthusiastically enlarging bilateral trade;
</P>
<P>
-- endeavoring to develop cooperation between enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- attaching importance to the development and utilization of
natural resources through the form of joint venture;
</P>
<P>
-- and strengthening exchanges in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Li's speech also covered progress made in the development of
ties and cooperation between China and Latin America, China's
development and the gains borne out of his current three-nation
Latin-American tour.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier called for joint efforts to open a new
chapter in the development of relations between China and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Moneta, permanent secretary of Latin American Economic
System (SELA), said in his welcome speech that SELA felt honored
to have the Chinese premier to make an important speech at the
Home of Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
He said the speech to be made by the premier will contribute to
strengthening and deepening the economic ties between Latin
America and China and between Latin America and Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said Latin America and the Caribbean, especially the Latin
American Economic System, are following the reform and opening-up
in China.
</P>
<P>
He said SELA could play an important role in promoting the
economic relations between China and countries in Latin America
and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The 100-seat hall where Li made the speech was packed to the
full. Among those present were senior Venezuelan government
officials, parliamentarians and celebrities of all works of life.

<HEADLINE> Rioting Occurs in South U.S. after Panel Justifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Riot erupted in St.
Petersburg, Florida, Wednesday night after a white police officer
was cleared in the fatal shooting of a black motorist last month,
the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Angry black youths went to the streets of south St. Petersburg
Wednesday evening, pelting passing cars with rocks, setting more
than 80 fires, and shooting at a police helicopter and wounding
the co-pilot. Another officer was shot in the leg and at least
seven other people were injured, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 police officers took to the streets, closing off
streets and firing canisters of tear gas to control the situation.
The National Guard was also placed on standby.
</P>
<P>
By early today, the streets seamed calm, leaving only remaining
blazes in homes and businesses. Several people were arrested in
the riot.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, a grand jury ruled that Officer Jim Knight
was justified in shooting the motorist, TyRon Lewis, during a
traffic stop on October 24.
</P>
<P>
Lewis bumped the officer four times in an stolen car and
refused to follow orders to surrender before Knight fired through
the windshield, killing Lewis, a panel statement was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The October 24 shooting triggered a riot in the same city in
which police cars were rocked, houses were set on fire and several
people were injured in conflicts between protesters and police.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Hails Sino-Latin American Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng hailed
Sino-Latin American relations here today, saying the friendly and
cooperative relations have contributed to establishing a new type
of South-South cooperation and a new international political and
economic order.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks when addressing the South American Economic
System (SELA) here.
</P>
<P>
"As developing nations, China and the Latin American countries
speak the same language and, through joint efforts, have been
expanding their friendly cooperation with each passing day," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that contacts between China and Latin America have a
long history. China has now established diplomatic relations with
17 Latin American countries and kept close political contacts with
them.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange of visits by leaders of China and many Latin
American countries has helped increase mutual understanding,
develop friendship and facilitate cooperation," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the economic field, the two sides have also made progress in
boosting trade and business cooperation, with their trade volume
totalling more than six billion U.S. dollars in 1995, twice that
of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, China has started to invest in 24
Latin American countries and regions, launching joint ventures or
solely Chinese funded enterprises, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also provided more than 20 Latin
American and Caribbean countries with economic aid with no
political conditions attached, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Through mutual support and close cooperation, China and Latin
American and Caribbean countries have contributed to establishing
a new type of South-South cooperation, improving the North-South
relationship, raising the status and enhancing the role of
developing countries, and creating a peaceful, stable, just and
reasonable new international political and economic order," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Latin America and the Caribbean, boasting vast
territory and abundant resources, are among the regions with the
greatest potentials and prospects for development.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will make efforts to build long-term, stable
and friendly cooperative relations with the Latin American and
Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
Li also spelled out five principles guiding the development of
Sino-Latin American relations and four priorities in expanding
Sino-Latin American economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The principles include strengthening political dialogue,
expanding economic cooperation and supporting each other in
international affairs to safeguard the interests of developing
countries. The four priorities are trade, direct cooperation
between enterprises, joint tapping of natural resources and
exchanges in science and technology.

<HEADLINE> MENA Economic Conference Ends, Calling for Peace, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Cairo Declaration adopted unanimously at the end of the
three-day event held at the Cairo International Conference
Centre, 3,500 participants expressed their "unswerving
commitments" to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
The participants also called for the strict implementation of
the signed agreements between the Israelis and the Palestinians
and the removal of blockade by Israel on the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging MENA countries to deepen economic reforms, the
conference highlighted the need to speed up privatization,
dismantle trade barriers and create an investor-friendly
environment.
</P>
<P>
The conference also decided to strengthen the existing
institutions, including a Middle East Development Bank,
established in the previous MENA summits with an aim to enhance
the regional economic cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
The participants vowed to "continue to work as partners for
peace and prosperity" in the MENA region, highlighting "the
urgency of achieving concrete progress in the political dimension
of the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa hailed the meeting as
"a great success" which resulted in business deals estimated
at 10 billion dollars. He told a news conference that the
meeting had enhanced the inter-Arab, Arab-European and
Arab-African economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session, U.S. Under-Secretary of
State Kpam Spero said that since peace had transformed the
MENA region, "we all have work to do to keep it moving
forward."
</P>
<P>
"As we look to the future, both the peace process and
domestic economic reform program must keep moving forward or
these economic gains may well be short-lived," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Third MENA conference was convened under the shadow of
the current tension between Israel and its Arab neighbors which at
one point nearly led to Egypt the cancellation of this annual
gathering launched since 1994.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to exclude politics from the more business-oriented
conference, the conference has been downgraded from a summit to a
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, government officials and business
leaders held a variety of plenary and thematic sessions on
exploring ways of creating an investor-friendly environment to
attract the badly-needed foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Participants offered and discussed plans and proposals on
boosting regional economic cooperation and development through
continuing economic reforms, speeding up privatization, upgrading
infrastructure and encouraging private investment.
</P>
<P>
The conference also witnessed the signings of several giant
business deals. Several U.S. companies signed deals totaling
hundreds of millions dollars with Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Oman,
a move apparently designed to underscore Washington's commitment
to cement the Middle East peace process through commerce.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at the conference that the next MENA economic
conference would be convened in 1997 Doha, Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Largest Biodiversity Center Opens in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Center for Environmental
Research and Conservation at Columbia Univerity opened here today
to pioneer new multidisciplinary approaches to species
conservation.
</P>
<P>
The center is a collaboration among five independent scientific
institutions that draws on the expertise of more than 50 faculty,
making it the largest such program of its kind anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The center is undertaking an interated assessment of the
effects of climate change in Indonesia, a long-term project where
researchers are using EL Nino events, long spells of hot, dry
weather as a model for the potential consequences of permanent
global warming for a host of variables, including agricultural
output, economic growth and human diseases.
</P>
<P>
Biologists estimate that humans may cause the loss of as many
as a half-million to a million species in the next 20 years.
Researchers at the center are involved in conservation efforts
around the world, including work to save rhinos and chimpanzees in
Africa; rhinos, elephants, orangutans, and monkeys in Asia;
reptiles and amphibians in Madagascar; Galapagos tortoises,
tropical palms and a host of other endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Professor Don J. Melnick, director of the center said," We are
building our mission to prepare the next generation of
environmental leaders through education, training and research."

<P>
MAPUTO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Harmful potash-bromide
additives, which could cause infant death, deformity and cancer,
have been detected here in the 6,000 tons of
imported flour.
</P>
<P>
Produced in France, the flour was imported from Belgium last
Thursday. It was found containing 25 ppm of potash-bromide,
according to Stephen Schafer, director of the trade department of
Mozambique's state-run Matola Industrial Company.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Mozambican food authority had warned that flour
imported from South Africa was identified to contain 2.5 ppm of
potash-bromide, enough to cause cancer in human body.
</P>
<P>
The trade official criticized "some European flour producers"
for dumping their low-quality, cheap flour to African countries.
</P>
<P>
Schafer said relevant authorities of the Mozambican
government, including the Ministry of Health, Ministry of
Industry, Trade and Tourism and Ministry of Finance and Planning,
have been informed of this case.

LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government is likely
to contribute a limited number of troops to a multinational relief
operation in Zaire in an effort to help more than a million
starving refugees there.
</P>
<P>
Irish government officials are quoted by press reports from

<HEADLINE> MENA Conference Calls for More Efforts in Peace, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The third Middle East and
North Africa Economic Conference (MENA Three) today passed a
Cairo Declaration calling for greater commitment to the ongoing
peace process and more cooperation for common prosperity in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The participants expressed their unswerving commitment to
achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle
East on the basis of U.N. Security Resolutions 242 and 338.
</P>
<P>
The 3,500 participants from some 90 countries and regions
across the world participated the three-day sessions.
</P>
<P>
The participants, in the declaration, also expressed their
determination to build upon the agreements reached among parties
concerned, calling on expeditious implementation of the
agreements by all parties, especially on the Israeli-Palestinian
track.
</P>
<P>
The participants expressed their appreciation to Egypt's
leading role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The participants maintained that the MENA Three provided an
opportunity to encourage international and regional investment in
the Middle East and North Africa, whose economic and commercial
potential was highlighted.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the implementation of programs such as
privatization, structural reform and removal of trade barriers
to facilitate a more business-friendly economic climate
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
The participants stressed the crucial importance of the
development of the Palestinian economy, which is devastated by
Israel's crippling border closure. They noted with concern that the
already-weak Palestinian economy is suffering from restrictions
caused by the closure, which hinders the daily movement of
Palestinian labor and trade.
</P>
<P>
The participants reiterated that removing the restrictive
measures will serve to help improve the Palestinian economy as
well as the political atmosphere surrounding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that the status of the economic
institutions called for by the MENA conferences previously held
in Casablanca in 1994 and in Amman in 1995 was reviewed during the
three-day sessions.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the significant progress made on establishing a
Middle East-Mediterranean Travel and Tourism Association was
welcomed by the participants.
</P>
<P>
"They underscored the importance of the Bank for Economic
Cooperation and Development in the Middle East and North Africa
in Cairo and its potential contribution to the promotion of
capital flow to the region, to building infrastructure projects
and to the development of the private sector in the region," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that countries were encouraged to sign the
agreement and complete their funding and ratification procedures
promptly in order to enable the bank to begin operations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition, work on establishing a regional business council
was also reviewed, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The participants from both government and private sectors
reaffirmed their commitment to continue to work as partners for
peace and prosperity in the Middle East and North Africa. They
also stressed the economic support for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The participants decided to meet again in late 1997 in Doha,
capital of Qatar, for the 4th MENA conference.

<HEADLINE> Perry Restricts U.S. Troops to Relief Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said on Thursday that the American troops would have
to get "the acquiescence" of disputing militias and other factions
before moving into the Central Africa next week.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out any plans of disarming combatants there, but
the U.S. troops would be armed to defend themselves on their
relief mission in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We are not planning a mission to go in and disarm factions or
separate military from refugees. This is a humanitarian mission,"
Perry told reporters at a photo session in the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"Our troops will go in armed and with rules of engagement that
will provide for their own protection.... They are not going in,
though, as a means of conducting military operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton agreed in principle on Wednesday to
dispatch up to 4,000 U.S. troops into the Central Africa as part
of a multinational force to help about one million refugees
languishing in eastern Zaire without food and water.
</P>
<P>
The multinational force will be headed by Lt. Gen. Maurice
Baril, the commander of Canada's land forces, and he will have a
U.S. officer, yet to be chosen, as second in command, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has placed several conditions in
participating the international relief effort, including that the
U.S. troops will stay no longer than four months and the local
combatants allow them to arrive peacefully to minimize the
possibility of U.S. casualties.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials are trying to avoid a repeating of U.S.
troops' disaster in Somalia when 18 American soldiers were killed
in a fire fight with forces of a Somali warlord in Mogadishu in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon officials said that 1,000 American Army
paratroopers will enter into Zaire from their base in Vincenza,
Italy, to undertake the mission of security for Goma airport and a
three-mile corridor from the airport to Kigali so that the channel
for the transportation of humanitarian reliefs could be safely
open. an no more.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that a deployment of troops always has potential
risks, McCurry said the American troops would have "very robust
rules of engagement", which means they could use deadly force to
defend themselves.

<HEADLINE> 10 Foreign Investment Projects to start in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Ten foreign investment
projects worth 700 million U.S. Dollars are expected to start in
Zanzibar soon.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Minister of State in the President's
Office in charge of planning and investment Ali Juma Shamuhuna at
a press conference in the town of Zanzibar today.
</P>
<P>
Shamuhuna said the projects are an outcome of the on-going
investment promotion drive by the Isles government in its
strategy to diversify the economy that had for a long time
survived on clove export.
</P>
<P>
The projects, owned by foreigners from the Gulf region,
include hotel construction, textile and pharmaceutical plants, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said investors from South Africa have also shown
interest in operating projects on joint venture basis with the
government in different fields of roads construction, airport and
port expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said his government is determined to expand the port and
airport to enable them to increase the volume of cargo and
passengers at this time of economic reforms in the Isles.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar government declared the Amaan Industrial Park in
the town of Zanzibar and Fumba area in Zanzibar and Micheweni in
Pemba as Export processing Zones to rehabilitate the ailing Isles
economy.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zanzibar held an international investment forum
which ended with 62 foreign institutions and individuals showing
interest in entering into joint ventures or establishing
companies at the export processing zones.
</P>
<P>
The value of the projects covered by the 62 letters of intent
issued by interested parties is over 80 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: Cairo Conference To Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planning and International Cooperation Minister of the PA Nabil
Sha'ath made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua at the
three-day Middle East and North Africa economic conference.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the Israeli businessmen will put pressure on their
government and bring the peace process back on course. That will
be the conference's biggest success," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked for his comment on the differences between the ongoing
conference and the previous two held in Casablanca in 1994 and in
Amman in 1995, the minister spoke highly of the economic event.
</P>
<P>
"It is very successful. It has combined a judicious mix between
the right political pressures and the long-term economic
development projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his vision on the future, he said without Israel
the world will continue and the success of the conference is not
contingent on the Israeli compliance.
</P>
<P>
In the plenary session on investment held earlier today, the
Palestinian minister stressed the importance to keep economic
prosperity and political going hand in hand to ensure the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"Peace stands on two legs, namely the economic prosperity and
political stability," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Deploring that last year the Palestinian economy witnessed a
very difficult stage, Sha'ath called for the lifting of the
Israel-imposed closure on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and an
end to the sufferings of the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sends Reconnaissance Force to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government
announced here today that Britain was sending a reconnaissance
party to Zaire before a larger British force to be deployed as
part of a multinational relief force.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major told parliament this
afternoon that Britain was willing to participate in the
international relief operation in an effort to help those starving
refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Britain would first send a 40-strong
advance party to the region before the main British force was
deployed, because the ground situation in Zaire was quite complex.
</P>
<P>
"So before sending British troops or deciding on upon the
precise numbers, we need to be absolutely clear about what they
are being asked to do in detail and the conditions under which
they will operate," Major said.
</P>
<P>
"A reconnaissance team will be traveling to the region today
to do this and I hope we will be able to reach a firm decision as
to what troops go before too long," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in follow-on statement, British Defense Secretary
Michael Portillo said he had put the units of Britain's Rapid
Deployment Force on short notice to fly to eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the mission of multinational force would be
limited to about four months and then they would hand it over to
African forces.

<HEADLINE> Syria, PLO Stress Coordination of Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Syria and the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) today gave prominence to their
coordination of policy with regard to regional issues,
particularly the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The issue was highlighted at a meeting here between Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and Farouk Kaddoumi, director of
the Political Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO).
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed Syrian sources, the meeting dealt
with the Arab situation, the Palestine in particular, the
obstacles obstructing the Middle East peace process and its future
prospects in the light of Israel's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi's unannounced visit to Syria came as the Palestinian-Israeli
talks failed to make progress on the issue of Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that a redeployment deal in Hebron,
the last West Bank town still under Israeli control, was near.
</P>
<P>
The same sources revealed that Kaddoumi would be visiting
Jordan and Lebanon to discuss with the respective authorities the
latest developments in the peace process, with a view to
coordinate Arab stances in confronting the Israeli hardline
policies.

<HEADLINE> China Spells out Principles for Sino-Latin American Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
spelled out five principles and four priorities for developing the
friendly Sino-Latin American relations and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Latin American Economic System (SELA) here, the
premier said China attaches great importance to expanding friendly
relations and cooperation with Latin America and the Caribbean
region.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China will stick to five principles in developing
relations with Latin American countries, including promoting
political dialogues to increase mutual understanding and trust,
and engaging in economic and technological cooperation in various
forms to promote common development.
</P>
<P>
Increasing people-to-people exchange to enlarge the areas of
exchange and cooperation, supporting each other in international
affairs to safeguard the interests of developing countries, and
seeking to establish normal state relations with those countries
which have not established diplomatic ties with China on the basis
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are also among the
principles.
</P>
<P>
On promoting economic cooperation, Li proposed that expanding
trade be the first priority, saying trade links between China and
Latin America are not strong enough.
</P>
<P>
There is a great potential for future development in trade,
because the economies of China and the countries in Latin America
highly complement each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China has set up a trade center in Panama and plans to
establish more such centers in the region to boost bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged direct cooperation between enterprises,
calling it another priority for economic cooperation. He said
enterprises of both sides are interested in various forms of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China has a huge market and Latin American investment is
welcome there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Latin America are rich in natural resources and
the two sides could learn from each other to make better use of
these resources.
</P>
<P>
Attaching importance to the development and utilization of
natural resources through the forms of joint ventures is also one
of the priorities for developing Sino-Latin American economic
cooperation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are working on cooperation projects in the
industry of petroleum and iron ore and China's nonferrous metals
sector is planning to invest in Chilean copper mines.
</P>
<P>
China is also willing to expand cooperation in the fields of
forestry, paper-making and agriculture, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li also named scientific and technological exchanges as an area
of priority, saying enhanced cooperation in this field could
improve the economic strength of both sides.
</P>
<P>
He noted that cooperation in this field has got off to a smooth
start, with progress being made in the Sino-Brazilian joint
project of global resources satellites and the signing of an
agreement on space cooperation between China and Chile.
</P>
<P>
The premier also appreciated SELA's role in Sino-Latin American
cooperation and hoped for more efforts in the future.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Tuesday on the last leg of his three-nation
Latin American tour.

<HEADLINE> EU, US Offers Give Momentum to International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The latest market-opening
offers submitted by the European Union and the United States have
apparently give momentum to international negotiations aimed at
liberalizing the 500 billion U.S. dollar a year global
telecommunications markets.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the negotiations held this week at the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Neil McMillan, chairman of the negotiations
said "at least momentum has started to come. It is extremely
encouraging."
</P>
<P>
In an agreed move, the EU and the US tabled their improved
offers in Geneva in the last two days. The EU now is offering to
speed up the liberalization of telecom markets in some member
states, and the US is offering to allow foreign operators to land
submarine cables on its shores.
</P>
<P>
According to McMillan, at least six countries, namely South
Africa, Singapore, South Korea, Poland, Mexico and India, were
encouraged by the EU-US move and had indicated Thursday that they
might be able to come up with their improved offers at the WTO
ministerial meeting due to be held on December 9-13 in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Canada and Brazil signaled that they might catch up with the
tabling of their new offers in mid- or late January.
</P>
<P>
Japan said it too would look further at its existing offers but
noted that any improvements would only be possible after its
government makes the decision in late January concerning the
future structure of its two largest telecom companies, NTT and the
international operator KDD, in which Japan still restrict foreign
ownership to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The telecom talks, being held under the auspices of WTO for
over two years, had been due to end in April. Although the EU
supported the conclusion of a deal at that time, the US refused to
sign at the last minute, saying that other offers, particularly
those from Asia and Latin America, were not good enough.
</P>
<P>
However, WTO members agreed to resume talks in July with the
aim of striking a deal by the new deadline of February 15 next
year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference Thursday, EU top negotiator Karl
Falkenberg shared the optimistic assessment made by McMillan.
"Nothing will allow us to conclude that we can not wrap up the
negotiations in February," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the US had said that it was no longer
sticking to its original position to include in its scheduled
commitments restrictive language concerning international
services, one of the stumbling blocks during the negotiations in
April.
</P>
<P>
The US had threatened to restrict market access to some
countries based on the fear that their telecom operators entering
an open U.S. market would establish telecom links with monopolies
back home that could demand excessive rates for distributing calls
forwarded by U.S. operators, while offering their own subscribers
cheap rates.
</P>
<P>
The US said Thursday that it was drafting domestic licensing
rules to tackle this issue, Falkenberg said.

ATHENS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Two Greeks were given stiff
prison sentences by a local court today after being found guilty
of using the hearse of the Xanthi Mufti's office to transport
illegal immigrants.

it for the funeral of a relative. They were arrested on the
Komotini- Xanthi road when police found four illegal immigrants
from Iraq in the vehicle after it had been stopped at a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrants are to be deported and the hearse was

<HEADLINE> 240 Kilos Hashish Found in Confiscated Boat in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek customs officers in
Chania, Crete today discovered a further 240 kilos of hashish
hidden in a special compartment of a yacht which has remained
moored in the Chania port since early 1994 when it was confiscated
after yielding over 6 tonnes of the narcotic.
</P>
<P>
Today's find came during an exercise being conducted by Chania
customs officers aboard the yacht -- the ''Gypsy Falcon'' -- which
was confiscated on January 3, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Then, the yacht developed a mechanical problem a few miles from
Chania and had to be towed to the port for repairs. During a
routine search of the vessel, customs officers discovered an
initial quantity of 440 kilos of hashish.
</P>
<P>
A subsequent search revealed a further 6 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Two Croats aboard the yacht at the time, which was on its way
from Yemen to Slovenia, were sentenced to life imprisonment.

Justic Bobby Bwalya here today.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba went to South Africa two
days ago to discuss with Mandela his country's election
stalemate.

Campaign Committee Chairman Vernon Mwaanga of the ruling party
said here today that countries in southern Africa must learn to
respect Zambia's sovereignty to build strong bonds of
relationships by not meddling in the internal affairs of the
country.
</P>
<P>
H charged that neighboring countries should not dictate terms
Zambia's electoral process should be conducted.
</P>
<P>
''We cannot be getting instructions from countries that only
got independence a few years ago telling us what to do,'' Mwaanga
said.
</P>
<P>
He said during Chiluba's discussion Tuesday with Mandela,
Mandela suggested that the elections be postponed.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: New Chapter in Sino-Latin American Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng's
successful trip to 3 Latin American countries has effectively
enhanced mutual understanding politically, expanded economic and
trade cooperation, thus ushering in a new period of Sino-Latin
American relations featured by long-term stability, equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng left here today for Rome to attend the World Food
Summit and visit Italy after concluding the Latin American trip
which took him to Chile, Brazil and Venezuela. The trip turned
out to be a complete success, Li told Xinhua before leaving.
</P>
<P>
During the official trip, Li held talks with presidents of the
three countries on bilateral relations and regional and
international issues of mutual concern and reached extensive
common acknowledgement, which has helped lay a solid political
base in maintaining and pushing ahead the good Sino-Latin American
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreements for retaining the consulates
general of Chile, Brazil and Venezuela in Hong Kong after July 1,
1997 when China resumes the exercising of sovereignty over Hong
Kong could be well served as an evidence of China's positive
attitude towards its relations with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, Li Peng accepted an interview with major local media
organizations. In Venezuela, the premier gave a lecture to
officials of the Latin-American Economic System. On the two
occasions, Li Peng elaborated China's principled stand and views
on bilateral and major international issues while making brief
accounts of China's domestic situation. This, in no doubt, played
an important role in helping the Latin American people better
understand and trust in China.
</P>
<P>
Li's just-concluded trip marked the continuation of the
frequent exchanges of visits by senior Chinese and Latin-American
leaders. Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Brazil in 1993 and
Li Peng visited Mexico and Peru a year ago. During that trip, Li
Peng made public China's five principles in handling its relations
with Latin America. The principles have proved to be of great
role in promoting the all-round development of the bilateral
relations. The principles include strengthening political
dialogues, conducting economic, scientific and technological
cooperation in various forms, mutual support in international
affairs and establishing normal country-to-country relations with
those that has not diplomatically linked.
</P>
<P>
An important evidence marking the yielding of Premier Li's trip
is the signing of a dozen of agreements between China and the
three countries. The signing of a new agreement between China and
Brazil on aerospace study has provided a new opportunity for the
in-depth cooperation in the aspect.
</P>
<P>
Though separated afar, China and Latin American countries are
all developing countries and their economies, which are among the
fastest rank in the world in terms of the growth rate, are
strongly supplementary. In the world today with the economy
becoming increasingly internationalized, the reinforcing of
cooperation in political, economic and all other fields benefits
not only the developing countries but also the world peace and the
healthy progress of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached importance to advancing cooperation
with developing countries in international affairs, economic and
trade ties in particular. The conspicuous yielding of Premier
Li's visit to the three Latin American countries will prove that
the Sino-latin American all-faceted cooperation can be well cited
as a model in South-South cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
expressed the hope that the Latin American Economic System (SELA)
as a regional economic organization will play a greater role in
promoting the economic ties between China and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with SELA Permanent Secretary Carlos Moneta here
this afternoon, Li said China attaches great importance to its
relations with Latin America and is willing to endeavor to
accelerate such relations, especially economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides should be far sighted and explore more
areas of cooperation to the mutual benefit of both sides.
</P>
<P>
He also said there exists great potential for Sino-Latin
American economic and trade cooperation and the two sides should
increase the exchange of information and gain an all-round
knowledge of each other's needs by conducting an on-the-spot
investigation of each other's environment for investment.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Moneta said the SELA, as a regional economic
organization, takes an enthusiastic attitude toward enlarging
economic, trade and technological cooperation between Latin
America and China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his agreement to the principles put forth by Li
Peng in a speech at the headquarters of the SELA this morning for
guiding the development of relations between Latin America and
China and the four areas of priority outlined by the premier for

<HEADLINE> Petition Challenging Chiluba's Nomination Thrown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's supreme court today threw
out a petition challenging President Frederick Chiluba's presidential
nomition.
</P>
<P>
The seven judges unanimously upheld that the petition is
premature because the electoral act requires that petitions against
nomination of a particular candidate be filed to the supreme court
within 14 days after the elections.
</P>
<P>
Controversy has of late surrounded the citizenship of President
Chiluba with some opposition parties alleging that one of his parents
is a Zairian.
</P>
<P>
Four opposition parties including the United National Independence
Party (UNIP) led by former President Kenneth Kaunda filed the
petition against Chiluba's monimation.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP and some other opposition parties have declared their
election boycott in protest against the government insistence that
the elections be held under the new constitution, which bars in fact
Kaunda from running for the presidency because his parents are
foreign immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba last month filed his presidential nomination in which
he swore that he is a Zambian by birth. enditem

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Chiluba to Postpone Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today requested Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba to postpone the general elections in Zambia in the
interests of peace.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's general elections, scheduled for November 18, was
boycotted by seven opposition parties, including former President
Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
Mandela on Wednesday sent Judge Richard Goldstone to Zambia to
discuss the possible postponement with Zambian Electoral
Commission Chairman Justice Bobby Bwalya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Durban today during his visit to
Kwazulu/Natal Province, Mandela said Bwalya had indicated to
Goldstone that in terms of the constitution, he was powerless to
postpone the poll, said a source reaching here.
</P>
<P>
However, Bwalya was quoted by Mandela as saying that Chiluba
had two options on the matter. He can either declare a state of
emergency which would then automatically postpone the election,
or he has got a prerogative in terms of the law to postpone the
poll.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also said he had already sent an urgent fax to
Chiluba, asking him to take either of these two alternatives in
the interests of peace in that country.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting on Tuesday in Pretoria, Mandela suggested
a postponement of the forthcoming elections in an attempt to
bring about a solution to the boycott by the oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiluba said the scheduled elections would go ahead
next week despite a planned poll boycott by the oppositions.

<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Almost all the striking
nurses at the Lesotho government-owned hospitals were suspended
from their duties without pay, the South African Press
Association reported today from Maseru, capital of the
land-locked kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The suspension would come into full effect on Monday next
week, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Lesotho Nurses Association (LNA) went on strike
on Monday to demand better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to the LNA, the strike was caused by the
government's failure to respond to nurses' grievances, including
a lack of medical equipment and staff shortages, a need for
improved salaries, risk allowances and uniforms.
</P>
<P>
The four-day strike has disrupted most critical services at
the hospitals, with patients being discharged soon after
admission as there was nobody to look after them, said the
report. enditem

<HEADLINE> Better Investment Environment Urged for MENA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Economies in the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) must create better environment for investment,
a large conference for the region was told.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they risk being left behind in races against those
in other regions, said World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab at the
just-concluded third MENA economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen attending the conference urged governments in the
region to reduce their involvement in the economy to create more
investment resources.
</P>
<P>
They also called for the transparency of legal, financial and
taxation systems and consistent and coordinated macro-economic
policies, particularly in the free flow of goods and capital.
</P>
<P>
At present the MENA region attracts only one percent of the
200-billion-U.S.-dollar global foreign direct investment every
year.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for a peaceful and secure environment
for private investment in the region, with many participants
singling out the fragile Middle East peace process a major obstacle
to investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Palestinian Authority, in their speeches at
the conference, focused attention on their need for a convincing
peace to secure investments.
</P>
<P>
Since peace talks were stalled earlier this year, a number of
commercial investments have folded, including plans for a Mariott
Hotel in Gaza and the West Bank, they said.
</P>
<P>
Brian Unwin, president and chairman of the European Development
Bank, said the international community should help improve
investment environment through multi-lateral cooperation and offer
partial credit guarantees that cover risk associated with
government behaviors.

Addressing the third committee which deals with social,
humanitarian and cultural issues, Chinese delegate Wang Min
noted that these treaty bodies should take into full account the
different levels of economic development and religious and
cultural backgrounds of various countries.
</P>
<P>
They should also strictly fulfill their mandated
responsibilities within their respective spheres of competence
on an impartial, objective and non-selective basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that whether to accede to a human rights instrument
or to make necessary reservations is a sovereign act of a state.
It would be counter-productive to force them to do so, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang Min told the meeting that China has so far acceded to 15
international human rights conventions and its implementation of
relevant provisions has been acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready, on the basis of equality of mutual respect,
to further strengthen its cooperation with all U.N. rights
organs," he observed.
</P>
<P>
On the future relations between Hong Kong and the international
covenants on civil and political rights, he said that after 30 June
1997, the relevant provisions of the two U.N. human rights
covenants as applied to Hong Kong would remain in force and be
implemented through the laws of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> PA Calls for Unity of Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- On the occasion of the
Independence Day, the Palestinian Authority (PA) called on its
people today to strengthen unity in order to achieve full
independence.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was announced in a statement issued by the
Palestinian Information Ministry in Ramallah on the eve of the
8th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence Day which
falls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Palestinians all over the world
have become determined to strive for the goal of freedom and
independence since the Palestinian statehood was declared eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now the number of countries recognizing the
Palestinian state, has outnumbered that of those recognizing
Israel, which was established more than 40 years ago," it noted.
</P>
<P>
It said, "The Palestinian dream of independence has begun to
realize gradually since the withdrawal of the Israeli military
forces from Palestinian cities starting with Gaza and Jericho and
then from Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Ramallah, and
Bethlehem."
</P>
<P>
The statement reaffirmed the PA adherence to its
participation in the peace process on the basis of
"land-for-peace" and international resolutions, and particularly
U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 which calls for withdrawal
of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned the Israeli authorities for besieging
the Palestinians' self-rule area, continuing occupation practices
and denying the Palestinian people's right of independence and
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration of Independence was issued at the 19th
special session of the Palestinian National Council held in
Algiers, Algeria, on November 15, 1988.

said in Malanje, a northern city today.
</P>
<P>
Monteiro made the remarks to newsmen at the end of his

Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced during the
nearly 20 years of civil war since 1975 when the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) started fighting
with the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola
(MPLA).
</P>
<P>
Monteiro said the most important work in the peace process
would be the formation of a government of national unity, the
complete assembling and repatriation of UNITA's soldiers and the
incorporation of UNITA's generals into a unified army.

<HEADLINE> China Can Meet Its Food Needs, Says Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that China has the confidence and ability to ensure adequate
and better food supply for its people in the future.
</P>
<P>
"We have the confidence and ability to ensure not only adequate
but also increasingly better food for our people," Li Peng told
the World Food Summit, which opened here on Wednesday and will
last till Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, through self-reliance, has succeeded in
feeding its people and securing a food consumption level that has
either reached or surpassed the world average.
</P>
<P>
China's demand for food is likely to increase steadily in the
coming 15 years or more against continued population growth and
rising food consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, China's basic food policy is to secure
self-sufficiency on the basis of domestic resources, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is entirely possible, either from an economic point of view
or a technical one, for China to meet its food needs in the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rising demand for food requires an average annual growth of
1 percent in China's food supply, but the country's growth rate
over the past 46 years stood at 3.1 percent, said the Chinese
premier.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the facts that there is a potential to increase
per unit grain yield and the country still has over 20 million
hectares of wasteland cultivable for agricultural purposes, China
abounds with natural resources, promising "a broad prospect" for
developing highly-nutritious non-grain food, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Li said China will establish a stable trade relationship of
grain and foodstuffs with other countries on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The small amount of grain China imports is designed to
diversify food varieties, make up for bad harvests and to achieve
a more balanced distribution across regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
While importing grain, China also exports some raw grain and
foodstuff, said the Chinese premier, adding that China is a net
grain exporter on balance.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Urges Fight Against Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-premier Jiang
Chunyun today appealed for greater measures to construct water
conservancy projects to help control floods and relief droughts
next year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the appeal at the third working conference of the
State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, noted that under the leadership
of the CPC Central Committee, and with the staunch efforts of the
broad masses of people and soldiers, the country has won great
victories over floods and drought this year, and kept losses to
the minimum.
</P>
<P>
However, there still existed some problems in flood control and
drought relief this year, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The inefficiency of flood control projects, outdated equipment,
silting in rivers and lakes, as well as lowering of the ability to
fight floods constitute major problems.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that priority will be given to fighting larger
floods and droughts next year, and various localities should make
earlier preparations for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
The general goal, Jiang said, is to ensure the safety of large
rivers and lakes, large and medium-sized reservoirs, large and
medium-sized cities, and major road and rail traffic routes.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier urged various localities to enhance awareness
to prevent hidden disasters, and warned against the slackening
of vigilance, and the mentality of "trusting to luck".
</P>
<P>
He called for various localities to lose no time in reinforcing
dykes and dams, eliminate silting in rivers and lakes, and restore
damaged flood-control facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China has hooked up 6,000
computers and 40,000 subscribers to the Internet through six
international channels. It gives 20,000 subscribers access to the
international computer network by Chinanet.
</P>
<P>
Deng Zhenyin, secretary general of China Institute of
Communications, said today that subscribers in more than a dozen
Chinese provinces and municipalities are able to download
information from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on the China International
Electronics &AMP; Telecommunications Exhibition (CIETE), which will be
held in China International Exhibition Center in Beijing next
September, Professor Deng predicted that the number of computers
and subscribers with access to Internet is expected to hit 10,000
and 100,000 respectively by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said Internet services are developing fairly fast since
China gained access to such services. The number of subscribers,
he said, increased ten times last year alone, he added.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese enterprises and localities now send their
information via the Internet, and many others have started to
publicize themselves through the Internet. A powerful information
network with interfaces in Chinese will go into operation in eight
cities by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
As an international network for the information superhighway,
the Internet has attracted around 40,000 to 50,000 local networks
and 60 million people in more than 150 countries and regions. It
is estimated that about 100 million computers, one million local
networks and 500 million subscribers will be connected to Internet

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks Joint Development of Disputed Isles With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov proposed today that Japan and Russia jointly develop four
disputed islands off Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido,
according to Kyodo News Service.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who arrived here Thursday for a four-day visit, made
the proposal in intensive talks with his Japanese counterpart,
Yukihiko Ikeda, on the decades-old territorial issue, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
In his first meeting with Primakov this year, Ikeda reiterated
Tokyo's policy of continuing negotiations on the issue of
sovereignty while trying to create a better political environment
for resolution, said the news service.
</P>
<P>
However, Primakov replied that Moscow attaches more importance
to laying the groundwork for a settlement of the dispute than to
pushing for talks on the sovereignty issue, it said.
</P>
<P>
He then floated the idea of promoting joint economic activities
on the island -- Etorufu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai
group of islets -- while respecting the two countries' stances on
the ownership of the isles, said Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda declined to give an immediate assessment of the
co-development proposal, adding that Japan will not reject any
further offer from the Russian side, it said.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been in demand of the return of the islands, seized
by the former Soviet Union at the end of World War II, and a
conclusion of a bilateral peace and friendship treaty in line with
the 1993 Tokyo Declaration calling for a prompt resolution of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that they will have another round of
talks in Moscow and Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor
Ilyushin will visit Japan for the second meeting of a Japan-Russia
governmental committee on trade and economic issues, both slated
for the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Apart from their conflicting claims over the islands, both
Ikeda and Primakov agreed to enhance bilateral relations in all
areas and reaffirmed the importance of the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Under an exchange program, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov will also visit Japan sometime next year for a bilateral
defense meeting, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to create a better political environment
around the territorial issue, the two sides agreed on the
expansion of visa-free visits between Russians currently living on
the disputed islands and people from Japan.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Primakov called on Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto at his official residence and handed over a personal
letter of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Yeltsin renewed the invitation for Hashimoto to
visit Moscow next year, according to the press.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told Primakov that he appreciates the invitation and
hopes to meet Yeltsin soon in a favorable political atmosphere.

and greater international assistance to developing countries and
South Asian countries in particular.

<P>
SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka and the Maldives.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Result of Candidate Balloting Satisfactory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- At 5:00 pm today, when the
result was announced of the balloting for Chief Executive
candidates, all participants in the first plenary session of the
Selection Committee for the first government of the Hong Kong SAR
expressed their satisfaction with warm applause.
</P>
<P>
After the well-organized secret balloting by members of the
Selection Committee, three nominees -- Tung Chee-hwa, Ti Liang
Yang and Peter K. C. Woo -- were qualified to become candidates
for the post of the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The meeting room on the seventh floor of the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center became the focal point of Hong
Kong today. More than 300 journalists assembled there, many of
whom arrived hours before the  meeting began, to cover this
historic event.
</P>
<P>
Many Selection Committee members also arrived long before the
opening time. They listened attentively to the opening speech made
by Chinese Vice-Premier and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee
Qian Qichen and a detailed explanation of balloting rules by
Vice-Chairman of the Preparatory Committee Lu Ping.
</P>
<P>
"We are all very sincere about today's voting, because we are
representing all the Hong Kong people to give the sacred vote,"
said Cheung Wan-fung, member of the Selection Committee, after
casting his ballot.
</P>
<P>
Just as Qian said at the opening speech, the election is the
first instance of Hong Kong people exercising their democratic
rights to implement the principle of "Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
When ballots were called out for counting in the afternoon, the
large meeting room was quiet as all the people present turned
their attention to the white boards on the stage, on which the
ballots for each nominees were being recorded. Each time the
number of ballots for a nominee reached 50, the minimum number
required for candidacy, all the Selection Committee members, with
obvious excitement on the face, applauded loudly to congratulate.
</P>
<P>
Selection Committee member Chan Kam-lam said that although the
final candidates turned out to be fewer than he had expected, the
result is reasonable and acceptable.
</P>
<P>
"The result shows that all nominators were aware of their
commitment to the Hong Kong people and have given their ballots to
whoever they believe is the most suitable person," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described as fair the method for selecting the candidates.
"The 400 members of the Selection Committee are strongly
representative of the Hong Kong people, and the way in which the
candidates were selected truly reflects participation in
administrating Hong Kong in a democratic way."
</P>
<P>
"For Hong Kong people, this is a very important democratic
step," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ming-chuen, another member of the Selection Committee,
called the result of the balloting quite satisfactory. "This is
the first democratic election in Hong Kong's history and it was
open to such a high extent, I think the atmosphere was quite
good."
</P>
<P>
Elsie Tu, also a Selection Committee member, said the voting
was carried out in a very fair way and there was certainly no
pressure on any of the nominators.
</P>
<P>
The whole procedure of today's meeting was broadcast live on
two local TV channels, for Hong Kong residents, who paid intense
attention to this event, to watch.

<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that the Chinese government is strongly committed to
promoting and safeguarding world food security to ensure the
sustainable development of world economy.
</P>
<P>
At the World Food Summit being held now, he said China's
principled positions on safeguarding world food security are as
follows:
</P>
<P>
-- strive to maintain world peace and stability so as to
provide a reliable guarantee for world food security;
</P>
<P>
-- take vigorous agricultural development as the fundamental
way towards solving domestic food problem;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Li said China stands ready to establish a stable trade
relationship of grain and foodstuff with other countries on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He said, governments of all countries share a responsibility of
ensuring world food security. To solve the food problem and put an
end to hunger and malnutrition requires not only efforts of
individual countries but also their mutual assistance and
cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries have the responsibility and obligation
to provide necessary agricultural development aid to developing
countries while taking concrete steps in debt relief and removal
of protectionist and discriminatory trade practices, he added.
</P>
<P>
China is an important force dedicated to maintaining world food
security. As the world's largest grain producer, China has
succeeded in feeding 22 percent of the world's population, which
is an important contributor to world food security, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, people can rest assured that in coming years, not only
will the Chinese people retain food sufficiency self-reliantly,
they will also make new contributions to greater food security in
the world.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Condemns Child Abduction in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) Friday condemned the continuing abduction of children in
the conflict-laden northern Uganda, calling for immediate release
of all children in captivity.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 children have been kidnapped over the past two
years by armed opposition fighters to join in their operations,
said the U.N. agency, which takes care of health, education and
other basic problems troubling children in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF called for more attention to the problem as there was a
recent increase of kidnaping in the country, particularly rampant
in Gulu, Kitgum and other northern districts.
</P>
<P>
It criticized the torture of the youngsters by the rebels, who
sexually abused the girls and forced the boys to carry impedimenta
during long treks back and forth between Sudan and Uganda. Those
who try to escape risk their lives.
</P>
<P>
The organization appealed for joint effort in helping the young
victims, including the captives' relatives and communities. Some
communities' reluctance to take back their children exposes those
few who were lucky enough to flee to new danger of falling again
into the rebels' hands.
</P>
<P>
The communities shut the children out for fear of the rebels'
return to recapture them, the agency said. They also fear that
the children might have contracted AIDS during captivity and they
might be rebellious after the military camp experience.
</P>
<P>
Around 300 such rejected children are now accommodated in a
rehabilitation center run by World Vision, a U.S.-based
international aid agency.

<HEADLINE> On-Line Fashion News Service Launched In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A new "Silk Road" was unveiled
today in China - using the worldwide Internet. It means that fans
of the Internet in every corner of the world can access Chinese
silk and other fabric fashions by clicking a mouse, instead of
shopping in department stores.
</P>
<P>
From today China's leading fashion newspaper, China Garment
News, launched an on-line service.
</P>
<P>
The computer newspaper, "China Fashion Net," is the first
Internet-based information service in the world for the Chinese
garment industry.
</P>
<P>
Its coverage will extend to the latest works of Chinese
designers, new products from local enterprises, daily changes in
market demand, latest trends in China's big cities, and knowledge
of dressing and making up.
</P>
<P>
Based on Java language, the China Fashion Net will use latest
moving picture technology and high fidelity background music.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhuo, deputy editor-in-chief of the paper, said that the
on-line fashion service will offer a faster and higher-capacity
information medium for China's garment enterprises, who are eager
to promote their corporate image and products abroad.
</P>
<P>
Compared with traditional news media, such an on-the-spot
information service boasts two predominant advantages - low cost
and high speed.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a new channel for the Chinese and foreign
fashion world to exchange ideas, the on-line service will provide
a new advertising method for domestic entrepreneurs, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Paintings Popular at Beijing Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Art works went under the
auctioneer's hammer for over 26 million yuan today as one of
China's biggest ever auctions got underway.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Hanhai Art Auction Corporation, one of China's
largest auction houses, has offered 200 ancient Chinese paintings
and works of calligraphy for sale.
</P>
<P>
The Hanhai Autumn Auction sold 88 percent of its ancient
Chinese paintings and calligraphy for a total of 26.565 million
yuan (about 3 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The three-day auction is the largest since the auction
corporation was established, with about 2,000 artworks with an
estimated value of over 80 million yuan (about 10 million US
dollars) being put up for sale.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive piece today was a painting by Yuan Yao, a
famous painter living in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), depicting a
magnificent royal palace.
</P>
<P>
It was sold for 3.641 million yuan, followed by a painting of
flowers by Zhou Zhimian, a painter from the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644), with a price of 2.86 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Against the auctioneer's expectation, two paintings from the
Song Dynasty (907-1279) failed to reach their research price.
Estimated to reach three and five million yuan, bidding stopped on
the two paintings at 1.55 million yuan and 1.44 million yuan
respectively.
</P>
<P>
A source at the auction company said this was mainly because
painters of the Song period are usually less well known among
ordinary collectors than painters of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The current slump in China's artwork market, and strict state
control over the purchase of rare ancient paintings by
individuals, also affected the price of the two paintings, she
added.
</P>
<P>
At Hanhai's autumn auction last year, a painting masterpiece
of the Song Dynasty was purchased by China's most prestigious
Palace Museum for a record 19.8 million yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- As of January 1, 1997, dialing
1-1-0 at a public telephone in any of China's 206 prefecture-level
cities will give access to a police emergency station.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Entao, assistant minister of the Ministry of Public
Security, said that each of the country's 206 prefecture-level
cities will have such an emergency hotline by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that by the end of September, 115 prefecture-level
cities across the country had the emergency system, which has
proved to be one of the main channels through which citizens can
contact the police in the event of an emergency or to report
urgent police-related information.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that each public security bureau should
coordinate the 1-1-0 station with the other divisions affiliated
with the bureau, in a move to improve immediate response
capabilities of police.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that advanced technology should be applied to the
building of police emergency stations, and that a national police
emergency station system, capable of cracking down on crime and
therefore better serving the people, should be set up as soon as
possible.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Dismisses Kuwaiti Statements on POWs Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today dismissed
statements made by Kuwaiti Defense Minister Salem al-Sabah and
quoted by Saudi MBC television Tuesday that Iraq had admitted
the presence of 128 Kuwaiti prisoners of war as well as a number
of other POWs in the country.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry was quoted by the
Iraqi news agency as saying that Iraq denies such "allegations
and lies" which Salim al-Sabah used to make wherever he goes. "We
confirm that the Iraqi authorities do not keep any Kuwaiti or
other prisoners and Iraq has no prisoners of any nationality'.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is well known for all that Iraq has
previously released all 6,000 prisoners, Kuwaitis and others in
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions 686 and 687
which provide for the ceasefire of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned the Kuwaiti minister against spreading
"lies," saying that the Iraqi side will ask the International
Committee of the Red Cross to publish reports of the meetings of
the tripartite technical committee which follows up the issue of
the missing.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the 1991 Gulf War which ousted Iraqi forces
from a six-month occupation of Kuwait, the issue of POWs between
the two countries has remained unsettled. Iraq insists that it
no longer holds any missing Kuwaitis or POWs after the 1990-1991
Gulf crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Fire fighting facilities in
use in China's major cities are to be substantially upgraded
within three to five years, a senior official at the Ministry of
Public Security said today.
</P>
<P>
He added that a recent investigation in the country's major
cities, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Public Security and
departments concerned, revealed that three major criteria, namely
public fire facilities in large and medium-sized cities, fire
facilities in buildings, and facilities for fire brigades, are all
60 percent lower than state-set levels.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the phenomenon of ignoring fire control input
and management to the pursuit of immediate economic profits by
local governments.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ministry of Public Security and departments
concerned have decided to close down factories which are
considered as potential fire hazards.
</P>
<P>
He added that governments at all levels should draw up detailed
plans for fire fighting work, and implement them seriously, in a
move to improve the fire fighting capability of the whole
society.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Border patrols in the area
between Hong Kong and Guangdong province have been stepped up as
the date of Hong Kong's return to China looms closer.
</P>
<P>
So far this year around 12,000 Chinese people who illegally
crossed into Hong Kong have been returned across the border.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1995 frontier guards in south China's Guangdong
Province, which borders Hong Kong, have conducted 13 drills to
fight against illegal emigration.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shengqin, deputy-director of the Guangdong Public
Security Department, said the measure will be conducive to
boosting the confidence of Hong Kong residents, and help keep
frontier areas in good order and maintain the stability and
prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The drills involved tens of thousands of public security
personnel and frontier guards in cities in the vicinity of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1 next year. But many people want to squeeze into overcrowded
Hong Kong in violation of the law. Zhang said some ringleaders had
fabricated rumors that the period before 1997 is the last
opportunity to settle in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of the year, frontier guards in
Guangdong cracked 126 cases of illegal emigration, and 48 gangs
and 137 chieftains were found to be engaged in illegal emigration
activities.

today called on Japan to have a correct understanding of its
militarist past, during which it invaded China.
</P>
<P>
He said this was a political issue of principle, to which
statesmen of both countries should pay attention. The President
stressed the importance of such understanding to the political
foundation and long-term development of bilateral relations
between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang quoted an old Chinese saying that "an overturned cart
ahead is a warning to the ones behind", to warn Japan to learn
from history.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese President, the two countries should,
on the basis of this, stand higher and look further in dealing
with the existing problems between each other, and to make efforts
for a healthy, steady development of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a meeting with Nikaido Susumu,
former vice president of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, who has
contributed to the normalization of Sino-Japan relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Sino-Japan friendship has come uneasily. The two
countries should continue to abide by the joint declaration
reached between them in 1972, when they normalized diplomatic
relations, and the agreement of peace and friendship reached
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Nikaido Susumu said, few people on the Japanese side, who
experienced the normalization of Japan-China relations, are still
alive. He pledged to do his best to let more Japanese know the
historical changes in Japan-China ties.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Jiang's view on history, he said, young generations
should be educated in regard to history with a correct
attitude.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Enjoys Deflation for the First Time Since 1950s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in Sweden
dropped 0.1 percent in October this year over the same period last
year, the country's Central Statistics Office reported.
</P>
<P>
The fall of the rate of interest of loans and the value added
tax on food was attributed to the deflation, the first Sweden ever
enjoyed since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The value added tax on food decreased by 7.4 percent since the
beginning of this year, making the food price drop 6.7 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the fall of the rate of interest of loans has
helped relieve the burden of the people who bought houses with the
loans.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's state bank expected that the consumer prices would
have increased by two percent this year.

<HEADLINE> HK Land Sales Revenue Hits 36 Billion HK Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Revenue from land
transactions is expected to exceed 36 billion HK dollars (4.65
billion US dollars) this year, according to a Hong Kong government
official.
</P>
<P>
Bob Pope, director of lands, said today that 13 billion HK
dollars (1.68 billion US dollars) or 36 percent of the forecast
land revenue would come from sales by public auction or tender.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on "Investing in Hong Kong's Property
Market: 1997 and Beyond," Pope said that the long-term prospect
would be good.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will maintain its position as a major financial and
business center and transport hub in the region, as a result, the
property and stock markets will remain strong into the next
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Property supply figures are expected to increase from 1997
onwards. The official said that major infrastructure projects
spanning 1992 to 2001 are under way or planned as the airport and
related road and rail systems enter their final stages, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Total revenue from land transactions over the past five years
has reached 157 billion HK dollars (20.3 billion US dollars), with
nearly 50 percent coming from sales by auction, Pope said. The
remaining half of the revenue came from sales by private treaty,
and lease modifications or exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Clockmakers of Bankrupt Firm Play Cat and Mouse With Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Former employees of a bankrupt
clock factory in eastern France are playing cat and mouse with
police by hiding most of their stock products to protest the
government's decision over the fate of the factory.
</P>
<P>
The 64 clock makers, most of them women, are protesting an
official receivership made in April over the factory, which owes
the banks 20 million francs (4 million U.S. dollars) in debt.
</P>
<P>
The Epee factory, based in Montbeliard, near the Swiss border,
had produced classically designed clocks with high artistic value
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted lawyer Marie-Claude Guyon
as saying that paramilitary police Thursday discovered in a
multi-purpose hall 213 clocks worth from 8,000 to 25,000 francs
(1,600 to 5,000 dollars) apiece.
</P>
<P>
Police intervened in September to end a five-month occupation
of the Epee by the employees after their factory was declared dead
by government.
</P>
<P>
While a local trade union is negotiating with the government
for the revival of the factory, people involved in the case have
warned that the project will not be accepted unless all the clocks
are returned.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Venezuelan Parliament Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that the parliaments of China and Venezuela will
further increase their mutual understanding and enhance their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The close ties between China's National People's Congress and
the National Congress of Venezuela and the frequent exchanges of
visits by the two parliaments' leaders and parliamentarians have
helped deepen the mutual understanding and trust of the two
peoples, Li said when meeting President of the National Congress
of Venezuela Cristobal Fernandez Dalo.
</P>
<P>
He said the exchanges also have played an important role in
promoting the development of the two countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
The two parliaments enjoy a long-term good cooperation in
international and regional affairs and have done a lot in the
promotion of international and regional cooperation and the
understanding between parliaments and peoples of various countries.
</P>
<P>
Praising the work done by the Venezuela-China friendship
subcommission of parliamentarians in promoting relations between
the two countries, Li hoped that more Venezuelan parliamentarians
will visit China.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Fernandez said the documents on cooperation
signed by the two nations during Li Peng's visit will further
bilateral cooperation in the field of energy, which he described
as a good beginning for long-term cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela and China complement each other economically and can
learn from each other's experience in economic construction
despite their differences in national conditions.
</P>
<P>
The National Congress of Venezuela is willing to strengthen its
ties with the National People's Congress of China, the president
said, adding that joint efforts by the two parliaments will surely
help lay down a solid foundation for the growth of relations
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Comprehensive Trade Policy from EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Chinese Foreign Trade
Minister Wu Yi said here today that trade between China and the
European Union (EU) faces challenges, and that China hopes the EU
will create a comprehensive policy to ensure the healthy
development of two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks here this afternoon at the 15th session of
the Sino-EU Joint Committee on Trade and Economy, which she
co-chaired with Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Wu said, Sino-EU trade and economic ties
have developed well in recent years.
</P>
<P>
China's trade volume with the EU, its fourth largest trade
partner, was 40.34 billion US dollars last year, and reached 24.07
billion US dollars in the first eight months of this year, a rise
of 0.7 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU members have set up 6,925 joint ventures in
China with a total promised investment of 24.45 billion US
dollars, of which 7.32 billion US dollars has been put into actual
use.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates some trade promotion items in the EU's
long-term policy on the Europe-China relations it launched last
year, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
However, she added, the policy is not complete as it only
stresses the EU's export to China while ignoring its import from
China.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Sino-EU trade is facing challenges from the
EU's increasing anti-dumping measures and quota restrictions
against China's exports.
</P>
<P>
China will never forget the EU's efforts in developing its
two-way trade with China, Wu said. But it is the EU which imposed
the first anti-dumping investigation against China's exports, and
since 1990, it has lodged 35 such cases against China, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister said that the EU's anti-dumping
investigation is discriminatory, because it refuses to accept
China as a market-oriented economy and taxed Chinese enterprises
at a unified rate.
</P>
<P>
The EU's quota restriction against China's exports is also
unfair, Wu said, as China is the only country to have such a
limitation imposed by the EU.
</P>
<P>
Such discriminatory measures and unfair practices will
seriously hinder the growth of the Sino-EU trade ties if they are
not corrected at an early date, Wu said. The only thorough
solution to such issues is for the EU to make a comprehensive and
correct trade policy with China, thus creating a favorable climate
for the development of their two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that the EU highly values its trade with China and
is willing to seek a solution to the problems in their trade
relations through consultations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU supports China's early entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), and is willing to take action to push
forward the negotiation process of China's WTO membership. Wu
expressed her appreciation for this.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, China and the EU signed an aviation
cooperation document. After the signing ceremony, Wu met with a
group of businessmen from EU's member nations, who are
accompanying Brittan on his visit.

<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua/OANA) -- A special organization
will be established in March next year to deal with nations'
disputes over limits of continental shelves, a senior UN official
said here today at the opening session of the 24th World
Conference on Oceanic Peace (Pacem in Maribus), which opened today.
</P>
<P>
The organization will help each nation implement the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and settle questions
involving the limits of continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
miles, said Hans Corell, UN Under-Secretary-General for Legal
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Corell, who is also the Legal Counsel of the United Nations,
said that the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf
would be established at the sixth meeting of the UN Convention on
the Law of the Sea, scheduled to be held at the UN Headquarters in
March, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Commission will act as an essential agency to prevent
international oceanic disputes, Corell said. It will be composed
of 21 geologists, geophysicists and hydrologists from member
states of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Convention went into effect on November 16, 1994 and
currently has 108 member states.
</P>
<P>
Two organizations have been set up under its auspices: the
International Seabed Authority and the International Tribunal for
the Law of the Sea. The Tribunal is authorized to solve
differences that arise during the implementation of the
Convention. The Seabed Authority is designed to manage
international seabed resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China and Venezuela should develop their
cooperation from a strategic point of view.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Venezuelan Minister of Energy and Mines Erwin
Jose Arrieta in the afternoon, Li Peng said that since China has a
huge market and Venezuela is rich in emulsified crude oil
deposits, the two countries should develop their cooperation from
a strategic point of view.
</P>
<P>
He said China takes a positive attitude toward increasing
trade, economic and technological cooperation with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that one of the major gains from his visit to
Venezuela was the signing of an agreement on China's purchase of
emulsified crude oil from Venezuela and an agreement on
feasibility studies for the project of joint development of
emulsified crude oil in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Several entrepreneurs accompanying him on the visit are willing
to increase contacts with their Venezuelan counterparts to promote
economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, said the
Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese and the Venezuelan governments should
continue to support cooperation between enterprises of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Arrieta said he is pleased to see a fruitful
start in cooperation between the two countries in the field of
energy.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela and China complement each other economically and both
have their own advantages, which he said will enable them to join
hands for common development.
</P>
<P>
He said enterprises in Venezuela are willing to increase
cooperation with Chinese enterprises in fields besides that of
energy where they have already enjoyed fruitful cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S.Africa Refuses to Send Fighting Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has said that it is not prepared to send troops to
Zaire to fight a war.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki yesterday
in Brussels during his visit to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
He had paid an unscheduled visit to Zairean President Mobutu
Sese Seko in the south of France to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zaire has asked South Africa to play a "leading role" in the
planned international force to secure the safety of aid supplies
in the Africa's worst current refugee disaster, said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear that there must be no shooting and the
first important is ceasefire."We woundn't want to send troops to
fight a war," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbeki, South Africa is still involved in
international negotiations to seek a solution to the crisis in
central Africa, but won't commit a force until a mandate is
agreed.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is currently trying to negotiate with
Rwanda and Zaire for a mandate for an international force to help
distribute aid to hundreds of thousands of refugees trapped in
fighting in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean army is battling Rwandan-backed Tutsi rebels who
are pursuing former Hutu soldiers of the Rwandan army forces
mixed with refugees from the 1994 Rwandan civil war.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the sort of mandate that South Africa wanted to see
given to any force would involve securing airports and guarding
the storage and distribution of food aid.
</P>
<P>
But the belligerants must first have agreed to stop fighting,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's comments echoed those of Canada and the United States
which are expected to land a contingent in Zaire within days.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a South African delegation, including senior military
officers, discussed in Tanzania how South Africa could contribute
to ending the disaster in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's visit, which started yesterday, was in
response to former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere's appeal
for South African participation in a multinational force for east
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere's spokesman Charles Sanga said yesterday that South
Africa "are part of us now and they should be involved in what
we're doing".
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela said on Wednesday the South African
delegation would consider military questions and political
solutions to the crisis and find out exactly what was required of
his country.

MOGADISHU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Ms. Halima Ali, the elder
sister of Somali warlord, Osman Hassan Ali Atto, was today
released in South Mogadishu after a day-long captivity by unknown
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
"Pressure has been exerted by some elders, religious men and
intellectuals to free the old lady, but without payment of
ransom," said Atto's spokesman who refused to say who is behind
the kidnap.
</P>
<P>
He said the abduction won't affect the ongoing peace talks in
the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa by the Somali faction
leaders. "Atto will personally go to Addis Ababa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, there were reports which accused militiamen of
Hussein Aidid, son of Somalia's once most powerful warlord, late
General Mohamed Farah Aidid, of being responsible for the
abduction of Ms. Halima.

However, Hussein's south Mogadishu government has denied any
connection with the case. "Kidnaping is not part of our policy,"
said Hussein's spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong
Yiren met today with former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, saying that China and Britain should make joint efforts
to ensure the smooth transition of Hong Kong's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
In talks at the Great Hall of the People, Rong said the Hong
Kong issue has been settled according to the concept of "one
country, two systems" put forward by Deng Xiaoping more than a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are only more than 200 days left before
China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong, and he urged
Sino-British joint efforts for the smooth changeover.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, 1997, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
will be governed strictly in accordance with the Basic Law, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Thatcher, who was here for the China Summit 1996, said
that she discussed the Hong Kong issue with Deng Xiaoping more
than 10 years ago when she was prime minister.
</P>
<P>
She said it was then that Deng Xiaoping introduced the concept
of "one country, two systems," adding that the current situation
in Hong Kong is good.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the belief that Hong Kong's continued prosperity
and stability will benefit the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Rong also briefed Mrs Thatcher on China's economic
development. He said that China, with a population of 1.2
billion, should first concentrate on guaranteeing enough food and
clothing for its people.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's economic system is in the process of
switching from planned to socialist market economy, and that the
country is working hard to make its state-owned enterprises more
market-oriented, and to improve quality of their products and
raise their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to relying on itself for economic
development, China welcomes foreign support during this process
and is willing to enhance friendly and cooperative relations with
all countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Thatcher said that the Chinese people are enterprising,
and that as long as they can fully realize their potential, they
will not only change the region, but also help change the whole
world.

<P>
PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Zairean Tutsi rebels have
reportedly taken the Mugunga refugee camp, 15 kilometers west of
Goma, after some 400,000 refugees and some Hutu militias fled the
camp Thursday afternoon, the Agence France Presse reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The Interahamwes (Hutu militias) left yesterday, because the
rebels, or the force of peace, I don't know how to call them, were
very close," the agency quoted a refugee who called himself
Alphonse as saying.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that small groups of Hutu refugees were returning to
Rwanda, while most of them feared that they might be subjected to
retaliation by Tutsis after returning home.
</P>
<P>
"Me, I will go back to Rwanda. I don't have fear because I have
done nothing wrong," said Alphonse.
</P>
<P>
The Interahamwes, held responsible for the 1994 genocide
against Tutsis in Rwanda, used Mugunga camp as a resistance base
against the Banyamulenge Tutsis who took Goma two weeks ago,
according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda said today that it no longer opposed the participation
by France in the multinational intervention force to be deployed

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Create Man-Made Island on Reclaimed Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A man-made island
covering more than 4,000 hectares in northwestern Malaysia will be
created on reclaimed land to be used for industries, tourism and
recreation, the national news agency Bernama reported today.
</P>
<P>
The artificial island will be located in Lekir of Perak State,
some 155 kilometers northwest of Kuala Lumpur and will be linked
to the mainland by a bridge, Perak Chief Minister Ramli Ngah Talib
was quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
He said a consortium headed by the Perak State Development
Corporation (PKNP) has been chosen to undertake the land
reclamation project which is expected to begin next year.
</P>
<P>
The consortium is conducting soil tests and environmental
impact assessment and will work to ensure that the project will
not harm the environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the biggest project to be sited on the island
would be a coal-fired power plant with a proposed production
capacity of 2,000 megawatts of electricity at a cost of 5 billion
ringgit (about 2 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,400 hectares of the reclaimed land will be allocated to
industries and a small port will be built to facilitate the import
and export of the goods to be produced on the island.
</P>
<P>
Recreational and hotel projects are also expected to be
implemented on the island, said the chief minister.

limits of continental shelves, a senior UN official said here
today at the opening session of the 24th World Conference on
Oceanic Peace (Pacem in Maribus), which opened today.
</P>
<P>
The organization will help each nation implement the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and settle questions
involving the limits of continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
miles, said Hans Corell, UN Under-Secretary-General for Legal
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Corell, who is also the Legal Counsel of the United Nations,
said that the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf
would be established at the sixth meeting of the UN Convention on
the Law of the Sea, scheduled to be held at the UN Headquarters in
March, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Commission will act as an essential agency to prevent

states of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Convention went into effect on November 16, 1994 and

LAGOS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) was today under Nigerian attack for
funding six local pro-democracy and human rights groups to
destablize the west African country.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. plans to destablize Nigeria under the guise of
propagating democracy," said Lagos' official daily "New

It said CIA was recruiting these human rights groups to
execute its destabilization plan allegedly code-named "Operation
Rosabe l6", the letter revealed.
</P>
<P>
The CIA was also pushing for the establishment of a foundation
called National Endowment for Democracy, said the letter.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Comprehensive Trade Policy from EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Trade Minister
Wu Yi said here today that trade between China and the European
Union (EU) faces challenges, and that China hopes the EU will
create a comprehensive policy to ensure the healthy development of
two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks here this afternoon at the 15th session of
the Sino-EU Joint Committee on Trade and Economy, which she
co-chaired with Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Wu said, Sino-EU trade and economic ties
have developed well in recent years.
</P>
<P>
China's trade volume with the EU, its fourth largest trade
partner, was 40.34 billion US dollars last year, and reached 24.07
billion US dollars in the first eight months of this year, a rise
of 0.7 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU members have set up 6,925 joint ventures in
China with a total promised investment of 24.45 billion US
dollars, of which 7.32 billion US dollars has been put into actual
use.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates some trade promotion items in the EU's
long-term policy on the Europe-China relations it launched last
year, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
However, she added, the policy is not complete as it only
stresses the EU's export to China while ignoring its import from
China.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Sino-EU trade is facing challenges from the
EU's increasing anti-dumping measures and quota restrictions
against China's exports.
</P>
<P>
China will never forget the EU's efforts in developing its
two-way trade with China, Wu said. But it is the EU which imposed
the first anti-dumping investigation against China's exports, and
since 1990, it has lodged 35 such cases against China, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister said that the EU's anti-dumping
investigation is discriminatory, because it refuses to accept
China as a market-oriented economy and taxed Chinese enterprises
at a unified rate.
</P>
<P>
The EU's quota restriction against China's exports is also
unfair, Wu said, as China is the only country to have such a
limitation imposed by the EU.
</P>
<P>
Such discriminatory measures and unfair practices will
seriously hinder the growth of the Sino-EU trade ties if they are
not corrected at an early date, Wu said. The only thorough
solution to such issues is for the EU to make a comprehensive and
correct trade policy with China, thus creating a favorable climate
for the development of their two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that the EU highly values its trade with China and
is willing to seek a solution to the problems in their trade
relations through consultations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU supports China's early entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), and is willing to take action to push
forward the negotiation process of China's WTO membership. Wu
expressed her appreciation for this.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, China and the EU signed an aviation
cooperation document. After the signing ceremony, Wu met with a
group of businessmen from EU's member nations, who are
accompanying Brittan on his visit.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Admits Lapse on Support for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn admitted at the Rome World Food Summit that his bank
has allowed its support for agriculture and rural development to
lapse over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He told the summit today that the World Bank "is utterly
committed to putting rural development back at the top of the
development agenda."
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to provide global leadership in this endeavor
and to build stronger partnerships within the international
community to integrate rural issues into development strategies,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
His statement was strongly attacked by non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) holding a parallel meeting here. They
described as "a complete folly" the World Bank's message that free
trade cures hunger and corporations can eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to the documents distributed by the bank at the food
summit, although the World Bank is still the largest international
funder of agricultural development, its lending portfolio for
agriculture and rural development has fallen by nearly 50 percent
over the past decade -- from more than 6 billion U.S. dollars in
1986 to 3.6 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the proportion of agriculture in the bank's total
lending declined from 34 percent in 1975 to 12 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The bank's main response to the task of ending global hunger is
an attack on rural poverty, which will be guided by the following
principles:
</P>
<P>
-- The policy and institutional framework must be supportive of
agricultural and rural development rather than working against
them;
</P>
<P>
-- Wherever possible, the private sector must be mobilized to
provide investment capital, production and services;
</P>
<P>
-- A variety of institutions need to be involved, including
community-level groups, lower-level governments and central
ministries;
</P>
<P>
-- Projects and programs should be decentralized and be
designed and implemented with a high degree of participation by
communities, associations and local governments.

<HEADLINE> China Regulates Business in Shares for Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- As of December 1, securities
institutions both inside and outside China will need to acquire an
official qualifications certificate in order to remain in the
securities business to deal in shares for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
China's securities watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), has unveiled a package of new provisional
regulations governing the transaction brokerage, underwriting, and
promoting of shares for foreign investors, China Securities
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-issued regulations set criteria for both domestic and
overseas securities businesses which have operations in such
shares, including B shares listed on Chinese stock exchanges for
foreign investors, and stocks listed on foreign bourses such as H
shares in Hong Kong and N shares in New York, according to CSRC.
</P>
<P>
The regulations laid out a number of requirements for both
domestic and overseas securities businesses, involving the size of
the businesses, their business record, management qualifications
and their experience in the field.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the brokerage business, overseas securities
businesses need to have a minimum asset value of 50 million yuan,
an official guarantee, at least two years of experience in
foreign securities business, efficient management personnel, and a
good record in law abidance.
</P>
<P>
Similar requirements have also been set for international
underwriters and overseas promoters of shares for foreign
investors, with the value of their assets standing at about 120
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
CSRC also said that the certificate will automatically become
invalid two years after it is issued, and the businesses have to
submit subsequent applications three months before the expiration
date of the current certificate.
</P>
<P>
To further regulate the business in such shares, the securities
brokerages or underwriters are also required to submit annual
business report before the deadline of January 31, each year,
added the official.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Urges Integration of Khmer Rouge Into Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's first prime
minister said the easiest way to bring peace to the kingdom is to
persuade the remaining Khmer Rouge forces to peacefully integrate
into the government troops, the Cambodian Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Norodom Ranariddh made the statement Thursday after attending
an integration celebration in Phnom Malai, a former Khmer Rouge
stronghold located near the Cambodian-Thai border, some 300
kilometers northwest of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was also attended by Ieng Sary, chairman of the
political arm of the breakaway Khmer Rouge, and Sok Pheap, former
commander of Division 450.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh's trip to Malai came a week after ceremonies in
Pailin and Phnom Malai marked the induction of the breakaway Khmer
Rouge forces into the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh told reporters Wednesday that he would go to Malai to
see the integrated soldiers and to complete the integration
process.
</P>
<P>
The daily also reported that Ieng Sary discussed with some
elements of the remaining Khmer Rouge force late last month on the
possibility of a total Khmer rouge integration with the government
troops.
</P>
<P>
But no agreement was reached, the paper quoted the First Prime
Minister as saying.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Confirms Universal Illness Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Social
Affairs Jacques Barrot said Thursday that the government would
maintain a "universal illness insurance."
</P>
<P>
Barrot made the remarks while denying any link between the
social security reform plan and the privatization of social
security system.
</P>
<P>
French private insurance giant UAP (Union des Assurances de
Paris) and Axa, which merged Tuesday, have proposed replacing the
state social security system with a private insurance system
similar to that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has been widely condemned by public opinions, the
left-wing parties and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Claude Bebear, the new boss of UAP-Axa, which will become the
second largest private insurance group in the world after
completing the merger by July 1997, was accused by union leaders
of trying "to kill the social security system for increasing
profits and making money on the back of the French people."
</P>
<P>
The proposal also convinced many union leaders that the social
security reform plan, presented by French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe on November 15 last year, was a "Troy Horse" of private
corporations, said the daily Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The plan, aiming to reform the heavily indebted social security
system, triggered nationwide public sector strikes in November and
December last year.
</P>
<P>
The public deficit in social security system is standing at 50
billion francs (10 billion U.S. dollars), which takes more than
one sixth of France's overall public deficit for 1996.

BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Renovation will begin next
spring on the western runway of Beijing's Capital Airport, sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
A study has been completed to determine accurate figures needed
for construction of the road surface and laying of underground

Over the past few years, an increasing number of airplane
landings and takeoffs damaged the Airport's runways, which are
hazardous to flight safety.
</P>
<P>
In April, the eastern runway of the airport was repaired with
State funds. The renovation work was successful, according to
airport authorities.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Continue Talks on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite predictions that an
agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians on the Hebron
redeployment could be reached before the weekend, the two sides
are still negotiating on the last-minute details of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the end game," a senior Israeli government source
told Israel Radio. "But it is unlikely that we will see an
agreement by today."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel is seeking international pressure to
convince Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to
complete the agreement on Israeli army's redeployment in the West
Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
called U.S. President Bill Clinton, updating him on the latest
round of negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
When Netanyahu called King Hussein of Jordan Thursday night
to wish him a happy birthday, he asked him to press Arafat to
move forward on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Hussein reportedly replied that the best gift he could get
would be an agreement on Hebron, then Hussein called back to
Netanyahu to brief the latter on his conversation with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The phone call diplomacy came as the direct negotiations
continued as well at the Jerusalem office of Yitzhak Molcho,
Netanyahu's legal adviser, until early this morning.
</P>
<P>
However, senior source said they were treading water until
orders arrived from Arafat, adding that although a meeting
between Netanyahu and Arafat is in the offering, it would not
take place "until there is agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Main stumbling blocks remained Israel's request for the
right of "hot pursuit of terrorists" into the
Palestinian-controlled areas, and the kind of weaponry to be used
by Palestinian policemen in Hebron after the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Some of the outstanding issues were left to be dealt with in
an exchange of letters between Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli letter is expected to include a reaffirmation of
Israel's commitment to continue with the next two stages of the
Oslo peace accords, a free access right for the Palestinians,
lifting the closure and an airport project in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian letter to Israel will include a
commitment to renounce terror and to uproot the Hamas
"terrorist" infrastructure, and a specific time when the
Palestinian Covenant would be changed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, Israeli army was originally
supposed to complete its redeployment in the Hebron area by
March 28, pulling back from approximately 80 percent of the
town.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 450 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron which has a Palestinian population of 120,000. Israel took
over the city from the Jordanian authority in the 1967 Middle
East War.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Japanese Researchers to Help Deaf Children Hear, Speak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese
scientists and technicians will cooperate to develop a system that
can help deaf children learn to speak.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Matsushita Electronic
Industrial Company Ltd. have signed a contract to create a
Chinese-styled program, which will incorporate the peculiarities
of the Chinese language in order to help deaf children learn
proper hearing and speaking skills.
</P>
<P>
Hearing and speech deficiencies affect about 20 million people
in China -- many of them children. There are now nearly 2,000
institutions throughout China that specialize in education for the
deaf.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the technology will promote the
application of modern information processing technology in the
field, and contribute to the recovery of Chinese disabled people.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Matsushita has cooperated with China to
develop new technology.

<HEADLINE> Paris Subway Partially Paralyzed by Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Subway trains on several major
lines in the capital stopped running this morning in response to a
strike call by trade unions to protest against social security
reform.
</P>
<P>
The workers were also protesting against unemployment and
declining purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
But some subway lines including the one that transports
employees of big corporations to Paris' new financial center La
Defense went on operating as normal.
</P>
<P>
The transport company, Regie Autonome des Transports Parisien,
which runs buses and upper subway lines in Paris, increased
traffic by 70 percent on the lines that are not on strike today.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Prime Minister Alain Juppe presented his plan to
drastically reform France's debt-burdened social security system.
</P>
<P>
The reform program triggered a general strike of the public
transportation sector, which paralyzed the country's public
transportation in November and December of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Gambling on Election Results Rife in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- While the general election
this year is described as "the dirtiest" and "the most violent"
because of rampant vote-buying and campaign-related murders,
gambling on election results is also beyond control.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said about 100 million baht (4 million US
dollars) has been bet in Bangkok, and between 800 million to 1
billion baht (32 million to 40 million dollars) in the 75
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Both the Democrat Party and the New Aspiration Party (NAP), the
two front runners to win the largest number of seats in the lower
house, are at odds of 10-9, reflecting a close race.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of gambling on election results is not only to make
money, but also is one of the strategies used by election
canvassers to influence the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
Candidates will set the odds in their favor to attract gamblers
to vote for them. People who want money will vote for those
candidates, increasing the politicians' chance of success.
</P>
<P>
Bets vary between provinces.
</P>
<P>
In the northeast, bets are being placed on which party, the New
Aspiration Party or Chart Pattana (national development) Party,
will win more seats.
</P>
<P>
In the south, which is a Democrat Party stronghold, odds are
being offered on whether a particular candidate will receive more
than 100,000 votes and on how many seats the party will eventually
win.
</P>
<P>
In the north, where opinion polls have offered different
expected results for the Democrats and NAP because of the highly
unpredictable prospects, even money of 1-1 is being offered on the
NAP winning 70 seats and odds of 5-4 on the NAP defeating the
Democrat Party in the region.
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok, where the Democrat Party is said to be a favorite,
the Democrats winning 28 seats or more out of a total of 37 is an
even-money bet with bookmakers, while 2-1 is being offered on the
party winning 30 seats or more, and 3-1 on it winning 32 seats or
more.
</P>
<P>
Northern metropolitan police commissioner Pol Maj Gen Barinboon
Wutthiphakdi said betting is not unusual during elections in the
country and it is hard for police to curb the illegal practice
because of lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
"They only have each other's word, no documents. We have no
evidence. Even if we catch them handing over money, they claim
they're just paying off their debts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gambling often leads to violence when those involved fail to
pay off their debts.
</P>
<P>
Police said they can do nothing about gambling on election
results because gamblers will not cooperate as they know that they
are breaking the law.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Scientists Use Sea Water to Turn Barren </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in Saudi
Arabia have successfully used sea water as the only irrigation
source to grow a saline resistant plant in its barren coastline
and turned part of it into a green farm, a Saudi daily has
reported.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Arab News said the technique, the first of
its kind in the world to be applied on such a wide scale, is
being developed by the Arabian Saline Technology Corporation, a
local company seeking to increase agricultural production and put
a green face on the desert by using saline water.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the company's director Ali Muhammad Magboul as
saying that his company had successfully grown the salicornia
plant at an experimental farm in Ras Az-Zour near Jubail in the
eastern part of the kingdom and hoped to start commercial
production soon.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the success may help revolutionize
agricultural techniques and help conserve rapidly disappearing
ground water reserves in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, with its main part being desert, has no
everflowing fresh water rivers and lakes on land and the level
of rain falls is very low. it has to desalinize sea water to meet
a large share of its industrial and agricultural demand as well
as the daily needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
Magboul said in a lecture recently made in the Saudi Red Sea
coastal city of Jeddah that apart from being used to prepare
various dishes, salicornia is a cheap source of fodder and its
seeds could yield high grade oil at a rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
His company has already started exporting some of its products
to European and Southeast Asian countries where demands are high,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said salicornia could save 630 million cubic meters of
water every year to partially replace the production of another
plant named "cover" in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The company has managed to increase its production by five
fold to 120 tons per hectare since it started the process
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the director said there were also difficulties with
the process as the crop could not ripen at the same time, thus
causing harvesting problems, and the grown season could be as
long as 10 months.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- There have been some favorable
occurrences in Sino-American relations recently that are in the
basic interests of the two peoples, State Councilor Li Tieying
said in an interview with the International Herald Tribune here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li said that an issue that matters a great deal is establishing
stable relations between the two countries, and that any problems
that exist can be resolved through negotiations and dialogues on
the basis of the three Sino-American joint communiques. "China is
willing to establish normal and friendly relations with all
countries in the world," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the "China threat" theory, saying that
China's development poses no threat to other countries, and in
fact, "China would like to see people everywhere be able to
develop and that all countries' development efforts are
contributions to the world.
</P>
<P>
China's outstanding achievement in social and economic
progress, he said, is closely linked to learning from other
countries and "absorbing all sorts of nutrients." He said that
China's socialist market economy is a new move in human history,
one that requires China to consider its own reality.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no particular mode of practice for China
to follow and that any problems that occur in the course of
development will be solved in the process of reform.
</P>
<P>
Li also met with Richard McClean, CEO and publisher of the
International Herald Tribune after the interview.

<HEADLINE> Mount Kilimanjaro Forests Go Ablaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Mountain
Kilimanjaro forest zone in Northern Tanzania, went ablaze
recently, turning more than 250 acres of forest into ash.
</P>
<P>
The razing flames in the Kilimanjaro forest zone, where
harbours a number of rare plant, animal and bird species in
Africa, were first observed at night on October 21, at a place
</P>
<P>
close to the ice-clad Kibo peak, sending wild animals into a
scurry. The flames was spread fast due to a prolonged drougt and
winds.
</P>
<P>
Rombo District Commissioner, Peniel Ole Saitabau, said on
Thursday that illegal timber dealers and wild honey harvestors
are to blame as the chief sources of frequent mountain fires
during dry seasons.
</P>
<P>
"Illegal timeber dealers often stay in the forests for months,
cooking food there. When shifting from one site to the next, they
rarely putout smouldering fires which later spread through the
forest," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the behaviour of wild honey collectors was similar to
that of timber dealers. Because of poor honey harvesting
technology, the honey collectors "resort to fire to fend off wild
bees. Such fires, finally burn across huge tracts of mountain
forests as they remain uncontrolled," he added.
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists maintain that the local authorities
should be held responsiblity for this sad ecological calamity
since they have adopted no legal measures to curb the damaging habits.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the inferno burned down timber worth
8,200 U.S. Dollars.

<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Oceanic development and
oceanic environment protection in the 21st century are the focus
of the 24th World Conference on Oceanic Peace (Pacem in Maribus)
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The global gathering has attracted more than 150 socialists,
jurists and oceanologists from more than 20 countries and regions
including Canada, the United States, Japan and China. Experts
attending the five-day meeting will discuss the law, resources
development, environment protection and management of oceans.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dengyi, director general of the National Bureau of
Oceanography, presided over today's opening ceremony. Luo Gan,
State Councillor and Secretary-General of the State Council,
delivered the opening speech.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that the ocean is closely tied with mankind's
existence and development, and the development of ocean resources
plays a very important role in the economic growth of countries
along the ocean.
</P>
<P>
However, Luo pointed out, the ocean's environment is being
polluted and the balance of oceanic ecology is being damaged,
posing a grave threat to the existence and development of human
beings.
</P>
<P>
Luo added that the developed countries have far surpassed
developing countries in resources consumption and discharging
waste, in terms of both total amount and per capita quotas.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that developed countries bear special
responsibilities for global environmental pollution control.
</P>
<P>
Luo praised the main theme of the current conference -- oceanic
management and the 21st century -- saying that it embodies the
great concern and strong sense of responsibility of the woman who
initiated the conference, Prof. Elisabeth Mann Borgese, who was
also present at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government agrees to the principles of the
"Agenda 21" and the "UN Convention on Maritime Law" and other
legal documents.
</P>
<P>
China is willing, under these principles, to strengthen
cooperation with other countries, and to make its due
contributions to the establishment of new international oceanic
order. This will ensure the protection of the oceanic environment,
and the rational use of oceanic resources as well as the making of
oceanic peace in the 21st century, Luo said.
</P>
<P>
The UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali sent a telegram
of congratulation to the conference.

<HEADLINE> Tse-Tse Flies Rampant in Western Tanzanian Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- About 70 percent
acreage of the Kigoma Region, in western Tanzania, is seriously
infested with tse-tse flies, leading to Nagana disease in cattle
and sleeping sickness in human, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Lack of both technical and financial ability to control the
reproduction of the insects for the last 64 years is reportedly
one of the chief causes for the wide spread of the tse-tse flies.
</P>
<P>
A document issued by the Kigoma regional authorities has said
that the insects were first spotted in the region in Kasulu and
Kibondo districts in 1932.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 10 years, about 7,527 people got sick of
sleeping sickness, 10 out of them died mainly because of lack of
curative medicines.
</P>
<P>
Tse-tse fly is a home of parasite Trypanasoma Brucei, the
causative agent of sleeping sickness. The parasite spends an
essential part of its life cycle in the body of the fly. The
parasite may be transmitted into the blood-stream of another
victim bitten by the fly.
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, some 24,421 cattle were infected with
Nagana, a disease which causes fever, muscular wasting, anaemia,
welling of tissues and paralysis of some body parts.

<HEADLINE> China Successful in Tobacco Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- There have been three
breakthroughs in China's attempts to control tobacco, according to
the country's vice-minister of Public Health, Cao Ronggui.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, 50 cities, and the provinces of Jilin, Shandong,
and Shanxi have come up with rules and regulations that ban
smoking in public places, Cao told the 7th National Smoking and
Health Symposium, in the central Chinese city of Wuhan recently.
</P>
<P>
The second breakthrough is the number of smoke-free schools
that have emerged in the country. The number in Beijing alone has
reached 123, and smoking has been banned for all primary and
middle school students in the city.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, more than 500,000 children signed an appeal from the
Soong Ching Ling Foundation, asking children not to smoke, not to
buy cigarettes, and to persuade their relatives to stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
Another breakthrough is the number of Chinese cities that have
removed tobacco advertising. These include Beijing, Zhuhai, and
Zhangjiagang in Jiangsu Province.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Changping Expressway Open to Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A newly-opened expressway in
north suburban Beijing has reduced travel time along a
31.2-km-long section from two hours to just twenty minutes.
</P>
<P>
The two-way, six-lane expressway, linking urban Beijing with
the suburban county of Changping, opened to traffic on
Thursday. By next year, it will extend to the Great Wall at
Badaling and the Ming Tombs, two of Beijing's most popular tourist
sites.
</P>
<P>
With a designed speed of 80 to 120 kilometer per hour, the new
route will help ease the travel worries of tourists and local
residents who have previously complained about traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
The project, which began in January, involved joint investments
from the municipal government and a Hong Kong company. The road is
considered to be the best in the country due to the advanced
technology used in construction.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo, State Councillor Luo Gan, and
Beijing's senior officials Wei Jianxing and Jia Qinglin attended
the opening ceremony Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Beijing has constructed four expressways
totaling 130 km in length to neighboring Hebei Province and
Tianjin City, as well as to the Capital International
Airport.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stock Market Sets Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
responded at last to the rises in other major stock markets in the
world by surging to an all-time-high close today.
</P>
<P>
But the delayed rally in the Australian bourse reflected
weakness of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries index closed 24.8 points, or 1.05 percent
up, at 2,387.3 points, a new high since it set a previous close
record of 2,377.6 points on October 24.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse was boosted by seven consecutive record
smashing closes in the New York Stock Exchange in the past week.
The Dow Jones industrial average has soared 283.62 points, or 4.7
percent, since the beginning of this month. There were
speculations that the Dow Jones index would break the 7,000 level
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the All Ordinaries index rose only 47.9 points, or
two percent.
</P>
<P>
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello was reportedly talking
about another interest rate cut in the new year in order to
stimulate the sluggish economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has already slashed
short-term official interest rates by one percent to 6.5 percent
in the past four months.
</P>
<P>
Locally, the All Industrials index jumped 34.1 points, or 0.93
percent, to 3,698.7 points. The All Resources index climbed 18.1
points, or 1.33 percent, to 1383.2 points.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 383.98 million shares, valued at
872.51 million Australian dollars (689.29 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index
contract rose 37 points to 2,412.0 points.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Kowloon Railway Improving Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Fenghuangzhou
Village in Jiangxi Province's mountainous Ji'an City, who lived in
poverty and found it nearly impossible to get in touch with the
outside world, are in for a change these days.
</P>
<P>
Because of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, Fenghuangzhou has been
visited by many journalists from other parts of the country,
including Taiwan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The village head, Xiao Xuexin, told Xinhua that since the
opening of the new railway, the price of local farm products has
been going up, bringing in more cash to farmers, and an end to the
bad, old days.
</P>
<P>
According to local government officials, because of the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway, the province is confident that it can
reach its poverty-reduction goals by the end of the century, a
year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The new railway starts at Beijing and ends in Kowloon, passing
through many mountainous, poverty-stricken parts of Hebei,
Shandong, Henan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces.
</P>
<P>
These areas were bases for the Communist Party-led peasant
revolt against the Kuomintang Regime, and remained poor, even
after 1949, the year the People's Republic was founded.
</P>
<P>
They are now working out their own poverty-eradication programs
for economic development based on local farm resources.
</P>
<P>
According to one source, when the government chose the route of
the railway, it considered development prospects for these poor
areas. Some sections of the railway and some stations have been
built specially for the purpose. The railway makes an extra turn
in Jiangxi, for example, and goes across the Ganjiang River twice,
in order to link up the two revolutionary bases of Jinggangshan
and Ruijin cities.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President and CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin, during
an inspection tour of the railway in September, confirmed the idea
that helping these areas escape from poverty was "an important
consideration of the central government when making the decision
to build the railway."

KUNMING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The launching of a 100-ton
shoal-draft ship recently on the Lancang River, which connects
with the Mekong in the south, will allow year-round navigation on
the international river.
</P>

China has begun building another 200-ton ship of the same kind,

</P>
<P>
The Lancang-Mekong runs through Yunnan Province in China,
Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, and is considered
a "golden water way".
</P>
<P>
Since resources are abundant along the river, its development
and use, and economic cooperation of those regions have gotten
attention from the international community as well.
</P>
<P>
Since the river's shallow water has hindered transport in the
middle and upper reaches, there has been focus on developing
shallow-draft ships.

YANTAI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on a
Sino-Japanese joint venture to manufacture auto air-conditioners
has been recently completed in Yantai City, east China's Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Yantai is on the eastern end of the Shandong Peninsula. The

company providing 50 percent of the stake, and Japanese, the
remainer. Annual sales volume are expected to reach 1.44 billion
yuan (about 180 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to a Chinese executive, it has signed agreements and
contracts with a dozen domestic auto makers.

<HEADLINE> SDB Loans for Capital Airport Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank
(SDB) has granted two billion yuan worth of loans for expansion
work on the capital airport in Beijing, "China Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The loan agreement, signed in Beijing on Tuesday, is the
biggest credit the SDB has given to the civil aviation sector.
The bank has invested more than five billion yuan in 35 aviation
projects.
</P>
<P>
Repayments are to be spread over 13 years. The deal includes
500 million yuan in low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the airport is the largest aviation
infrastructure project listed in the state's key construction
program for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The 17-part project will cost a total of 9.18 billion yuan. It
centres on a new terminal building and facilities, including
car-parking and a freight warehouse. The project is expected to be
operational in 1999.
</P>
<P>
It will increase the airport's passenger handling capacity to
12,000-13,000 travellers an hour, well above the present limit of
2,500-3,000 passengers an hour.
</P>
<P>
SDB, one of China's three policy banks, exists to fund
important infrastructure projects in basic industries and remove
bottlenecks hampering China's economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of this year, SDB gave loans totalling
61.5 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has set three pre-conditions for
participating in the dialogue offered by the government to resolve
the crisis resulting from BNP's abstaining from Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Since Monday night, the BNP has boycotted the house because of
allegedly unfair treatment to the opposition MPs by the ruling
party in the house. It declared that BNP MPs would not return to
Parliament until its 10-point demand is met.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources disclosed that deputy leader of the opposition
in Parliament and BNP Vice Chairman A.Q.M. Badruddoza Chowdhury
communicated the pre-conditions to the prime minister's
parliamentary affairs adviser Suranjit Sengupta Thursday, which
call for the release of BNP leaders and workers detained in jails,
implementation of the party's 10-point demand and creating a
congenial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
"They've set pre-conditions when we've agreed to an
unconditional dialogue. Now they should explain as to how to
create the atmosphere they want," Suranjit confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the pre-condition of releasing the political
detainees, he denied the existence of any political detainees in
jails at the moment and claimed that a majority of the terrorists
arrested since the present government came to power had arrest
warrants against them issued during the BNP government.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province is becoming a new tourism attraction, with 20,000
springs, karst landforms and the highest annual precipitation in
China.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has ground water reserves of more than 14 billion cubic
meters, and tests have shown that the water contains many elements
that are vital to the human body, and can be helpful in treating
some skin diseases and nervous disorders.
</P>
<P>
There are some unusual springs in the province. One to the
southeast is called "Sun Spring", because water gushes out only
when the sun shines on the site. A scientific explanation has yet
to be found for the strange phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Xifeng Hot Springs, which attracts thousands of tourists each
year, is known as the "No. 1 spring in Guizhou", and three
springs run continually with water temperature staying around 56
degrees centigrade, providing 1,032 tons of water daily.
</P>
<P>
In the western part of the province is a spring called "Pearl
Spraying Spring", which fascinates visitors with its strings of
tiny bubbles coming up to the surface.
</P>
<P>
As the springs attract more visitors, local people hope that
they will help them increase their incomes, because Guizhou is an
underdeveloped region in China.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen here today called on members of the Selection Committee to
cast their ballots with Hong Kong's overall interests in mind to
nominate the candidates for the first Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first plenary session of the Selection Committee
for
the first government of the HKSAR at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center, Qian said that the 400-member Selection
Committee
which is made up entirely of Hong Kong people marks the first
instance in
which Hong Kong people exercise their democratic rights to
implement the
principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is alao chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the
HKSAR, He said that the Selection Committee elected by the
Preparatory Committee early this month is broadly represented and
they can be trusted by the vast Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He said it is unprecedented in Hong Kong's history for Hong
Kong people to elect their own Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 150 years, Britain has appointed 20-odd governors
to Hong Kong. It never sought opinions from Hong Kong people,
still less to let Hong Kong people participate in the
decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that the process of establishing the HKSAR is the
beginning of genuine democracy in Hong Kong instead of what
certain people called "end of democracy".
</P>
<P>
He said that from the Basic Law Drafting Committee to the
Preliminary Committee and then the Preparatory Committee, the
proportion of Hong Kong people in these bodies has been on
increase. The Selection Committee is made up entirely of Hong Kong
permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
All this shows that the principle of "Hong Kong people running
Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy are being implemented, he
noted.
later, the responsibility of governing Hong Kong will rest with
the first government of the HKSAR made up entirely of Hong Kong
people.
</P>
<P>
He said, "A review of what has been done by the Chinese
government in Hong Kong transition period, especially in the
latter half of the period, and people will have every reason to
believe in the Chinese government's sincerity and determination in
implementing the principle of 'One country, Two systems'."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the members of the Selection
Committee
will cast their ballots according to their own will and in the
spirit of being responsible for Hong Kong people, for the country
and for history.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Confiscates Bosnian Moslem's Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The peacekeeping forces in
Bosnia have confiscated many weapons from a Moslem force involved
a recent ethnic conflict in northeastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the NATO-led peace forces said in Sarajevo
today the weapons including armored vehicles, artillery and
machine guns. They were seized earlier in the day by peacekeeping
troops who stormed the headquarters of the Moslem force in Celic,
and would be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
There was enough evidence to show that the Moslem's No.254
brigade had been ``directly involved'' in violation of the Dayton
peace accord in Monday's incident, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Monday incident occurred when armed Moslems attempted to
cross into a Serb-held village.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declared that as of Saturday, an area of 35
kilometers diameter around Celic would be a temporarily restricted
zone, in which no one but local police could carry arms.
</P>
<P>
Many armed Moslems crossed the Inter-Entity Boundary Line
(IEBL) northeast of Tuzla on Monday to return to homes in Gajevi
and Koraj, on Serb-administered territory, from which they were
driven during the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
This sparked a conflict with local Serbs in which at least one
Serb was reported to have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping forces were dispatched immediately to the
scene and restored order.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton accord, which ended the Bosnian War one year
ago, the IEBL is supposed to be an administrative boundary line
between Moslem-Croat and Serb territory. Instead it has hardened
into a de facto ethnic border.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Assents to Indemnity Repeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to official sources today, the president assented to
the bill Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mujibur Rahman, the first head of state after the country's
independence in 1971 and also father of the present Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, was assassinated along with his kins and associates
during a bloody military coup on august 15, 1975.
</P>
<P>
The indemnity ordinance was promulgated on September 26, 1975
by the then president Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed and later
incorporated in the constitution on April 7, 1979, giving
indemnity to those who were involved in the 1975 killing and
banning any possibility to try the case. It was said that the
indemnity was given to the suspects of killing because most of
them were army officers loyal to the then regime of Ziaur Rahman,
late husband of the ex-prime minister and present opposition
leader Begum Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
Since coming to power on June 23 this year, the Awami league
government of Prime Minister Hasina has been determined to restore
historic truth by insisting on trying those involved in the
killing.
</P>
<P>
The indemnity repeal bill was passed unanimously in the
parliament by a simple majority on Tuesday night with "yes" votes
from members of the ruling Awami League and the Jatiya party, the
third largest party in the country.
</P>
<P>
But the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) and
the Jamaat-e-Islami MPs were absent. The BNP has been boycotting
the parliament because of what they said unfair treatment by the
ruling party in the house.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 15 (Xinhua)-- A World Bank funded industrial
waste water treatment plant costing 12 million US dollars will
soon be established in Sri Lanka, according to official sources
today.
</P>
<P>
The plant will inter-connect two of the country's most polluted
industrial estates at Ja-ela in North of Colombo and Ratmalana 15
kilometers South of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Ja-ela and Ratmalana account for over 364 chemically polluting
industries in the country and the environmental degradation that
has taken place due to these industries has caused a host of
environmental problems, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Untreated effluents from textile factories and other high
polluting industries are currently being released to water ways in
the vicinity in spite of laws prohibiting the discharge of
untreated material.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of this waste water treatment plant
effluence will be treated through a central pumping station before
being released, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Cruise Market Glutted, Operators Buy More Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Caribbean cruise
market is already glutted with an oversupply of services, but
cruise operators keep on ordering new ships, the International
Shipping Logistics (ISL) said today.
</P>
<P>
Besides an oversupply of services, frequent bad weather in the
region, like storms and hurricanes, depressed the demand.
</P>
<P>
Despite the business contraction, cruise companies have
continued ordering new ships, expecting the demand will one day
perk up.
</P>
<P>
Cruise operators recur to all kinds of measures to maintain
competitiveness, including registering their ships in countries
that offer open registry, known as flags of convenience.
</P>
<P>
ISL statistics show that 14 cruise ships were registered in
Panama this year.
</P>
<P>
ISL executives said the glut in the cruise market has forced
several companies, particularly American ones, to ply other less
congested markets like Europe.
</P>
<P>
World cruise industry is flourishing. In 1994, more than four
million people took a cruise and the figure is expected to reach
six million in 1996 and eight million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The cruise industry is estimated to be worth 15 billion
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
ISL representatives in Panama said there are 222 cruise ships
of more than 1,000 tons of gross registry navigating around the
world.

WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration announced today that it is preparing a regulation
to require more than 2,800 older airplanes be fitted with cargo
hold fire detectors and suppression systems.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made six months after a ValuJet plane
crash in the Florida Everglades in which 110 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash remains under investigation, but blame
has been focused on a cargo of oxygen generators in the plane's
hold.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that one of the generators burst into
flames, igniting other goods, including tires stored in the hold,
and that the flames destroyed the aircraft controls.
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department imposed an emergency ban on
hauling the generators after the crash.
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department also plans to impose a ban on
carrying oxidizing materials on airliners.

<P>
VIENNA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Police today seized three

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Start Asia Pacific Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will start a 12-day trip to Asian and Pacific nations Friday,
mainly for a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum in the Philippines, the White House announced today.
</P>
<P>
It is Clinton's first foreign trip since his re-election early
this month, and it signifies that the president attaches great
importance to the Asian-Pacific region in his second term, Deputy
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that in a global economy in a post-Cold War world,
"America must look to the East."
</P>
<P>
Asia's economies account for over a quarter of the world's
output, and a third of U.S. exports flow to Asia. "That's why the
president has led efforts to build a real community of nations in
the Asia Pacific region," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Philippines, the trip will also take the president
to Australia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to meet with Chinese President Jiang Zemin
in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the fourth between the two leaders, will come
after a meeting between Chinese foreign Minister Qian Qichen and
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Berger said, "Over the past year, I believe we've turned a
corner in the (U.S.-Sino) relationship and dealt successfully with
some very difficult issues ... That progress demonstrates that we
can work together and work through our differences as great powers
must."
</P>
<P>
Clinton will also hold talks with Japan's Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto and South Korean President Kim Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
Berger said Clinton and Hashimoto will discuss the U.S.
military presence on Okinawa and "ways to modernize the
relationship between our militaries."
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the talks with Kim is the proposed
four-party talks on Korean Peninsula issues, which also involve
the United States and China, Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Rise of 2.5% Predicted For German Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany's "Five Sages" (German
Council of Economic Experts) predicts a 2.5 percent economic
increase for Germany, in 1998 in its annual report to be submitted
to the government tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The "Five Sages" is composed of five economists and professors
nominated by the federal government, whose major task is to
provide the government with a report before November 15 each year,
analyzing Germany's overall economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The economic expert committee said the number of unemployed in
1998 would increase to 4.06 million from this year's 3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that Germany's federal deficit in 1998
would account for 3.3 percent of the country's Gross Domestic
Product (GNP), which meant Germany would not have reached European
Monetary Union (EMU)'s convergence criteria, though it would be
lower than this year's 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty sets the convergence criteria for joining
the EMU at 3.0 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The report said western Germany would see a 1.5 percent
economic increase this year, and 2.5 percent next year, while
eastern Germany would be 2.0 percent and 2.25 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Prices would rise at a low level of 1.75 percent next year, the
report said.

UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Disarmament
Ambassador Sha Zukang said on Thursday that to increase
transparency without considering specific conditions might not
help promote confidence and build security.
</P>
<P>
"Only proper and realistic measures could promote trust," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the First Committee (Disarmament and
International Security) of the United Nations General Assembly as
it considered a draft resolution on transparency in armaments.
</P>
<P>
The draft calls upon member states to provide requested data
and information for the U.N. Register of Conventional Arms to the
U.N. Secretary-General by April 30 annually.
</P>
<P>
It also requested the U.N. Secretary-General to prepare a
report on the continuing operation of the Register and its further
development. In short, it encourages the enlargement of the
register areas.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Sha expressed reservation on the second part,
stressing that the most urgent task was to sum up the experience
and lessons gained since the Register's establishment and move
towards a universal register.
</P>
<P>
He added that the number of participants had not reached even
half the Member States of the U.N., and the Register had not
achieved a reduction in international arms transfer.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Surveys Give Democrats Edge in Thailand's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- With only two days left before
the general election on Sunday, opinion surveys in Thailand have
offered different sets of results.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned that these opinion polls may not be totally
free from partisan bias. Results of some opinion surveys are
published to swing the trend in the actual ballot-casting on
Sunday in favor of certain parties or candidates.
</P>
<P>
Three major surveys predict that the Democrat Party will win
the most seats, while two others show that the New Aspiration
Party (NAP) will be the winner. All polls agree that neither of
the two largest parties will obtain more than half of the 393
seats in the new House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 political parties have fielded 2,310 candidates
for the 393 seats in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The Suan Dusit poll shows that the Democrat Party, led by
former prime minister and former opposition leader Chuan Leekpai,
will win 149 of the total seats up for grabs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
It gives a big lead of 35 seats over the second placed New
Aspiration Party (114 seats), which is led by outgoing deputy
prime minister and defense minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Chatichai Choonhavan's Chart Pattana
(national development) Party will trail far behind by taking only
45 seats, while outgoing prime minister Banharn Silpa-archa's
Chart Thai (Thai nation) party will seize no more than 34 seats,
ranking fourth.
</P>
<P>
Nine small parties will collect the remaining 51 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Matichon Poll pegged the Democrats' winning margin over the
New Aspiration Party by a margin of 20 seats, at 139 to 119.
</P>
<P>
The Nation Poll predicts the Democrats and New Aspiration
winning 132 and 122 respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, a survey by the Ministry of the Interior, which is in
charge of conducting the general election, shows NAP in first
place with 120 seats, followed by the Democrats (115 seats), Chart
Pattana (50) and Chart Thai (36 to 38).
</P>
<P>
Another poll, conducted by Kanman (sub-district) and Village
Headmen's Association in villages nationwide, also put NAP in the
lead, with 131 seats, 15 seats more than the Democrats (116
seats).

<P>
JAKARTA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia will sell 20 Nomad
aircraft to Indonesia, visiting Australian Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the deal was reached Thursday during a meeting
between McLachlan and his Indonesian counterpart Edi Sudrajat in
Surabaya, East Java province, the Australian embassy here today
quoted McLachlan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The twin turboprop aircraft, which are not equipped for combat,
were "retired from the Australian defense force (ADF) service in
1995 after they became unsuitable for continued military use,"
McLachlan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is interested in the aircraft for maritime
surveillance, a role in which it already uses 18 Nomad aircraft
acquired from Australia in the 1970s," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nomads, manufactured in Australia in the early 1970s, were
used by the Australian military as heavy transport and support
aircraft.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Spain and the United
Nations Program for Development (UNDP) said here today that they
will join efforts to train judges and other law enforcement
officials for Central American nations.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Agency for Cooperation and the UNDP presented a
program on judicial cooperation with Central America at the
on-going Spain-Central America Conference on Governability.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by Latin American leaders and four
former presidents of the region.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, to be implemented in Honduras in 1997, the
Judicial Power Council and the University of Salamanca of Spain
will cooperate in training judges and magistrates.
</P>
<P>
The program also provides assistance in introducing new
standards for dealing with minors who violate the law and in
reducing the number of people who are in jails without being
sentenced.
</P>
<P>
UNDP's regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean
Fernando Zumbado said that the fundamental rights of people must
be respected and that judges should be the first to do it.
</P>
<P>
"But there is also the right to live in peace and tranquillity,
to go out to the street without fear of being attacked or robbed,
and that is why it is necessary to create a culture of respect to
the safety of the citizens and to the effective defense of their
human rights," said Zumbado.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on Selecting HKSAR First Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) must represent the
overall interest of Hong Kong instead of that of any political
party or organization, said Lu Ping, vice-chairman and
secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR,
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first plenary session of the Selection
Committee for the first government of the HKSAR, Lu explained the
Method for Selecting the First Chief Executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The Method includes four aspects - eligibility for applicants
for the post of the Chief Executive, stipulations on applicants as
current civil servants or members of political parties or
organizations, the method for producing the Chief Executive and
the supervision of the selection.
</P>
<P>
Applicants for the post of the Chief Executive must be Chinese
citizens with Hong Kong permanent residence without right of abode
in any foreign country, having resided in Hong Kong for no less
than 20 consecutive years, supportive of the Basic Law for the
HKSAR and loyal to the SAR, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
These were stipulated in light of Articles 44 and 105 of the
Basic Law on the Chief Executive of the HKSAR, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Current civil servants who wish to be nominated as candidates
must resign from their posts and leave the job, so as to maintain
the current system of political neutrality of the civil servants
and to prevent current civil servants from using their power in
campaigning, Lu Ping said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Method, any aspiring applicant must be
nominated as an individual, and anyone affiliated to a political
party or organization must quit before announcing the intention to
run for the post.
</P>
<P>
This is because the Chief Executive must represent the overall
interest of the HKSAR instead of that of any political party or
organization, LU Ping explained.
</P>
<P>
The chairman and vice-chairmen of the Preparatory Committee
approved eight out of the 31 applicants as eligible applicants
during the PC's sixth plenary session on November 1-2. And the
Selection Committee members will make their choice for candidates
from among the eight. Any applicant who wins 50 or more votes
becomes candidate, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The candidates will introduce to the Selection Committee their
personal background and political programs and answer questions
raised by the Committee members before the Committee Members cast
their votes to select the chief executive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins more than half of the Selection Committee members'
votes is selected. If none of the candidates win enough votes as
stipulated, the two with the most votes will be put to a second
round of voting to decide the winner, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
He said that the selection process is presided over and
supervised by the chairman and vice-chairmen meeting of the
Preparatory Committee.

BERLIN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A Berlin court today issued

<HEADLINE> Manila to Resume Talks With MILF Rebels After APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
resume talks with the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
shortly after the November 22-25 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum meetings in the country, a senior official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will be after APEC," Executive Secretary Ruben
Torres told reporters in the presidential palace, adding that the
government is now busy dealing with the APEC-related matters.
</P>
<P>
Under earlier understandings reached between the MILF and the
government, exploratory talks would have begun last week to
discuss their talking points and a temporary truce between the
government troops and the MILF guerrillas in southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But the talks were stalled after the government rejected a
demand by the MILF to immediately withdraw its troops from
MILF-controlled areas in Basilan.
</P>
<P>
Torres again urged the rebel group to submit their own peace
proposals so that the government would be able to consider them in
drafting its own proposals.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Basilan erupted on October 16 when MILF
guerrillas ambushed an army patrol, wounding five soldiers. The
military retaliated and began massive offensives against MILF
strongholds in the island.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from the nearly month-long fighting rose to 97
on Tuesday when one rebel was killed and four others wounded in a
clash in the village of Bangkung in Tipo-Tipo Town, Basilan. Some
4,000 villagers living in the theater have fled, local officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is the biggest anti-government force
after the MNLF made peace with the government in September.

<HEADLINE> Canada, Chile Strike Free Trade Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada and Chile have reached a
free trade agreement, Canada's Minister for International Trade,
Art Eggleton, announced today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides immediate duty-free access for most
industrial goods, and the elimination over five years of Chile's
11 percent import duty on almost all remaining industrial and
resource-based goods.
</P>
<P>
There would be improved access for a range of agricultural
goods, including durum wheat, barley, lentils, seed potatoes, pork
products and beef, according to Canada's Department of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade.
</P>
<P>
Canadian exporters' overall access to Chilean markets would now
be better than that of their competitors in the United States, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Canadian investments in Chile would also enjoy
"significant new protection", the department said, without giving
details.
</P>
<P>
"This is a solid deal for both nations," Eggleton said. It
would "boost Canadian exports and create jobs in both countries."
</P>
<P>
"This agreement demonstrates our commitment to economic growth
through expanded trade and is an important first step in further
trade liberalization throughout the hemisphere and beyond," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Today's accord includes two parallel agreements on
environmental and labor cooperation, modeled on side agreements
of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
Canada and Chile began to negotiate a free trade agreement last
January. Ten rounds of negotiations have been conducted since then.
</P>
<P>
Chilean President Eduardo Frei is expected to arrive in Canada for
a three-day state visit Sunday, during which the agreement will be
formally signed.

BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged the central and local securities regulatory bodies to
reinforce surveillance and regulation of the securities markets,
to punish breaches of market rules and to protect the interests of
medium and small investors.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted Zhou Daojiong, chairman of the
China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), as telling a
conference in Xiamen, capital of Fujian Province, that central and
local regulators should ordinate their work to ensure proper
implementation of national policies on securities trading.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, which ended yesterday, was aimed at
improving control over the country's fledgling stock and futures
markets, which have experienced problems during rapid expansion.
</P>
<P>
Zhou urged local securities supervisory departments to improve
the quality of their work and their staff.
</P>
<P>
He said local regulatory departments should shift their focus
from restructuring local enterprises to share-holding companies -
and overseeing their market listing - to examining their
performance in the market.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the conference said authorizing local departments
to undertake some supervisory functions helps the establishment of
a unified and efficient regulatory mechanism and the
standardization of securities trading.
</P>
<P>
Four local securities regulators in Anhui, Shandong, Beijing
and Wuhan were commended at the conference for their work in
maintaining order in the securities markets.

Eleven local departments were authorized to oversee the
securities market in their regions, bringing the total to 35.

KIEV, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Hungarian President
Arpad Goncz and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma agreed here
today to further boost already strong bilateral relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Hungary should enhance cooperation in various
fields and give full play to agreements signed by the two sides,
Kuchma said in a news conference after he met Goncz at Marinsky
Palace.
</P>
<P>
Goncz, who arrived earlier today for a three-day visit, said
Hungary, already an associate member of the Council of Europe,
supported Ukraine's effort to join European organizations
including the European Union and the Western European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian President said his country held the same views as
Ukraine on NATO's eastward expansion. Nuclear arms would not be
based on Hungarian territory if it entered NATO, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has proposed the establisment of a non-nuclear zone
this year in response to fears that potential new members of NATO,
such as the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, would deploy NATO
nuclear arms on their territory.
</P>
<P>
Goncz also held talks, later in the day, with Ukrainian Prime
Minister Pavel Lazarenkoon on enlarging bilateral economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hungary and Ukraine signed a treaty on good-neighborly
relations and bilateral cooperation in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the trade volume between the two countries was 412.7
million U.S. dollars. In the first eight months this year it

SANTIAGO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chile today sent 14 tons of
humanitarian aid to Peru where a major earthquake has killed 14
people and injured at least 500 others.

The Chilean Interior Ministry National Emergency Board, which

The cargo was made up of blankets, clothes and canvas tents
donated by the Chilean government, the Chilean Red Cross and
Peruvians living in Chile. The latter also donated money for
victims.
</P>
<P>
Many of the tens of thousands homeless people had to spend
Tuesday and Wednesday nights in the open because of a shortage of
tents and blankets.

around noon, Tuesday in southern Peru.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Austria's economy is picking up
but there is no sign of an immediate boom by the end of this year,
a report of an economic research institute in Vienna said today.
</P>
<P>
Production is recovering in most industrial enterprises but
they are still complaining of the lack of orders and the
overstocking of products, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The construction market also improved compared with that of
early this year, the report said, but as winter approaches also
comes the dull season of the industry.
</P>
<P>
As for the retail sales, the report said that sales of cars and
durable goods slumped after the government adopted an austerity
economic policy in June. Food and beverage turnovers also dropped
with the recession of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate reached 6.6 percent by the end
of October, and the number of the jobless totalled 216,000, which
registered an increase of 120,000 over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Inflation also increased from 1.5 percent in May to 2 percent
now, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Spy Charge Against Oleksy Was Illegal: Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Action taken last year by the
Interior Ministry against the then Polish Prime Minister, Jozef
Oleksy, over alleged spying was "illegal", and "may have violated
the law", a parliamentary report says.
</P>
<P>
The 50-page report was released by a special committee of the
Polish parliament after nearly 11 months of investigation, the
newspaper Zycie Warszawy said today.
</P>
<P>
On December 19, 1995, Oleksy was accused of being a spy for the
Soviet Union by the then State Secretary of the Interior, Andrzej
Milczanowski. But the Russian foreign ministry and intelligence
bureau denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
A special committee was set up soon after by the Polish
parliament to investigate whether the accusation by the Interior
Ministry against the prime minister was illegal.
</P>
<P>
The Polish authorities said in a white paper issued earlier
this year that Oleksy was not a spy.
</P>
<P>
The report will be submitted Thursday to the leadership of
Polish Parliament. The report, if passed by the parliament in the
next few weeks, would be presented to a top procurator who would
decide whether or not to hold Milczanowski responsible for the
allegation.

<HEADLINE> Customs Offices Get Tougher on Smuggling of Pornographic Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Since 1993, China's customs
offices have seized 400,000 smuggled pornographic materials,
including printed items, audio-visual products and electronic
publications, according to a national conference held here.
</P>
<P>
In response to the new trend toward smuggling of pornographic
materials from the sea, customs offices along the coastal regions
have increased forces to patrol the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
In December of 1995, Guangzhou Customs Office seized 30,000
VCDs and 6,800 LDs that had been illegally transported across the
sea. Over the past four years, Shantou Customs Office netted
130,000 pornographic books and magazines in three major cases.
</P>
<P>
Customs offices have intensified cooperation with public
security departments in the anti-smuggling campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Gongbei Customs Office once discovered pornographic
electronic publications in the baggage of a traveler who was
exiting the area. The office then informed the Gongbei City Public
Security Bureau, and the two agencies jointly raided a center in
Gongbei that produced illegal publications.
</P>
<P>
China's customs offices have also exercised stricter checks on
inland enterprises that produce printing materials, audio-visual
products and electronic publications, and have shut down several
assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Xiamen, Shanwei and Beijing customs offices have
been honored as national-level offices that have excellent records
of cracking down on pornography and confiscating illegal
publications.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou, Shanghai, Gongbei, Changchun, Shenyang, Nanning customs
offices also have been honored by local governments.

<HEADLINE> State Curbs Use of Bags for Cement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China will levy a tax to
promote the use of bulk cement by construction developers and
contractors in a bid to increase productivity and protect the
environment, the Ministry of Internal Trade announced.
</P>
<P>
The measure will increase the cost of packed cement to
encourage producers and consumers to switch to bulk cement.
</P>
<P>
Bulk cement usually refers to rotary cement, a high-quality
cement suitable for bulk shipment.
</P>
<P>
Conventional packaging methods waste 17.4 million tons of
cement a year during transportation.
</P>
<P>
The paper used to pack cement amounts to 2.3 million tons a
year, representing nearly one fifth of the nation's wood
consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, under state regulations to
take effect on January 1 next year, cement packers will be banned
from using some kinds of plastic bags on the grounds that they are
easily torn and broken.

<HEADLINE> Dogs Play Mum To Piglets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Piglets in a Chinese city suburb
are leading a dog's life - and enjoying every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
Three female dogs have been playing surrogate mother to 36
piglets in the past year in a suburb of Zhangzhou city in eastern
coastal province of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
The dogs' owner, a farmer, said she raised the three bitches
specially to feed the piglets. Within a year the canine trio fed
36 piglets in three batches, earning 12,000 yuan (about 1,446 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
On each occasion the farmer bought piglets from a local market
the day after the dogs had puppies, according to the Yangcheng
Evening News. If the dogs refused to feed the pigs, the owner
would clean the dog kennel with spirits to remove the special
smell brought in by the newly-arrived piglets.
</P>
<P>
The dogs would then happily feed the piglets, without
discriminating against them.
</P>
<P>
The owner said the dogs are very responsible towards their
piglet feeding duties, and the piglets seldom become ill.
</P>
<P>
There were reports in China earlier this year of a dog
successfully feeding a tiger cub that had been abandoned by its
mother.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Atlanta Olympic Games,
which cost $1.7 billion to stage, broke even and will probably end
up showing a small surplus, organisers said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We reported that we have met our goal, which was to break
even, and that we will probably have a very small amount of money
remaining after we actually close the books sometime this
summer," Games organising committee president Bill Payne told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after delivering a financial report to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is holding a
four-day meeting at Caicun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the surplus would be more than 10 million
U.S. dollars, Payne replied: "I don't think so."
</P>
<P>
He did not give an exact figure. Payne said that outstanding
costs, consisting mainly of partial demolition of a stadium and
some pending debts, were already covered by money in the bank and
were firmly under control.

<HEADLINE> Using Natural Gas To Produce Fertilizer In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region will produce chemical fertilizer, using natural
gas from China's largest natural gas field, by building a 313-km
pipeline from Jingbian County, Shaanxi Province, to the Ningxia
Chemical Works, along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The gas field is located on the border of Shaanxi and Gansu
provinces and the Ningxia autonomous region, and can supply 1.5
billion cubic meters of natural gas in the first phase of pipeline
construction.
</P>
<P>
The pipe will run to the city of Yinchuan, the regional
capital, which is close to the field and which is equipped with
industrial plants. It will expand production equipment of the
Ningxia Chemical Works, which has an annual production capacity of
300,000 tons of synthetic ammonia and 500,000 tons of urea.
</P>
<P>
Total cost of the project is put at 470 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
After the expansion project is completed, the chemical works is
expected to be able to produce 600,000 tons of synthetic ammonia
and 1.02 million tons of urea.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Set for Two Million-Dollar Showdown With Bailey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Olympic 200m and 400m
champion Michael Johnson said in Chicago Thursday that he and
Canada's Donovan Bailey will meet in Toronto May 31 for a 150m
showdown worth two million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The winner will take home the title of "fastest man in the
world" in addition to the record prizemoney.
</P>
<P>
Bailey won the 100m gold medal in a world record time at the
Atlanta Games and challenged Johnson, the first man to take double
gold in the 200m and 400m at the same Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who shattered the 200m world record, said both runners
would receive a 500,000-dollar appearance fee just for competing
at SkyDome in a race that will be billed as "The Rumble in
Toronto."
</P>
<P>
Johnson's 200m gold-medal final time of 19.32secs broke his own
record of 19.66 seconds set one month earlier at the United States
Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
Bailey won the 100m in 9.84 seconds, trimming the 9.85 seconds
mark set by American Leroy Burrell in Lausanne, Switzerland in
July of 1994. Bailey also anchored Canada's 400m relay team,
which beat the United States for the gold medal.

<HEADLINE> Jingyu People More Healthy for Drinking Mineral Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- People across China are
spending a fortune on bottled mineral waters, believing it is
purer and healthier than ordinary tap water.
</P>
<P>
But in one township health-restoring water from a famous spring
is supplied to every home ... on tap.
</P>
<P>
Now 40,000 residents in Jingyu County town in northeast China's
Jilin Province say they have become more healthy since their
ordinary tap water was replaced with the mineral water.
</P>
<P>
Even doctors at the county hospital are reporting that fewer
residents from the mountainous county town have caught colds,
dysentery, or suffered from scabies since all 40,000 households
were equipped with water pipelines that provide them with mineral
water for drinking.
</P>
<P>
The county, classified as a poor area, collected seven million
yuan (810,000 U.S. dollars) to build a pipeline several kilometers
long to carry the mineral water from a spring in the Qinglong
Spring Nature Reserve to all homes in the county town.
</P>
<P>
An investigation shows that not a single case of malignant
tumors have been reported in areas around the nature reserve in
decades, and very few cases of dysentery and scabies have ever
been reported.
</P>
<P>
Tests have shown that the Qinglong Spring water is rich in
minerals, such as selenium, which are good for people's
health. Its daily flow capacity is 6,500 tons, enough to meet the
daily drinking water needs for all the households in the town.
</P>
<P>
As the spring is 83 meters higher than the county town, the
water has been supplied to the households without the need to
build complicated water supply systems.
</P>
<P>
Before the mid-1960s, people in the township relied on river
water for daily use. But river water lacked iodine and contained
much bacterium. Many people contracted diseases linked to the
lack of iodine.
</P>
<P>
After 1966, the government built projects to supply
ground water for residents, and in 1985 a waterworks was
built.
</P>
<P>
However, with the running water containing too much iron, water
pipelines often rusted, and water become yellow. Residents
had to clarify the water before using it for drinking.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the county government decided to collect
money for the introduction of water from the nearby spring, which
has turned out to be specially good for people's health.

WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Don King was stripped
Thursday of the rights to promote a WBC heavyweight title bout, a
move that will pay Lennox Lewis 1.5 million dollars less but
should assure him a fight in three months, according to reports
from Paterson, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that a number of different times a fight was
supposed to happen and it didn't happen," Lewis told Superior
Court Judge Amos Saunders. "It seems like I'm being stretched
along. Every time it's in Don King's hands, it seems like
something goes wrong.''

Saunders ruled Don King Productions had failed to meet
contractual obligations when the WBC on September 26 accepted the
company's 9.2 million dollars purse bid for a Lewis-Oliver McCall
fight, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Saunders instead awarded the bout to Totowa, New Jersey-based
Main Events, which bid 6.2 million dollars for the fight, the

<HEADLINE> Hunger Still Torments Mankind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was a solemn proclamation made by the 1974 World Food
Conference in its Universal Declaration on the Eradication of
Hunger and Malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
But 22 years later, that goal to eliminate hunger, food
insecurity and malnutrition has not been achieved. Today hunger
and malnutrition are still ruthlessly tormenting people,
especially those in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference two days before the
World Food Summit opens on November 13, Director-General of the
Food and Agriculture Organization Jacques Diouf said: "Although
the world recognizes freedom from hunger as a fundamental human
right, some 840 million men, women and children in the developing
world and many millions more in the developed countries are
undernourished."
</P>
<P>
"This situation is unacceptable," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
According to FAO data, Asia claims the lion's share of the
world's hungry. The number of people not eating a minimum diet in
southern and eastern Asia is estimated to be over 500 million,
equivalent to 18 percent of the population of the region and 67
percent of the total chronically undernourished population in the
developing world. South Asia alone is home to over 58 percent of
the world's undernourished children and nearly 60 percent of the
215 million stunted children in the world.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa gives the most cause for concern. More than
200 million, or more than 40 percent of the region's population,
is chronically malnourished. Moreover, the intensity of hunger
(the degree to which the actual food intake of underfed people
falls below the national average per capita requirement of the
population, expressed as a percentage) has increased in the
sub-Saharan Africa. Yet worldwide, it has declined by one-half
(from 10 percent to 5 percent) in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Relatively speaking, hunger in Latin America and the Caribbean
is not as serious as in the above two regions. However, the number
of chronically undernourished people has grown from 46 million
around 1980 to more than 60 million in the early 1990s. This
amounts to 14 percent of the region's population.
</P>
<P>
The seriousness of hunger in the developing countries is also
demonstrated in urban areas. Nearly 42 percent of the urban
population in sub-Saharan Africa, 23 percent in Asia, 27 percent
in Latin America and over 34 percent in the Near East and North
Africa live below the official poverty lines and face starvation.
</P>
<P>
Hunger is even found in the most affluent countries. The number
of hungry people in the United States totaled 30 million in 1990
or 12 percent of the total population. Canada had 2.5 million or
8.6 percent of its population, and Australia had about 2 million
or one in every eight people, who did not have adequate access
to food.
</P>
<P>
The FAO identifies three main categories of hunger. The first
category comprises people facing acute hunger, who are the victims
of conflict and natural disasters. The number of refugees and the
people displaced by conflicts increased from about one million in
1970 to 50 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The second category consists poor people who are more
vulnerable than others at critical times of the life cycle,
including babies in the womb, the new-born, young child-bearing or
lactating women. There are about 20 million new-born babies
worldwide each year who are underweight.
</P>
<P>
The third category is the chronically poor and hungry. They
account for the largest proportion of hungry people, totaling
about 700 million. For the people of this category, hunger is not
only a demonstration but also a cause of poverty.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate hunger and malnutrition, external food assistance
is perhaps the most direct and urgent method. Unfortunately, food
aid commitments by rich countries are rapidly declining in recent
years. During the 1983-93 period, annual food aid was always more
than 10 million tons of cereals. However, the figure dropped to
8.4 million tons in 1994, and further to 7.6 million tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural aid commitments by rich countries are also on the
decline. The total volume went down from 10 billion dollars in
1982 to 7.2 billion dollars in 1992 (in 1985 constant prices).
</P>
<P>
If the present trend continues, FAO believes, the world will
still have 730 million hungry people by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Declaration adopted at the outset of the current
five-day World Food Summit sets as its immediate goal the
reduction of the number of undernourished people to half their
present level by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
The same document also admits: "The problems of hunger and food
insecurity have global dimensions and are likely to persist, and
even increase dramatically in some regions, unless urgent,
determined and concerted action is taken, given the anticipated
increase in the world's population and the stress on natural
resources."

<HEADLINE> Mortalities of Children, Pregnant Women Drop in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The survival rates of expectant
mothers, newly born babies and young infants in Tibet have
dramatically improved.
</P>
<P>
It follows a massive campaign to improve training of midwives
and the use of sterile equipment during childbirth.
</P>
<P>
Local health officials have reported new figures which show
that the mortality rates of expectant mothers and children under
the age of five have dropped significantly since 1989, when the
scheme was launched.
</P>
<P>
Deaths of expectant mothers dropped to 326.4 per 100,000 in
1994, from the 1989 level of 715.58 per 100,000 people; death
rates of infants declined from 91.8 per thousand to 50.73 per
thousand in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Mortality of children under five also decreased from 126.72 per
thousand to 50.54 per thousand in the 1989-1994 period, said the
report released by the Public Health Department of Tibetan
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to a health-promotion project jointly launched by the
Tibetan government and Unicef, the health conditions of Tibetan
women and children have been greatly improved," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of safe delivery methods, in which well-trained
midwives use sterilized devices in the course of child delivery,
was the main reason for the substantial drop, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The improved method was applied to about 46 expectant mothers
among every 100 in 1994, while the rate was only about 11 among
every 100 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by China's Ministry of Public
Health in August, China's maternal mortality was 62 per 100,000

<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- An electronic atlas charting
China's national economy, the first one in the country, has been
published in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Experts describe it as an authorized state information bank on
China's economy.
</P>
<P>
The atlas, published by the Publishing House of Higher
Learning, and approved by the State Planning Commission, reflects
the geographic, economic, social, historical and cultural features
of China, and illustrates the economic and social progress in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The atlas uses video images and pictures and accurate statistics,
and focuses on natural resources, population, the general
state of the economy, agriculture, industry, construction
industry, urban building, environmental protection, domestic and
foreign trade, tourism, education, science and technology,
culture and medical care.
</P>
<P>
It contains 250 maps, over 1,000 statistical break-downs and
briefings.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Boss in Hot Water over Reported Racial Slur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Swedish UEFA chief Lennart
Johansson has found himself in the center of controversy after
racist comments about Africans attributed to him were published in
the Swedish daily Aftonbladet on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the article, Johansson described the situation at a recent
meeting in South Africa when FIFA president Joao Havelange wanted
to single-handedly give the 2006 World Cup to Africa, a move the
Sweden felt should be decided by FIFA's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived in South Africa, the whole room was full of
blackies, and it gets damned dark when they're sitting there
together. If they're also angry, then it's not so cheery," he
said, according to Aftonbladet.
</P>
<P>
Johansson on Thursday told the Swedish news agency TT he did
not recall exactly what he had said and could therefore not deny
the remark.
</P>
<P>
"I don't recognize those words. I said that it was dark in the
room and that there was an aggressive atmosphere. That was what I
wanted to describe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a long conversation and I don't remember everything
that was said, so I can't accuse anyone of lying," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I can only say that I have never had racist ideas or
attitudes. If such an impression was created and if I have
offended anyone then I can only apologize," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year old Swede has worked hard to promote football in
Africa, and was in South Africa to accept an award from the
African equivalent of UEFA for his efforts.

<HEADLINE> US Drops Charges Against Former KGB Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Fearing of Russia's
retaliation, the United States dropped spying charges today
against former KGB agent Vladimir Galkin in consideration of what
the Justice Department said "national interest."
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, and after further consultations within the
government, the CIA has concluded, and the State Department has
concurred, that the national interest would best be served by
dismissing the charges," the Justice Department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The CIA was advised in advance of the October 29 arrest of
Galkin and raised concerns but no objections, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Galkin was accused of attempted espionage and conspiracy to
obtain for Russia information on the U.S. "Star Wars" defense
program.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin called U.S. Vice President Al Gore today and
discussed the Galkin case. Chernomyrdin explained Moscow's
position and asked Washington to be "more attentive" to solving
the Galkin problem to avoid new tensions between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia has issued several public protests and a threat of
retaliation over the arrest of Galkin, who was with a Moscow
delegation, by the FBI at New York's Kennedy International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Russia accused the United States of breaking the "unwritten
rules" of espionage by giving a former spy a visa, then arresting
him when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans breached the unwritten rules of the game and the
code of behavior of the world's espionage services," Tatyana
Samolis, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Intelligence Service, said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service says Galkin, 50, has
been a private citizen and businessman since 1992.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Diabetics to Top 250 Million by 2025 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of diabetics
worldwide will increase from the current about 120 million to top
250 million by the year 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The growth will be registered in both developed and,
especially, developing countries, due to population aging,
unhealthy diets, obesity and a secondary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. health agency, about 20 percent of
diabetics develop the so-called insulin-dependent form of
diabetes, or IDDM, and live on with insulin injections, while
about 30 percent of the non-IDDM cases may use insulin injections
to control their conditions.
</P>
<P>
The WHO considers insulin an essential drug. However, it noted
that in some developing countries, the drug that turns the once
fatal IDDM into a treatable disease is still unavailable or
unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
A vial of insulin may cost a month's salary in many African
countries, according to it.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by the human body's
failure to produce insulin or to produce effective insulin. The
deficiency leads to increased concentrations of glucose in blood
and thus damage the body's many systems, particularly blood
vessels and nerves.
</P>
<P>
The long-term complications of diabetes include blindness,
kidney failure, heart attacks and even gangrene and amputation of
the limbs.
</P>
<P>
Insulin was discovered in 1921.

<HEADLINE> US Cabinet Appointments Still Being Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- While speculation continued
today about the choices for the cabinet of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's second term, the White House indicated no major
announcements would be made before Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the speculation centered around a replacement for
outgoing Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry told reporters that
President Clinton viewed that decision as part of a larger
configuration of the "national security cluster" -- including top
jobs at the Pentagon and CIA.
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect any announcement pertaining to the secretary of
state any time soon, but there are other issues involved in that
cluster that he has been working on," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't necessarily rule out that he might have a Cabinet
announcement before he goes," McCurry said. "But...I am not going
to guarantee that."
</P>
<P>
Clinton talked today with U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and
Education Secretary Richard Riley about their roles in the next
administration, and will talk with other officials including
Attorney General Janet Reno when he returns, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At least four other Cabinet secretaries have already met with
Clinton -- Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Transportation Secretary
Federico Pena and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, who are leaving,
and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who is not.
</P>
<P>
Other Cabinet officials expected to leave are Defense Secretary
William Perry and Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Clinton's economic adviser,
has refused to discuss his role during Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was engaged in the "outreach" phase of reviewing
Cabinet appointments by talking with potential nominees, McCurry
said.

<HEADLINE> Africa Frustrated Over Impotence in Zaire Crisis: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- African countries, especially
French-speaking African countries, were frustrated with their
impotence when facing the refugee crisis in Zaire, said the daily
Le Monde today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ivorian President Henri Konan Bedie as saying
in Abidjan that the Organization of African Unity once planned to
set up a pan-African force to save more than 1 million refugees in
eastern Zaire, but to no avail due to lack of material means.
</P>
<P>
"They (Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi) are French-speaking
countries: what touches them touches us, too. But we are
frustrated when facing the situation, because of our impotence,"
Le Monde quoted Bedie as saying.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that African countries now feel better because
some African countries, including Senegal and South Africa, will
join the multinational intervention force in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the lack of mobilization of West African
states in the Zaire crisis is that they have been engaged in the
peacekeeping mission in Liberia for several years.
</P>
<P>
"The diplomatic and military resources of the region are used
to support a peace process which is always uncertain in Liberia,
including the reinforcement of personnel of the West African
Interposition Troops in Liberia," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The only diplomatic initiative to solve the Zaire crisis came
from Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who presented a
four-point cease-fire proposal which called for the withdrawal of
Tutsi rebels from the Zairean territory.
</P>
<P>
But the report said that by making the initiative, Eyadema was
showing solidarity with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.
Eyadema and Mobutu are presently two of a few African heads of
state who came to power in the 1960s, soon after Africa won its
independence.

<HEADLINE> (Rpt With Correction) Canadian Land Force Preparing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada is in tense
preparation for sending its troops to eastern Zaire to facilitate
humanitarian relief tasks, with Lt. Gen. Maurice Baril as the
commander of a multinational force.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Deputy Foreign Minister Gordon Smith and Commander
Baril confirmed this at a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Canada was asked by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali and many other countries to take the lead, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past week, Canada kept on talking to
countries, trying to produce a momentum to carry through a kind of
resolution of the Security Council that will permit an
international force to be deployed in the region. "We certainly
hope it's going to happen at the latest at the end of tomorrow,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The immediate issue is to provide relief for the people who are
displaced, providing security so that the humanitarian
organizations can deliver aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second purpose is to create necessary conditions for the
voluntary, orderly and secured repatriation of refugees, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past couple of days, they talked with
U.S. officials who in principle agreed to participate in the
force, which will number around 10,000 soldiers from different
countries. Canada will send 1,500 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Maurice Baril said that the Canadian force intends to
establish its headquarters for the humanitarian intervention task
in Goma, Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He also said some African countries are participating in the
task forces. He said he hopes that contributing countries will not
add conditions on the tasks. He himself will leave earlier next
week.
</P>
<P>
The mission is expected to last four to six months.
</P>
<P>
Baril, 52, who is also a military adviser to the U.N.
secretary-general, has served in the army for 35 years.

<HEADLINE> US Demands Cease-Fire for Troops Entering Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States demanded
today that there must be at least an informal cease-fire agreement
among warring factions around Goma before it could send troops to
eastern Zaire for a humanitarian relief mission.
</P>
<P>
"What we would like is a pledge by the sides that there will be
a cease-fire," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
But he said such a "de facto cease-fire" between warring Hutu
and Tutsi militia groups would not necessarily be "a written,
signed agreement."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Defense Secretary William Perry said that
the U.S. troops would have to get "the acquiescence" of the
disputing militias and other factions before moving into the Goma
area.
</P>
<P>
He also restricted the role the American troops will play
strictly to the humanitarian aid mission.
</P>
<P>
"They are not going in as a means of conducting military
operations," he told reporters at a Photo session in the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"We are not planning a mission to go in and disarm factions
or separate the military from refugees. This is a humanitarian
mission," he added.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton agreed in principle Wednesday to
dispatch up to 4,000 U.S. troops into Central Africa as part of a
multinational force to help about 1 million refugees languishing
in eastern Zaire without food and water.
</P>
<P>
The United States has placed several conditions in
participating in the international relief effort, including that
the U.S. troops will stay no longer than four months and the
local combatants allow them to arrive peacefully to minimize the
possibility of U.S. casualties.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said that National Security Adviser Anthony Lake was at
the United Nations Thursday discussing plans with other nations in
an attempt to arrange such a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said U.S. troops could start moving to the
region as early as next week.

WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Beninese
defense ministers met today to start the second session of a joint
military commission.

<P>
A Pentagon statement said the commission, which first met in

</P>
<P>
The United States and the western African nation have conducted
a series of military exercises since 1991, including training for
officers and provision of medical instruction and humanitarian
assistance. The goal is to improve the expertise of the Benin
army, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Benin has contributed police monitors to the U.N. mission in
Haiti and has offered to contribute troops to a multinational
western African peacekeeping force.

<HEADLINE> Budget Amendment Not to Be Backed by US Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin has said that President Bill Clinton "is still
opposed to a balanced-budget constitutional amendment."
</P>
<P>
Major U.S. newspapers reported today that U.S. government
officials scrambled to clarify what President Clinton had said
that he would agree with the amendment sought by the Republicans
in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Tuesday that he could live with the amendment that
had an "escape hatch" for government action in recession. He said
any amendment would have to provide the tools necessary to lift
the economy if it slipped into recession.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said Wednesday that the U.S. president "is opposed to
a balanced-budget amendment, and if one is proposed, he will be
actively opposing it."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president's senior economic advisers worried that
Clinton's remarks would be interpreted as a policy reversal and
Rubin and other top advisers quickly moved to right the record,
U.S. newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
A version of constitutional amendment on the balanced-budget
passed the House of Representatives in 1995 but failed by a single
vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
White House aides said Tuesday that Clinton's change of tone on
an amendment on the budget was a bow to political reality after
Republicans gained two seats in the Senate for a 55-45 advantage
over the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
A day after President Clinton appeared to open the door a bit
to a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal
Budget, his Treasury Secretary slammed that door shut again, The
New York Times said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Land Force Preparing to Go to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada is in tense
preparation for sending its troops to eastern Zaire to facilitate
humanitarian relief tasks, with Lt. Gen. Maurice Baril as the
commander of a multinational force.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Deputy Minister Gordon Smith and Commander Baril
confirmed this at a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Canada was asked by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali and many other countries to take the lead, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past week, Canada kept on talking to
countries, trying to produce a momentum to carry through a kind of
resolution of the Security Council that will permit an
international force to be deployed in the region. "We certainly
hope it's going to happen at the latest at the end of tomorrow,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The immediate issue is to provide relief for the people who are
displaced, providing security so that the humanitarian
organizations can deliver aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second purpose is to create necessary conditions for the
voluntary, orderly and secured repatriation of refugees, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past couple of days, they talked with
U.S. officials who in principle agreed to participate in the
force, which will number around 10,000 soldiers from different
countries. Canada will send 1,500 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Maurice Baril said that the Canadian force intends to
establish its headquarters for the humanitarian intervention task
in Goma, Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He also said some African countries are participating in the
task forces. He said he hopes that contributing countries will not
add conditions on the tasks. He himself will leave earlier next
week.
</P>
<P>
The mission is expected to last four to six months.
</P>
<P>
Baril, 52, who is also a military adviser to the U.N.
secretary-general, has served in the army for 35 years.

<HEADLINE> New Rating For Singapore's United Overseas Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- IBCA, The European Credit
rating agency, has assigned an Individual rating of A/B to United
Overseas Bank (UOB), which is the second highest Individual rating
level awarded by the agency.
</P>
<P>
United Overseas Bank is the third largest in Singapore, with
about a 23 percent share of the banking market.
</P>
<P>
Two other banks in Singapore have also been assigned an A/B
rating: the Development Bank of Singapore and Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corportion, according to an announcement by IBCA here
today.
</P>
<P>
The highest Individual rating awarded by IBCA is A and there
are less than 10 banks worldwide that have been assigned an A
rating.
</P>
<P>
A bank's Individual rating is an evaluation of its financial
strength based on the premise that it is entirely independent and
therefore unable to rely on the support from state authorities or
its owners.
</P>
<P>
IBCA said, "United Overseas Bank has a very strong financial
profile. Not only is UOB rated the third most profitable bank in
the world by IBCA, it has the highest reported total capital to
risk weighted assets ratio in Singapore of 23 percent."
</P>
<P>
UOB also impresses people with its proactive approach to risk
management that seeks to comprehensively assess and manage its
risks, rather than avoid them, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, UOB's previously assigned Legal rating of 2
is also affirmed, IBCA said.

<HEADLINE> US Names Jordan Major Non-NATO Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has designated Jordan a major non-NATO ally of the United States,
which makes the kingdom eligible for priority consideration for
military aid and equipment, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"Effective November 13th, 1996, the president designated Jordan
a major non-NATO ally of the United States, pursuant to Section
517 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961," State Department
spokesman Glyn Davies told reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
This designation "makes Jordan eligible for priority
consideration for the transfer of excess defense articles, the use
of already-appropriated military assistance funds, for procurement
through commercial leases, the stockpiling of U.S. military
materiel, and the purchase of depleted uranium munitions," Davies
said.
</P>
<P>
It reflects the key role played by Jordan in the Middle East
where the United States has strategic interest, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan has joined Egypt and Israel as a full partner in the
effort to bring peace to the Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
Other countries that also enjoy this special designation
include Australia, Egypt, Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief: US May Keep 8,000 Troops in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
likely commit up to 8,000 troops to a follow-up peacekeeping force
in Bosnia next year once the mandate of the current force expires,
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said today.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who is in Washington for talks on American
participation in peacekeeping operations, told reporters that he
had talks with Vice President Al Gore Wednesday, which left him an
optimistic impression on the prospect of continued U.S.
involvement in the mission.
</P>
<P>
"Without U.S. participation, I think it would be very difficult
to have a follow-on force," he said. "It would be a mistake, now
that we've come this far, to stop."
</P>
<P>
Solana said he expected Washington to send 7,000 to 8,000
troops to a new NATO-led force until the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the new force would also include 5,000 German troops and
forces from Russia and other NATO countries. The mission would
focus on civilian rather than military matters, mainly calling the
repatriation of refugees and holding municipal elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said later that the U.S. had not
yet made decisions on its involvement in the new NATO force in
Bosnia, while White House spokesman Mike McCurry said President
Bill Clinton arranged to discuss the matter late today with his
advisers, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said any announcement on U.S. participation would come
Friday, before the president leaves for a three-day vacation in
Hawaii followed by a nine-day trip to Asia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initially committed a year stay of American troops in
Bosnia to enforce the 60,000 multinational force to implement the
U.S.-brokered Dayton agreement, which largely ended fighting
between Muslims, Croats and Serbs. It planned to pull out its
15,000 troops before mid-March next year.
</P>
<P>
Solana said he expected the follow-up force would consist of
20,000 to 30,000 troops. NATO political leaders would give a
formal approval for the new force in Brussels next Monday, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Designates 1997 as Year of Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ottawa, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The government of Canada today
announced the designation of 1997 as Canada's Year of Asia-Pacific
(CYAP).
</P>
<P>
Canada's Minister of Transport David Anderson and Secretary of
State (Asia-Pacific) Raymond Chan made the announcement while
unveiling the official CYAP logo in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
"As a people and a trading nation, Canada's ties to the Asia
Pacific community run deep," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"This special year will celebrate our Pacific dimension and
help us to build even stronger partnerships in Asia-Pacific to
create opportunities for Canadians from coast to coast," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Canada will chair the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, which will culminate with the Economic
Leaders' Meeting in Vancouver in November.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the government will encourage businesses and
business associations, youth and cultural organizations as well as
other groups to focus on Asia-Pacific in their activities.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it is organizing events, such as business forums and
trade fairs, around APEC meetings being held across Canada in 1997
to help Canadians strengthen their partnerships and learn more
about doing business in Asia-Pacific, said a government news
release.
</P>
<P>
Other key events include the January Team Canada 1997 trade
mission to South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines; a youth
conference and other activities involving youth; as well as
cultural activities to underscore the breadth of Canada's close
ties with the region and the importance of cultural understanding
in doing business in the region.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The space shuttle
Columbia's flight managers have decided to postpone the launch to
next Tuesday because of the predicted bad weather, according to a
NASA news report today.
</P>
<P>
Columbia, already one week late because of a booster rocket
safety investigation, had been scheduled to take off Friday. But
NASA put off the launch to Saturday to accommodate the flight of
an unmanned rocket, and then delayed it again because of the bad
weather in the Kennedy Space Center for the next several days.
</P>
<P>
Columbia's launch window Tuesday opens at 2:53 p.m. EST and
extends for 2.5 hours. An on-time launch and nominal mission will
have the spacecraft returning to Earth on December 5.
</P>
<P>
During the final shuttle flight for 1996, Columbia's crew will
deploy and retrieve two free-flying spacecraft, conduct two space
walks and perform a variety of microgravity research experiments.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts will also study blood pressure regulation and
function in rats fed either a high- or a low-calcium diet before
and during space flight; and continue the investigation into how
microgavity affects bones at the cellular level.
</P>
<P>
This mission will be Columbia's 21st flight and the 80th of the
U.S. space shuttle fleet.

<HEADLINE> Deval Patrick Resigning as Civil Rights Enforcer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Assistant Attorney General
Deval L. Patrick, who played a major role in U.S. President Bill
Clinton's refusal to renounce affirmative action, said today he is
resigning as the administration's chief civil rights enforcer.
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview, Patrick said, "My family's in Boston, and
I've been commuting all told for about two years."
</P>
<P>
Calling it a "hard decision," Patrick said, "I love this job.
But I miss my kids and I love my wife, and I need to be home."
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno, joined by Patrick at her weekly
news conference today, described Patrick as "one of the finest
public servants" she has ever known.
</P>
<P>
Reno and Patrick said that the civil rights division headed by
Patrick achieved a record government settlement in a major housing
bias case.
</P>
<P>
The owners and former managers of 10 South Florida apartment
complexes that allegedly refused to rent to African-Americans and
families with children agreed to pay a combined total of 1,345,000
dollars in four separate settlement agreements.
</P>
<P>
After the Supreme Court tightened the standards for affirmative
action programs to remedy past discrimination, Patrick helped an
administration task force design modifications that Clinton said
would "mend, not end" affirmative action. A major Pentagon program
to allocate contracts to minority businesses was ended, but others
were continued under tighter standards.
</P>
<P>
"The whole question of tolerance seems to be in jeopardy
today," Patrick said. "But I'm not without hope. There is a
tremendous reservoir of goodness in the American people, but it
has to be called forth by parents and leaders."
</P>
<P>
"What is really at issue is whether ultimately in this country
integration is still a national objective," Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
Patrick's work on lending bias led to record increases in loans
to qualified minority borrowers. He also co-chaired a task force
on church fires that led to the arrest of more than 100 people in
80 fires since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under Patrick, the division won court battles to open two
state-supported military schools to women, the Virginia Military
Institute and the Citadel in South Carolina. He also focused on
enforcing the Americans With Disabilities Act, including getting
an Olympic Stadium built in Atlanta with unprecedented access for
those in wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
The division had an 87 percent success rate in criminal
prosecutions of alleged civil rights violations under Patrick.
</P>
<P>
Patrick was a partner in a Boston law firm before taking up the
position.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Pledges Cooperation With UN on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides pledged here today that his government will cooperate
with the U.N. and the European Union (EU) in search for a
solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in a message on the 13th
anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence (UDI)
by the Turkish Cypriot regime on November 15, 1983, in the
northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council resolution 541 adopted in 1984 deplored
the Turkish Cypriot UDI, which was recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the Cyprus government pins great hopes on the new
initiative expected to be launched by the United States, Britain
and the EU at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that "it is not enough that our side
alone desires a solution," adding that the Turkish side should
also "genuinely" want it.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that now is the time for foreigners who are
interested in Cyprus to help, so that when the time comes for
direct negotiations, the Turkish side will have the political will
it is lacking," Clerides added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Cyprus government will sincerely
cooperate with the representatives of the U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and the EU in search for a solution to "the benefit of
all the legitimate citizens of Cyprus, Greek Cypriots, Turkish
Cypriots, Maronites, Armenians and Latins."
</P>
<P>
Clerides also called for all events planned to denounce the
Turkish UDI to abide by government policies.
</P>
<P>
A series of anti-occupation demonstrations staged today
throughout the country and they will expect to reach climax Friday
with gatherings and marches.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for 22 Mln Dlrs to Help Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations launched
today an appeal for 22 million U.S. dollars to meet urgent
humanitarian needs in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, launched by the U.N. Department of Humanitarian
Affairs (DHA) in Geneva, was based on investigations made by a
DHA-led humanitarian needs assessment mission to Tajikistan last
month.
</P>
<P>
The assessment mission found that the humanitarian situation in
the country had worsened considerably due to the combined effect
of continued fighting between the government and the United Tajik
Opposition, and a sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
The DHA said that Tajikistan was suffering from a dramatic
deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a
sharp decline in the provision of social services, health and
education.
</P>
<P>
The real income of most families in the country has shrunk
considerably, with large sectors of the population in the country
not able to meet even their basic food needs.
</P>
<P>
Under these conditions, many vulnerable groups in Tajikistan
require continued and immediate humanitarian assistance to ensure
their survival during the winter months, the DHA said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Belarus President Sacks Election Chief </HEADLINE>

MOSCOW, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alxander
Lukashenko sacked Central Electoral Commission chief Viktor
Gonchar today for his decisive refusal to sign Sunday's referendum
results on the grounds that they are invalid.
</P>
<P>
"I have signed a resolution on relieving Viktor Gonchar of the
post of chairman of the Central Electoral Commission of Belarus,"
Lukashenko said in a televised statement, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Gonchar once again reaffirmed that he was
definite about non-signing the final vote count.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide referendum, designed to poll on presidential and
parliament versions of the fundamental law, started earlier this
month and lasts till November 24. There exist differences between
Lukashenko and a large number of lawmakers over top powers defined
by the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in front of parliament, Gonchar accused referendum
organizers of violating the law both during the preparation and
the initial phase of the nationwide poll.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the poll was in progress, its budget was
not yet approved and its sources of financing unclear. He also
said that his commission did not even know the number of allots
printed and had been left aside their spread-out by electoral
areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Prosecutor General Vasili Kapitan told the lawmakers
that none of the local electoral commissions had reported
poll-related violations to his office so far.
</P>
<P>
After the speeches, the parliament announced a three- or
four-day break in the session to check at least 1,000
constituencies for compliance with the election law during the
poll.
