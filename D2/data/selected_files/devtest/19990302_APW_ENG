	The retailer expects to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 1998  
earnings within the range of current analysts' estimate of 23 cents 
a share and $1.58 a share, respectively. Venator said it plans to 
reduce 1999 capital spending to about $175 million from $550 
million, in an effort to increase cash flow.

</P>
<P>
	The company reported fourth-quarter operating earnings of 36  
cents a share, beating analysts' expectations by a penny. Internet 
sales rose more than 1,000 percent last year, and the company plans 
to open at least 100 new stores in the United States this year, and 
stores in Brazil, Mexico and Japan.

outlook for 1999. Texas Instruments is holding firm to its 
first-quarter outlook of 4 percent to 6 percent revenue growth, 
which is strong given seasonal weakness in semiconductor sales. 
However, TI also is the market leader in digital signal processing 
chips, which are used in a variety of machines including

roll out a television-based Internet service that will cost about 
$15 a month in the second half of the year, targeted as an 
introduction to the Internet ``for the grandmothers of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive said he expects At Home to report more than $2  
billion in revenue by the year 2002, and that gross margins should

<HEADLINE> Jets, Testaverde Reach $19.5M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vinny Testaverde sensed he'd finally found the  
right place. Oddly, he had to come home to discover it. 
</P>
<P>
	Long Island native Testaverde signed with the New York Jets as a  
free agent before last season. Then he led them to their best 
season in three decades and within a step of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the 12-year veteran quarterback was rewarded with a  
three-year contract worth nearly $19.5 million to remain with his 
hometown team. The deal also includes a $6.2 million signing bonus 
-- making nearly $9 million guaranteed -- and the Jets hold a 
four-year option beyond the original three seasons. If exercised, 
Testaverde would earn $42.4 million for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want the talks to be a distraction for me or the  
team,'' said Testaverde, who led the AFC in passing in 1998 and 
went 13-2. ``I knew things would work out as soon as I signed there 
last year. It was a gut feeling I had. I think my decision has 
worked out for me to perform the best I can. 
</P>
<P>
	``After these talks today, I can refocus and get ready for the  
upcoming season. I'd like nothing more than to finish my career at 
home. When I first signed there, it was not on the top of my list 
wanting to come back home, to the Jets. It was playing for coach 
(Bill) Parcells and knowing his background and the way he coaches. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Then coming home and being around my family, and as we went  
along, the family part moved up the ladder quite a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the deal was postponed after Testaverde's  
father, Al, died of a heart attack Feb. 14. Al Testaverde's heart 
condition prohibited him from watching his son's games live. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few weeks have been a roller coaster,'' Testaverde  
said. ``One thing I am still thankful for is my father got to enjoy 
a great season after my being away from my family my first 11 years 
in the NFL. I had the opportunity to come home last year and see 
him at training camp each day, knowing he couldn't watch the games 
on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I was able to see him on a regular basis and talk with him  
on the contract negotiations. I'm very happy I got to share that 
time with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he hopes to share more success with a team that, until  
Parcells took over in 1997, was one of the league's perennial 
losers. Testaverde was used to losing, having been drafted No. 1 
overall in 1987 by Tampa Bay, which has had even less success than 
the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1986 Heisman Trophy winner who grew up in Elmont, N.Y.,  
not far from where the Jets train, turned around his career in '98. 
Signed ostensibly to be a backup to Glenn Foley, he took over when 
Foley got hurt, then was ineffective, and took the Jets to their 
first division title since the team joined the NFL in 1970. 
Testaverde completed 259 of 421 passes for 3,256 yards and a 
team-record 29 touchdowns. The Jets advanced to the AFC title game, 
losing to Denver 23-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he technically was a free agent for two weeks,  
Testaverde never considered leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart was set on playing in New York. We've developed a  
relationship that developed into a marriage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no bigger stage than New York City. And to come in and  
perform well there was great for me, knowing it was in front of my 
family and friends. The team had not been to the playoffs in quite 
awhile and they made me feel right at home and part of the team 
right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After the success we had as a team and individually,'' he  
said, ``in my heart I just wanted to get this deal done with the 
Jets. This year was the best of my career. I think there were 
reasons for that and the biggest reason was Bill Parcells. I wanted 
to remain with him so I can continue to have that success.''

<HEADLINE> Store To Be Demolished for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- For years, residents of a run-down inner city  
neighborhood have been afraid to sit on their front steps or take a 
walk because of drug dealing around a corner convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun-toting dealers looking for customers flagged down residents,  
and grown men on bicycles carried drugs or acted as lookouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The city decided the only way to get rid of the drugs was to get  
rid of the 73-year-old store, and a judge on Monday ordered the 
demolition of the Springhill Grocery and an adjacent apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really a drug store,'' said Ann Refolo, an assistant  
state's attorney with the city's housing department. 
``Unfortunately, it is for the convenience of the users, not the 
surrounding community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Monday's order was the first time a Maryland  
business has been targeted for demolition because of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington attorney Roger Conner, a visiting fellow with the  
National Institute of Justice, said the tactic has been tried in 
New York, San Diego and San Antonio. But usually homes and not 
businesses are targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is prosecution with a plan,'' he said. ``Most cities  
don't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many neighborhood stores in Baltimore, the Springhill  
Grocery's shelves and cash register are kept behind a thick glass 
partition. Since 1995, police have responded to 486 drug-related 
calls on the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, they arrested 10 people at the site in less than  
five hours. During a raid last May, police found drugs and drug 
paraphernalia in the back of the store and a handgun in an area 
accessible to customers. Weeks earlier, they found 28 bags of crack 
cocaine -- 18 in the pockets of a store employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never dealt with any kind of drugs,'' Ulysses Holmes,  
who runs the store, said during a break in the civil trial last 
week. ``I personally don't know about any drug dealing inside (the 
store).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city sued under a nuisance law aimed at eliminating drug  
havens. 
</P>
<P>
	Two friends of Holmes testified that getting rid of the store  
wouldn't solve the problem. One gave the judge a petition with 100 
signatures of residents asking to keep the store open. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes and Allen Becker, a Baltimore real estate agent who owns  
the property, were given a week to present a plan to stop the drug 
activity. That plan -- to close the store but maintain the apartment 
-- was rejected Monday by District Judge Timothy Doory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has  
not been involved in the case, but Executive Director Susan Goering 
said she is concerned about whether the two men received due 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you have the heavy hand of the government taking away  
people's rights, it's important for government to bear the burden 
of showing why those rights should be denied,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in Shooting in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Two men opened fire on a crowd in front  
of a convenience store, killing three people and wounding two 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said two men fired into a cluster of about 10 people  
standing outside the Stop and Shop store at about 9 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the dead victims were shot near a pair of pay phones,  
while the other victim was killed near the store entrance. The two 
injured victims were reported in serious and in good condition at 
local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The identities of the victims, believed to be in their 20s, were  
not available late Monday. Clark said investigators were not 
certain whether the men were the intended targets or bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen fled in a getaway car, and no arrests had been made  
early today. A motive for the attack remained unknown.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Examines Iran Energy Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department criticized French and  
Iranian oil companies on Tuesday for signing a $540 million energy 
deal with Iran and said U.S. authorities would begin proceedings 
that could lead to economic penalties against the firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf Aquitaine of France and Agip of Italy signed a deal Monday  
that would boost Iranian oil production to an estimated 100,000 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is with the state-run National Iranian Oil Co. for the  
Dorood oil and gas field and was made over the opposition of the 
United States, which embargoed American trade with Iran in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are both disappointed and concerned about this development.  
The U.S. remains strongly opposed to investment in Iran's petroleum 
sector. We have repeatedly urged the governments of France and 
Italy at the most senior levels to discourage this investment,'' 
James Foley, the deputy State Department spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States tries to discourage investment in Iran on the  
grounds Iran sponsors terrorism beyond its borders, spreads 
dangerous technology and is bent on developing weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1996 law, investments of more than $20 million in Iran  
or $40 million in Libya could result in a variety of sanctions. 
Among them are bans on export licenses for the United States and 
denial of Export-Import Bank credits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will look closely at the facts of what has happened and we  
will be assessing the implications under (the Iran-Libya Sanctions 
Act). If sanctionable activity is found to have occurred, we will 
decide upon and take appropriate action,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the French oil company Total signed a $2 billion deal  
with Iran to develop natural gas reserves, along with Gazprom, a 
Russian petroleum company, and Petronas, a Malaysian company. The 
United States said in 1998 it would waive sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't preview for you what we will ultimately decide,''  
Foley said. ``We actively tried to discourage this investment. We 
reminded our European friends that (this) is the law, and that we 
will apply it.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Tackle Major Antitrust Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During the 1980s, a declawed Federal Trade  
Commission would have been unlikely to take on a high-profile 
antitrust case against one of the world's biggest technology 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But in just a week, the commission will face off against Intel  
Corp. in the other major computer-courtroom drama unfolding in 
Washington -- bringing it out from behind the shadow of its sister 
federal antitrust agency, the Justice Department, and its case 
against Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-stakes Intel case is indicative of the changing tide at  
the commission, which almost doubled its antitrust enforcement 
actions from 1997 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	With an aggressive leadership and buoyed by some large  
victories, the commission in recent years has vigorously exercised 
the authority given it by the 1976 Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
Improvements Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``The principal reason is not our doing but the world's doing,''  
said Robert Pitofsky, the commission's chairman. ``The behavior by 
some firms really raises antitrust questions more frequently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, a wave of mergers has swept the nation in the past few  
years. More than $1 trillion in mergers occurred in fiscal year 
1998, and nearly 4,800 requests were filed by companies to have 
merger proposals reviewed by antitrust agencies as required by law. 
That is a 28 percent increase from previous years' filings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, many believe the FTC has been newly aggressive in  
using its antitrust power and in grabbing headlines from Justice, 
harkening back to the 1960s, when it argued many antitrust cases 
before the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Intel case was probably filed in part to say, `Hey, look  
at us! We're here, too, and we can enforce the same laws,''' said 
Bill Shughart, a University of Mississippi economics professor. 
Shughart, who worked at the FTC in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
said he couldn't imagine the commission at that time bringing a 
similar complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission alleges that Intel illegally withheld from three  
companies technical information about its new generation of 
computer chips to ``extort'' valuable technology that the companies 
developed independently. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., makes 
chips that run 80 percent of world's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts attribute a good part of the agency's new gusto to  
Pitofsky, a lawyer sworn in as commissioner in 1995. In 1994, 
Pitofsky chaired a Pentagon advisory panel to address whether the 
defense industry should be granted antitrust exemptions as it 
downsized in the post-Cold War era. The task force recommended 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman is the first to admit that mergers are not  
intrinsically harmful but rather the inevitable consequence of 
economic globalization, deregulation and an increase in the 
importance of high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably a sensible response to some changes that  
are going on,'' Pitofsky said. ``But independent deals can be very 
much of a threat to consumer welfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the FTC and Justice both embroiled in big computer cases,  
the fine line that distinguishes the two agencies seems a bit 
blurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally there has been a gentleman's agreement between the  
two agencies not to compete to file lawsuits against the same firms 
at the same time,'' said Shughart. An agency might opt for a case 
based on workload or prior expertise: Airline mergers tend to end 
up at Justice, gasoline companies at the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with mergers of a certain size must inform both  
agencies. Historically, the assistant attorney general of the 
antitrust division -- currently Joel Klein -- and the FTC chairman 
chat by phone to determine jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has handled probably two-thirds of all mergers, because  
it has broader jurisdiction on civil matters, said Robert Burka, a 
private antitrust expert. In contrast, Justice can bring criminal 
cases and the FTC can't. 
</P>
<P>
	After its period of vigilant regulation in the 1960s, the FTC in  
the late 1970s moved away from traditional antitrust cases and 
focused instead on trying to stop states from using legislation to 
create monopolies, said Don Boudreaux, president of the Foundation 
for Economic Education in Irvington, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the early 1990s, the commission started to accelerate its  
activity in mergers and predatory pricing, producing a string of 
successes: 
</P>
<P>
	--Staples and Office Depot in July of 1997 called off their $3.5  
billion merger after the commission got a court injunction arguing 
the deal would reduce competition and lead to higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rite Aid Corp. dropped a $1.8 billion deal with Revco in 1996  
after the FTC said Rite Aid would gain too much of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofsky concedes some deals can create efficiencies that could  
benefit consumers. He cites the alliance between Chrysler Corp. and 
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, approved in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We became fairly persuaded there were true efficiencies in  
putting together the two companies,'' Pitofsky said.

<HEADLINE> Marine Cable Car Case Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The government's case against a Marine  
pilot whose jet severed an Italian gondola cable and killed 20 
people during a low-altitude training mission is heading to a 
military jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony that began Feb. 8 ended Tuesday in the manslaughter  
trial of Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif. After 
closing arguments from attorneys and instructions from the judge, 
the eight-man military jury was expected to begin deliberations 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was at the controls of an EA-6B Prowler jet on Feb. 3,  
1998, when it struck the Mount Cermis gondola cable near Cavalese, 
Italy. He is charged with involuntary manslaughter and other counts 
and could get 206 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't recall in 20 years of investigating accidents any  
pilot being held criminally responsible for an accident,'' said 
Jeff Edwards, an investigator who worked for the defense team. ``I 
believe he's very worried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Europeans were outraged over the 
accident, and Italians demanded that U.S. landing rights be revoked 
at bases in their country. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Ashby intentionally flew too low and too  
fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have suggested the aviators were charged because  
of political pressure that went as high as the White House. They 
also said Ashby's jet had a malfunctioning radar altimeter, that he 
may have been victim of an optical illusion that exaggerated his 
altitude and that his superiors didn't provide up-to-date 
information on speed and altitude limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree the gondola cable wasn't marked on the map  
Ashby was issued by the Air Force. Ashby testified last week that 
he didn't know of the ski lift and that he didn't see the cable 
until the last second. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, faces similar  
charges and a separate court-martial. Charges against the other two 
crewmen were dismissed.

<HEADLINE>  Tennis Great Bill Talbert Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bill Talbert, a star player who later became  
tournament director of the U.S. Open, is dead at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1967 enshrinee of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in  
Newport, R.I., Talbert died Sunday in his Manhattan home. Cause of 
death was not immediately known, but he had been confined to a 
wheelchair for the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
	William F. Talbert, born in Cincinnati on Sept. 4, 1918, was  
diagnosed at age 10 with diabetes. He was recognized as the first 
diabetic to compete in athletics at the highest international 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached the singles finals at the U.S. Championships -- later  
known as the U.S. Open -- in 1944 and 1945 and the U.S. Indoor 
Championships in 1948-51. He was ranked among the top 10 in the 
United States from 1941 through 1955, and was a stalwart of the 
American Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	As a player, he starred in doubles, teaming with Gardnar Mulloy  
to reach the U.S. doubles final six times, winning in 1942, '45, 
'46 and '48. He also captured the U.S. Championship mixed doubles 
with Margaret Osborne four straight years -- 1943-46. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert teamed with Tony Trabert, another Hall of Famer, to win  
both the French and Italian doubles titles in 1950, and was U.S. 
Davis Cup captain from 1953-57, defeating Australia to win the Cup 
in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Mr. Tennis,'' Talbert was named director of the U.S.  
Open Championships at Forest Hills and served as chairman and 
director of the Open from 1971-75. When the Grand Slam tournament 
moved to Flushing Meadows, Talbert returned as director from 
1978-87 and served as honorary vice chairman until his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Having played in both the longest men's doubles match and mixed  
doubles match on record, Talbert was instrumental in introducing 
the tiebreaker in a major tournament in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chairman emeritus of the Hall of Fame, served on the Hall  
of Fame's executive committee and was tournament chairman of the 
Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the National Diabetes Advisory Board, the  
President's Advisory Council of the American Diabetes Association 
and a director of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. Last year, 
Talbert marked 50 years of service with the U.S. Banknote 
Corporation in New York, where he was a vice president from 1953 
until his death. 
</P>
<P>
	He also co-authored eight books, including the acclaimed ``The  
Game of Doubles in Tennis,'' and his autobiography, ``Playing for 
Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert was married to the former Nancy Pike, an editor for  
Vogue and Life Magazine, from 1946 until her death in 1995. He is 
survived by two sons, W. Pike and Peter, and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of the family, funeral services will be private.

<HEADLINE> Jets Sign Atwater to $8.3M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- It worked with Bryan Cox, so why not with  
Steve Atwater? 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets signed the veteran free safety, an eight-time  
Pro Bowl player for Denver, to bolster their secondary and provide 
leadership for the defense. That was exactly what linebacker Cox 
did in last season's Jets turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he feels like he has something to prove again. I can  
sense it in the player, just like Bryan had it when he came here,'' 
coach Bill Parcells said of Atwater, who signed a three-year, $8.3 
million contract that includes a $1.8 million bonus. ``What you're 
always curious about when you have a player like this is, is the 
fire still burning? Does he still want to do it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater says there will be no problems in that area after he was  
cut by the two-time champion Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The former team I played with, I think they felt like I  
couldn't play anymore,'' he said. ``I'd like to show them and show 
the world that Steve Atwater can still play football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known as an aggressive tackler, Atwater, 32, sometimes was  
replaced on passing downs in Denver. The Broncos apparently felt 
they could do just as well with younger players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets struggled at the position last year, using rookie Kevin  
Williams and journeyman Jerome Henderson, who was released last 
week. Their other safety, Victor Green, had a good season and is 
similar to Atwater in style. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater had five tackles in the AFC title game against the Jets,  
with a forced fumble and a tipped pass that resulted in an 
interception. He plans to be just as active with the Jets, whose 
defense he praised. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I noticed was guys flying around to the  
ball,'' Atwater said. ``That's my characteristic. I like coming to 
the ball, and I like to get there full-speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons -- who lost to the Broncos in the Super Bowl -- the  
Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles also expressed an 
interest in Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, if I didn't have full confidence that he was able  
to do what we're asking him to do, he wouldn't be here,'' said 
Parcells, who noted that Atwater was on the field for 96 percent of 
the Broncos' defensive snaps last season. ``You can watch a guy 
play and know what you've got. This guy is involved in heavy 
traffic most of the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signing came a day after the Jets committed $19.5 million to  
quarterback Vinny Testaverde in a three-year contract extension. 
The club, aggressive as promised during the offseason, also has 
signed quarterback-punter Tom Tupa, tight end Eric Green and 
defensive end Mike Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said the Jets are not finished with offseason  
transactions, including trades. Only 15 players remain from the 
roster Parcells inherited when he took over the ballclub in 
February 1997.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Senate OKs School Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Under tight security, the state Senate on  
Tuesday passed a bill allowing Detroit's mayor to take over the 
city's troubled schools from the elected school board. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the Senate's 15 Democrats joined all 22 Republicans to  
pass the bill 30-7. It now goes to the House, where talks are 
taking place to make the bill more palatable to Detroit residents. 
</P>
<P>
	State police kept watch at the Capitol's front entrance and used  
metal detector wands to visitors. The handful of critics who got in 
were quieted when they broke into applause twice as opponents 
spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a clear voter-rights issue. We don't want to oppress  
people,'' said Pat West as she waited for a seat in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposed by Gov. John Engler, the bill would authorize Mayor  
Dennis Archer to replace the elected school board with a 
seven-member ``reform board.'' The public would vote in five years 
whether to replace the board with a new, elected school board. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler cites poor test scores, high dropout rates and crumbling  
buildings as signs the district needs help. Detroit residents have 
accused the white governor and mostly white Legislature of trying 
to oust people elected by a predominantly black city. Engler said 
there is no racism and said control of the schools would be in the 
hands of Archer, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
	The district's dropout rate for high school students was 26.4  
percent in 1997; the four-year graduation rate was 29.7 -- much 
worse than any other large district in the state. The 
180,000-student district has 108,000 children living in poverty.

<HEADLINE> CBS Renews 12 Shows for Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pushing up Hollywood's traditional timetable,  
CBS announced Tuesday that 12 of its prime-time series will return 
in the fall and that it will immediately begin selling advertising 
time on them. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's entire Monday night schedule of comedies and its three  
newsmagazines were included in the early renewal announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	TV networks usually announce their fall schedules in May,  
touching off a scramble by advertisers to place orders for millions 
of dollars worth of commercial time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we are sort of laying down the gauntlet that we  
will be stable,'' said Leslie Moonves, president and chief 
executive of CBS Television. ``It will say to our affiliates and 
advertisers that we're ready for next season. Why wait until May 
when we know where we are going?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shows that will definitely return are ``Cosby,'' ``King of  
Queens,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Becker,'' ``JAG,'' ``60 
Minutes,'' ``60 Minutes II,'' ``Touched By an Angel,'' ``Kids Say 
the Darndest Things,'' ``Nash Bridges,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``Candid 
Camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others existing shows will probably join them on the renewal  
list, but CBS can't announce them yet for contractual reasons, 
Moonves said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, NBC has said that seven of its shows will definitely  
return next fall: ``ER,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Friends,'' ``Dateline 
NBC,'' ``Just Shoot Me, ``Law and Order'' and ``3rd Rock From the 
Sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has already renewed ``The PJ's,'' ``That '70s Show'' and  
``Beverly Hills 90210.'' ABC, the WB and UPN have not announced any 
series renewals for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves said he expects advertisers to jump at the chance to  
place advertising orders for CBS's hottest shows, like the comedy 
``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa questioned the  
strategy, saying it would limit a network's chances to sell ad 
packages. Networks sometimes require advertisers to buy ads on new 
or lower-rated shows if they want to get a slot on a hit show like 
``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem short-sighted to sell their shows alone without  
using them as bait to get people to your new shows,'' Sassa said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's announcement is another indication that the traditional  
calendar for television seasons is slowly breaking down. Networks 
are more frequently premiering new programs outside of September, 
when the fall season usually starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves said CBS is likely to have the fewest number of new  
shows next fall than it has had in years. He said he was startled 
to see the number of pilots in development set in high schools or 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be such an obsession with teen-agers and  
animation that we're not going to go there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Owner Moves to Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn has  
moved to Florida, fueling speculation he is planning to sell the 
NBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn is now living in a $1.4 million home he has owned for  
several years in Jupiter, Fla., said Hornets vice president Sam 
Russo. 
</P>
<P>
	Russo and NBA commissioner David Stern told The Charlotte  
Observer they have not heard that Shinn is trying to sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern also said there is no truth to a rumor Michael Jordan is  
heading an investment group interested in buying the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to interest him in any team, but I have no indication  
that's something he wants to do,'' Stern said of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	If Shinn does decide to sell the team, the move to Florida could  
save him millions of dollars, an accountant said. He would not only 
avoid North Carolina's capital gains tax, but would also dodge the 
state's 7.75 percent tax on personal income. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn's move comes a year after a woman sued him, alleging he  
forced her to perform oral sex at his Tega Cay, S.C. mansion in 
September 1997. Shinn was not charged in the incident, but 
countersued the woman, 29-year-old Leslie Price, claiming she 
slandered him and tried to extort $5 million from him. 
</P>
<P>
	Price's lawsuit may go to trial this spring in Richland County,  
S.C. Both sides call an out-of-court settlement unlikely.

<HEADLINE>  Playful Sosa Joins Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Sammy Sosa insists he's ready to play ball  
following a whirlwind offseason that took him all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been busy. But I'm only 30 years old, and I don't get  
tired,'' the National League MVP said Monday. ``To get tired is 
mental, and I'm strong mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was seen everywhere following a season in which he and Mark  
McGwire staged baseball's greatest home run derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The frequent flier, who said he often slept on long plane rides,  
worked for Dominican Republic hurricane relief, made public 
appearances and picked up awards. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in Japan, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Miami, New York, Los  
Angeles, Arizona, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Washington, where he 
helped light the national Christmas tree and attended the State of 
the Union address. His longest stay at home was about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied because 66 is a lot of home runs, and a lot of  
people wanted to shake my hand,'' Sosa said. ``I've been meeting a 
lot of people I would have never dreamed about. The nicer you are 
to people, the more they want to be around you. I think I have 
earned that respect from everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a humanitarian award he won at the ESPYs meant as much  
to him as the MVP because it represented something other than his 
accomplishments on the field. It recognized his work for his own 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saved a lot of lives back home because of the help that came  
in,'' he said. ``I'm doing something great and will continue to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll also continue to joke and smile and pledged not to change,  
despite his celebrity status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never forget where I come from,'' the former shoeshine  
boy said. ``I'm still hungry, and I'm still humble. This is my 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no pressure, he said, to repeat his MVP season of a  
year ago. His goal, he said, is to play in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``The race with Mark was great -- back and forth. We were  
motivation for each other. I just hope I can continue doing the 
job. I don't know if I can have another year like that, but you 
never know what will happen,'' Sosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire won the home run race 70-66, but Sosa helped the Cubs  
reach the playoffs for the first time in nearly a decade by hitting 
.308 with 158 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	If pitchers don't give him anything to hit this year, Sosa said  
he's prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I'll go to first, take a walk,'' he said. ``This is not  
1998. We don't need to go out and break records anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's first spring workout was nothing if not painful.  
</P>
<P>
	When a fan tossed a ball over a high fence for Sosa to  
autograph, it came as a surprise and plopped on the head of the 
normally sure-handed right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa sent six batting-practice homers over the fence at Fitch  
Park, but facing reliever Rod Beck, Sosa fouled a ball off his 
groin area and fell to the grass in pain. He shook it off and 
moments later was able to participate in a base-running drill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got me pretty good,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On a brilliant day with temperatures in the 80s, fans followed  
his every move, chanting his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy-six this year,'' one yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	Bats, shirts, programs and even an Arizona license plate ``Maris  
61'' were presented for Sosa to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more pressure on him because of what he did last  
year,'' teammate Gary Gaetti said. ``He can handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's arrival Monday came three days after the team's first  
full-squad workout, but still one day ahead of today's mandatory 
reporting date. He also reported three days later than most of his 
teammates last season, and it certainly didn't hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to camp bigger than last season -- his muscular arms  
bulged, and there was a little roll around his middle. He said he 
was up to 222 pounds, which would be a 12-pound increase from what 
he was listed at last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all muscle, no fat,'' he said with a huge laugh. ``I'm  
probably just eating better.''

<HEADLINE>  Playful Sosa Joins Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Sammy Sosa insists he's ready to play ball  
following a whirlwind offseason that took him all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been busy. But I'm only 30 years old, and I don't get  
tired,'' the National League MVP said Monday. ``To get tired is 
mental, and I'm strong mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was seen everywhere following a season in which he and Mark  
McGwire staged baseball's greatest home run derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The frequent flier, who said he often slept on long plane rides,  
worked for Dominican Republic hurricane relief, made public 
appearances and picked up awards. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in Japan, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Miami, New York, Los  
Angeles, Arizona, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Washington, where he 
helped light the national Christmas tree and attended the State of

<HEADLINE> David Wells Has Back Spasms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- For David Wells, his trade to Toronto is  
proving to be a pain in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	The colorful left-hander was in the treatment room instead of on  
the field Tuesday, bothered by back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wells has some lower right back inflammation,'' Toronto  
trainer Tommy Craig said. ``We're treating him now, and he seems to 
be responding to the treatment and exercises. We don't anticipate 
it being a long and drawn-out thing. We're just going to take it 
day to day right now, then ease him back up to the on-the-field 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells felt discomfort his first time Saturday but finished his  
11-minute pitching stint. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if there is anyone who can put an exact cause,''  
Craig said. ``It might be that his pelvis twisted too far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, who pitched a perfect game for the New York Yankees  
against Minnesota last May, was acquired last month along with 
reliever Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush for five-time 
Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells began his major league career with Toronto.  
</P>
<P>
	``He knows what he has to do to get ready,'' Blue Jays manager  
Tim Johnson said. ``He's just stiff. I think he'll be fine.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura Gives First Major Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura got serious for his  
first State of the State address Tuesday and outlined his 
philosophy of limited government and personal responsibility, 
saying in his usual blunt fashion: ``We can't legislate against 
every stupid thing people will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the former pro wrestler wanted to be taken seriously  
in his first major address as governor. He read nearly every word 
of his sober, 45-minute speech from a TelePrompTer, made no jokes 
and showed little of the attitude that got him elected in a 
third-party upset. 
</P>
<P>
	Striking a familiar theme, he said, ``The state of the state is  
that the people are very tired of business as usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He challenged Minnesotans to take control of their lives, and  
urged public officials to end the ``free ride'' for people who 
don't take responsibility for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The state, he said, is ``jeopardized by this weak notion that  
taxpayers must step forward to provide nearly unlimited resources 
to anyone who faces adversity, who lives with circumstances they 
brought about through their own decision or who lives with 
consequences of choices to act illegally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``The legacy of this administration will be provoking  
people out of their apathy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the state is awash in surplus revenue, he made just one  
specific new proposal: to increase the $10 million in his initial 
budget to help struggling farmers to $60 million over the next 
three years. He also encouraged lawmakers to pass legislation that 
would return surplus revenue through a sales tax rebate. 
</P>
<P>
	The former wrestler, known as ``The Body'' in the days when he  
strutted around the ring wearing a feather boa, said he wants to 
simplify the property tax system. He also talked about a plan to 
``market Minnesota'' by expanding export markets and bringing film 
productions here. 
</P>
<P>
	He also mentioned his goal of a better transportation funding  
system and a light-rail transit system in the Twin Cities by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has been criticized for introducing few bills since the  
legislative session opened in January, but he said he will govern 
with a vision, not a flood of bills. And he said he had instructed 
his staff to make no ``deals,'' but to judge each proposal on its 
merits. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders liked Ventura's general message but were  
concerned by the lack of detail and Ventura's disengagement from 
negotiations with the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cooperation is a three-way street,'' said House Speaker Steve  
Sviggum, a Republican. ``I think his principles are wonderful. 
We'll work with the governor as long as the actions follow the 
principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, a Democrat, wasn't surprised  
by the speech, noting the familiar themes of better education, 
transit and a tax rebate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are goals that all of us share and will try to help him  
achieve,'' Moe said.

<HEADLINE> Pat Robertson Joins Bank Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- American television evangelist Pat Robertson is  
forming a banking-by-telephone venture in the United States with 
the Bank of Scotland PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, whose television ministry reaches millions of  
viewers, will hold a substantial minority interest in the joint 
venture through his wholly-owned firm, Robertson Financial Services 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Scotland said Tuesday it was filing an application  
with U.S. regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bank, which has not been named, will let customers do  
their banking entirely by telephone. Deposits and withdrawals of 
cash will be done via money transfers to a second institution. The 
new bank will offer attractive interest rates to build a customer 
base, the Bank of Scotland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bank will be a subsidiary of the Edinburgh-based Bank of  
Scotland. Marshall and Ilsley Corp. of Milwaukee, Wis., is to 
provide support services, personnel and technology for the joint 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson founded the Christian Broadcasting Network and the  
Family Channel. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 1988 and 
continues to head the Christian Coalition, a political organization 
he started a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson was appointed in January to the board of British  
clothing retailer Laura Ashley PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland has experience in telephone, or direct, banking  
through a partnership with J. Sainsbury PLC, a British supermarket 
chain.

<HEADLINE> IOC Told To Police Members, Bidders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An ethics report that criticizes the  
International Olympic Committee could help the panel rebuild in the 
wake of its worst corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's chief investigator said Monday that he generally  
favored many of the recommendations by the U.S. Olympic Committee 
commission, including outside elections, term limits for members 
and strict rules on travel, expenses and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice president Dick Pound argued with the report's  
characterization of the IOC as a ``culture of improper gift 
giving'' and stressed that he had not seen the report, issued as he 
was flying back from Switzerland earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the IOC was committed to radical change in the wake  
of the million-dollar Salt Lake bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to reinvent ourselves for the new millennium,''  
Pound said from his Montreal office. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee blamed the scandal on leaders who turned a  
blind eye to corruption that was ``flourishing'' even as the games 
grew into a billion-dollar empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, headed by former Senate Majority Leader George  
Mitchell, said the IOC was an inbred, unethical group that needed 
to change into a modern, open business. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the conduct ``tolerated by the IOC is potentially  
illegal and inevitably corruptive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC should no sooner tolerate improper gifts by candidate  
cities to its members than it would tolerate such gifts by athletes 
to judges,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he would watch the IOC's special assembly March  
17-18 to see if the committee is committed to reform. The Senate 
Commerce Committee, meanwhile, has scheduled hearings on the 
Olympic scandal next month and will consider stripping the IOC's 
tax exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Mitchell panel's recommendations, such as financial  
audits and open books, have been suggested by others, including 
Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report contained unusually harsh language for the  
international sports hierarchy. It said the IOC helped create 
``this mess'' that shifted the focus of picking Olympic cities from 
sports to ever-bigger presents for committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We called this `gift-creep,''' Mitchell said at a news  
conference. ``Gradually, what started with small, legitimate items 
evolved into scholarships and then direct payments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the whole system should be reformed, and that  
there was no need for Juan Antonio Samaranch to resign as IOC 
president if no fundamental changes in operations were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``If President Samaranch and the entire leadership of the IOC  
retires tomorrow and there were no other changes, the problems of 
the IOC would continue, '' Mitchell said. ``If they continue in 
office, then everyone ... has a right to expect they will institute 
structural change promptly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell report was the third on the scandal, in which  
members of Salt Lake's bid committee offered $1.2 million in cash, 
scholarships and other gifts to IOC members and their relatives in 
exchange for awarding the 2002 Winter Games to the Utah city. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike earlier findings by the IOC and the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee, it delivered no blockbuster revelations, focusing 
instead on what needed to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said Olympic leaders at every level are responsible  
for the scandal and said reforms were needed from top to bottom to 
avoid a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission blasted the IOC.  
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake's misconduct, Mitchell said, was ``part of a broader  
culture of improper gift-giving in which candidate cities provided 
things of value to IOC members in an effort to buy their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This culture was made possible by the closed nature of the IOC  
and by the absence of ethical and transparent financial controls of 
its operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Benz, a commission member and former champion figure  
skater, said the Mitchell panel was especially disturbed by ``the 
prevalence of a culture in which it was acceptable to request 
things of value while making a decision involving the people from 
whom you were requesting things of value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It became apparent that the objectionable conduct was  
inextricably intertwined with the system,'' Benz said in an 
interview. ``That system led bid cities to gift-giving that made 
the strengths of their sports system secondary to caring for the 
preferences of individual IOC members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had no formal comment on the report. The U.S. Olympic  
Committee, which uses Mitchell's panel as an ethics watchdog, is 
scheduled to release its response at a news conference on Wednesday 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's investigation has led to nine IOC members resigning or  
being expelled, at least 13 more are expected to learn their fate 
this week. The Canadian said his commission was finalizing 
recommendations and would send them to the IOC leadership soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member commission was trying to reach a consensus on  
all of the cases and was now dealing with an additional six IOC 
members linked to the scandal by the Utah ethics report, Pound 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell report suggested a series of changes, from severe  
limits on bid-city gifts and expenses to opening the IOC's books 
and having the bulk of its members elected to limited terms by 
others in the sports community. The IOC traditionally picks its 
members to virtual life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also called on the IOC to require that any country  
bidding for the games sign the international treaty against 
bribery. And it urged the White House to bring the IOC under 
coverage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits 
bribing of foreign government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell commission, working mostly from public records and  
news reports, did not examine Olympic bids other than Salt Lake's, 
and Mitchell pointedly refused to comment on possible improprieties 
in successful Summer Games bids by Atlanta for 1996 and Sydney for 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the IOC should have paid more attention to a 1991  
report from Toronto's losing bid for the 1996 Games, which detailed 
abuses of the gift and travel rules by a string of unidentified 
committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``In strikingly prophetic language, they warned of the  
consequences of such improper behavior,'' the report said. ``The 
Toronto prophesy has come true. As a result, credibility of the 
Olympic movement has been gravely damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benz said the Toronto report ``provided notice to the IOC. ...  
It showed the IOC had knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said some of the recommendations in the Toronto report  
were adopted by the IOC, including coordination of travel to bid 
cities. But he conceded that the committee could have been more 
alert to signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're paying for that,'' he said. ``We're going to get the  
genie back in the bottle.''

<HEADLINE>  Jurors in ski lift death trial hear one witness, are sent home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Jurors hearing the trial of a Marine  
pilot whose plane cut a ski lift cable in the Italian Alps, killing 
20 people, were sent home early today after hearing one last 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged  
with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count each of 
destroying private property, destroying government property, 
dereliction of duty and improper flight planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The last testimony came from a prosecution rebuttal witness,  
Robert Duarte, an expert on some flight instruments, who questioned 
defense evidence saying the aircraft 's speed was lower than what 
prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, sent the jury home for  
the day while he and attorneys prepare jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments will begin Wednesday, Nunley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was at the controls of an EA-6B Prowler when it hit the  
cable of the Mount Cermis ski lift on Feb. 3, 1998, near Cavalese, 
Italy. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 206 years if convicted 
of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the last defense witness narrated a computer  
simulation of the flight. Gan Wang of Cambridge Research Associates 
said the government's three sources of data used to plot the flight 
didn't show the same path. Two tracks showed the radar-jamming jet 
flying through a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who presented 11 days of testimony, questioned  
several witnesses about whether Ashby violated flight rules by not 
using a ``hot mike,'' a voice-operated system that allows the pilot 
to talk to his crew without pressing the mike button. 
</P>
<P>
	But air crash investigator Jeff Edwards testified Monday that  
the hot mike wasn't reliable and that the pilot could turn it off 
and easily press the mike button. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said his review of tests showed the jet's radar  
altimeter wasn't functioning. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a member of the Marine investigation board  
testified that Ashby's superiors didn't provide all the navigation 
information he needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct of the flight with what was available to the air  
crew was very reasonable,'' said Col. Thomas Blickensderfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ashby was reckless and violated the mission's  
517-mph speed limit and 2,000-foot altitude restriction. His jet 
cut the cable about 370 feet above the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said he thought the altitude restriction was 1,000 feet  
and claims he was unaware of a speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys also contend that Ashby's map didn't have the  
gondola marked on it, his radar altitude gauge malfunctioned and 
that he suffered from an optical illusion that made him think he 
was flying higher than he was. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Jurors in ski lift death trial hear one witness, are sent home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Jurors hearing the trial of a Marine  
pilot whose plane cut a ski lift cable in the Italian Alps, killing 
20 people, were sent home early today after hearing one last 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged  
with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count each of 
destroying private property, destroying government property, 
dereliction of duty and improper flight planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The last testimony came from a prosecution rebuttal witness,  
Robert Duarte, an expert on some flight instruments, who questioned 
defense evidence saying the aircraft 's speed was lower than what 
prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, sent the jury home for  
the day while he and attorneys prepare jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments will begin Wednesday, Nunley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was at the controls of an EA-6B Prowler when it hit the  
cable of the Mount Cermis ski lift on Feb. 3, 1998, near Cavalese, 
Italy. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 206 years if convicted 
of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the last defense witness narrated a computer  
simulation of the flight. Gan Wang of Cambridge Research Associates 
said the government's three sources of data used to plot the flight 
didn't show the same path. Two tracks showed the radar-jamming jet 
flying through a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who presented 11 days of testimony, questioned  
several witnesses about whether Ashby violated flight rules by not 
using a ``hot mike,'' a voice-operated system that allows the pilot 
to talk to his crew without pressing the mike button. 
</P>
<P>
	But air crash investigator Jeff Edwards testified Monday that  
the hot mike wasn't reliable and that the pilot could turn it off 
and easily press the mike button. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said his review of tests showed the jet's radar  
altimeter wasn't functioning. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a member of the Marine investigation board  
testified that Ashby's superiors didn't provide all the navigation 
information he needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct of the flight with what was available to the air  
crew was very reasonable,'' said Col. Thomas Blickensderfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ashby was reckless and violated the mission's  
517-mph speed limit and 2,000-foot altitude restriction. His jet 
cut the cable about 370 feet above the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said he thought the altitude restriction was 1,000 feet  
and claims he was unaware of a speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys also contend that Ashby's map didn't have the  
gondola marked on it, his radar altitude gauge malfunctioned and 
that he suffered from an optical illusion that made him think he 
was flying higher than he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, faces similar  
charges and a separate court-martial.

<HEADLINE> Bush Expected To Announce Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush says forming a  
presidential exploratory committee would allow him to assess the 
national political mood and, most important, to raise money should 
he decide to seek the White House next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he's been considering the race for months, Bush said  
Monday there still would be work for an exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be interesting to see what the different politics are  
around the country. But raising money is the most important aspect 
of an exploratory committee,'' the Republican governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	An adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Bush  
was expected to reveal his plans to form a presidential exploratory 
committee today, with an afternoon briefing planned for Texas 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator whose low-budget  
campaigns shocked the Republican establishment in 1992 and 1996, 
opened his third presidential race today in Manchester, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he won't talk about other candidates until he  
enters the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush attended a lunch Monday at which Republicans from other  
states encouraged him to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``My gut feeling is that he's going to run. I hope that's not  
just wishful thinking,'' said North Carolina Senate GOP leader 
Patrick Ballantine. 
</P>
<P>
	David Wilkins, speaker of the South Carolina House, gave Bush a  
letter signed by 59 of the state's 66 Republican House members 
urging him to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut House GOP leader Bob Ward said 90 percent of the  
Republican legislators in his state had signed a letter asking Bush 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he's raised no funds, although he has held a series of  
meetings with fund-raising and policy experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have said they're interested. They're just waiting to  
see what decision I make,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't discuss specifics, including whether he would accept  
federal matching funds for a campaign.

<HEADLINE>  Cepeda, Maz Hope Hall Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For years, Orlando Cepeda enjoyed playing in a  
lineup with Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Juan Marichal. 
</P>
<P>
	Today he's hoping to join his former teammates in the Hall of  
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, Bill Mazeroski and former manager Dick Williams are  
expected to attract the most attention when the Veterans Committee 
holds its annual vote in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Results are to be announced at 2 p.m. EST. Either Cepeda or  
Mazeroski can be picked, but not both of them -- and perhaps 
neither. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to get very nervous,'' Cepeda said last week  
from his California home. ``I've been waiting so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dom DiMaggio and umpires Doug Harvey and Nestor Chylak also will  
be among the top candidates, as will turn-of-the-century manager 
Frank Selee. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a special adviser to the New York Yankees, was at  
their spring training camp Monday, about 10 minutes from where the 
Vets were to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't control it, so I don't worry about it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, Stan Musial and Yogi Berra are on the panel, down  
to 12 members this year from its normal 15. It will take 75 percent 
-- nine votes -- for election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vets can pick up to four new Hall of Famers, one from each  
of four categories. 
</P>
<P>
	The categories are: former major leaguers, Negro leaguers, 19th  
century players and personnel, plus a composite of managers, 
umpires, executives and Negro leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Negro leagues stars Smokey Joe Williams, Biz Mackey and Turkey  
Stearnes each drew support in last year's vote. The committee chose 
Larry Doby, Lee MacPhail, ``Bullet'' Joe Rogan and ``Gorgeous'' 
George Davis last March. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies will be held July 25 at Cooperstown, N.Y.  
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were elected in January by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda was the NL's rookie of the year in 1958 with San  
Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. Nicknamed the Baby Bull and Cha-Cha, he hit .297 with 379 
home runs and 1,365 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	His 379 homers tie him with Tony Perez, a slugger often  
overshadowed by teammates such as Pete Rose, Johnny Bench and Joe 
Morgan. Like Cepeda, Perez has not been elected to the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Tony made everybody great,'' Cepeda said. ``He was a  
magnificent player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election  
five years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last 
year in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope this time I make it,'' said Cepeda, a community  
relations representative for the San Francisco Giants. ``It would 
be the highest thing. It's hard to describe how much it would 
mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski batted just .260 with 138 homers and 853 RBIs for  
Pittsburgh, but hit one of the most famous home runs ever -- a 
bottom-of-the-ninth shot in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series to beat 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski made his mark in the field, winning eight Gold Gloves  
and taking part in 1,706 double plays, most in history among major 
league second basemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they consider defense, I got a chance,'' said Mazeroski,  
now 62 and working for the Pirates as a spring instructor. ``But if 
they don't, I don't have a chance at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, at 82 the younger brother of Joe, hit .298 in 11  
seasons as an outfielder for the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, Mazeroski and DiMaggio all have strong supporters on the  
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda is endorsed by Marichal and Mazeroski is boosted his  
former Pirates general manager, committee chairman Joe Brown. 
DiMaggio is supported by Ted Williams, his longtime teammate on the 
Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans panel is down to 12 because of the retirement of  
longtime executive Buzzie Bavasi and the health of writer Leonard 
Koppett and Hall of Fame shortstop Pee Wee Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Williams has gotten support in the past. He was 1,571-1,451  
(.520) with Boston, Oakland, California, Montreal, San Diego and 
Seattle and went to the four World Series, winning two of them.

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks Is No Hit for Padres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- First things first for Garth Brooks.  
</P>
<P>
	``You might want to get a helmet,'' San Diego Padres manager  
Bruce Bochy told the country singer as he headed out for his only 
at-bat in the club's intrasquad game on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Five pitches later, Brooks was back in the dugout, apologizing  
to his teammates for striking out on a neck-high fastball from 
non-roster right-hander Salvador Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't deliver a hit, but he at least knew what was going on  
out there. He even managed a couple of foul balls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was cool,'' Brooks said a few hours later, when most of his  
teammates were long gone for the day, but he was still in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess four out of the five pitches I was proud of. The last  
one I wasn't. That's the one I'll remember. I was there. That's why 
I was apologizing to my teammates. The guy on first has to be moved 
over and it was my job to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After whiffing, Brooks tapped the front of his helmet with his  
bat and motioned toward Rodriguez, 24, who played in the Mexican 
Leagues last year, as if to say, ``Nice job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Brooks got back to the dugout ``he said he was sorry,''  
said scout Jeff Gardner, who was managing Brooks' team. ``He's such 
a good guy. He honestly feels like he let us down by striking 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heck, Brooks even apologized to reporters later on.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew what I was doing. He just brought it a little harder  
than he did the first one,'' said Brooks, who's in camp on a 
non-roster basis to live out his fantasy and help kick-start his 
baseball-related charitable foundation. ``He bettered me. He shook 
it off twice, so I knew he was coming with something I hadn't seen. 
I'm sorry guys, I apologize to you, too. I don't know what the hell 
I was thinking. It was clearly a ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he makes a mistake in batting practice, Brooks usually  
tells pitchers, ``Pretty pitch,'' ``I'm sorry'' or ``My fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was his first real game situation. Brooks tried to take  
Rodriguez's second pitch to right field, but fouled it into the 
screen covering the first-base dugout. He hit a weak foul ball down 
the third-base line, then took ball one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not proud of the statistic, but I am proud of the  
at-bat,'' said Brooks, who admitted he'd be thinking about it for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be my hardest part of the game right here.  
Because if every at-bat I remember as well as this one, I'm never 
going to get to the next one. I got to let it go. It's hard for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bochy: ``I didn't expect any more. Actually there was a  
pretty good slider, and he made contact to stay alive there. He 
probably wish he would have taken a swing at the first pitch (a 
called strike). But he had a couple swings in. A lot of hitters 
were overmatched today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks did better with his glove, cleanly handling his only  
chance in left field -- a single by Gary Matthews Jr. Brooks even 
hit the cutoff man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real glad that my one field thing wasn't an error,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy said Brooks would likely see action in B games and split  
squad games, and might play in some minor-league games so he'd get 
4-to-5 at-bats in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said he'd love to bat against intimidating lefty Randy  
Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might as well go against the best,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> US Wins Vitamin Price Fixing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Swiss vitamin manufacturer and five U.S.  
executives have agreed to plead guilty to participating in a 
worldwide conspiracy to fix the prices of vitamins, the Justice 
Department announced Tuesday. The company agreed to pay a $10.5 
million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation, Lonza AG, was charged in previously sealed  
court documents with scheming to fix the prices and allocate the 
sales of vitamin B3, also known as niacin and niacinamide, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five executives were charged Tuesday with plotting to fix  
prices and allocate customers and sales of vitamin B4, also known 
as choline chloride. 
</P>
<P>
	Both vitamins are used to enrich human and animal nutritional  
products and are sold around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	These were the first cases made public from the antitrust  
division's investigation of the vitamin industry. Both the company 
and the executives agreed to cooperate in the continuing probe, 
which is centered in Dallas, where the charges were filed in U.S. 
District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cooperation of these defendants, in combination with  
information being provided by others who are cooperating, will 
substantially advance the division's investigation of international 
cartels in the vitamin industry worldwide,'' said Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General Gary R. Spratling. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the latest in a series of international price-fixing  
cases brought by the division in recent years, including 
prosecutions in the food and animal feed additives industry which 
obtained record fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``These charged are the latest example of the antitrust  
division's commitment to prosecuting international cartels that 
increase prices for American consumers,'' said Assistant Attorney 
General Joel I. Klein. ``Our investigation into worldwide 
conspiracies involving vitamins is continuing. Those conspiracies 
have affected billions of dollars of commerce in products found in 
nearly every American household.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One count was filed Tuesday against each of the following:  
</P>
<P>
	--John Kennedy, vice president of sales and marketing, Chinook  
Group Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Chinook Group Ltd., a Canadian 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	--Robert Samuelson, sales manager, Chinook Group Inc.  
</P>
<P>
	--Lindell Hilling, former president, DuCoa L.P.  
</P>
<P>
	--J.L. ``Pete'' Fischer, president, basic and international  
products, DuCoa L.P. 
</P>
<P>
	--Antonio Felix, vice president, basic and international  
products, DuCoa L.P. 
</P>
<P>
	Each was charged with scheming with unnamed co-conspirators to  
eliminate competition in the choline chloride market in this 
country and elsewhere between at least January 1988 through Sept. 
29, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Each man is charged with agreeing to set prices, rig bids,  
allocate customers, divide world markets, and monitor and enforce 
the agreed-upon prices and market shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lonza case, filed under seal last Sept. 30 and unsealed  
Monday, charged that Lonza executives agreed with the world's other 
major vitamin B3 firms to eliminate competition here and elsewhere 
at least from January 1992 until March 1998. Specifically, the 
company was accused of agreeing to set prices, allocate sales 
volume between competitors and enforce these agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	All the defendants were charged with violating the Sherman Act,  
which carries a top penalty of $10 million for corporations and 
three years in prison and a $350,000 fine for individuals. The 
maximum fine for both may be increased to twice the gain derived 
from the crime or twice the loss suffered by victims, if those 
amounts are greater than the stated maximum fine.

<HEADLINE> MasterCard Extends Sponsorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- MasterCard International extended its  
official sponsorship of the World Cup soccer tournament through 
2002 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	MasterCard, which has been involved with FIFA, the world  
organizing body for the sport, and the World Cup since 1990, also 
said it had extended its agreement with Pele as spokesman for the 
credit card group. Pele, considered the greatest player in soccer 
history, began working with MasterCard in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	An official sponsorship for the World Cup, which is the the  
world's most popular sports event and is held every four years, 
costs nearly $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A marketing source familiar with World Cup sponsorships told The  
Associated Press that MasterCard is likely to spend $130 million 
through the next three years, including what member banks spend, in 
leveraging the 2002 sponsorship. That's about $30 million more than 
MasterCard committed to the 1998 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most popular sport and largest sports event in the  
world, and we are a large global brand,'' said Mava Heffler, senior 
vice president of global promotions and sponsorship for MasterCard. 
``It is a good marriage overall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heffler said the staging of the 2002 tournament in South Korea  
and Japan works well for MasterCard, which has a strong presence in 
Asia through its member banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we look at the business and where the growth is coming  
from, the whole Asia-Pacific region is important to us,'' Heffler 
said. ``Japan and South Korea are two very key markets, as are Hong 
Kong, Taiwan and Australia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer's global ambassador, Pele will be conducting clinics and  
making appearances for MasterCard throughout the world in the 
buildup toward 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pele is a global brand in every sense of the word,'' Heffler  
said.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Boston Killer Confesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A few weeks before Charles Pierce died, the  
convicted child killer summoned authorities to the state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they arrived, the former carnival worker confessed to  
killing two more children in Lawrence, Mass., more than 40 years 
ago. During an almost two-hour interview, in which he sometimes 
fell asleep or became confused, Pierce provided the location of 
where the children's bodies could be found and other details about 
the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite Pierce's confession, authorities aren't sure if they  
can finally close the book on two missing persons cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could be lying to us, but you can't just write it off,''  
police Capt. Mike Molchan, who interviewed Pierce, said Monday. 
``We need to get answers first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answers are proving to be elusive, mainly because missing  
persons' records in Lawrence date back only to the 1970s, said 
Molchan. In addition, some details don't correspond to Pierce's 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce, serving time for killing a 13-year-old girl in 1969, was  
cancer-stricken and wheelchair-bound when he asked a corrections 
officer to bring the police in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told one of the guards he wanted to clear his conscience,''  
Molchan said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Pierce relied on an oxygen tank, he told police a horrific  
story of how he allegedly killed a boy he had befriended at an old 
theater and buried the child's body in a nearby field. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce also said that sometime in the eight months prior to that  
killing, he had abducted a girl in Connecticut, murdered her and 
buried her body in the same field, about 30 feet from the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce gave vague directions to the field, leading investigators  
to what is now a ball field. But before proceeding, police say they 
want to put together some of the many problematic pieces of 
Pierce's story. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, while the name of the girl Pierce gave is similar  
to the name of a girl who did disappear in Connecticut, that 
abduction happened in the early 1970s -- not in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	To confuse matters further, Pierce had a history of confessing  
to things and later recanting. When Connecticut authorities showed 
up at prison to ask him about his statements to Molchan, Pierce 
allegedly became agitated and denied the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, police said, they'll dig through old newspaper  
articles, interview Pierce's acquaintances and hope the case sparks 
someone's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll depend on old-timers,'' Molchan said. ``It is a very  
cold case.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Renews 12 Shows for Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pushing up Hollywood's traditional timetable,  
CBS announced Tuesday that 12 of its prime-time series will return 
in the fall and that it will immediately begin selling advertising 
time on them. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's entire Monday night schedule of comedies and its three  
newsmagazines were included in the early renewal announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	TV networks usually announce their fall schedules in May,  
touching off a scramble by advertisers to place orders for millions 
of dollars worth of commercial time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we are sort of laying down the gauntlet that we  
will be stable,'' said Leslie Moonves, president and chief 
executive of CBS Television. ``It will say to our affiliates and 
advertisers that we're ready for next season. Why wait until May 
when we know where we are going?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shows that will definitely return are ``Cosby,'' ``King of  
Queens,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Becker,'' ``JAG,'' ``60 
Minutes,'' ``60 Minutes II,'' ``Touched By an Angel,'' ``Kids Say 
the Darndest Things,'' ``Nash Bridges,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``Candid 
Camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others existing shows will probably join them on the renewal  
list, but CBS can't announce them yet for contractual reasons, 
Moonves said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, NBC has said that seven of its shows will definitely  
return next fall: ``ER,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Friends,'' ``Dateline 
NBC,'' ``Just Shoot Me, ``Law and Order'' and ``3rd Rock From the 
Sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has already renewed ``The PJ's,'' ``That '70s Show'' and  
``Beverly Hills 90210.'' ABC, the WB and UPN have not announced any 
series renewals for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves said he expects advertisers to jump at the chance to  
place advertising orders for CBS's hottest shows, like the comedy 
``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa questioned the  
strategy, saying it would limit a network's chances to sell ad 
packages. Networks sometimes require advertisers to buy ads on new 
or lower-rated shows if they want to get a slot on a hit show like 
``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem short-sighted to sell their shows alone without  
using them as bait to get people to your new shows,'' Sassa said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's announcement is another indication that the traditional  
calendar for television seasons is slowly breaking down. Networks 
are more frequently premiering new programs outside of September, 
when the fall season usually starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves said CBS is likely to have the fewest number of new  
shows next fall than it has had in years. He said he was startled 
to see the number of pilots in development set in high schools or 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be such an obsession with teen-agers and  
animation that we're not going to go there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Private Ohio Prison Settles Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- About 1,900 inmates in Ohio's only private  
prison would split $1.65 million under a settlement of their 
lawsuit that claimed guards used excessive force and that the 
facility improperly housed maximum-security prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, reached Monday in federal court in Akron, also  
calls for the prison's owner, Corrections Corporation of America, 
to pay $130,000 a year to hire a monitor to oversee the facility in 
Youngstown. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge must approve the settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty happy. When you balance it all out, it's a pretty  
fair settlement because it ensures permanent reform to make the 
prison safe and provide adequate medical care,'' said Alphonse 
Gerhardstein, the attorney representing the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	CCA, based in Nashville, Tenn., denied wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	Three inmates sued CCA in August 1997, claiming the 3-month-old  
Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, which was built to handle 
medium-security inmates, was unsafe and that medical treatment was 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	After the lawsuit became a class action, two inmates were killed  
by fellow prisoners. A Justice Department report said staff members 
had used ``unnecessarily harsh and humiliating procedures'' during 
inmate searches after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer the prison made several security and personnel  
changes after six inmates escaped. Their breakout prompted a series 
of legislative hearings and a proposal to ban maximum-security 
inmates at private prisons in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison also transferred out 803 inmates that were  
reclassified maximum security, according to Youngstown Mayor George 
McKelvey.

<HEADLINE> 3 Strains Involved in Strep Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELGIN, Ill. (AP) -- Three different strains of the strep A  
bacteria are being blamed for separate clusters of infections that 
have killed six Chicago-area residents and sickened at least seven 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims include an 18-month-old boy, a man in his 40s who  
died of necrotizing fasciitis -- sometimes called the ``flesh-eating 
bacteria'' -- and a 90-year-old man who died of toxic shock 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who died in Kane County, west of Chicago, was considered a  
suspected seventh case but not yet confirmed Monday, said Tom 
Schafer, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials on Monday were investigating possible links  
between the cases -- all from group A strep -- but state officials 
downplayed that possibility. Officials said it was virtually 
impossible for all 13 cases to be linked, but it's possible some of 
them are linked to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	While such geographic clusters are unusual, experts don't really  
understand why, said Carl Langkop, chief of communicable diseases 
for the Illinois Department of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Group A strep strains most often lead to strep throat, but  
virulent strains can get into a person's bloodstream, muscle tissue 
or organs and develop into a more serious infection -- especially 
for people with weakened immune systems or other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strep is in the community all the time, causing infections,''  
Dr. Stanford Schulman, chief of infectious diseases at Children's 
Memorial Hospital. ``What's unpredictable are these cases of 
invasive strep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frequent and thorough hand-washing can help prevent transmission  
of the bacteria, which are spread by contact with nasal or throat 
secretions from an infected person or by contact with an infected 
wound or skin sore. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 to 15,000 people in the United States develop the  
illness each year, and about 2,000 die, according to the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

<HEADLINE> NBC Declares Victory in Feb. Sweeps / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC has come out on top during the crucial  
February ``sweeps'' period, helped by the strength of its Thursday 
night schedule and popular miniseries like ``The '60s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's interview of Monica Lewinsky by Barbara Walters on ABC  
isn't expected to change the standings even though it is counted 
for sweeps, a key ratings period used to set local advertising 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's victory came despite losing last week's prime-time ratings  
race to CBS, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Through Sunday night, NBC had a 10.1 rating and 16 share for the  
month, CBS was second at 9.8 and 16, ABC had an 8.2 and 13, Fox had 
a 7.1 and 11, the WB had a 3.5 and 5 and UPN was at 2.1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa said the surge in  
viewership on certain nights over the last few weeks was good news 
for all networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you provide good programming, you can certainly increase  
the network shares,'' he said. ``We think the networks are really 
in a good position right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS Television,  
congratulated NBC but also took a swipe at his competitor, saying 
NBC relied on a ``great amount of stunting'' to win sweeps. He 
referred to the successful miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa said NBC, unlike CBS, stuck to the schedule it set at the  
start of the year and didn't rely on any last-minute 
reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC and Fox were both down in comparison with November sweeps,  
but that could change for ABC. ``It ain't over until the intern 
sings,'' quipped ABC Entertainment President Stu Bloomberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Big events proved successful for the networks last week. CBS's  
airing of the Grammy Awards, while down slightly from last year, 
was the fourth most-watched show of the week behind the NBC 
Thursday night troika of ``ER,'' ``Frasier'' and ``Friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part one of NBC's ``Alice in Wonderland'' finished sixth for the  
week for NBC, although its ratings couldn't quite match the level 
of last May's ``Merlin.'' ABC was successful with its Sonny and 
Cher TV movie, ``And the Beat Goes On,'' and CBS hit with ``Too 
Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 10.6 rating and 17 share, the highest  
weekly rating for a network this year excluding Super Bowl week. 
NBC had a 10.0 and 16, ABC had an 8.2 and 13 and Fox had a 7.6 and 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 3.5 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 1.9 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' dominated the evening news competition  
with a 9.0 rating and 18 share, its widest margin over CBS in 
nearly two years and over ABC in one year. ABC's ``World News 
Tonight'' had an 8.1 rating and 16 share and the ``CBS Evening 
News'' was at 7.5 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 22-28, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 20.2; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 17.7; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 17.6; ``The Grammy Awards,'' CBS, 16.6; 
``Jesse,'' NBC, 15.0; ``NBC Sunday Night Movie: Alice in 
Wonderland,'' NBC, 14.8; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 14.3; 
``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 14.2; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.1; 
``Home Improvement,'' ABC, 12.9.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Moves Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures moved sharply higher Tuesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, giving corn and soybeans a lift, on 
forecasts for below-normal temperatures this weekend in major 
winter-wheat growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat continued its rally that began a day earlier on new export  
business as the National Weather Service and private forecasters 
predicted freezing temperatures in the next few days across the 
Midwest and Plains states, setting up the potential for damage to 
crops that account for nearly 75 percent of the nation's total 
wheat production. 
</P>
<P>
	Warmer weather has helped some of the crop emerge early from the  
ground, leaving a larger portion vulnerable to late-season frosts 
because of a lack of insulating ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat advanced on Monday as market participants eyed an improved  
outlook -- at least in the near-term -- for export business. Egypt 
over the weekend made a large purchase, while Pakistan was 
considering buying from either the United States, Australia or 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans benefited from heavy fund house buying as  
investors rushed to cover positions following Monday's unexpectedly 
strong rally. Soybeans advanced after the government reported 
export inspections jumped 14 percents last week, although market 
participants expected gains to be limited today on reports of 
increased exports from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery rose 9 cents to $2.63 3/4 a bushel; May corn  
rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.15 3/4 a bushel; May oats fell 1 cent to $1.05 1/4 a 
bushel; May soybeans rose 8 1/2 cents to $4.71 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, pressured by weak cash market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell .55 cent to 67.70 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .55 cent to 73.40 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .42 cent to 43.05 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 1.30 
cents to 47.77 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> 3 Withdraw From Grand Prix Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Injuries have wiped out the Canadian figure  
skating team for the Grand Prix final this week in St. Petersburg, 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the International Skating Union issued a medical bye  
to three-time world champion Elvis Stojko, who has been 
recuperating from a groin injury since the Nagano Olympics last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Figure Skating Association withdrew seven-time  
Canadian champion dancers Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz. 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko competed in the Four Continents event, but two tough  
back-to-back competitions would have aggravated the injury. Stojko 
worried 
</P>
<P>
	the extra wear on his body would have caused him to lose  
training time before the world championships later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko lost several days of training after January's Canadian  
championships because of leg tightness. 
</P>
<P>
	Bourne tore cartilage in her left knee during a freak practice  
accident before the Canadian championship. She was still in pain at 
the Four Continents event last week in Halifax, where she and 
Kraatz won the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning, Bourne said her knee felt tender. Bourne said she  
did not want to jeopardize their chances at the world championships 
in Helsinki. After that, she needs arthroscopic surgery, which will 
be followed by three to four weeks of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Bourne and Kraatz won the Grand Prix final in 1997, when the  
event was called the Champions Series final.

<HEADLINE> Injured Violinist Awarded $29.6M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Four years after an awful day that changed her  
life, a jury decided that prize-winning violinist Rachel Barton was 
due $29.6 million for the train accident that cost her a leg and 
part of a foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, 24, was dragged 366 feet down the tracks from a suburban  
Winnetka commuter platform after the strap of her violin case 
caught in a closing door in 1995. She sued Metra, the commuter rail 
agency, and the Chicago and Northwestern Transportation Co., now 
owned by Union Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton claimed that the strap pinned her. Railroad attorneys  
said she kept on clutching the strap because her 200-year-old Amati 
violin was worth $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton said it's time to move on.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, as it was in the beginning of this terrible  
journey, I hope to be known for my music and not my injuries,'' she 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad attorney C. Barry Montgomery said the award was far too  
high. 
</P>
<P>
	``People relate to the Michael Jordans of the world and the  
enormous amounts being spent in the movie industry and when that 
carries over into the jury box, that is a serious thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery also said that the jurors -- some of whom hugged  
Barton and kissed her on the cheek as they left the courthouse -- 
seemed to be swayed by sympathy for her condition rather than the 
facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, who uses crutches or a wheelchair and has a prosthetic  
left leg, told jurors, ``I'm just one big Frankenstein monster,'' 
in describing her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, Barton attorney Robert Clifford called the  
accident ``an event waiting to happen.'' He pointed to 14 riders 
who have been pinned between train doors in similar circumstances 
over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad attorneys noted that none of the 14 were seriously  
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton in 1992 became the first American and the youngest person  
ever to win first prize in the Bach Competition in Leipzig, 
Germany. She was the only American laureate of the 1993 Queen 
Elizabeth Competition in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	She also has performed with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and  
the Chicago Lyric Opera Orchestra.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Renew Posada's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Jorge Posada felt the pinch following  
arbitration victories by teammates, with the New York Yankees 
deciding Tuesday to renew the catcher's contract at $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very disappointing it came to this. There's nothing I  
could do,'' said Posada, who made $250,000 last year. ``They were 
only thinking about what I made last year and not my contributions 
to the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Posada hit .268 with 17 homers and 63 RBIs in 111 games last  
season. He is expected to see additional playing this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that, basically, Jorge is a major  
contributor to this championship and you would think they would 
treat him a little bit better,'' said Posada's agent, Alan Nero. 
``The system doesn't provide for that. It's disappointing -- but you 
know what -- we're just going to go out and play ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees' payroll swelled to $88 million following  
arbitration victories by shortstop Derek Jeter ($5 million) and 
closer Mariano Rivera ($4.25 million) and the acquisition of 
five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens from Toronto last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly affects it to some degree. It's the domino  
affect,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. ``Everything 
has an impact on everything. Is it fair or not fair? It's not for 
me to say. The bottom line, we looked at the system and this is the 
number we came up with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said the Yankees overpaid -- by industry standards -- last  
year when they renewed Jeter and Rivera at $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``350 is not a number that's extraordinary low and, also in  
fairness, not extraordinary high either,'' Cashman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said he will talk with Posada, but  
doesn't expect the renewal to have a negative impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way you can approach it is, my time will come,''  
Torre said. ``There's too much at stake for it to play a part when 
you consider what the numbers are and what they will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees did reach agreement on a one-year deal with  
outfielder Ricky Ledee, worth about $203,000. Talks continue with 
the agents for outfielder Shane Spencer and pitcher Ramiro Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also agreed to terms on one-year contracts with  
pitchers Luis DeLosSantos, Ryan Bradley, Mike Jerzembeck and Mike 
Buddie, infielder D'Angelo Jimenez and outfielder Donzell 
McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Right-hander Dan Naulty solidified his position as the top  
contender to fill the bullpen spot vacated by Graeme Lloyd with two 
perfect intrasquad innings. Naulty struck out Paul O'Neill, the 
only left-hander he faced, on a called third strike. ``We'll 
definitely take a good long look at him,'' Torre said. ... Torre 
was impressed with Hideki Irabu, who had a lengthy 19-minute 
bullpen session. Irabu struggled with his curveball, but ended the 
workout with five consecutive knee-high fastballs. ... Ledee, one 
of four candidates to start in left, will get some playing time in 
center this spring. ... Jeff Nelson, Mike Stanton and Rivera will 
follow starter Orlando Hernandez in Thursday's exhibition opener 
against Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 47 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An early stock rally developed some traction by  
midday, sending major indexes higher as the bond market improved 
and Hewlett-Packard shot higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
47.27 at 9,372.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher after wobbling a bit  
earlier in the day. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 9.57 at 
1,245.73, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 
21.14 at 2,316.32. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was up 19/32 point, with its yield,  
which falls when prices rise, trading at 5.62 percent, down from 
5.67 percent late Monday. Bonds were shoring up a big loss Monday 
spurred by reports showing that the economy is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets got more confirmation of that this morning with two  
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a New York private research group,  
reported today that its index of future economic activity rose 0.5 
percent to 106.9 in January from a revised level of 106.4 in 
December, pushed up in part by rising stock prices. The rise 
signalled that the U.S. economy will continue growing through at 
least mid-year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly better than the 0.4 percent increase  
economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the U.S. Commerce Department said new home  
sales slipped for the second consecutive month in January. They 
were down 5 percent from December, but nevertheless remained 
exceptionally strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, ``bonds are breathing a little easier here,'' said  
Michael Clark, head of block trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, 
``and Hewlett-Packard is up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The computer maker's shares were up 7 1/4 at 73 1/8, after it  
announced that it would divide itself into two separate publicly 
held companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 314 million shares, 
up slightly from Monday's pace of 302.1 million on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Hewlett-Packard's gain, technology shares were mixed  
after Micron Electronics Inc. said it expects earnings for the 
second quarter to be below those of the first quarter because of 
slower-than-expected personal computer sales. Micron Electronics' 
shares were down 2 13/32 at 12 1/32 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictions of lower personal-computer sales have rattled  
technology stocks for several sessions. Compaq Computer was down 
17/32 at 33 in leading volume on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks climbed on heavy volume after Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.  
boosted its rating on three carriers. AMR was up 2 5/8 at 58 3/4, UAL was 
up 3 1/4 at 65 1/4, and Continental Airlines was up 1 5/16 at 37 3/8.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Giving Hurricane Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Latin American victims of Hurricane Mitch will  
receive $32 million from the American Red Cross to rebuild drinking 
water and sanitary systems, improve disaster preparedness and 
provide better access to health care, the organization announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional funds bring total American Red Cross  
contributions to Hurricane Mitch relief to $38 million. The total 
International Red Cross contributions will reach an estimated $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The October hurricane killed more than 9,000 people, left more  
than 3 million homeless and destroyed large areas of farm land in 
Latin America, primarily in Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	``Progress is being made'' in the region, said Steve Bullock,  
acting president of the Red Cross who is in Latin America to tour 
the ravaged area. ``But it is a very serious situation that 
requires continued outpouring of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross funds, including $26 million for recovery and  
rebuilding, will be allocated during the next 18 months. Funds are 
earmarked to help move families from overfilled shelters to homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The $32 million was raised by local Red Cross organizations  
across the country specifically for Mitch relief. These funds and 
the initial $6 million are part of an international disaster relief 
fund which is separate from the domestic fund that aids disaster 
victims in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch was the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since 1780. It  
stalled off the east coast last October, dumping record rains on 
Honduras and Nicaragua. The resulting floods were so powerful that 
maps must be redrawn to reflect the land's new contours.

<HEADLINE> Accident Delays Reporters in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Reporters left behind in Utah when  
President Clinton cut short a vacation weekend were further delayed 
when one of two press buses struck the wing of their charter flight 
home today. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured when the bus, which was making a turn and  
tried to pull too close to the Miami Air 727 charter jet, struck 
the tip of the left wing with the front right quarter of the 
vehicle. The plane was to take the reporters to Andrews Air Force 
Base in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred around 8:40 a.m., according to Washington  
Post writer Charles Babington, who was on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The passengers) saw it coming,'' he said. ``At the last  
minute, we yelled 'Stop!' and he must have hit it two seconds after 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the slow-moving bus hit the plane, a pane of windshield  
glass broke and scattered onto the tarmac. The crash also caused 
minor damage to the plane's wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Police cars and fire engines responded to the scene within 30  
minutes. There was an immediate scramble to find flights home for 
some two dozen reporters, cameramen, producers, and a handful of 
White House press staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters took group photos in front of the debris before  
another bus arrived to take them across the tarmac to Salt Lake 
City International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporters arranged for a group discount rate on a Delta  
flight to Washington.

<HEADLINE> Fund Taxes Remain a Knotty Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Many people have tried, but nobody has had much  
success in solving a troublesome puzzle posed by taxes on stock 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is what to do about those pesky capital gains  
distributions that funds must make to their investors every year on 
net profits from portfolio investments. 
</P>
<P>
	As many fund investors now doing their income tax returns can  
testify, these distributions come in unpredictable amounts that can 
scramble the best-laid plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite a few fund families have responded to the situation by  
organizing ``tax-efficient'' funds that seek to minimize taxable 
distributions each year. But as one student of the subject told a 
recent audience of financial and investment planners in San Diego, 
even those funds can't get around an obstacle that is built into 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax law doesn't allow that,'' said Mark Hurley, president  
of Undiscovered Managers, a Dallas fund management firm, at the 
annual conference of planners sponsored by Waterhouse Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	If you invest directly in stocks, you usually control when you  
realize profits that incur a capital gains tax. As long as you 
don't sell a winning investment, you postpone the day of reckoning 
with Uncle Sam and keep all your money at work compounding for you. 
</P>
<P>
	When you invest in a fund instead, your give up some of that  
control. To stay exempt from paying taxes themselves, funds are 
required to pass the taxable gains they realize through to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Figuring from estimates by the Investment Company Institute  
trade association, roughly $80 billion in long-term capital gains 
was paid to taxable investors in 1998, on top of more than $90 
billion the year before. Even at the maximum capital-gains tax rate 
of 20 percent, that's a lot of taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
	Experienced investors know that whatever distributions they are  
hit with now reduce their potential future tax liability. In that 
sense, it all balances out eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	But the more you can postpone taxes, the greater the amount you  
can keep working for you until it's time to pay up. ``Investors 
must eventually pay taxes on all their capital gains,'' said 
Hurley. ``The whole key is when you pay them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One popular answer to this problem is to pick funds with low  
portfolio turnover, on the reasoning that these funds will cash in 
fewer gains each year. Low turnover is a basic part of the strategy 
employed at most ``tax-efficient'' funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Think for a moment, though, about what happens in a fund where  
few or no gains are realized over several years of a strong bull 
market. The fund builds up a large backlog of gains that would 
necessitate big taxable distributions when the investments in 
question are eventually sold. 
</P>
<P>
	So a fund that has a very good past record of tax efficiency may  
be one of the worst choices tax-conscious investors could make to 
buy today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax efficiency of a mutual fund is not static,'' Hurley  
points out. ``Each mutual fund has a tax life cycle that 
substantially benefits some shareholders and disadvantages 
others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What to do about all this? As complicated as the problem may be,  
it leaves room for some simple solutions. Above all, it needs to be 
kept in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	You can dodge the whole issue of taxable distributions entirely  
if you invest through a tax-deferred savings vehicle such as an 
individual retirement account or employer-sponsored 401(k) plan. In 
these accounts, no tax is levied until you take withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
	As for your taxable fund investments, once you have a field of  
good funds to choose among, you can aim to minimize your tax 
headaches by looking for funds that have few embedded gains they 
might realize soon. Example: A new fund run by an established 
manager. Or a newly organized index fund, rather than one in the 
same family that has been operating for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Always remember, Hurley added, ``if you don't have good pretax  
returns you will never have good aftertax returns.'' In other 
words, if you focus too much on taxes without making a good 
fundamental investment choice in the first place, you may wind up 
having few gains to worry about.

<HEADLINE> Payton's Condition Stabilizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The condition of ailing Chicago Bears great  
Walter Payton has stabilized and he is sleeping better, an aide 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame running back, the NFL's all-time leading  
rusher, had been experiencing increased fatigue and nausea at 
mealtime until last week when his condition ``leveled off,'' said 
Ginny Quirk, vice president of Walter Payton Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has stabilized, the doctors gave us official word of that  
Thursday,'' she said. She said Payton continues to live in his 
South Barrington home and has had less trouble sleeping lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton is suffering from a rare liver disease and needs a  
transplant. A number of friends have offered their planes to fly 
him to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., on an emergency basis 
when a liver is available.

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising stock prices and an increase in orders at  
the nation's factories carried a key gauge of future economic 
activity higher in January, signaling that the U.S. economy will 
continue to thrive through at least the middle of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the gain in the Index of Leading Economic and a  
separate government report of robust home sales showed that the 
economy remains very healthy, some analysts warned that its rate of 
growth may slow in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private research group, reported Tuesday  
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.5 percent to 
106.9 in January from a revised level of 106.4 in December and 
106.2 in November. The results were slightly better than the 0.4 
percent increase economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the leading index posting three consecutive sharp  
increases, the U.S. economy does not seem to be ready to settle 
down much from the fast pace of growth it experienced in 1998,'' 
said Michael Boldin, senior economist with the Conference Board. 
``Over the past six months, the index has increased 1.2 percent, 
which is far above its historical average, and the prospects for 
growth in income and employment are very bright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that although new  
home sales slipped for the second straight month in January, they 
nonetheless were very strong. Americans bought new homes at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 918,000, down 5 percent from 
966,000 in December and more than 1 million in November. 
</P>
<P>
	With mortgage rates remaining under 7 percent and jobs  
plentiful, at least so far this year, most economists expect robust 
new home sales in 1999, but not quite as strong as the record 
887,000 for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists found signs in both reports that the economy's recent  
fast rate of growth would decline in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Maury N. Harris, chief economist with PaineWebber Inc. said the  
jump in leading indicators and the continued strength in housing 
sales were the predicted results of last fall's slumping dollar and 
declines in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that in February, March and April they're going to  
cool off because the dollar is back up and so are interest rates,'' 
he said, referring to a recent increase in mortgage rates. The 
average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose last 
week for the fourth straight week to 6.89 percent, the highest 
level since mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 10 leading indicators that make up the Conference  
Board's index rose in January. Leading the way were increases in 
prices of 500 common stocks and manufacturers' orders of 
non-defense capital goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole area of decline was in the average factory work week.  
However, the National Association of Purchasing Management, which 
tracks the health of the nation's factories, reported Monday that 
manufacturing strengthened in February, so the one laggard in the 
January indicators might see an improvement in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indicators index is designed to forecast economic  
activity six to nine months in advance. It operates from a base of 
100, set in 1992. First calculated in the late 1960s, it is 
periodically fine-tuned and figures from past years are revised.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Support for Tax Cuts Soft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The idea of a tax cut appeals to half of  
America as Congress considers how to spend the budget surplus, but 
that support may be soft. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll conducted for The Associated Press by ICR of Media,  
Pa., 49 percent of American adults said a tax cut is the best use 
for the surplus left after Congress sets aside a large share for 
Social Security. An additional 35 percent chose making payments on 
the national debt, while 13 percent chose spending more on 
government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But by a small margin, people say they trust President Clinton  
rather than Republicans in Congress, to make decisions about the 
surplus. Clinton favors boosting spending for selected programs 
rather than across-the-board tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	And nearly half of those surveyed said education should be the  
top priority if money is earmarked for programs instead of tax 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Another poll, by the Pew Research Center, indicated similar  
support for tax cuts over generic program increases. But when 
respondents were asked to choose tax cuts or extra money for such 
things as education and health care, support for tax cuts dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings suggest that the party that does the best job  
framing the surplus debate may end up with public opinion on its 
side. Both sides have agreed to spend more than half of the 
expected surplus to bolster Social Security. Many Republicans favor 
using much of the rest for tax cuts, while President Clinton wants 
to spend it on Medicare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Caught in the middle of this tug of war are people like John  
Niederer, who considered the surplus while downing his lunch 
recently at Ernie's Texas Lunch in Gettysburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see them pay off the national debt,'' the  
50-year-old insurance agent said. ``I would rather my two hundred, 
three hundred or four hundred dollars go to that. I don't want to 
see too much spent on new programs, maybe something for education 
and public safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If some of the surplus is spent on new programs, nearly half in  
the AP Poll said education should be the top priority, while a 
third of respondents chose health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Health and education are my personal choices,'' said dentist  
Eli Shuman of Englewood, N.J., who was in Gettysburg to tour the 
famous Civil War battlefield. ``Spending more money on defense is 
ridiculous. We've got too many colonels, too many officers. We 
don't know where to put them anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half thought the economy would stay strong in the  
coming years, bringing even larger surpluses for the two parties to 
spar over. That continues a trend from recent polls, which showed 
Americans are more optimistic now than at any point since the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty hard to take money, put it in the stock market and  
not make more money,'' said 43-year-old antiques dealer Eric 
Shields, as he nursed a beer at a Gettysburg bar. ``Some 
investments go up 20 percent to 30 percent in a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the other side of that issue was barber Greg Deaner, who  
took a few moments from a haircut to worry that the Asian financial 
crisis and other problems could make the surplus short lived. 
</P>
<P>
	By a very narrow margin, respondents said they trust President  
Clinton over Republicans in Congress when it comes to making 
decisions about the budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Gettysburg, one shopper expressed hope that the two  
parties that divided so bitterly over impeachment could now come 
together to try to solve the country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have this dream that they're working together, even though  
everybody says they will not,'' said retiree Gloria Amstine of 
York, Pa. ``I believe they'll have to work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AP Poll of 1,008 adults, taken Feb. 19-24, has a margin of  
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Help With Y2K Glitches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate moved today to help small  
businesses deal with Year 2000 computer crashes as part of a ``Y2K 
Day'' devoted to making people more aware of the problems that 
could arise from computers not prepared for the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	A special Senate panel on the Year 2000 computer problem also  
was releasing a report today detailing widespread disturbances that 
could occur on and after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the report, Sens. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, and  
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., wrote in a letter to their colleagues 
last week that all sectors of the economy ``are at risk, including 
public utilities, health care, telecommunications, transportation, 
banking and finance, commerce and small business and national 
security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One major concern, the report says, is that 90 percent of  
doctors haven't fixed their computers and could temporarily lose 
medical records and smaller hospitals may not be fully prepared for 
possible shutdowns in medical devices such as dialysis machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate planned to spend the afternoon discussing the report,  
which emphasizes that for most people disruptions will be minor -- 
phones will work and planes will keep flying -- but recommends that 
people stock extra food and water in the event of temporary 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and Dodd heard today from representatives of the food  
industry, who gave assurances that they would have adequate food 
supplies on Jan. 1. Michael Heschel of The Kroger Co. said the 
supermarket chain usually has 35-36 days of inventory in its stores 
and ``we believe, therefore, unless there is widespread hoarding or 
excessive stockpiling, Jan. 1, 2000, will be a routine shopping 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 99-0 today on a measure sponsored by Sen.  
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., that would require the Small Business 
Administration to guarantee loans for businesses trying to fix 
their own computers or threatened by the Y2K problems of their 
suppliers, customers or financial institutions. The legislation 
still has to pass in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond expressed concern for the businesses. ``The outlook is not  
good,'' he said. ``Many small companies have not yet begun to 
realize how much of a problem Y2K failures could be for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the noncontroversial legislation, the SBA is expected to  
guarantee about $500 million in loans through the end of the 
program on Dec. 31, 2000. Studies have concluded that up to 750,000 
small businesses could be severely hurt or be forced to shut down 
because of the glitch in many computers that keeps them from 
differentiating between the year 2000 and the year 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and Dodd also were going behind closed doors with other  
senators during the day to discuss Y2K-related national security 
and international issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon, which was explaining its Y2K readiness at a House  
hearing today, insists that its thousands of computer systems will 
be upgraded by the end of the year and there will be contingency 
plans in the event of any malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Of greater concern is the threat of a severe economic blow to  
the countries around the world lagging in their Y2K preparations. 
Russia in particular could face midwinter energy shortages and 
breakdowns in its nuclear power and missile systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday took up a more  
controversial bill, a measure sponsored by Sens. Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah, and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that would limit lawsuits 
arising from Y2K breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has strong backing from the business community, which  
warns that Y2K problems could result in up to $1 trillion in 
lawsuits. U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue told 
the Judiciary Committee that one estimate is that for every dollar 
spent fixing the problem, $2 or $3 will be spent in courts. 
``Obviously, this scenario would be a monumental tragedy for 
American businesses, workers and consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration, backed by trial lawyers, has blocked all  
previous efforts by the GOP-led Congress to reduce punitive damages 
in product liability cases. Assistant Attorney General Eleanor 
Acheson, at the hearing, questioned whether the legislation could 
undercut the incentives for fixing Y2K problems and ``prevent 
businesses and consumers with legitimate claims from vindicating 
their rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would set aside a 90-day ``problem-solving'' period  
allowing companies to remedy problems before lawsuits can be filed. 
It would encourage mediation, limit punitive damages and put some 
restrictions on class-action lawsuits. The Senate Commerce 
Committee is to vote Wednesday on a similar bill sponsored by its 
chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

<HEADLINE> Jets Sign Atwater to $8.3M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Steve Atwater, an eight-time Pro Bowl  
player, already has something to prove with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The former team I played with, I think they felt like I  
couldn't play anymore,'' said Atwater, who signed a three-year, 
$8.3 million contract with the Jets on Tuesday after he was cut by 
the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to show them and show the world that Steve Atwater  
can still play football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hard-hitting, 32-year-old Atwater, entering his 11th NFL  
season, will have plenty of chances as he moves right in at free 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets coach Bill Parcells, who started three players at the  
position during last season's run to the AFC title game -- a 23-10 
loss at Denver -- is a believer. Atwater, who played under Jets 
defensive coordinator Bill Belichick and his staff at last month's 
Pro Bowl, had five tackles in the conference title game, adding a 
crucial forced fumble and a tipped pass that resulted in an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater's deal includes a $1.8 million signing bonus.  
</P>
<P>
	Atwater also was the Broncos' second-leading tackler in Denver's  
34-19 Super Bowl victory over the Atlanta Falcons with seven stops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, along with the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia  
Eagles, also had expressed an interest in landing the coveted free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, if I didn't have full confidence that he was able  
to do what we're asking him to do, he wouldn't be here,'' said 
Parcells, who noted that Atwater saw 96 percent of the Broncos' 
defensive snaps last season. ``You can watch a guy play and know 
what you've got. This guy is involved in heavy traffic most of the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signing came a day after the Jets committed $19.5 million to  
quarterback Vinny Testaverde in a three-year contract extension. 
The club, aggressive as promised during the offseason, also has 
signed quarterback/punter Tom Tupa, tight end Eric Green and 
defensive end Mike Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome Henderson, who started nine games at free safety for the  
Jets last season, was released last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said the Jets are not finished with offseason  
transactions, including potential trades. He did not specify 
players who may be dealt. Only 15 players remain from the roster 
Parcells inherited when he took over the ballclub in February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater, a former Arkansas standout, has played and started in  
155 games, posting 1,301 total tackles, 24 interceptions, 12 forced 
fumbles and nine fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I noticed was guys flying around to the  
ball,'' Atwater said when asked about the Jets. ``That's my 
characteristic. I like coming to the ball, and I like to get there 
full-speed.''

<HEADLINE> Government Calls Intel a Monopolist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Portending a bitter legal struggle, the  
government is outlining its pending antitrust case against Intel 
Corp., the world's largest manufacturer of computer processors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission portrayed Intel as a monopolist  
that bullied at least three other companies until they surrendered 
valuable secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Intel rejected the FTC's characterization, arguing  
that even the government's own expert economist cannot point to any 
rivals harmed by its behavior, which it called ``fundamentally 
fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's lawyers, in legal paperwork made public Monday, called  
the pending case before an administrative law judge ``an assault on 
fundamental antitrust principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Intel and the FTC outlined their legal strategies Monday  
for the company's upcoming hearing, which starts March 9 and is 
expected to last six to 10 weeks. Together with the government's 
antitrust case in nearby federal court against Microsoft Corp., the 
legal actions confront two of the most important companies in the 
nation's technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC alleges that Intel illegally withheld from three  
companies advanced technical information about its upcoming 
microprocessors to ``extort'' valuable technology that the 
companies developed independently. 
</P>
<P>
	It called the company's actions ``a raw exercise of monopoly  
power to muscle competitors into signing over intellectual property 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply competing on the merits was insufficient,'' FTC lawyers  
wrote. ``Intel's victims had no choice but to accede to its 
demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which now owns Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, with $26.2 billion in sales last year, makes processors  
for more than 80 percent of the world's computers and last week 
introduced its fastest chip ever, the Pentium III. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said ``any hope of meaningful challenge'' to Intel's  
dominance relies on other companies developing rival technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 71-page filing that quotes the government's own expert  
economist more than anyone else, Intel did not deny that it 
withheld technical data about upcoming products. 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel contended it was legal for the company to decide which  
secrets to disclose to its customers about its upcoming products. 
That information typically was contained within ``color books'' -- 
with red covers for the most sensitive and yellow covers for less 
important paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel lawyers accused the FTC of trying ``to prevent Intel from  
using its intellectual property to barter in value-for-value 
commercial exchanges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the government's antitrust case comes during a  
period of unprecedented competition facing Intel from rival 
chipmakers, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National 
Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, an industry report showed consumers bought more  
computers in January with AMD processors than Intel -- knocking 
Intel from the No. 1 spot for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any reader of personal computer ads today can readily see that  
Intel faces intense competition,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said the government's own economist, Harvard University  
professor Frederic M. Scherer, found no evidence that innovation in 
the computer industry has suffered. Scherer also is quoted as 
calling Intel's behavior ``unfair'' but agreeing that its actions 
haven't directly affected chip prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Scherer predicted that Intel's efforts on the industry  
will ``unravel over a period of 10 or so years, and it's just too 
early to assess those consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel called that ``not a basis for imposing antitrust  
liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company indicated previously its witnesses will include  
Andrew Grove, Intel's high-profile co-founder and chairman, and 
Craig Barrett, who took over as chief executive officer last year.

<HEADLINE> Impulses May Ease Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Shooting painless electrical impulses into  
muscles through fine needles brought patients modest relief from 
back pain and improved movement, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts not involved in the work cautioned that the patients  
were an unusual group and results may not be applicable to others. 
Even among the 60 subjects, they said, improvements were very 
modest. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, a therapy called PENS (percutaneous electrical  
nerve stimulation) helped patients with chronic low-back pain feel 
better, move better and use less pain-relieving medicine within 
three weeks, researchers reported in today's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Dr. El-sayed Ghoname of the University of  
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	PENS worked better than three other therapies the researchers  
compared it to: using the acupuncture-like needles without 
electricity; stimulating nerves and muscles electrically without 
the needles; and having patients do simple exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Using electrical stimulation without needles -- via electrode  
pads placed on top of the skin -- is called TENS, or transcutaneous 
electrical stimulation. Past studies found TENS provided some 
relief to back-pain patients, the researchers noted. 
</P>
<P>
	PENS uses the same kind of fine needles used in acupuncture with  
tiny amounts of electrical energy pulsing through them. But PENS 
differs in that the needles are inserted only at 10 points on the 
lower back. Acupuncturists often insert needles at various points 
throughout the body. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not include acupuncture.  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said PENS was the only significantly effective  
treatment tried, and all patients received each therapy three-times 
weekly for three weeks, with a one-week rest period between each 
method. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nortin Hadler, a back-pain expert at the University of North  
Carolina School of Medicine, said the subjects were highly unusual 
in that all were relatively young (in their 40s), were not 
overweight and had injuries that were not complicated by 
psychological or job-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with studying such a group,'' Hadler  
said. ``You just have to realize at the outset that whatever their 
findings, it may not generalize to any other group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even among subjects, relief was ``very modest,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another back-pain expert, Dr. Richard Deyo of the University of  
Washington in Seattle, agreed. Deyo also criticized the type of 
exercise studied, a simple bending and straightening, as being 
inadequate by today's standards.

<HEADLINE> White House To Attack Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is withdrawing its  
support from the independent counsel law and intends to urge 
Congress to let the Watergate-inspired statute expire in June, 
according to a senior administration official. 
</P>
<P>
	With both Democrats and Republicans in Congress increasingly  
opposed to the law, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder was 
announcing the administration's reversal before a House Judiciary 
subcommittee chaired by Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., today. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder planned to tell the panel that the law, which provides  
for an independent counsel selected by three judges to investigate 
allegations against several dozen top administration officials, is 
``fundamentally flawed'' and should not be renewed this summer, 
this administration official said Monday night, requesting 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder planned to testify that a study group he chaired  
concluded that the Justice Department is capable of investigating 
and prosecuting most of the officials now covered by the law, the 
senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In rare cases in which there is a genuine conflict of interest,  
the attorney general could use long-standing statutory authority to 
hire a special counsel to conduct an investigation, Holder will 
say, according to the official. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder will cite the use of special counsels appointed by the  
attorney general in several scandals, including Teapot Dome and 
Watergate, as serving the country well, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the Independent Counsel Act directly reverses the  
Clinton administration's stance five years ago, when both President 
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno successfully urged Congress 
to renew the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The new position was developed by the Justice Department task  
force and then cleared with the Office of Management and Budget and 
the White House as acceptable administration policy, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law has never been popular among career Justice Department  
attorneys, many of whom viewed it as calling into question their 
integrity. But the first version was passed in 1978 with bipartisan 
support in Congress, largely in reaction to President Nixon's 
firing five years earlier of special counsel Archibald Cox during 
the Watergate investigation. Cox, who had been appointed by the 
attorney general, was replaced by Leon Jaworski, appointed by 
another attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	In essence, Holder intended to tell the committee that the wrong  
lesson had been drawn from that episode, arguing that Jaworski did 
an effective job and independent investigators appointed by judges 
were not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for the law among Republicans has been eroded by two  
events in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	They objected to the length of Lawrence Walsh's multiyear  
investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan and Bush 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Republicans have groused about Reno's refusal to  
turn over to an independent counsel her department's investigation 
of campaign financing activities of Clinton, Vice President Al Gore 
and other Democrats in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have turned against the law because of the length and  
conduct of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of 
Clinton over the Whitewater affair, his relationship with White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky and several other matters. Starr 
recommended Clinton's impeachment to the House last September. The 
Senate acquitted Clinton last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Justice Department, officials have felt that some of  
the record seven independent counsels sought by Reno over the past 
six years overreached and exceeded their intended mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current law, the attorney general must ask a  
three-judge panel to select an independent counsel if she believes 
there is enough evidence to warrant a full criminal investigation 
of certain top administration officials. The independent prosecutor 
is given an unlimited budget to hire aides and conduct an 
investigation with no time limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno is scheduled to testify on the issue later this month  
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

<HEADLINE> Group Won't Recommend Circumcision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The benefits of circumcising newborns aren't  
significant enough to recommend it as a routine procedure, 
according to the nation's most influential group of pediatricians. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Pediatrics stopped short of advising  
against circumcision, but on Monday recommended for the first time 
that newborns get pain relief for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weight of the evidence would have to be significant for  
the academy to recommend an elective surgical procedure on every 
newborn male, and the evidence is not sufficient for us to make 
such a recommendation,'' said Dr. Carole Lannon, chairwoman of the 
task force that wrote the new policy statement for the academy, 
which has 55,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of circumcision, who say it leaves long-term  
psychological scars and diminishes sexual pleasure, hailed Monday's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what that means is the medical debate is over,'' said  
Ronald Goldman, director of the Circumcision Resource Center, an 
anti-circumcision organization. ``I think circumcision is now an 
ethical issue. It challenges us to empathize with newborn 
infants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how many newborns are circumcised annually is unclear.  
Federal figures show that nearly two-thirds of American boys born 
in 1995 were circumcised, but the pediatrics academy said those 
statistics were taken from too small a sample to be reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy statement, outlined in a report in the March  
issue of Pediatrics, the academy's journal, says parents should 
take into account cultural and religious traditions as well as the 
advice of a pediatrician when considering circumcision. 
</P>
<P>
	In its last policy statement on the issue, in 1989, the academy  
said circumcision has potential medical benefits as well as risks 
and should be carefully explained to parents. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing scientific evidence, the task force did find  
some medical benefits of circumcision: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Boys who have not been circumcised are as much as 12 times  
more likely to get urinary tract infections than those who have 
been circumcised. Uncircumcised boys had a 1-in-100 chance of 
developing such an infection in their first year of life; for 
circumcised boys the chance was 1 in 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Some evidence shows penile cancer is more prevalent among  
uncircumcised males. But the disease is so rare, striking just 1 in 
100,000 American males a year, that the researchers found any added 
risk insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said pain relief is recommended because studies have  
shown that infants circumcised without anesthesia experience pain 
and bodily stress. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force reviewed three forms of pain relief. One involves  
applying a local anesthetic in a cream about an hour before the 
procedure. The two others involve injecting anesthetics into the 
penis. One of those, a subcutaneous ring block, was deemed the most 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Gerald Chirnomas of Boonton, N.J., who estimates he has  
performed 12,000 circumcisions, said that anesthesia is unnecessary 
and that injections are more painful than the circumcision. He 
allows an infant to suck a little wine from his finger, then gives 
him some sugar water from a bottle after the circumcision for pain 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the policy statement should not affect observant  
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jewish people don't do circumcision because it's a healthy  
thing,'' he said. ``We do it because it's a covenantal ritual 
ordained by the Bible.''

Motorola Inc. announced a pact Tuesday to develop a software 
language that will let people access the Internet using their 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies hope the tool will be adapted by developers of  
software that would allow users to get Web information over the 
phone, reducing the need to use home computers. The 
voice-recognition software would reside on central Web computers, 
not on desktops. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible applications include calling Web sites to easily get  
information such as weather forecasts and traffic information. 
Another potential use is telling a Web site to call back a driver's 
car phone in the event of traffic on the road ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies hope the language, called VXML for voice  
extensible markup language, will get accepted as an industry 
standard. So far, 17 other companies, including leading makers of 
voice-recognition software, are participating in a group reviewing 
the specification, due out next month.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Japan Stocks Tumble / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today as fresh  
Japanese data underscored a weakening of the economy. Japanese 
stocks tumbled amid increased selling of cross shareholdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.08 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.96  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 
119.76 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 300.69 points or 2.11  
percent, closing at 13,921.06. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Nikkei's lowest closing level since Feb. 9, when it  
finished at 13,902.66, and the first time since Feb. 12 that it has 
closed below 14,000. On Monday, the index shed 145.79 points, or 
1.01 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said sentiment toward the  
greenback was bullish at the start of trading after the National 
Association of Purchasing Management said Monday that U.S. 
manufacturing activity rose in January for the first time in eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency also gained momentum against the yen after the  
Japanese government reported today that the nation's jobless rate 
remained at a record high 4.4 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said the number of people  
seeking work after being forced out of their jobs rose by 340,000 
in January from a year earlier to 1 million the highest number 
since the government started compiling the data in its current form 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 119.68 yen and 120.30 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.08 yen, down  
from 130.86 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei average dropped mainly on the  
active unwinding of cross shareholdings by Japanese companies ahead 
of the March book closing and hedge selling by investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's fiscal year ends March 31.  
</P>
<P>
	Share prices remained range bound for most of the session, but  
selling accelerated in the late afternoon after futures dropped 
below a key technical support line, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traders sold cash issues actively as they judged that the  
market was top heavy,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager at 
Chuo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The March futures contract fell after it failed to remain above  
14,200, Ishikawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies were selling shares they traditionally hold  
in other companies, as keeping those shares carries fewer business 
relationship and financial benefits than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 457  
million shares, up from Monday's 420 million shares. Decliners 
outnumbered advancers 825 to 315, with 155 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 15.73 points, or 1.42 percent, to 1,092.08. 
On Monday, the TOPIX lost 12.22 points, or 1.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.815 percent from Monday's finish of 1.840 percent, 
pushing the price up to 99.88 yen from 99.68 yen.

<HEADLINE> Va. Minister Accused in Murder Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STERLING, Va. (AP) -- Prosecutors say a minister approached a  
parishioner with an offer easy to refuse: Kill my wife and I'll 
kill yours. 
</P>
<P>
	James Elrod Ogle, 46, was arrested after the parishioner, whose  
name was not released, told police about Ogle's alleged plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogle is charged with attempted murder and solicitation to commit  
a felony. If convicted of both charges, he could get 25 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	His court-appointed attorney, William Baker, had not spoken with  
Ogle on Tuesday afternoon. The minister was being held without 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	A man sitting the Ogles' porch refused to answer questions  
Tuesday and asked a reporter to leave the property. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince William County police spokeswoman Kim Chinn refused to  
discuss a motive or when the alleged offer was made. Ogle asked the 
parishioner to use a gun and promised to kill that man's wife after 
Judy Ogle was killed, Ms. Chinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Abel, a neighbor of the Ogles, said the couple has four  
children, and that Mrs. Ogle provides day care for about four 
preschool children. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Abel said the minister and his wife seemed to have  
financial problems since Ogle's church, Bull Run Bible Fellowship 
in Manassas, closed in January, but there was no hint of marital 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than something snapping in that man's head, I can't  
imagine what went on,'' Ms. Abel said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Attack Halts Oil Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AIN ZALA, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. airstrikes on two communications  
centers in northern Iraq will stop the flow of oil through the 
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline indefinitely, an Iraqi oil official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the two strikes, which occurred one day and 70 miles  
apart, it will take ``a long time'' to resume pumping, said Hussein 
al-Fattal, head of operations for Iraq's Northern Oil Company. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt to resume pumping failed Monday, he said: ``We tried  
to restart pumping, but we lost communications and control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operator at the Ain Zala communications center, 300 miles  
north of Baghdad, was killed in Monday's bombing, al-Fattal said, 
and several people were wounded. Iraqi officials have said one 
person was killed and two were wounded in Sunday's bombing 70 miles 
south of Ain Zala. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British planes, which patrol the skies over northern  
and southern Iraq, have been striking Iraqi targets almost daily 
since late December. The allies have said they are attacking 
military targets in response to Iraq firing at the planes or 
locking its radar systems on to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Fattal and other Iraqi officials have denied the two centers  
hit were ever used for military purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Ain Zala center functioned as an oil relay station,  
carrying signals between Iraq and Turkey, and was used to maintain 
contact between branches of the company in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi engineers and technicians were clearing debris and trying  
to restore power to residents of Ain Zala, a relatively minor 
oil-producing town that pumps about 10,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The communications center, on the side of a tree-lined hill, is  
300 feet from about 50 houses for oil workers. Iraqi officials, who 
escorted journalists to see the damage, displayed a metal container 
about 20 inches long that they said was part of the two bombs that 
hit the center Monday. Metal scraps and debris from electricity 
poles and wires littered the area. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear whether the Ain Zala center could be repaired,  
said al-Fattal, who estimated the damage has cost Iraq at least 
$2.5 million. Officials have said 56 percent of Iraq's oil exports 
flow through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	In Turkey, meanwhile, the Anatolia news agency reported that a  
delegation of Turkish technicians had traveled to a communications 
center in Silopi, near the Iraqi border, to coordinate the 
re-establishment of communication with the Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq is allowed to export $5.2 billion in oil every six months  
under a program that provides an exemption to U.N. sanctions 
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Oil revenues are to 
be used for food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Fattal said the U.S. strike at Ain Zala also damaged new  
communication equipment Iraq had bought under the oil-for-food 
deal.

<HEADLINE> Enviros, Loggers in Lorax Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In ``The Lorax,'' Dr. Seuss' 1971 cautionary  
tale about the environment, the title character warns that cutting 
down Truffula Trees hurts Brown Bar-ba-loots, who eat Truffula 
Fruits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack,'' the Lorax  
urges. But now, environmentalists complain, the fuzzy yellow 
critter is helping a nonprofit group that they say advocates 
clear-cutting forests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't have a forest of Truffula Trees if we are advocating  
clear-cutting,'' said Ken Rait, director of the Heritage Forests 
Campaign in Portland, Ore. ``We want The Lorax to speak for the 
trees again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Rait wrote Dr. Seuss Enterprises, which controls  
licensing of the late author's characters, and demanded ``the 
liberation of our children's first icon of forest protection.'' Dr. 
Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Geisel, died in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	American Forests, the group that has been using the Lorax as  
part of a promotion, said environmentalists have misinterpreted 
5-year-old congressional testimony and wrongly concluded it 
supports clear-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shame on you. Shame. Shame,'' Deborah Gangloff, executive  
director of American Forests, wrote Rait in a Seussian reply. ``You 
think publicity by deceit is a feat!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the promotion, people who bought a special edition of The  
Lorax or who responded to advertisements in American Forests' 
magazine or on its Web site could become a ``Lorax Helper'' by 
sending in $2.95 to a California company. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, they would get crabapple seeds, stickers and a  
certificate of appreciation, and $1 of their payment would be used 
to plant a tree in the Dr. Seuss Lorax Forest, which is actually 
part of the Francis Marion National Forest in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Planting trees is fine, but American Forests is friendly with  
the timber industry and has advocated clear-cutting and other 
methods to help ``manage'' forests, Rait said. Timber companies 
such as Champion International Corp. have taken out full-page ads 
in American Forests' magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Smith, an American Forests spokesman, said his group often  
works with industry in tree-planting campaigns and other efforts, 
but he said the group often disagrees with timber companies, too. 
``We're not advocates of clear-cutting,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said about 15,000 trees have been planted as a result of the  
campaign, which began early last year and involves American 
Forests, Random House Inc. and Green Gems USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Seuss Enterprises doesn't expect changes from Rait's complaint,  
said Herbert Cheyette, an agent for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to us to be environmentally friendly,'' he said of  
the promotion. ``It did seem to be an endorsement of the morals of 
the Lorax. ... It's unfortunate Dr. Seuss has been dragged into 
this.''

<HEADLINE> Lomas Brown May Sign With Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Lomas Brown, a fixture at left tackle with  
the Arizona Cardinals the last three seasons, accepted a three-year 
contract with the expansion Cleveland Browns, according to news 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republic said the clincher was the Browns'  
willingness to add money to the second year of an offer that 
originally was for $10.5 million. But $4.1 million of it was in the 
final year, when Brown could be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix TV station KSAZ, which also reported Brown agreed to go  
to Cleveland, said the deal included a provision that Brown will be 
the first player introduced at the Browns' first home game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said Brown, a 14-year veteran, was telling friends  
goodbye on Monday and had rejected an 11th-hour appeal from 
Cardinals head coach Vince Tobin and others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals offered a $2 million signing bonus and were  
willing to give Brown $4 million this year, about $500,000 more 
than the Browns' offer, but were unwilling to go for a third year 
for a player soon to be 36, the Republic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the Cardinals' $6 million offer was said to be about  
$400,000 less than that of Cleveland's for two years, and Cleveland 
was said to have offered a $3 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown declined comment, but his agent, Lamont Smith, criticized  
the Cardinals for unclear negotiations that lost a player who 
wanted to stay. ``He deserved more respect than this,'' Smith told 
The Tribune. The Republic said team sources disputed Smith's 
version of the offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer said last week he figures there's  
still a lot of good football left in Brown, who has made the Pro 
Bowl seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in great shape,'' Palmer said. ``Plus, he'd be a great  
role model for the younger players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republic said Brown's decision cleared the way for the  
Cardinals, to step up talks Monday with linebacker Jamir Miller, to 
whom recently they had yet even to make a contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still want him back,'' a Cardinals source told the  
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller visited the Chicago Bears last week, but the Bears may  
not be able to afford Miller after signing offensive tackle Blake 
Brockermeyer to a four-year, $17 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Neil Schwartz said Brown's decision may have opened the  
door for the Cardinals to give renewed interest to his client, 
offensive tackle Wayne Gandy, a free agent who spent his entire 
five-year career with the Los Angeles and St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said the Cardinals made it clear that Gandy was a  
possibility only if Brown signed elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Lost Tomb To Be Opened on Fox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Egypt's pyramids have stood for nearly 5,000  
years. Can they survive Fox TV's ``Opening the Lost Tombs: Live 
From Egypt''? 
</P>
<P>
	Producers promise the two-hour special airing 8 p.m. EST Tuesday  
will be ``the Super Bowl of archaeology,'' with science made sexy 
by music, high-tech camera work and speculation about deadly curses 
and pyramid power. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not your mother's Egypt. ... We're going to show it in  
a really new, inventive, Fox-like way,'' said executive producer 
Peter Isacksen. 
</P>
<P>
	Uh oh. Is there a hieroglyph for ``Please do not sacrifice us to  
the frisky network known for 'When Good Pets Go Bad'?'' Talk about 
being cursed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Isacksen vows that safeguards will be observed in the  
on-camera excavation of the pyramid of Queen Khamerernebty II 
(pronounced Ka-MAIR-air-neb-tee). Respect will not be traded for 
entertainment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zahi Hawass, chief archaeologist at the Giza Plateau, is in  
charge of the dig. Maury Povich, American talk show host, is in 
charge of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the program is going to cheapen the science of  
archaeology, nor do I think it's going to cheapen the country of 
Egypt,'' Isacksen said. ``We're going to portray this science and 
this country in a new, hip, cool way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Hawaas carries a camera into the royal tomb, Fox hopes he  
will hit the jackpot: The discovery of an undisturbed, embalmed 
body. In addition to the live segments, the program will include 
pre-taped visits to other Giza sites, on Cairo's western edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Khamerernebty's pyramid, nestled close to the Sphinx, is one of  
the smaller pyramids built at Giza for Egypt's queens. One of the 
plateau's trio of great pyramids was constructed for her husband, 
King Menkaure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Opening the tomb itself, it's a big show. Just to open a tomb  
that hasn't been opened for 4,600 years ... This really is big,'' 
Hawass told a news conference in January. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a curse, it may fall on Povich. In 1986, TV host  
Geraldo Rivera yanked open a vault linked to 1930s gangster Al 
Capone on live television and found, embarrassingly, nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope I don't find Geraldo,'' joked Povich.  
</P>
<P>
	``Opening the Lost Tombs'' arrives in time to boost Fox's  
audience for February ``sweeps,'' a key ratings measurement period 
used to help set TV station advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Egyptians didn't understand that at all,'' Isacksen said.  
``Try to explain sweeps to a bunch of archaeologists. ... Try to 
explain that they need to slow everything down (on the dig) because 
we're gonna get a better time slot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In return for government permission for the broadcast, a  
contribution was made to Egypt's antiquities department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox isn't the only network using ancient grandeur to lure  
viewers this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cleopatra's Palace: In Search of a Legend,'' showing Sunday,  
March 14, on the Discovery Channel and narrated by actor Omar 
Sharif, follows French explorer Franck Goddio's attempt to find the 
undersea remains of the royal island of Antirhodos. 
</P>
<P>
	A documentary, ``The Real Cleopatra,'' follows on the cable  
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Learning Channel is up next with ``The Curse of  
Tutankhamun,'' set for Sunday, March 7, while ABC is pulling out 
the stops in May with its big-budget miniseries, ``Cleopatra,'' 
starring Timothy Dalton, Billy Zane and Leonor Varela. 
</P>
<P>
	Fascination with Egypt's history and artifacts is nothing new;  
the 1922 discovery of King Tut's tomb and its riches triggered a 
craze in America for all things Egyptian. Fashion, design and 
films, such as 1932's ``The Mummy'' with Boris Karloff, were 
influenced. 
</P>
<P>
	In contemporary times, people are seeking more than cinematic  
thrills. They want answers to the Mysteries of Life, one expert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people looking for a separate level of existence,  
extraterrestrials and all this kind of thing,'' said Carol 
Redmount, associate professor of Egyptian archaeology at the 
University of California, Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a lot more of it around than there used to be,  
and I think it has to do with the dislocation in modern society 
that's causing people to look for meaning,'' Redmount said. Add 
millennial anxiety to the mix and you have a full-blown, often 
Internet-driven, trend. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a trend that Redmount and other archaeologists, including  
Hawass, dismiss. And it's one reason ``Opening the Lost Tombs,'' 
which will be seen internationally, is important, Hawass said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The audience all over the world, and not only in the United  
States, should know what is going on,'' he said. ``They should not 
only read the Internet, which is full of false information.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Budget Surpluses Prove Complicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There it sits, a projected surplus for next  
year exceeding $100 billion, and lawmakers of both parties would 
love to use big parts of it for new spending, tax cuts or both. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite this eagerness to use the money in fiscal 2000 to  
demonstrate their priorities, they are finding political and 
budgetary hurdles in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Still feeling their way through the new era of federal  
surpluses, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and other top Republicans met 
privately today to search for answers to their problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, participants said they discussed plans for setting  
aside Social Security funds explicitly for the program. Republicans 
hope such a mechanism will shield them from Democratic accusations 
they are robbing Social Security to pay for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to reserve the money for Social Security so it  
is ``not still there as a kitty for people to dip into'' for 
various programs, Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the lawmakers probably will discover ways to spend  
some of the surpluses, as they did last fall when they grabbed 
about $20 billion of the surplus for an end-of-session spending 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But they're not there yet. Consider tax cuts, long one of the  
Republican Party's defining issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans want to vote this year to cut taxes  
substantially beginning in 2000, when the presidential and 
congressional election campaigns will be in full throttle. 
</P>
<P>
	They'd love to leave that tax cut unpaid for. That is, rather  
than finding budget savings to offset its costs to the government, 
the lost revenue would simply make future surpluses smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, they've been stymied. That's because for the next  
few years, almost all of the budget black ink comes from enormous 
annual surpluses the Social Security system is running to prepare 
for the baby boomers' retirements. And President Clinton has used 
that fact to press a potent political argument. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the Social Security portion of the surplus should be  
used only for Social Security. The pension program for the elderly 
and disabled is so popular that most Republicans are reluctant to 
ignore Clinton and use that money for tax cuts. In effect, that has 
left the GOP grasping at how to cut taxes deeply enough next year 
that voters will notice. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible solution: Finance the tax cuts with the interest  
the Social Security trust funds accumulate each year. That plan is 
favored by House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, a 
GOP presidential hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill by Reps. Wally Herger, R-Calif., and David Minge,  
D-Minn., would leave $51 billion of that interest available for 
spending or tax cuts next year and $38 billion available in 2001, 
but then push the interest off-limits completely in 2002. Hastert 
likes the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	But the proposal is opposed by other Republicans, including  
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. They worry 
the plan would expose Republicans to Democratic accusations that 
the GOP is raiding Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to stir up public support for tax cuts, House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and other House Republicans plan a 
rally Wednesday aimed at highlighting the Republican drive to cut 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties want to increase spending next year, but, like the  
tax cuts, it remains unclear how they would pay for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants more than $20 billion in new spending next year  
for child care, schools and other items. But he would pay for them 
with higher tobacco taxes and other proposals Congress has rejected 
before, leaving the fate of his initiatives in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate last Wednesday approved, 91-8, increased  
salaries, pensions and other benefits for military personnel. The 
bipartisan measure would cost about $3 billion next year, the 
Congressional Budget Office says, rising to $18 billion by 2009 as 
all of its improvements kick in. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill may change as it moves through the House. But for now,  
no one has determined how -- or if -- the measure would fit within 
spending limits set by the 1997 budget-balancing deal between 
Congress and Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott predicted the measure would be paid for with cuts elsewhere  
in the budget. But highlighting lawmakers' hunger to boost defense 
spending, he also stressed that finding those savings isn't his top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do what's necessary for the military, period,''  
he told reporters, adding, ``It's number one. It's ahead of 
anything else in my mind.''

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Dragging Death Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- In a Feb. 25 story about the sentencing of  
John William King for the dragging death of James Byrd Jr., The 
Associated Press erroneously reported that King was the first white 
person to be sentenced to die in Texas for killing a black person 
since the death penalty was reinstated in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Vigneault was sentenced to death in the 1979 murder of a

not immediately located by the Texas Department of Criminal 
Justice, said Glen Castlebury, the agency's director of public

<HEADLINE> Pacifier Use Lessens Breast Feeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Mothers should breast-feed their children  
as long as possible to best protect their health, according to 
researchers who found that babies who use pacifiers are weaned from 
breast-feeding sooner than other children. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study of 265 breast-feeding mothers in New York, infants  
who used pacifiers were breast-fed eight times a day on average, 
compared with nine times a day among babies not given the option of 
sucking an artificial nipple. Pacifier-sucking babies also spent 
less time overall breast-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, mothers who turned to pacifiers weaned their babies  
off the breast one month earlier than those who relied solely on 
breast-feeding. The reason, researchers said, is that pacifiers 
satisfy babies' innate need to suck. 
</P>
<P>
	About 62 percent of American women breast-feed.  
</P>
<P>
	With less frequent breast-feedings, a mother's milk supply tends  
to decrease, often leading her to add formula or solid foods to her 
child's diet sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the study, published in this month's issue of the  
journal Pediatrics, said that mothers should be careful not to give 
children pacifiers until breast-feeding is well-established. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you substitute the pacifier for the breast, your milk  
supply is going to go down. And it's really important for your 
baby's health that your baby be breast-fed as long as possible,'' 
said Dr. Cynthia Howard, a professor of pediatrics at the 
University of Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Pediatrics says breast-feeding is  
thought to decrease infant ear infections, allergies, diarrhea and 
bacterial meningitis and even more serious illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, considered the first of its kind in the United  
States, bolsters three recent studies in Brazil that had similar 
findings, said Lawrence Gartner, chairman of the academy's work 
group on breast-feeding.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame To Target Sweatshop Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame announced Monday it will hire  
an international accounting firm to police manufacturing sites that 
produce merchandise bearing its trademark, ensuring they comply 
with its anti-sweatshop policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Notre Dame became one of the first colleges to ban  
licensees from using sweatshop labor. But this is the first time 
the school has set up a system to give those policies weight, said 
associate vice president and counsel William Hoye. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not only the right thing to do, but it's mission-driven  
behavior for a Catholic university like Notre Dame,'' said Hoye, 
who believes Notre Dame is the first school to develop such a 
monitoring system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweatshop labor has been a hot topic on college campuses over  
the past year. Student protests prompted a task force of university 
representatives and the Atlanta-based Collegiate Licensing Co. in 
January to draft a conduct code requiring licensed manufacturers to 
comply or be shut out of the estimated $2.5 billion-a-year 
college-license retail business. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft code would ban child labor, forced labor, abuse and  
harassment in the workplace, and also limit working hours and 
require safe and healthy work environments. Notre Dame's 1997 
regulations for university licensees includes similar bans, but it 
has an independent licensing agent that is not part of the effort, 
Hoye said. It also does not release its merchandising revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame is in the process of collecting a list of  
manufacturing sites from its licensees, which Hoye said could be in 
the thousands because many of Notre Dame's 230 licensees have 
dozens of sites operated by subcontractors. The Pricewaterhouse 
Coopers firm will then use the list to randomly select sites for 
visits, Hoye said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's efforts come just ahead of a plan by the Fair  
Labor Association to create a centralized monitoring system to 
monitor sweatshop labor overseas, said Michael Posner. He's the 
executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, one 
of four non-governmental agencies advising the FLA, which was 
created through a Clinton administration initiative to improve 
overseas labor conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Posner said he doesn't know of any other schools that have  
established their own monitoring system and expects Notre Dame's 
efforts to help pave the way for the FLA next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're certainly among the schools that are trying to take  
this seriously, and Notre Dame has if not the largest, one of the 
largest licensing programs in the country, so it's very important 
that schools like Notre Dame are in the forefront,'' Posner said. 
``There needs to be an industry-wide system that holds every 
company accountable to the same standing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Posner said he expects the monitoring system to be in place by  
early next year, but Hoye said the university decided to go out on 
its own with its $75,000 plan rather than wait any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame still hopes to be part of the FLA effort and has  
discussed with other universities the possibility of pooling 
resources, including reporting on working conditions to 
universities that share the costs of monitoring checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our code of conduct was a good start, we knew more  
needed to be done, and that doesn't mean we're at the end with 
this, either,'' said school spokesman Dennis Brown.

<HEADLINE> Two More DaimlerChrysler Execs Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Two top engineering executives at DaimlerChrysler  
AG resigned to take similar positions at Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	They became the fourth and fifth senior U.S. executives to leave  
the former Chrysler Corp. since it merged with Daimler-Benz AG less 
than four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Theodore, who was senior vice president of platform  
engineering at DaimlerChrysler, was named Monday as vice president 
of Ford's large and luxury car vehicle center. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamel Rushwin, formerly DaimlerChrysler's vice president of  
international manufacturing and minivan assembly operations, was 
named Ford's vice president of advanced manufacturing engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	``The experience and expertise that Shamel and Chris bring to  
Ford will add exceptional depth to an already strong team,'' Ford 
President Jac Nasser said Monday in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	In leaving DaimlerChrysler, Theodore and Rushwin follow former  
public relations chief Steve Harris, who went to General Motors 
Corp. last month; Dennis Pawley, the former manufacturing chief who 
retired in January to become a consultant; and Rex Franson, the 
former president of Chrysler Financial Corp. who resigned in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Though DaimlerChrysler was portrayed by its chief architects as  
a ``merger of equals,'' some U.S. executives have complained 
privately that the Daimler half of the automaker has taken a firmer 
grip on the new company. Some, like Harris, were placed in 
subordinate positions to their counterparts in Stuttgart. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ford, Theodore will replace Kenneth Kohrs, who will retire  
June 1 after 37 years at Ford. Rushwin replaces Roman Krygier, who 
was named vice president of powertrain operations Jan. 1.

<HEADLINE> Broken Bow Surges Toward Open Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore (AP) -- Twenty-six days after the New Carissa ran  
aground along Oregon's coastline, the cargo ship's broken bow was 
hauled free and towed over the horizon to be buried deep at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state officials in charge of dealing with the wreck  
exchanged high-fives and lit victory cigars Monday night as they 
watched the lights of the tug Sea Victory and the 420-foot bow 
recede under starry skies and a full moon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yabba dabba doo!'' cheered Bill Milwee, the salvage consultant  
to the ship's Japanese owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleanup continues on the 70,000 gallons of oil that spilled from  
the ship. Restoration of the beach where the ship ran aground could 
take years. Four commercial oyster farms in Coos Bay remained 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	State biologists have found more than 100 dead birds in the  
area, and at least 48 died from exposure to oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The 640-foot cargo ship ran aground Feb. 4 when it dragged  
anchor while waiting out a storm to pick up a load of woodchips 
bound for Japan. Four days later, battered by the pounding surf, it 
began leaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Scrapping plans to try to pull the whole ship off the beach,  
authorities decided to burn the fuel oil to prevent a spill on 
beaches that are nesting grounds for the tiny Western snowy plover, 
a threatened species of shorebird. 
</P>
<P>
	After a Navy demolition team ignited the fuel with napalm, the  
ship split in two. Last Friday, salvage crews rigged a towline from 
the broken bow to the tug. After three days of glacier-like 
progress, the bow began to come off the beach Monday morning after 
salvage crews discovered a channel through the first of two 
sandbars. 
</P>
<P>
	After clearing the first sandbar, the bow was blocked by a  
second. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 9:30 p.m. it began to violently pitch and yaw, clearing  
the sandbar, and by 9:37 p.m. it was moving away smoothly and 
steadily on the open ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bye-bye, New Carissa. We're so sad to see you go -- NOT!'' said  
Coast Guard Petty Officer Shelly Freier. 
</P>
<P>
	The tug was heading west more than 200 miles to an area past the  
continental shelf, where the 210-foot Coast Guard Cutter Intrepid 
will sink the bow section and the 130,000 gallons of oil still 
aboard with shells fired from its 3-inch deck gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really fortunate as far as how much oil got on the  
beach,'' said Heather Parker Hall, a scientist with the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ``It could have been a lot 
worse.''

<HEADLINE> Pele: U.S. Will Grow in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- No less a soccer expert than Pele, merely the  
greatest player the world's most popular sport has known, sees the 
United States as a rising power heading toward the next World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking during a conference call Tuesday in which MasterCard  
announced the renewel of its World Cup sponsorship and its deal 
with Pele, Pele also criticized the conservative manner in which 
games are played these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the clinics and training in the United States, I feel  
very proud to see the growing of football in U.S.,'' said Pele, the 
company's best-known spokesman. ``When a national team has more 
experience, they have become more strong. For the next World Cup in 
three years in Japan and South Korea, no doubt the United States 
will be a good team. 
</P>
<P>
	``America beat England, Mexico, Germany, all these big teams.  
They have improved a lot since (France '98). Of course they need 
more experience and to play abroad. But no doubt today it is not 
easy to beat the American team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pele, who led Brazil to three World Cup titles, then ventured to  
New York to play for the Cosmos and build the sport in this country 
in the 1970s, would like to see a return to wide-open soccer. He's 
dismayed by the way coaches play not to lose rather than to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``People sometimes ask me as a joke this question, but it is not  
a joke, it is serious,'' he said. ``The public looks for great 
players and nice individual plays and this is difficult right now. 
The mind of the coach is to play as a team and not give the athlete 
too much space and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should work with the youth and the coaches who come  
up from the base. Those coaches treat the under-18 and under-16 
teams like they are training a professional team. They want to win 
the game, then they don't let the kids be creative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should work harder on that. If you look in the last five  
years, we have one or two names we can mention (as stars). Before, 
we would have three or four on each team. I think this is damaging 
for the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer's global ambassador, Pele has worked for MasterCard since  
1991 and will be conducting clinics and making appearances 
throughout the world in the buildup toward 2002. An an official 
sponsor, MasterCard's commitment to FIFA, the world governing body 
for soccer, and its various international tournaments will cost the 
company nearly $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A marketing source familiar with World Cup sponsorships told The  
Associated Press that MasterCard is likely to spend $130 million 
through the next three years, including what member banks spend, in 
leveraging the 2002 sponsorship. That's about $30 million more than 
MasterCard committed to the 1998 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, MasterCard finds the association with soccer works; the  
Japan-South Korea tournament will be its fourth World Cup as an 
official sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most popular sport and largest sports event in the  
world, and we are a large global brand,'' said Mava Heffler, senior 
vice president of global promotions and sponsorship for MasterCard. 
``It is a good marriage overall.''

<HEADLINE> Smith Sends Video To Special Fan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Will Smith is sharing secrets with a  
special fan about his latest movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie star and recent Grammy winner sent a homemade  
videotape to Stacey Taylor, a 28-year-old victim of Huntington's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tape, he talks about his new movie -- ``Wild, Wild West''  
with Kevin Kline, due in theaters this spring -- and shows pictures 
of a prototype doll being made of him as James West, his character 
in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one -- no one -- has seen this,'' he confided. ``This is like  
a top-secret, confidential, Warner Bros. in-house secret. Even more 
than the `Men in Black' stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith sent the message after Ms. Taylor's nurse sent in a  
request to the Dream Foundation, a Santa Barbara, Calif.-based 
group that grants wishes for people with terminal illnesses and 
less than a year to live. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Will Smith I appreciate what he did for me and thank him  
for giving me his time,'' Ms. Taylor said in Monday's Janesville 
Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25,000 Americans have Huntington's, a progressively  
debilitating brain disorder. Victims, who include the late folk 
singer Woody Guthrie, gradually lose control over their mental and 
physical functions.

<HEADLINE> Private Ohio Prison Settles Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Inmates of Ohio's first private prison would  
share $1.6 million under a proposed settlement of a class-action 
lawsuit alleging unsafe conditions behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the lawsuit, six inmates who were receiving medical  
care at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center have died since the 
$40 million facility opened in May 1997. At least 20 inmates have 
been stabbed at the prison at Youngstown, about 60 miles southeast 
of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Two inmates were murdered after the lawsuit was filed, and a  
Justice Department report said staff members used ``unnecessarily 
harsh and humiliating procedures'' during inmate searches after the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Most inmates of the prison, owned by the Corrections Corporation  
of America of Nashville, Tenn., were sent by the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, announced Monday in federal court, the money  
would be divided among about 1,000 inmates according to injuries, 
lack of medical care and other standards. A hearing on the proposal 
is set for April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also calls for hiring an independent monitor to  
check conditions at the prison, said Al Gerhardstein, a Cincinnati 
attorney who represents the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suit was brought primarily to improve conditions at the  
facility, and that has been accomplished,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the company agreed to the settlement, it does not admit  
claims that the prison was unsafe, guards used excessive force and 
medical treatment was inadequate, spokeswoman Susan Hart said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``CCA denies any liability for the claims made by the inmates,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy because it looks like a resolution has been  
brought forward,'' she said. The company manages about 80 prisons 
with more than 66,000 beds in the United States, Puerto Rico, 
Australia and the United Kingdom. In some cases, the company owns 
as well as manages the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Six inmates escaped last July but were recaptured and were  
convicted and sentenced to additional time. The escapes led to 
tightened security and a series of legislative hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in the lawsuit disclosed that although the prison is  
supposed to house only medium-security inmates, it has accepted 
maximum-security prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Deregulation Not Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan and the United States still have a ``long way  
to go'' to resolve differences on deregulating the Japanese 
economy, a senior U.S. trade official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries wound up two days of talks on Tuesday.  
Washington is demanding that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
lower the fees it charges other carriers for connecting to its 
local lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher said progress in  
the talks is ``halting, but forward,'' as he entered Japan's 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a process, so we have a long way to go,'' he told Dow  
Jones Newswires. ``But we would need to make more progress to make 
this successful in order to say we're moving down the path of 
deregulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the talks, the United States also asked that new entrants in  
the telecommunications market be given wider access to NTT's 
underground networks and the poles of utility companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher reiterated his point that Japan needs deregulation to  
complement fiscal and monetary policy as a means of boosting the 
economy, now stuck in its worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the points we've been making is that fiscal stimulus  
and monetary stimulus aren't enough,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Stock Markets Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,  
with the key index in Tokyo slumping more than 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 300.69 points or  
2.11 percent, closing at 13,921.06. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Nikkei's lowest closing level since Feb. 9, when it  
finished at 13,902.66, and the first time since Feb. 12 that it has 
closed below 14,000. On Monday, the index shed 145.79 points, or 
1.01 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell mainly on the active unwinding of  
cross-shareholdings by Japanese companies ahead of the March 
book-closing and hedge selling by investors. Japan's fiscal year 
ends March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies were selling shares they traditionally hold  
in other companies, as keeping those shares carries fewer business 
relationship and financial benefits than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.08 yen in late  
afternoon trading, up 0.96 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also 
above its New York level of 119.76 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong also slumped as investors took profits  
following two straight sessions of sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 106.88 points, or 1.1 percent, closing at 
9,913.58. On Monday, the index had gained 161.97 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said profit-takers stepped into the market following  
recent sharp gains in property stocks that were triggered by rumors 
that Walt Disney Co. may build a theme park in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have confirmed talks with Disney, but the  
company has declined comment on the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Local press reports said that Hong Kong Financial Secretary  
Donald Tsang may announce the Disney project when he unveils the 
territory's budget in the legislature on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market was also dragged down by the sharp fall in

<HEADLINE> Rep. Says US Planning Mass Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Texas Republican says the Clinton  
administration is trying to circumvent a 1997 law with a plan to 
grant amnesty to Central American illegal immigrants without 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House is shamelessly bowing to special interests and  
thumbing its nose at Congress, the American people and every legal 
alien who played by the rules and waited his or her turn to come to 
America,'' Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he objected to a plan to grant Central American  
illegal immigrants eligible for amnesty a blanket ``presumption of 
hardship,'' instead of requiring each immigrant to prove hardship 
on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Congress passed a law that granted amnesty to some  
Nicaraguans and Cubans in the United States and allowed them to 
apply for status as legal permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, Guatemalans and Salvadorans who qualify would be  
considered for a suspension of deportation under the less stringent 
rules that existed before 1996 immigration legislation, but on a 
case-by-case basis requiring them to prove ``extreme hardship'' if 
they were returned to their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the proposal for a blanket presumption of hardship  
goes against the intent of the 1997 law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew full well how to give amnesty,'' Smith said. ``We gave  
it to certain Nicaraguans and Cubans who were our allies in the 
Cold War against communism. If we wanted to give it to other 
groups, we would have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said a blanket presumption would give as many as more than  
240,000 illegal aliens a benefit that Congress declined to give 
them in 1997. He and 28 other House members signed a letter to 
President Clinton asking him to reject the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service has not yet made a  
final decision on presumption of hardship, agency spokeswoman Maria 
Cardona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration advocacy groups have lobbied in support of a new  
rule presuming hardship, and a Clinton administration official said 
members of Congress also have submitted written comments on the 
issue -- mostly in favor of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	A Feb. 23 letter signed by seven senators, including Senate  
Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Sen. Connie Mack, 
R-Fla., told Attorney General Janet Reno that the presumption of 
hardship would ``foster administrative efficiency and be 
fundamentally fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, it would avoid imposing any further hardship on  
applicants, who waged a long legal battle over the issue. ``The 
experiences shared by this group as a class support a determination 
of extreme hardship,'' the letter to Reno said. ``Even before 
Hurricane Mitch, these countries were considered among the poorest 
in the Western Hemisphere. When Hurricane Mitch struck the region 
in November 1988, the little progress these countries had made in 
rebuilding their economies, infrastructures and communities after 
the end of the civil wars was substantially reversed.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Examines Iran Energy Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department criticized French and  
Iranian oil companies on Tuesday for signing a $540 million energy 
deal with Iran and said U.S. authorities would begin proceedings 
that could lead to economic penalties against the firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf Aquitaine of France and Agip of Italy signed a deal Monday  
that would boost Iranian oil production to an estimated 100,000 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is with the state-run National Iranian Oil Co. for the  
Dorood oil and gas field and was made over the opposition of the 
United States, which embargoed American trade with Iran in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are both disappointed and concerned about this development.  
The U.S. remains strongly opposed to investment in Iran's petroleum 
sector. We have repeatedly urged the governments of France and 
Italy at the most senior levels to discourage this investment,'' 
James Foley, the deputy State Department spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States tries to discourage investment in Iran on the  
grounds Iran sponsors terrorism beyond its borders, spreads 
dangerous technology and is bent on developing weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1996 law, investments of more than $20 million in Iran  
or $40 million in Libya could result in a variety of sanctions. 
Among them are bans on export licenses for the United States and 
denial of Export-Import Bank credits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will look closely at the facts of what has happened and we  
will be assessing the implications under (the Iran-Libya Sanctions 
Act). If sanctionable activity is found to have occurred, we will 
decide upon and take appropriate action,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the French oil company Total signed a $2 billion deal  
with Iran to develop natural gas reserves, along with Gazprom, a 
Russian petroleum company, and Petronas, a Malaysian company. The 
United States said in 1998 it would waive sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't preview for you what we will ultimately decide,''  
Foley said. ``We actively tried to discourage this investment. We 
reminded our European friends that (this) is the law, and that we 
will apply it.''

<HEADLINE> Calif Community Faces Incorporation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGUNA HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- With a high-stakes election at hand,  
you'd expect to see harried campaigners working up to a frenzied 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Not at Leisure World -- folks here frown on frenzy.  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest privately enclosed community for senior citizens on  
the West Coast may be embarking on one if its most historical 
choices, but its citizens have already seen plenty of history. 
</P>
<P>
	The retirement enclave of 18,000 -- about 15,000 of them  
registered voters -- must decide today by simple majority vote 
whether to incorporate as a California city or remain a private 
island in the midst of plenty. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory for cityhood would give Leisure World a new name and  
make it the first gated municipality in the United States strictly 
for senior citizens, according to activists here. Householders' 
minimum age is 55. 
</P>
<P>
	If opponents win, Leisure World will remain just that: a  
private, 1,200-acre world some 50 miles south of Los Angeles, with 
14 guard-controlled gates and 24-hour security patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of reducing stress, not adding stress at this  
time of life,'' said Bea Hassel Rogatz, an opponent of cityhood and 
the oldest of 16 potential city council candidates at age 91. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, stress isn't a problem here. There are two  
professional golf courses, eight tennis courts, a 844-seat theater, 
five large swimming pools, spas, lawn bowling greens, shuffleboard 
courts and a well-equipped fitness center. 
</P>
<P>
	At Leisure World, all exterior maintenance and landscaping is  
done by a full-time staff of carpenters, plumbers, painters and 
gardeners, leaving residents free to join more than 200 community 
clubs and organizations, arts and crafts classes, choral groups and 
ballroom dance groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep asking those people who left the city, `Why do you want  
to be in a city?''' Rogatz said outside her tidy condominium, 10 
minutes from the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	She and others are concerned about a new layer of bureaucracy,  
and whether a city bureaucracy would encourage a sprawl of strip 
malls around the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogatz said that the benefits of Leisure World -- from health  
services to shopping amenities -- can't be matched by any public 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	And people pay taxes already, she said. Even though Leisure  
World has no schools, it falls into two school districts and 
residents support education in neighboring Laguna Hills and Aliso 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of cityhood say the change wouldn't be severe. The  
$70 million that residents already pay into corporate-run 
associations could become the new town's operating budget, said Bob 
Ring, a top cityhood proponent. 
</P>
<P>
	And with thousands of lifetimes of career experience  
concentrated at Leisure World, administration expertise is here, 
waiting to be used, Ring said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hardly a traumatic experience. We do have the people. We  
do have the know-how,'' Ring said. ``If you use any common sense at 
all, we're going to be a very, very well-to-do city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leisure World advertises itself as the biggest retirement center  
on the West Coast. Completed in the early 1960s by developer Ross 
Cortese, the Orange County community is a sister city to slightly 
older Leisure World in Seal Beach to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how the vote goes, Leisure World won't become  
``Seizureville'' or ``Geezerville'' as some wags suggested. And 
tongue-in-cheek labels like ``Viagra Village'' never made the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	If cityhood does pass, however, voters won't be able to continue  
living at Leisure World. They'll have to choose between two names: 
Laguna Woods or Laguna Verde. 
</P>
<P>
	Given a ``yes'' on incorporation, voters will pick five council  
candidates, who must organize a city hall and recruit staff. Since 
state and federal laws permit senior-citizen communities to set 
minimum age limits, the composition of the new city might not 
change drastically. 
</P>
<P>
	Three separate consultants have recommended incorporation, said  
Mary Balcom, a cityhood proponent and the self-proclaimed ``baby'' 
of the prospective council members at 58. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be here for at least 30 years,'' she said.  
``Cityhood is very important to me because I see it's the best 
option for 30 years. And I've looked at all the financials.''

<HEADLINE> IRS To Rewrite Audit Warning Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service was told to let  
taxpayers who are being audited know that people such as neighbors 
and employers might be contacted. What it did instead is stir up 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't begin to imagine the alarm I would feel if I went to  
my mailbox one day and received this type of letter from the 
government,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti acknowledged Tuesday the audit  
notices failed to clearly outline taxpayers' rights and could worry 
people unnecessarily. He announced that a rewrite is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a mistake, and we're going to fix it,'' Rossotti said.  
``This third-party notice does not represent the first-rate service 
we must give taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, first used on Jan. 18, was included in changes made  
by the 1998 Internal Revenue Service reform law passed by Congress. 
Third-party contacts usually are a last resort in an audit. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision for a new letter to taxpayers subjected to audits  
was included to reduce personal embarrassment caused by such 
sensitive contacts, to give taxpayers notice about who is contacted 
and to describe their other rights. 
</P>
<P>
	But the notice only states that IRS may need to contact third  
parties. It says: ``Third-party contacts may include, but are not 
limited to, neighbors, employers, employees and banks. We may use 
these contacts to help us determine your correct tax liability, 
identify your assets or locate your current address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wording provoked criticism from tax accountants and lawyers  
as well as key members of Congress and taxpayers who got them. They 
said it raised privacy concerns and didn't clearly explain when IRS 
typically contacts third parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that the IRS has decided to dust off its old,  
subversive tactics with this daunting notice,'' said Bond, who 
complained last week in writing to Rossotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said IRS will consult with professional tax  
practitioners to write a new, improved version that will highlight 
taxpayers' rights and stress that the agency's main goal is to 
finish the audit without contacting any outside parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I promise that when we rewrite the notice, and we will, we  
will get it right,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS did not say when the new letter would be ready, but  
Rossotti said people who get the old one shouldn't be worried that 
the agency would contact more outside parties than it had in the 
past.

<HEADLINE> MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Pete Rose Jr. was a hit, Garth Brooks was a miss.  
</P>
<P>
	While the New York Mets were beating St. John's University 12-3  
Tuesday in this spring's first exhibition, several other teams were 
playing intrasquad games. 
</P>
<P>
	With his father sitting in the stands, Rose got a hit in the Los  
Angeles Dodgers' game at Vero Beach, Fla. Brooks, however, struck 
out in his only at-bat in the San Diego Padres' game at Peoria, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	After being reminded by manager Bruce Bochy to put on his  
batting helmet, the country music star managed to foul off two 
pitches before chasing a neck-high fastball from non-roster righty 
Salvador Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was cool. I guess four out of the five pitches I was proud  
of. The last one I wasn't. That's the one I'll remember,'' Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was there. That's why I was apologizing to my teammates. I  
was there,'' he said. ``The guy on first has to be moved over and 
it was my job to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks did fine in left field, cleanly handling a single by Gary  
Matthews Jr. in his only chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Sr., baseball's career hits leader, watched his 29-year-old  
son swing away at Dodgertown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let you know if he's my son after he hits,'' Rose said to  
a fan. ``If he gets a hit, he's my son. If he doesn't, he's your 
son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Jr. is just hoping for a chance with the Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got what it takes,'' he said Tuesday. ``I plan on  
making the team. I don't plan on playing in (Triple-A) 
Albuquerque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bust my tail,'' Pete Jr. said. ``I'm going to be in LA at  
some time. I'm a guy who's got some pop. Left-handed pop looks to 
be a little scarce around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Brown, who signed a $105 million, seven-year contract with  
the Dodgers, pitched two innings in a simulated game. He threw 16 
pitches in the first inning and 23 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of getting started back up, getting cranked up  
again,'' Brown said. ``I survived, didn't get hit in the face or 
anything, so there's a moral victory there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the session, Brown gave up a couple of shots that  
most likely would have been hits in a game, to Jose Vizcaino, Gary 
Sheffield and Raul Mondesi. He ended the session by striking out 
Eric Karros. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 1,431 at Port St. Lucie, Fla., watched the Mets  
defeat St. John's. Matt Franco homered during a seven-run burst in 
the third inning, and Melvin Mora and Mike Kinkade also connected 
for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Mets pitchers combined on a five-hitter. Mets closer John  
Franco, a St. John's alumnus, did not pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander David Wells, meanwhile, had back spasms and was in  
Toronto's training room in Dunedin, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wells has some lower right back inflammation,'' Blue Jays  
trainer Tommy Craig said. ``We're treating him now, and he seems to 
be responding to the treatment and exercises. We don't anticipate 
it being a long and drawn-out thing. We're just going to take it 
day to day right now, then ease him back up to the on-the-field 
stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Professor Under Fire for Swearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- John Bonnell says it's hard not to teach  
some literature -- say, a James Joyce short story or ``Lady 
Chatterley's Lover'' -- without using a few saucy words. 
</P>
<P>
	The English professor has used what he calls ``blunt language''  
in his classes at Macomb Community College for 32 years. But this 
year, school officials have accused Bonnell's speech of running 
afoul of sexual harassment policies and have suspended him 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	A student filed a complaint in November, saying she found his  
words ``dehumanizing, degrading and sexually explicit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	College officials have declined to speak about the case, saying  
it's confidential. Bonnell said the school suspended him for three 
days for the complaint, then suspended him indefinitely while it 
investigated whether he told students to stay away during his 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnell said he begins the semester by warning students that  
graphic language may be used in class. And he said his use of 
four-letter words does not go beyond the normal speech used by his 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get in novels and short fiction, at times, some rather  
blunt handling of human sexuality, which I think more than anything 
is the problem here,'' Bonnell said. ``It's easier to say `I object 
to the language' than `I object to human sexuality.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnell said among the classes he teaches is a freshman  
composition course, and this year's readings included ``The 
Boarding House,'' a Joyce story published in 1914 about a man 
tricked into seducing the daughter of a boardinghouse owner. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Joyce couldn't use several words, such as ``pregnant,''  
that are common today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other references to human sexuality in the story  
that I explicate,'' Bonnell said. ``Some students get uncomfortable 
with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnell said there had been previous complaints about his  
language, but none had escalated this far. 
</P>
<P>
	James Howarth, Bonnell's lawyer, said Bonnell never directed his  
language at any particular student, and only used coarse words in 
relation to teaching. Howarth said he would ask the school to 
reinstate Bonnell. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bonnell was suspended, some students protested and  
boycotted classes taught by a substitute. One was Sean Renkert, 20, 
who had Bonnell for composition and was taking his poetry class. 
</P>
<P>
	Renkert said Bonnell used rough language ``every once in a  
while, but it always pertained to the works. It was words you hear 
every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very passionate about his work -- he talks a lot about  
love, hates, passion. He really got into the literature and drew in 
between the lines really well, so you could tell what was going 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former student, Patricia Lawrence, 45, helped start a petition  
drive in Bonnell's support after his original suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have this wrong impression that he goes in and starts  
cussing and cursing. That's not it at all,'' Lawrence said. ``There 
are just certain words used in everyday slang that people are more 
familiar with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School policy defines sexual harassment as ``unwelcome verbal or  
physical conduct'' that interferes with education ``by creating an 
intimidating, hostile, abusive, or offensive work or educational 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the policy also says ``speech in the classroom which is  
germane to course content is not subject to this policy.''

<HEADLINE> High Court Hears Gifts-to-Espy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court is trying to sort out  
distinctions between innocent good will and illegal gifts to 
government officials, using a case that arose from the corruption 
investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	The tangled rules governing gifts or favors that officials may  
or may not accept on the job were on display during the four-year 
prosecution of Espy and some of the companies that gave him things. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel appointed to investigate Espy asked the  
justices Tuesday to reinstate the gratuities conviction of 
Sun-Diamond Growers of California. The farm cooperative's head 
lobbyist spent $2,295 for Espy to attend the U.S. Open tennis 
tournament and otherwise wined and dined him. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first 14 months of Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy's  
tenure, Sun-Diamond lavished on its chief regulator thousands of 
dollars in gifts while it had millions of dollars at stake,'' 
Deputy Independent Counsel Robert Ray argued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court is expected to clarify by July the federal law that  
makes it a crime to give a gift to a public official ``for or 
because of any official act performed or to be performed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Sun-Diamond maintain the company did nothing wrong  
in giving things to Espy, since there was no arranged quid pro quo 
and no specific intent to influence him. 
</P>
<P>
	Several justices offered hypothetical situations where gifts or  
invitations could have sinister or pure motives, depending on 
shades of interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia repeatedly used the hypothetical example  
of the chairman of AT&AMP;T doling out cash to the chief of the Federal 
Communications Commission with no specific strings attached. He 
asked whether Sun-Diamond's position was akin to AT&AMP;T offering 
money out of a vague hope that the FCC would look kindly on the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's $2 million. Think well of us in all you do in this  
office,'' Scalia said to laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked Ray why a gift is illegal if  
it is not tied to some specific act by the official. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't baking brownies for a senator, or knitting a pair of  
socks for an official, is it?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray replied that the possibility of future favors to the company  
is enough.

	Ray's boss, Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz, maintained  
throughout the nearly two dozen Espy-related cases that it was not 
necessary to prove that Espy ever did anything in return for gifts, 
and that lobbyists or companies did not have to expect specific 
favors as a result of their largesse.

<P>
	Espy was acquitted in December of 30 charges related to gifts he  
accepted from Sun-Diamond, Tyson Foods and others.

to Espy, including tickets to the U.S. Open, luggage, meals, a 
framed print and a Waterford crystal bowl.

<P>
	A federal appeals court threw out the 1996 gratuities  
convictions on grounds the federal gratuities law requires a 
connection between a gift and official acts.

<HEADLINE> GAO Reports Rail Shipper Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A process that shippers find expensive and  
burdensome keeps them from seeking federal recourse even when they 
believe railroads are charging too much, according to congressional 
auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the General Accounting Office, being released today  
at a Senate hearing, shows that large numbers of rail shippers feel 
they are systematically being overcharged by rail carriers who have 
monopolies in their region. But at the same time, a majority 
believe federal regulators don't provide accessible relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency in charge of fielding complaints about rates  
-- the Surface Transportation Board -- has a process that seems too 
complicated and unwieldy for many shippers to undertake, according 
to the report by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of providing rate relief is so expensive and so  
cumbersome that it is almost unworkable,'' says Sen. Byron Dorgan. 
D-N.D., one of the lawmakers who requested the report. ``When 
shippers are held captive by a monopoly, they don't have an 
effective way to complain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 75 percent of the 700 shippers surveyed by GAO  
auditors said they are paying unreasonable rates for rail service. 
And 70 percent said the time, complexity and costs in filing 
complaints with the STB are barriers that often preclude them from 
seeking relief. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the GAO said, shippers who file a complaint that a  
railroad is using its market dominance to overcharge must create a 
model for the STB, demonstrating how much an optimally efficient 
railroad should charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 72 percent of shippers told the GAO that constructing  
such a model is a difficult task, particularly for small 
businesses. ``The time and cost associated with the model's 
development may outweigh the compensation afforded the shipper 
should the board determine that the challenged rate was 
unreasonable,'' GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors tracked the 41 complaints filed with the STB since  
1990 and found that shippers spent about $500,000 to $3 million 
preparing each case. The process can also be timely -- with the STB 
taking anywhere from several months to, in one instance, 16 years 
to resolve a case. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was to be introduced today as an exhibit in a Senate  
subcommittee hearing on reauthorizing the Surface Transportation 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan said the GAO study will give the surface transportation  
and Merchant Marine subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee 
``a road map'' in determining what changes are needed at the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially in a period when you have so many railroad mergers,  
you either need effective regulation or a complaint process that is 
simple,'' Dorgan said. He stressed that extra costs are eventually 
passed down to farmers and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate survey, the GAO interviewed the nine major freight  
railroads. They expressed satisfaction with the rate review process 
and said no change in the process is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The board has implemented some measures to streamline its  
complaint process, the GAO said. For example, it eliminated product 
and geographic competition as criteria for determining market 
dominance by a railroad. It also has implemented guidelines to 
simplify complaints involving smaller dollar amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A second GAO report analyzing the rates shippers pay freight  
railroads is scheduled for release in April.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Tuesday as more  
bad economic data added to Japan's woes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the dollar fell against the euro and other major  
European currencies on profit-taking, although analysts said the 
economic fundamentals upholding the new European currency remain 
weak. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.23  
Japanese yen, up from 119.76 on Monday. Also in late trading, the 
euro was quoted at $1.0925, up from $1.0887. During trading, the 
euro fell to $1.0857, yet another historic low for the currency 
representing 11 European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors took the dollar higher against the yen in early Asian  
trading as they carried over dollar-positive sentiment from 
Monday's North American trading that was fueled by bullish U.S. 
economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar got a further boost when Japan reported Tuesday that  
its unemployment rate remained at a record high, 4.4 percent, in 
January. The yen faltered and Japan's main stock index fell 2.11 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After the euro fell to its historic low, it rose against the  
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Europe is fighting high unemployment among other  
economic problems that have lead the euro lower against the dollar 
and typically would have kept the new currency from rising. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's more a technical blip'' attributed to  
position-taking ahead of Thursday's meeting of the European Central 
Bank, said Jeff Woodruff, a currency strategist at BankBoston in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank has been under political pressure to lower interest  
rates to attract borrowers. That also means the euro would be less 
appealing to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4571 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4621, and 1.5208 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5220. The British 
pound rose to $1.6145, up from $1.6095. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7902 German 
marks, down from 1.7966; 6.0024 French francs, down from 6.0241; 
and Italian lire, 1,773.05, down from 1,779.36.

<HEADLINE> 14 Deaths Tied To Contaminated Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The death toll linked to contaminated hot dogs  
and deli meats made by Sara Lee Corp.'s Bil Mar Foods in Michigan 
has reached 14, government health investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the tainted meat has been blamed for six  
miscarriages and 97 illnesses in 22 states from early August to 
Jan. 17, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak is the nation's second-deadliest involving Listeria  
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 22, Bil Mar began a recall of 15 million pounds of hot  
dogs and cold cuts produced at its Zeeland, Mich., plant after a 
rare strain of Listeria was found in both opened and unopened 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria can be found in soil, water and various raw foods. The  
bacteria can cause death or severe illness in women who are 
pregnant, people with weakened immune systems, newborns and the 
elderly.

<HEADLINE> Grandmother Arrested in Mass. Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNN, Mass. (AP) -- A grandmother with a history of mental  
illness has been charged with setting a fire that killed two adults 
and three girls at the home of her son's estranged girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Hilton, 52, was arrested Saturday after telling police  
she set the Feb. 24 fire, apparently to deflect the suspicion that 
had settled on her son, Charles Loayza. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Loayza, 22, had threatened to torch the building  
where his ex-girlfriend, Krystina Sutherland, and her two children 
lived on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutherland and her two children escaped the fire. Sonia  
Hernandez, 32; Sonia's husband, Heriberto Feliciano, 34; their two 
daughters, Sonia and Maria Feliciano, 12 and 13; and niece Glorimar 
Santiago, 11, died. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a district court judge postponed Hilton's arraignment  
because the defendant claimed during psychiatric interviews that 
her cell was haunted and that she saw spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton has been institutionalized for mental illness and has  
suffered from seizures since age 5, according to her lawyer, 
Michael Natola. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Joseph Dever ordered tests and observation of Hilton, with  
another court date on March 19 -- if doctors decide she's mentally 
capable. 
</P>
<P>
	Natola said that Hilton's confession were the words of a  
disturbed woman who did not understand the consequences of her 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The statements she is alleged to have made to Lynn police were  
an effort to clear her son under a mistaken impression that by 
making those statements she would help him,'' said Natola.

<HEADLINE> Amway Takes Sales Into Cyberspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amway, the company made famous by its cheery  
salespeople who sell household goods to friends in their living 
rooms, is taking a giant step into the impersonal world of 
cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway is expected to announce Wednesday that it will launch a  
new Internet site, Quixtar.com, in September. It's the latest move 
by direct sellers to broaden the way they pitch their products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going door-to-door, to people's homes, is more difficult today  
than ever before. More people just don't have time,'' said David 
Rush, who works at the retail consulting firm Kurt Salmon 
Associates in Atlanta. ``The Internet is a way to knock on 
someone's door or have them knock on your door when they have 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other direct sellers, Avon has begun opening retail  
stores. Last month Tupperware announced it would offer its food 
storage products online by the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is the way the marketplace is heading in the  
United States today,'' said David Van Andel, Amway's senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway's move online isn't a reach for the Ada, Mich.-based  
company. It has already solved one of the biggest challenges faced 
by Internet retailers -- it has an established distribution network 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has a built-in promotional staff -- its army of  
three million eager sales representatives, who have already started 
touting the new Web site to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway already operates an Amway.com site as a promotional  
vehicle. It decided against using its own name for the new site 
because it plans to sell thousands of goods and services from other 
companies. Quixtar.com will also be filled with familiar Amway 
names, such as Nutrilite vitamins and SA8 laundry detergent. 
</P>
<P>
	This new sales approach is a big change for Amway. Founded in  
1959, the company has long prided itself on its network of 
representatives using face-to-face meetings -- whether at a 
neighbor's house or at the local coffee shop -- to woo business. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway's salespeople are known for their almost evangelical  
spirit, but the company says they won't lose commissions to the Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Salespeople will sign up their customers to become ``members''  
of Quixtar.com, which will allow them to order goods online, some 
at discounted prices. The salespeople will get a commission from 
those orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Salespeople will continue to encourage their customers to become  
Amway representatives themselves and will continue to get a 
percentage of the commissions earned by their recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also hopes the Web site will broaden its reach.  
Anyone, regardless if they are a member or not, can purchase goods 
on Quixtar.com. The profits from such sales will be randomly 
assigned to Amway representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway's move online comes as the company looks for new avenues  
of growth. Its representatives' pep rallies and motivation meetings 
haven't helped boost business in the last year, especially in 
financially strapped Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway's sales for the year ended in August 1998 fell 18 percent  
to $5.7 billion. About 70 percent of Amway's operations take place 
outside North America. Amway, which is privately held, doesn't 
disclose profits.

<HEADLINE> Md. Razing Store for Drug Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A judge has ordered the demolition of a corner  
convenience store authorities say is a haven for drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Monday's order is the first time in Maryland  
that an operating business has been targeted for demolition because 
of drugs. Previously, authorities had torn down houses, some of 
which were occupied. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really a drug store. Unfortunately, it is for the  
convenience of the users, not the surrounding community,'' said Ann 
Refolo, an assistant state's attorney with the city housing 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	The city decided the only way to get rid of the drugs was to get  
rid of the Springhill Grocery, which has been in business in the 
city's West Baltimore section since 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many neighborhood stores in rough neighborhoods in  
Baltimore, the Springhill Grocery's shelves and cash register are 
behind a thick glass partition. Customers point to what they want, 
usually just candy and cigarettes in the sparsely stocked store. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors have been afraid to sit on their front steps or take a  
walk because of the drug activity around the store. Gun-toting drug 
dealers looking for customers tried to flag down residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulysses Holmes, who lives in the building and runs the store,  
testified he nets $500 to $600 a week and employs two part-time 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never dealt with any kind of drugs,'' Holmes said  
during a break in a civil trial last week. ``I personally don't 
know about any drug dealing inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has  
not been involved in the case, but executive director Susan Goering 
said she is concerned about whether the store owner and the 
landlord got a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for government to bear the burden of showing  
why those rights should be denied,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington attorney Roger Conner, a visiting fellow with the  
National Institute of Justice, said the tactic of tearing down 
homes and businesses to prevent crime is cutting edge but not 
unique. The practice has been tried in such cities as New York, San 
Diego and San Antonio, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, however, fewer businesses than homes are demolished,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is prosecution with a plan,'' he said. ``Most cities  
don't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the Baltimore store has been a haven for drug  
activity for years. Since 1995, police have responded to 486 
drug-related calls on the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, police said, they arrested 10 drug dealers and  
users at the store in less than five hours. During a raid last May, 
police found drugs and drug paraphernalia in the back of the store 
and a gun in an area accessible to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks earlier, police making a drug arrest at the store found 28  
bags of crack -- 18 in the pockets of a store employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes has been arrested on drug charges but never convicted,  
Ms. Refolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few neighborhood activists attended the trial, but Ms. Refolo  
said they were too afraid to testify. One neighbor presented the 
judge with a petition with 100 signatures of residents asking to 
keep the store open. 
</P>
<P>
	Two friends of Holmes testified that getting rid of the store  
wouldn't solve the problem. ``If the store is closed or open, they 
will sell those drugs,'' Michael Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes and Allen Becker, a Baltimore real estate agent who owns  
the property, were given a week to present a plan to stop the drug 
activity. Their plan -- to close the store but maintain the 
apartment -- was rejected Monday by District Judge Timothy J. Doory. 
</P>
<P>
	He ordered Holmes to vacate the building within 10 days and  
Becker to demolish it at his expense within 30 days. They have 10 
days to appeal.

<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Five foreign tourists were killed and  
seven others rescued in an operation to free at least 14 foreigners 
taken hostage by Rwandan rebels in southwestern Uganda, police said 
today. Police in the Ugandan capital confirmed the five deaths but 
did not give details of the rescue operation or say when it was

semi-official Anatolia news agency reported. The 15-member

	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq will keep confronting American and  
British warplanes, despite two days of airstrikes that have 
interrupted Iraqi oil exports, Iraq's vice president said in 
remarks published today. U.S. and British planes have struck 
northern Iraq twice since Sunday, damaging a communications 
facility that assists the flow of Iraqi oil through a pipeline to 
the southern Turkish port of Ceyhan. The pipeline is one of only 
two outlets for oil exports. U.S. and British planes, which patrol 
no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq, have been striking 
Iraqi military sites on an almost daily basis since late December.

	Chinese Teens Skip Out From Airport  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A group of Chinese teens visiting California  
as part of an educational exchange program disappeared shortly 
before they were to board a flight home. ``It appears that this was 
a very well-orchestrated effort to remain here in the United 
States,'' said Lt. Anthony Alba. The 18 girls and 14 boys, who were 
visiting California to study English at the University of Redlands, 
were dropped off at Los Angeles International Airport by a 
chartered bus yesterday morning. Moments later, several Asian men 
approached the group, took their luggage and passports, and whisked 
them away in cars.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav forces pounded an area

today, pressing an offensive that has driven thousands of ethnic 
Albanian civilians from their homes. The days-old operation appears 
to be an ominous military effort to control a strategic artery in 
the Serbian province, even as international officials struggle to 
contain the fighting and seal up a peace deal. Yugoslav troops and 
tanks have been massing at the border, and a bridge connecting 
Macedonia and Kosovo is mined -- preparations either to prevent NATO 
forces from coming in, or keep diplomatic monitors and refugees 
from getting out.

	BEIJING (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left China

political dissent. ``In our relationship with China, these are 
neither the best of times nor the worst of times,'' Albright said, 
summing up a three-day visit marked by confrontation on human 
rights and Taiwan and growing cooperation on North Korea and 
possibly trade. In her talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, 
Premier Zhu Rongji and other Chinese officials, Albright said she 
made clear that the Clinton administration ``deplores'' China's 
fresh crackdown on dissent.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Mum on 2nd White House Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ``Will Jesse Run?'' phase of the early  
presidential campaign season has arrived, a regular event on the 
Democratic Party calendar since Jesse Jackson's first campaign for 
the party's presidential nomination in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson won't say. Instead, he says he is certain of only one  
thing: A minority should be on the Democratic ticket in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must remove the ceiling for people of color,'' Jackson said  
in an interview. ``No longer can we exclude blacks for 
consideration on the national ticket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his own possible candidacy, he says only, ``I have talked  
to many who believe in my leadership and priorities. But no 
decision has been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, little has changed since 1984 and 1988, the two  
times Jackson actually entered the primaries. He remains one of the 
most influential black leaders in Democratic politics; now, as 
then, he clearly wants a place at the table. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, inquiries on his intentions bring only parrying replies  
-- and a burst of oratory on the need for all candidates to pay more 
than lip service to his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Some political observers, like Norman Ornstein of the American  
Enterprise Institute, don't think Jackson will compete for the 
nomination against Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill 
Bradley of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be surprised if Jackson ran,'' Ornstein said. ``He  
doesn't appear as active as in years past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is really is no candidate of the left out there,''  
Ornstein added. ``That might bring him in, but I'm not sure it's 
enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews over the past few weeks, Jackson, 57, sounds less  
like a potential candidate and more like one seeking the 
recognition he feels he deserves for his decades of work 
registering voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've registered more voters than any of (the announced  
candidates),'' he said. ``I've stood at more plant gates with 
workers. I've broadened the base for participation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But David Bositis, senior politics analyst for the Joint Center  
for Political and Economic Studies, sees barriers to a Jackson 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be difficult to get the money needed. People don't  
give unless there see a realistic shot of winning, and I don't see 
it,'' Bositis said. ``They won't give money so somebody like Jesse 
can make speeches to bring up liberal social policy issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bositis said Gore has been lining up black support for more than  
a year so Jackson's base might not be as solid as in past years. 
</P>
<P>
	But since Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., has taken himself out of  
the race, the absence of a liberal candidate competing with Gore 
from the left could tempt Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson shrugged off a frequent criticism -- the fact that he has  
never held an elected public office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaders give vision and choose policy priorities,'' he said.  
``No one person writes an entire budget. It's not magic. Critical 
leadership must be accepted where it is found.''

<HEADLINE>  Giants QB Denies Being Racist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Being the New York Giants' starting  
quarterback isn't Kerry Collins' top priority right now. 
</P>
<P>
	He's just not ready yet. There are football fundamentals he has  
to develop again, and some off-the-field problems to dealt with, 
some real and some perceived. 
</P>
<P>
	Denying he is racist and saying he is addressing an alcohol  
problem, Collins began offseason workouts with Giants on Monday in 
what might be a final attempt to salvage a once-promising career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people have a lot of questions about me, and I am  
excited to have to opportunity to prove them wrong,'' Collins said 
in his first official interview since signing a four-year, $16.9 
million contract as free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The move created a stir not only because the Giants released  
Danny Kanell, who led them to a division title in 1997, but because 
it also put starter Kent Graham's job in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a salary that makes him the Giants' highest-paid player,  
Collins said he understands his role as a backup. A first-round 
pick in the 1995 NFL draft, Collins also said that he is tired of 
all the negative perceptions about him, that he has taken steps to 
get his life back in order and that he has the skills to be a very 
good NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	During most of the interview Collins dealt with his  
off-the-field problems: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A bad joke in the Carolina Panthers' locker room that got him  
labeled a racist. 
</P>
<P>
	-- His release on Oct. 13 after reportedly telling then-Panthers  
coach Dom Capers that he didn't have the heart for pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	-- His arrest on drunken driving charges in Charlotte, N.C.,  
after he signed with New Orleans and returned with the Saints to 
play the Panthers two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Penn State quarterback, who led Carolina to the NFC  
title game in 1996, spoke most about his alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel alcohol certainly played a role in my life and that it  
may have played too much of a role in my life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins would not discuss the details of the racial incident,  
but it was the subject he was most passionate about. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the racial thing goes, to my dying day I will deny  
the fact that I am a racist,'' said Collins, who is white. ``I know 
what kind of person I am. I know what my beliefs are and I know how 
I feel about things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Given the chance, he said, teammates would like the man they  
found. Giants players seemed willing to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry is his own man,'' receiver Ike Hilliard said.  
``Everybody has done some things and lived their life the way they 
wanted to. He doesn't have to answer questions or hold himself 
accountable for anything he's done. He's one of my teammates. I'm 
behind him 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard from a lot of his close friends (that) he is not  
that type of guy,'' fullback Charles Way said. ``Everybody makes 
mistakes and you have to put it behind you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Way and Hilliard are black.  
</P>
<P>
	When asked about being a quitter, Collins said he never stopped  
giving his all, although there were times when it was hard to do 
that. After taking a long, hard look at himself, Collins said he 
has taken steps to correct the problems and to be less of an enigma 
than he has been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have rededicated myself to the game,'' he said. ``I realize  
that I love football and football is very important to me. To be 
quite honest, some of the things that have gone on in my personal 
life took away from what I was trying to do on the football field. 
I'm still working on things, things in my personal life that I 
needed to address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giants coach Jim Fassel insisted on Monday that Graham is his  
starter and that Collins won't be rushed into anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to play better than what he has demonstrated as a  
quarterback,'' said Fassel, who wants to work on Collins' 
fundamentals and footwork. ``It's going to take time and practicing 
and practicing and practicing.''

<HEADLINE> Pele: U.S. Will Grow in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- No less a soccer expert than Pele, merely the  
greatest player the world's most popular sport has known, sees the 
United States as a rising power heading toward the next World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking during a conference call Tuesday in which MasterCard  
announced the renewel of its World Cup sponsorship and its deal 
with Pele, Pele also criticized the conservative manner in which 
games are played these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the clinics and training in the United States, I feel  
very proud to see the growing of football in U.S.,'' said Pele, the 
company's best-known spokesman. ``When a national team has more 
experience, they have become more strong. For the next World Cup in 
three years in Japan and South Korea, no doubt the United States 
will be a good team. 
</P>
<P>
	``America beat England, Mexico, Germany, all these big teams.  
They have improved a lot since (France '98). Of course they need 
more experience and to play abroad. But no doubt today it is not 
easy to beat the American team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pele, who led Brazil to three World Cup titles, then ventured to  
New York to play for the Cosmos and build the sport in this country 
in the 1970s, would like to see a return to wide-open soccer. He's 
dismayed by the way coaches play not to lose rather than to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``People sometimes ask me as a joke this question, but it is not  
a joke, it is serious,'' he said. ``The public looks for great 
players and nice individual plays and this is difficult right now. 
The mind of the coach is to play as a team and not give the athlete 
too much space and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should work with the youth and the coaches who come  
up from the base. Those coaches treat the under-18 and under-16 
teams like they are training a professional team. They want to win 
the game, then they don't let the kids be creative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should work harder on that. If you look in the last five  
years, we have one or two names we can mention (as stars). Before, 
we would have three or four on each team. I think this is damaging 
for the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer's global ambassador, Pele has worked for MasterCard since  
1991 and will be conducting clinics and making appearances 
throughout the world in the buildup toward 2002. An an official 
sponsor, MasterCard's commitment to FIFA, the world governing body 
for soccer, and its various international tournaments will cost the 
company nearly $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A marketing source familiar with World Cup sponsorships told The  
Associated Press that MasterCard is likely to spend $130 million 
through the next three years, including what member banks spend, in 
leveraging the 2002 sponsorship. That's about $30 million more than 
MasterCard committed to the 1998 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, MasterCard finds the association with soccer works; the  
Japan-South Korea tournament will be its fourth World Cup as an 
official sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most popular sport and largest sports event in the  
world, and we are a large global brand,'' said Mava Heffler, senior 
vice president of global promotions and sponsorship for MasterCard. 
``It is a good marriage overall.''

<HEADLINE> Hamilton, James Are Beast of East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Connecticut swingman Richard Hamilton, the Big  
East player of the year last season, was selected Tuesday to share 
the award this season with Miami forward Tim James. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's Leonard Hamilton was chosen coach of the year and Notre  
Dame's Troy Murphy was selected rookie of the year in a voting of 
the league's coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	It was third time in the league's 20-year history that player of  
the year honors were shared. Chris Mullin of St. John's and Patrick 
Ewing of Georgetown did it as juniors and seniors in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, a 6-foot-6 junior, joins those two as the only players  
to win the award more than once. Mullin also won it as a sophomore 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton led the Huskies to the conference regular-season title  
and was the league's scoring leader in conference games this season 
at 22.1 points. His 1,020 points are the most any player has had 
after three years in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	James, a 6-7 senior, averaged 18.9 points and 8.3 rebounds for  
the second-place Hurricanes and this season became just the seventh 
player in league history to have 1,000 points and 500 rebounds in 
conference play. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-9 Murphy led the conference in rebounding at 10.3 -- the  
first freshman to ever do that -- and field goal percentage at .534. 
He averaged 18.9 points, which was fourth best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Hamilton, who was coach of the year in 1995, led the  
Hurricanes to a 21-5 overall mark and 15-3 in the league, easily 
the best marks since they joined the Big East in 1991. Miami was 
8-1 on the road in the conference this season, a record even more 
remarkable since the school had a total of 11 league road wins in 
its history before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse junior center Etan Thomas was chosen the league's  
defensive player of the year. Thomas, who was named the league's 
most improved player last season, averaged four blocked shots per 
game and his total of 167 has him in fifth place on the career 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami junior Johnny Hemsley, a first-team all-league choice this  
season, was selected as most improved player after averaging 17.4 
points.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Sante Fe Bus Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A bus bringing elementary school children  
back to Santa Fe from a ski outing crashed and overturned Tuesday, 
killing three people. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of students walking along the roadway. They  
were bleeding and crying and frantic,'' said Whitney Russell, 36, 
who came upon the wreck moments after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was one of three transporting elementary school students  
back to the city from the Santa Fe Ski Basin. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports said the bus that crashed was in the lead when  
the driver apparently lost control, hit a rock protruding from the 
side mountain and overturned, Undersheriff Benjie Montano said. The 
bus was found laying on its side, with the front end smashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Fe County Sheriff's Deputy Terry Delgado said one of the  
three who died was an adult. He had no information on the other 
victims. Twelve students and the bus driver were admitted to a 
hospital.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Calls Hinckley a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal prosecutor is trying again to keep  
John W. Hinckley Jr. from making short trips away from a mental 
hospital, saying the attempted presidential assassin may still be 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley recently won court permission for supervised day trips  
away from St. Elizabeths hospital, despite objections from federal 
prosecutors. Prosecutors said Hinckley remains disturbed and 
unpredictable 18 years after he tried to kill President Reagan 
shortly after he took office. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the top prosecutor for the District of Columbia asked  
a federal appeals court to reconsider its January ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the potential impact of the opinion on public  
safety presents an issue of exceptional importance, which should be 
reconsidered,'' U.S. Attorney Wilma Lewis wrote in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley, 43, has been confined to the hospital since 1982, when  
he was acquitted by reason of insanity in the 1981 shootings 
outside a Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan, his press secretary, James Brady, and two law  
enforcement officers were wounded in an attack Hinckley later said 
was an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley's doctors support supervised day trips as part of  
treatment that could eventually make Hinckley well enough to leave 
the hospital, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every doctor who has seen John in the recent past has said he  
does not present a risk of danger to the community,'' lawyer Barry 
W. Levine said Monday. ``This position advanced by the U.S. 
attorney is nothing short of fear mongering, and it is shameful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levine said the appeals judges should let the initial decision  
stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley began pressing for greater freedom more than a decade  
ago, but has never won the right to leave the hospital grounds. His 
lawyer has complained repeatedly that Hinckley is being treated 
more harshly than other patients acquitted by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a special rule for John Hinckley,'' Levine said. ``He  
knows if his name was not John Hinckley he would have had these 
privileges long ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge turned down Hinckley's request for a  
Christmastime visit with his parents and girlfriend in 1997. 
Hinckley appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia, where a three-judge panel eventually cleared the way for 
Hinckley's off-campus visits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Lewis asked the full 11-judge appeals court to  
reconsider the case. The appeals court may choose to do so, or it 
may let stand the panel's 2-1 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals panel did not rule directly on the merits of  
Hinckley's request to leave the hospital grounds. Instead, the two 
judges agreed with Hinckley's argument that decisions about such 
visits should be made by doctors, not the courts. The third judge, 
dissenting, said the courts should be involved.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Contraceptive Demand High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One night last summer, Anne Dill and her  
boyfriend had a terrifying experience: The condom broke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was freaked out, I didn't know what to do,'' recalled Dill,  
a 21-year-old senior at Colorado State University. The next day, a 
friend told her about a form of emergency contraception -- a high 
dose of birth control pills that may prevent pregnancy if taken 
within 72 hours after sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Dill called a family-planning clinic for a prescription. Two  
weeks later, her menstrual period started. ``It was a great 
feeling,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few years ago, few women knew about the ``morning-after''  
pills. Now, due largely to Preven, the first marketed emergency 
contraception kit, it is gradually becoming more mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	At family-planning clinics, inner-city medical facilities and  
college health centers, doctors say the demand for emergency 
contraception has risen dramatically in the past year. Most women 
may not know the brand Preven, but they increasingly know that 
there's help available if they have unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Some obstetricians and gynecologists are even writing Preven  
prescriptions for patients to keep on hand -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three months that the $20 Preven kits were available in  
1998, about 1.3 million were sold, according to IMS Health, a 
market data firm based in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, Planned Parenthood clinics received 28,000 requests  
for emergency contraception last year, twice the number of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There no question that the availability of a dedicated product  
raises everyone's consciousness level for emergency 
contraception,'' said Gloria Felt, president of Planned Parenthood 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	At Penn State University's main campus in State College, Pa.,  
requests for emergency contraception rose 57 percent last year to 
148. 
</P>
<P>
	Preven is made by Barr Laboratories of Pomona , N.Y., and  
marketed by Gynetics Inc., a Somerville, N.J., company that is 
spending about $30 million this year to advertise Preven. Its 
marketing campaign includes full-page ads in most women's magazines 
with the slogan: ``The condom broke. But her life stayed intact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preven pills are no different from other brand-name birth  
control pills that have been used as morning-after emergency 
contraception. But doctors say Preven is easier to use because it 
comes prepackaged in a kit that includes simple directions and a 
pregnancy test. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show Preven is 75 percent effective at preventing  
pregnancy if the pills are taken within three days of sex. By 
contrast, regular birth control pills taken properly are 99 percent 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning-after pills are different from RU-486, the French  
abortion pill, which can end a pregnancy several weeks after it has 
begun. The morning-after pills delay or prevent ovulation, meaning 
no egg enters the uterus to be fertilized. If ovulation has already 
occurred, experts theorize that the morning-after pills may prevent 
fertilization or alter the uterine lining so that a fertilized egg 
doesn't implant and develop into an embryo. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion groups vigorously protest RU-486, though they have  
been far less vocal about the morning-after pills. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Right to Life Committee said in a statement that it  
takes no position on any drug or device that acts to prevent 
fertilization, though it opposes anything that acts after that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Judie Brown, president of the American Life League of  
Stafford, Va., said morning-after pills are ``nothing more than an 
early abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Preven debuted without much political fanfare, Gynetics  
has come under scrutiny for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration, which approved Preven on Sept.  
2, accused Gynetics in January of using false and misleading 
advertising because the materials ``imply that Preven is an 
alternative to regular contraceptive use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gynetics officials say they are in discussions with the agency  
about the ads' language. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA also accused the company of minimizing the drug's side  
effects of nausea and vomiting. Gynetics is working on a second 
generation Preven that would reduce the nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Another company, Women's Capital Corp., of Washington, D.C.,  
last month applied to the FDA to get approval for its as yet 
unnamed emergency contraception. Women's Capital officials say its 
pill would have fewer side effects and be more effective than 
Preven. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA, which is known for restricting drugs into the U.S.  
market, was a catalyst for Preven. In 1995, the agency joined 
several women's health groups in seeking a company to market 
emergency contraception. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, public health officials felt hindered in getting the  
message out about morning-after contraception as doctors worried 
about abortion politics, and patients did not know to ask for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Large drugmakers, such as Johnson and Johnson, parent of birth  
control pill manufacturer Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, showed no 
interest. But Gynetics, which is headed by former Ortho President 
Roderick Mackenzie jumped at the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials were driven by one goal: Reducing the more than  
2.7 million unintended pregnancies each year in the United States. 
About half are due to contraceptive failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Carolyn Westhoff, medical director of a women's clinic at  
New York Presbyterian Hospital, gives prescriptions for Preven to 
her patients even if they don't ask. ``This way, patients are 
prepared in advance,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after using emergency contraception, Dill has no  
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only other option was not taking it and having an unwanted  
pregnancy. It would have been worse to have a baby that I did not 
want, or have an abortion,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, emergency contraception may become as easy to buy as  
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
	A government project in Seattle that started last spring permits  
pharmacists to prescribe the pills directly to women. In nine 
months ended last December, more than 6,000 prescriptions were 
written.

<HEADLINE> Jail for Landlord Who Hired Hitman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A landlord who admitted hiring a hit man to kill  
two of his tenants so he could raise the rent on their apartments 
has been sentenced to seven to 14 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvin Weiss, 46, was sentenced Monday and must serve at least  
seven years before he is eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The two murder targets, who lived in one of Weiss' 22 Manhattan  
buildings, were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss pleaded guilty in January to attempted murder, attempted  
arson and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted that he bailed a man out of jail in 1997 and paid  
him to kill the two tenants by giving them overdoses of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	The would-be assassin, who received about $4,000, instead  
revealed the plot to police and recorded a damning conversation 
with Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss would have faced up to 25 years had he been convicted  
after trial. Prosecutors said they agreed to a plea deal because 
Weiss had no criminal record and because they wanted to spare the 
tenants from the rigors of testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, when a tenant leaves a rent controlled apartment,  
the landlord is allowed by law to raise the rent charged to the 
next tenant.

<HEADLINE> NFL May Rotate Thanksgiving Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions again are defending  
their 64-year-old tradition of playing host to Thanksgiving Day 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. said he learned Monday that  
NFL owners will discuss the possibility of rotating the two 
Thanksgiving Day games among all 31 teams, rather than just Detroit 
and the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch, which would be effective with the 2000 season, is on  
the owners' agenda for their meetings March 14-18 in Phoenix. And 
they can expect an all-out fight against it from the Lions, said 
Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never give up without a good fight, and I think I've  
got some pretty good ammo on my side,'' Ford told the Detroit Free 
Press for Tuesday's editions. ``We've got some pretty powerful 
people here in Michigan, and I'm going to leave no stone unturned. 
I'm going to have a scorched-earth policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal to rotate the Thanksgiving games including Dallas'  
-- itself a tradition since 1966 -- is backed by owners Lamar Hunt of 
the Kansas City Chiefs and Tom Benson of the New Orleans Saints. It 
would need support by 24 of the 31 owners to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar proposal by Hunt was shot down in 1995 after Ford  
enlisted the support of his family's own Ford Motor Co. and the 
other two Big Three automakers, who are major NFL advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford hinted Monday that the automakers might be part of another  
defense of the Lions' Thanksgiving game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll see some interesting forces marshaled here,''  
he told the Detroit News.

<HEADLINE>  Giants QB Denies Being Racist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Being the New York Giants' starting  
quarterback isn't Kerry Collins' top priority right now. 
</P>
<P>
	He's just not ready yet. There are football fundamentals he has  
to develop again, and some off-the-field problems to dealt with, 
some real and some perceived. 
</P>
<P>
	Denying he is racist and saying he is addressing an alcohol  
problem, Collins began offseason workouts with Giants on Monday in 
what might be a final attempt to salvage a once-promising career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people have a lot of questions about me, and I am  
excited to have to opportunity to prove them wrong,'' Collins said 
in his first official interview since signing a four-year, $16.9 
million contract as free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The move created a stir not only because the Giants released  
Danny Kanell, who led them to a division title in 1997, but because 
it also put starter Kent Graham's job in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a salary that makes him the Giants' highest-paid player,  
Collins said he understands his role as a backup. A first-round 
pick in the 1995 NFL draft, Collins also said that he is tired of 
all the negative perceptions about him, that he has taken steps to 
get his life back in order and that he has the skills to be a very 
good NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	During most of the interview Collins dealt with his  
off-the-field problems: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A bad joke in the Carolina Panthers' locker room that got him  
labeled a racist. 
</P>
<P>
	-- His release on Oct. 13 after reportedly telling then-Panthers  
coach Dom Capers that he didn't have the heart for pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	-- His arrest on drunken driving charges in Charlotte, N.C.,  
after he signed with New Orleans and returned with the Saints to 
play the Panthers two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Penn State quarterback, who led Carolina to the NFC  
title game in 1996, spoke most about his alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel alcohol certainly played a role in my life and that it  
may have played too much of a role in my life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins would not discuss the details of the racial incident,  
but it was the subject he was most passionate about. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the racial thing goes, to my dying day I will deny  
the fact that I am a racist,'' said Collins, who is white. ``I know 
what kind of person I am. I know what my beliefs are and I know how 
I feel about things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Given the chance, he said, teammates would like the man they  
found. Giants players seemed willing to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry is his own man,'' receiver Ike Hilliard said.  
``Everybody has done some things and lived their life the way they 
wanted to. He doesn't have to answer questions or hold himself 
accountable for anything he's done. He's one of my teammates. I'm 
behind him 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard from a lot of his close friends (that) he is not  
that type of guy,'' fullback Charles Way said. ``Everybody makes 
mistakes and you have to put it behind you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Way and Hilliard are black.  
</P>
<P>
	When asked about being a quitter, Collins said he never stopped  
giving his all, although there were times when it was hard to do 
that. After taking a long, hard look at himself, Collins said he 
has taken steps to correct the problems and to be less of an enigma 
than he has been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have rededicated myself to the game,'' he said. ``I realize  
that I love football and football is very important to me. To be 
quite honest, some of the things that have gone on in my personal 
life took away from what I was trying to do on the football field. 
I'm still working on things, things in my personal life that I 
needed to address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giants coach Jim Fassel insisted on Monday that Graham is his  
starter and that Collins won't be rushed into anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to play better than what he has demonstrated as a  
quarterback,'' said Fassel, who wants to work on Collins' 
fundamentals and footwork. ``It's going to take time and practicing 
and practicing and practicing.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Jumps on Frost Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wheat futures jumped nearly 4 percent on the Chicago Board of  
Trade Tuesday, rallying for a second day as forecasts for 
below-normal temperatures this weekend in major winter-wheat 
growing regions deepened concerns about crop damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also advanced strongly. On other markets,  
cocoa tumbled to its lowest level in nearly three years, while 
crude gained. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat rallied as market participants noted recent dryness in the  
Plains has left crops emerging from winter dormancy particularly 
vulnerable to just such a cold snap that is forecast to arrive in 
the area by week's end. The National Weather Service and private 
forecasters are calling for below to sharply-below normal 
temperatures in areas that account for some 75 percent of the 
nation's total wheat production. 
</P>
<P>
	Warmer weather has helped some of the crop emerge early from the  
ground, leaving a larger portion vulnerable to late-season frosts 
because of a lack of insulating ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains were made on the back of a sharp advance on Monday  
tied to an improved outlook -- at least in the near-term -- for 
export business. Egypt over the weekend made a large purchase, 
while Pakistan was considering buying about 300,000 metric tons 
from either the United States, Australia or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans benefited from heavy fund house buying as  
investors rushed to cover positions following Monday's unexpectedly 
strong rally. Soybeans advanced after the government reported 
export inspections jumped 14 percents last week, although market 
participants expected gains to be limited today on reports of 
increased exports from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, dry weather in South America and parts of South  
Africa could hinder late production, reducing overall yields, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery rose 9 cents to $2.63 3/4 a bushel; May corn  
rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.15 3/4 a bushel; May soybeans rose 8 1/2 cents to 
$4.71 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa fell to its lowest in nearly three years on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York amid few takers for crops arriving 
from Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world's largest producing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The peak consumption period, in which chocolate makers buy cocoa  
to make their goods, is winding down as most complete Easter 
holiday production. The heavy buying season is not expected to 
increase dramatically until late summer, when manufacturers begin 
gearing up for Halloween candy-making. 
</P>
<P>
	May cocoa fell $48 to $1,241 a ton.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures gained on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
amid speculation U.S. airstrikes on communications centers in 
northern Iraq had damaged a key oil pipeline and delayed pumping 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British planes, which patrol no-fly zones over northern  
and southern Iraq, have been striking Iraqi targets almost daily 
since late December. The allies have said they are attacking 
military targets in response to Iraq firing at the planes or 
locking its radar systems on to them. 
</P>
<P>
	April light sweet crude rose 27 cents to $12.51 a barrel; April  
heating oil rose .54 cent 32.48 cents a gallon; April unleaded 
gasoline rose .66 cent to 38.44 cents a gallon.

<HEADLINE>  Orlando Cepeda Makes Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Orlando Cepeda, the Baby Bull who earned his  
reputation with a big bat, and three others were elected to the 
Hall of Fame today by the Veterans Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Former umpire Nestor Chylak, turn-of-the-century manager Frank  
Selee and Negro Leagues pitcher Smokey Joe Williams also were 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member Veterans panel, which included Ted Williams and  
Stan Musial, passed over Bill Mazeroski, Dom DiMaggio, former 
manager Dick Williams and umpire Doug Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates needed 75 percent -- nine votes -- for election. Voting  
totals were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies will be held July 25 at Cooperstown, N.Y.  
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were elected in January by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda was the NL's rookie of the year in 1958 with San  
Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. He hit .297 with 379 home runs and 1,365 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election  
five years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last 
year in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Cepeda was arrested at an airport on charges of trying  
to pick up 160 pounds of marijuana. He was sentenced to five years 
and served 10 months -- widely believed to have worked against him 
in previous bids for the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope this time I make it,'' said Cepeda, a community  
relations representative for the San Francisco Giants. ``It would 
be the highest thing. It's hard to describe how much it would 
mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda played on great Giants teams with Willie Mays, Willie  
McCovey and Juan Marichal, all of them Hall of Famers. Marichal was 
on the Veterans panel that picked Cepeda. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda's father, Pedro, was called ``The Bull'' and also the  
``Babe Ruth of Puerto Rico.'' Cepeda joins Roberto Clemente as the 
only Hall of Famers born in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Tupperware Stretches Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Until Pam Parish attended a Tupperware  
party last year, she hadn't been able to find the plastic utensils 
and food storage products in ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Mrs. Parish, a 35-year-old teacher's aide and mother  
of two children, has been rapidly filling her kitchen with 
containers, bowls and modular mates. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time you didn't hear about anybody having a  
Tupperware party,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware has taken Ms. Parish's predicament to heart.  
</P>
<P>
	For many, Tupperware demonstrations are a throwback to an  
earlier generation when TV's Donna Reed was the standard-bearer of 
domestic rectitude. But the changing customer base of working 
mothers with limited time, as well as economic turmoil in 
international markets and a lack of confidence by investors, has 
resulted in declining sales and a plummeting stock price over the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	So the company that popularized at-home sales demonstrations in  
the 1940s has gone beyond its decades-old tradition of selling its 
wares only at Tupperware parties. Tupperware products are moving 
into shopping mall kiosks, onto the Internet and into television 
infomercials in order to make them more accessible to people who 
want them, but can't find them. 
</P>
<P>
	The products also have been modernized with bright colors and  
new features, including characters from Disney movies under a 
two-year-old partnership with the entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company is saying 'Look, it's 1999. We have to figure out  
how to reach more people. We have to get it in their hands,''' Lisa 
Humphreys, a Tupperware sales manager, said after a recent 
demonstration at Ms. Parish's home in Leesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	The company began allowing sales representatives to sell  
Tupperware products at kiosks in a handful of Orlando shopping 
malls last Christmas and plans to expand to other markets this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	It also began airing infomercials for the first time last year  
and promises that customers will be able to buy Tupperware products 
over the Internet by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware's problems, however, run deeper than not being able  
to get their products into potential customers' hands. 
</P>
<P>
	With 85 percent of its sales coming from outside the United  
States, Tupperware has been buffeted by the economic crises in Asia 
and Latin America. The company, which had $1.08 billion in sales 
last year, has seen revenue slip by more than 10 percent during 
each of the past two years, in part because of currency 
devaluations and the weakened purchasing power of non-U.S. 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Conceding that Tupperware has historically been slow to change,  
chairman and chief executive Rick Goings said the new measures will 
supplement, not replace, the direct sales made at Tupperware 
parties by a million-person sales force in more than 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This enhances attendance at our parties. It helps our core  
direct-selling business,'' Goings said at Tupperware's sprawling, 
100-acre headquarters in Kissimmee. ``We've been fighting stranded 
customers. There is a pent-up demand for the product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware is coming to the changes with a great deal of  
reluctance because the company doesn't want to offend its sales 
force, said Budd Bugatch, an analyst who follows Tupperware for 
Raymond James in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware officials don't want to do anything ``that could be  
perceived or used against them as denigrating or slapping their 
existing distributorship in the face,'' Bugatch said. ``But they 
need a higher level of sales, particularly in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall sales slipped by almost 12 percent to $1.08 billion in  
1998. Only the United States, its smallest market, posted a gain (6 
percent) from the previous year. Sales in Asia and Latin America 
decreased by 24 percent and sales in Europe decreased by slightly 
more than 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company is still profitable, its income in 1998  
dwindled to $69.1 million, a 39 percent decrease from the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have also lost confidence in the company since it went  
public in 1996 as a spin-off of Premark International Inc. 
Tupperware stock has fallen from a high of $55.50 in December 1996 
to a low of around $11 last year. It is currently selling for 
around $18. 
</P>
<P>
	Goings attributed the volatility to the hype surrounding the  
initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Tupperware is moving into shopping mall kiosks, don't  
expect any full-fledged Tupperware stores anytime soon. Over the 
decades, Bugatch said, the company has learned that its products 
don't do well at retailers because it's pricier than the 
competition and management believes the products need to be 
demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
	But the demonstrations fulfill a greater need than just sales,  
Goings said. Most women of an earlier generation learned their 
homemaking skills from watching mothers or grandmothers. In today's 
mobile society where parents and grandparents live across country 
from their children and grandchildren, women are looking to people 
like Martha Stewart for those skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of a local Tupperware woman is being a local Martha  
Stewart,'' Goings said. 
</P>
<P>
	To a certain extent, Mrs. Humphreys, the 33-year-old sales  
manager, feels she is fulfilling that role as she talks about 
recipes, offers health tips and shows off the latest microwaveable 
casserole dish in Mrs. Parish's living room. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour demonstration is interspersed with Mrs. Humphreys  
asking trivia questions about food and cooking. The women who 
answer correctly get fake $100 bills they can use to buy Tupperware 
goods during an auction after the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tupperware is a relationship business,'' Mrs. Humphreys said.  
``The kiosks are for people who don't know where to get it from.''

<HEADLINE>  Cepeda, Maz Hope Hall Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For years, Orlando Cepeda enjoyed playing in a  
lineup with Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Juan Marichal. 
</P>
<P>
	Today he's hoping to join his former teammates in the Hall of  
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, Bill Mazeroski and former manager Dick Williams are  
expected to attract the most attention when the Veterans Committee 
holds its annual vote in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Results are to be announced at 2 p.m. EST. Either Cepeda or  
Mazeroski can be picked, but not both of them -- and perhaps 
neither. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to get very nervous,'' Cepeda said last week  
from his California home. ``I've been waiting so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dom DiMaggio and umpires Doug Harvey and Nestor Chylak also will  
be among the top candidates, as will turn-of-the-century manager 
Frank Selee. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a special adviser to the New York Yankees, was at  
their spring training camp Monday, about 10 minutes from where the 
Vets were to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't control it, so I don't worry about it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, Stan Musial and Yogi Berra are on the panel, down  
to 12 members this year from its normal 15. It will take 75 percent 
-- nine votes -- for election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vets can pick up to four new Hall of Famers, one from each  
of four categories. 
</P>
<P>
	The categories are: former major leaguers, Negro leaguers, 19th  
century players and personnel, plus a composite of managers, 
umpires, executives and Negro leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Negro leagues stars Smokey Joe Williams, Biz Mackey and Turkey  
Stearnes each drew support in last year's vote. The committee chose 
Larry Doby, Lee MacPhail, ``Bullet'' Joe Rogan and ``Gorgeous'' 
George Davis last March. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies will be held July 25 at Cooperstown, N.Y.  
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were elected in January by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda was the NL's rookie of the year in 1958 with San  
Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. Nicknamed the Baby Bull and Cha-Cha, he hit .297 with 379 
home runs and 1,365 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	His 379 homers tie him with Tony Perez, a slugger often  
overshadowed by teammates such as Pete Rose, Johnny Bench and Joe 
Morgan. Like Cepeda, Perez has not been elected to the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Tony made everybody great,'' Cepeda said. ``He was a  
magnificent player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election  
five years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last 
year in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope this time I make it,'' said Cepeda, a community  
relations representative for the San Francisco Giants. ``It would 
be the highest thing. It's hard to describe how much it would 
mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski batted just .260 with 138 homers and 853 RBIs for  
Pittsburgh, but hit one of the most famous home runs ever -- a 
bottom-of-the-ninth shot in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series to beat 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski made his mark in the field, winning eight Gold Gloves  
and taking part in 1,706 double plays, most in history among major 
league second basemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they consider defense, I got a chance,'' said Mazeroski,  
now 62 and working for the Pirates as a spring instructor. ``But if 
they don't, I don't have a chance at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, at 82 the younger brother of Joe, hit .298 in 11  
seasons as an outfielder for the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, Mazeroski and DiMaggio all have strong supporters on the  
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda is endorsed by Marichal and Mazeroski is boosted his  
former Pirates general manager, committee chairman Joe Brown. 
DiMaggio is supported by Ted Williams, his longtime teammate on the 
Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans panel is down to 12 because of the retirement of  
longtime executive Buzzie Bavasi and the health of writer Leonard 
Koppett and Hall of Fame shortstop Pee Wee Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Williams has gotten support in the past. He was 1,571-1,451  
(.520) with Boston, Oakland, California, Montreal, San Diego and 
Seattle and went to the four World Series, winning two of them.

Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. Nicknamed the Baby Bull and Cha-Cha, he hit .297 with 379 
home runs and 1,365 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	His 379 homers tie him with Tony Perez, a slugger often  
overshadowed by teammates such as Pete Rose, Johnny Bench and Joe 
Morgan. Like Cepeda, Perez has not been elected to the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Tony made everybody great,'' Cepeda said. ``He was a  
magnificent player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election  
five years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last 
year in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope this time I make it,'' said Cepeda, a community  
relations representative for the San Francisco Giants. ``It would 
be the highest thing. It's hard to describe how much it would 
mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski batted just .260 with 138 homers and 853 RBIs for  
Pittsburgh, but hit one of the most famous home runs ever -- a 
bottom-of-the-ninth shot in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series to beat 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski made his mark in the field, winning eight Gold Gloves  
and taking part in 1,706 double plays, most in history among major 
league second basemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they consider defense, I got a chance,'' said Mazeroski,  
now 62 and working for the Pirates as a spring instructor. ``But if 
they don't, I don't have a chance at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, at 82 the younger brother of Joe, hit .298 in 11  
seasons as an outfielder for the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, Mazeroski and DiMaggio all have strong supporters on the  
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda is endorsed by Marichal and Mazeroski is boosted his  
former Pirates general manager, committee chairman Joe Brown. 
DiMaggio is supported by Ted Williams, his longtime teammate on the 
Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans panel is down to 12 because of the retirement of  
longtime executive Buzzie Bavasi and the health of writer Leonard 
Koppett and Hall of Fame shortstop Pee Wee Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Williams has gotten support in the past. He was 1,571-1,451  
(.520) with Boston, Oakland, California, Montreal, San Diego and 
Seattle and went to the four World Series, winning two of them.

<HEADLINE> Retailers Report Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dayton Hudson's earnings jumped 19 percent in the fourth quarter  
largely on increased sales at its Target discount stores. Federated 
Department Stores' quarterly profit rose a more modest 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Both retailer's reports Tuesday beat Wall Street expectations.  

</P>
<P>
 *Dayton Hudson Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson, the nation's fifth biggest  
retailer, earned $423 million, or 90 cents per share, in the 
November-January period compared with $356 million, or 76 cents per 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter increased to $10.14 billion from $8.95  
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Its earnings excluding onetime charges came to 97 cents a share  
for the quarter, beating the 90 cents a share average expected by 
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayton Hudson's stock fell $2.25 to $61.87 1/2 a share in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Target's fourth-quarter profits before taxes and extraordinary  
items increased 26 percent while pre-tax profits in the department 
store division increased 12 percent. Mervyn's stores pre-tax 
profits held steady. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Dayton Hudson earnings rose to $935 million,  
or $1.98 a share, from $751 million, or $1.59 a share, in 1997. 
Revenues rose to $30.95 billion from $27.76 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive, said he expects to  
post higher sales and earnings this year for a fourth consecutive 
year. 

</P>
<P>
 *Federated Department Stores Inc.    	

</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based retailer, ranked 11th largest in the U.S.,  
earned $408 million, or $1.88 per share, for the quarter ending 
Jan. 30, compared with $379 million, or $1.66 per share, the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Net sales for the quarter totaled $5.2 billion, up 3 percent  
from $5.1 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts had expected quarterly earnings of $1.82  
per share from the parent of the Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Stern's 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Its shares were up 75 cents a share at $40.06 1/4 in trading on  
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated Chairman James Zimmerman said strong sales, good  
inventory management and continued cuts in expenses contributed to 
the increased earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Federated reported net income of $662 million, or  
$2.96 per share, compared with earnings of $536 million, or $2.41 
per share, in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the year rose 1 percent to $15.8 billion from $15.7  
billion for the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated operates more than 400 department stores in 33 states.  
Other store names include The Bon Marche, Burdines, Goldsmith's, 
Lazarus and Rich's. Federated also operates direct mail catalog and 
electronic commerce subsidiaries under the names of Bloomingdale's 
By Mail, Macy's By Mail and Macys.Com.

<HEADLINE>  Ariz. Gov. Rejects Execution Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- Gov. Jane Hull rejected a state panel's  
recommendation that a German man scheduled to be executed Wednesday 
get a 60-day reprieve to allow his government to appeal to the 
International Court of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interest of justice and with the victims in mind, I  
have decided to allow this execution to go forward as scheduled,'' 
Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Board of Executive Clemency on Tuesday refused to  
reduce Walter LaGrand's death sentence to life without parole but 
voted 2-1 for the reprieve recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	LaGrand, 37, was the second of two German brothers condemned to  
die for stabbing a bank manager to death during a botched robbery 
in 1982. His brother Karl, 35, was executed last week by injection 
after appeal efforts failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemency Board Chairman Edward Leyva said the board took the  
action to give the German government time to appeal to the court, 
also known as the World Court, in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Tuesday, Germany asked the court to try to halt the  
execution, accusing the United States of failing to advise LaGrand 
of his right to consular assistance during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany asked court to find the United States guilty of  
violating the Vienna Conventions, to release LaGrand and to pay 
reparations for the execution of his brother. The court has no 
enforcement powers and relies on voluntary compliance with its 
rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were born in Augsburg, Germany and moved to  
southern Arizona as small children. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brothers requested they be executed in the gas chamber in  
an effort to get the method ruled cruel and unusual, and therefore, 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal maneuver worked for a short time for Karl, when the  
9th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the execution. But hours later, 
the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the stay. He then changed his 
mind and asked for injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter LaGrand would be the first person to die in Arizona's gas  
chamber since voters approved use of lethal injection in 1992. On 
Monday, he rejected the state's offer to die by injection.

<HEADLINE>  MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tom Seaver and Yogi Berra finally returned to spring training  
for the New York teams they starred on. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, the Hall of Fame catcher who had boycotted the New York  
Yankees since George Steinbrenner fired him 14 years ago, attended 
an intrasquad game in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tremendous. It's a great feeling,'' said Steinbrenner,  
who wants Berra at the regular-season home opener against Detroit 
on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner apologized two months ago for firing Berra after a  
slow start in April 1985. Berra has not been back to the ballpark 
for a Yankees game since. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called, he wanted to apologize and he said the right thing.  
If he didn't, I wouldn't be here,'' Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't commit to the home opener, but made clear he's  
likely to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what happens,'' Berra said, adding, ``Let's keep it  
a secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, the Hall of Fame right-hander who has spent the last 11  
years away from the team, arrived at camp in Port St. Lucie, Fla., 
in his new role as special instructor for the team's pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just look at him and are kind of overwhelmed,'' said Jason  
Isringhausen, one of Seaver's first pupils. ``I will listen to 
anything he says to me. It is a total respect thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, who also will broadcast the team's games this season,  
said he is anxious to help out wherever he can, especially with 
Hideo Nomo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing about Nomo that is on my checklist is to see  
what he is like at his release point,'' Seaver said. ``All the 
other stuff can be superfluous, but the more the movement, the more 
the release point becomes inconsistent and fatigue can set in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like watching Arnold Palmer swing a golf club. You  
say a guy can't swing that way, but when he gets to the contact 
point, he's in the right spot. It might be the same way with 
Nomo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa also arrived at spring training Monday, three days  
after most of his teammates made it to Cubs' camp in Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel happy,'' he said. ``Everybody is here waiting for  
me. I love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire won the home run race 70-66, but Sosa helped the  
Chicago Cubs reach the playoffs by hitting .308 with 158 RBIs. Sosa 
spent a whirlwind offseason traveling the world, picking up awards, 
working for Dominican Republic hurricane relief and making public 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in Japan, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, New York, Los Angeles,  
Arizona, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Washington, D.C., where he helped 
light the national Christmas tree and attended the State of the 
Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, McGwire went on vacation to Australia and made  
almost no personal appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied because 66 is a lot of home runs and lot of  
people wanted to shake my hand,'' Sosa said. ``I've been meeting a 
lot of people I would have never dreamed about. The nicer you are 
to people, the more they want to be around you. I think I have 
earned that respect from everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other camp news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Boston Red Sox said they may be interested in signing ace  
pitcher Pedro Martinez's brother Ramon, who is recovering from 
shoulder surgery. ``He was pretty positive about maybe signing 
here,'' said Pedro, who spoke Saturday to Ramon. Boston GM Dan 
Duquette went to Santo Domingo two weeks ago to watch Ramon throw 
in his comeback from the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- McGwire won't make his spring debut until Saturday, when the  
Cardinals play in Jupiter, Fla., against Montreal. McGwire won't 
make the 90-minute bus trip to Vero Beach for St. Louis' spring 
opener against Los Angeles on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Giants left fielder Barry Bonds was back at work after missing  
most of workouts Sunday because of spasms in his lower back. Bonds 
took turns in the batting cage, hitting line drives into the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Clearwater, Fla., negotiations broke down between Bobby  
Abreu's agent and the Philadelphia Phillies, who don't expect to 
get their starting right fielder signed to a multiyear contract 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Todd Helton, the runner-up in last year's NL rookie of the  
year voting, will sign a four-year, $12 million contract with the 
Colorado Rockies on Tuesday. Sources said Helton will make $750,000 
in 1999, $1.3 million in 2000, $4.95 million in 2001 and $5 million 
in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Once Jose Rijo's baseball academy in the Dominican Republic is  
complete, he intends to try to resurrect his baseball career one 
more time. Despite nearly four years of elbow operations and 
waylaid comeback attempts, Rijo isn't ready to retire. He said 
Monday that he hopes to sign another minor league contract with the 
Cincinnati Reds in a few weeks, once he's done supervising 
construction on the academy.

<HEADLINE> Gas Leak Empties Reagan Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A natural gas line rupture forced authorities  
to evacuate the Ronald Reagan Building on Tuesday just moments 
before Defense Secretary William Cohen was to deliver a speech 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	After emergency sirens sounded and the public address system  
warned of a ``fire emergency,'' Cohen and more than 100 others, 
including dozens of European military and defense officials, were 
sent out of the building on Pennsylvania Avenue, a few blocks from 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen returned to the Pentagon a short time later without  
delivering the speech. The leak was quickly fixed, and people were 
allowed back into the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said a construction worker struck a three-inch gas  
line in an alley between the Reagan building and the John Wilson 
District Building shortly before 10 a.m. The Wilson Building is 
under renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no injuries.

<HEADLINE>  Orlando Cepeda Makes Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Orlando Cepeda, the Baby Bull who earned his  
reputation with a big bat, and three others were elected to the 
Hall of Fame today by the Veterans Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Former umpire Nestor Chylak, turn-of-the-century manager Frank  
Selee and Negro Leagues pitcher Smokey Joe Williams also were 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member Veterans panel, which included Ted Williams and  
Stan Musial, passed over Bill Mazeroski, Dom DiMaggio, former 
manager Dick Williams and umpire Doug Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates needed 75 percent -- nine votes -- for election. Voting  
totals were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies will be held July 25 at Cooperstown, N.Y.  
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were elected in January by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda was the NL's rookie of the year in 1958 with San  
Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. He hit .297 with 379 home runs and 1,365 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election  
five years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last 
year in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Cepeda was arrested at an airport on charges of trying  
to pick up 160 pounds of marijuana. He was sentenced to five years

<HEADLINE>  Ariz. Gov. Rejects Execution Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- Gov. Jane Hull rejected a state panel's  
recommendation that a German man scheduled to be executed Wednesday 
get a 60-day reprieve to allow his government to appeal to the 
International Court of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interest of justice and with the victims in mind, I  
have decided to allow this execution to go forward as scheduled,'' 
Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Board of Executive Clemency on Tuesday refused to  
reduce Walter LaGrand's death sentence to life without parole but 
voted 2-1 for the reprieve recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	LaGrand, 37, was the second of two German brothers condemned to  
die for stabbing a bank manager to death during a botched robbery 
in 1982. His brother Karl, 35, was executed last week by injection 
after appeal efforts failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemency Board Chairman Edward Leyva said the board took the  
action to give the German government time to appeal to the court, 
also known as the World Court, in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Tuesday, Germany asked the court to try to halt the  
execution, accusing the United States of failing to advise LaGrand 
of his right to consular assistance during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany asked court to find the United States guilty of  
violating the Vienna Conventions, to release LaGrand and to pay 
reparations for the execution of his brother. The court has no 
enforcement powers and relies on voluntary compliance with its 
rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were born in Augsburg, Germany and moved to  
southern Arizona as small children. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brothers requested they be executed in the gas chamber in  
an effort to get the method ruled cruel and unusual, and therefore, 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal maneuver worked for a short time for Karl, when the  
9th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the execution. But hours later, 
the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the stay. He then changed his 
mind and asked for injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter LaGrand would be the first person to die in Arizona's gas  
chamber since voters approved use of lethal injection in 1992. On 
Monday, he rejected the state's offer to die by injection.

<HEADLINE> NBC Declares Victory in Feb. Sweeps / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC declared victory Tuesday in the crucial  
February ratings ``sweeps'' period, defeating its network rivals on 
the strength of its Thursday hits and miniseries ``Alice in 
Wonderland'' and ``The '60's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeps, when television ratings are watched closely to set local  
advertising rates, end Wednesday night. But the final standings 
aren't likely to be changed by the last two evenings, even taking 
into account ABC's interview with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's victory came despite losing last week's prime-time ratings  
race to CBS, according to Nielsen Media Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Through Sunday night, NBC had a 10.1 rating and 16 share for the  
month, CBS was second at 9.8 and 16, ABC had an 8.2 and 13, Fox had 
a 7.1 and 11, the WB had a 3.5 and 5 and UPN was at 2.1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa said the surge in  
viewership on certain nights over the last few weeks was good news 
for all television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you provide good programming, you can certainly increase  
the network shares,'' he said. ``We think the networks are really 
in a good position right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Moonves, president and CEO of CBS Television,  
congratulated NBC but also took a swipe at his competitor, saying 
NBC relied on a ``great amount of stunting'' to win sweeps. He 
referred to the successful miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa said NBC, unlike CBS, stuck to the schedule it set at the  
start of the year and didn't rely on any last-minute 
reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC and Fox were both down in comparison with the November  
sweeps, but that could change for ABC. ``It ain't over until the 
intern sings,'' quipped ABC Entertainment President Stu Bloomberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Big events proved successful for the networks last week. CBS's  
airing of the Grammy Awards, while down slightly from last year, 
was the fourth most-watched show of the week behind the NBC 
Thursday night troika of ``ER,'' ``Frasier'' and ``Friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part one of NBC's ``Alice in Wonderland'' finished sixth for the  
week for NBC, although its ratings couldn't quite match the level 
of last May's ``Merlin.'' ABC was successful with its Sonny and 
Cher TV movie, ``And the Beat Goes On,'' and CBS hit with ``Too 
Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 10.6 rating and 17 share, the highest  
weekly rating for a network this year excluding Super Bowl week. 
NBC had a 10.0 and 16, ABC had an 8.2 and 13 and Fox had a 7.6 and 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 3.5 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 1.9 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' dominated the evening news competition  
with a 9.0 rating and 18 share, its widest margin over CBS in 
nearly two years and over ABC in one year. ABC's ``World News 
Tonight'' had an 8.1 rating and 16 share and the ``CBS Evening 
News'' was at 7.5 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 22-28, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 20.2; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 17.7; ``Friends,'' NBC,  
17.6; ``The Grammy Awards,'' CBS, 16.6; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 15.0; ``NBC 
Sunday Night Movie: Alice in Wonderland,'' NBC, 14.8; ``Veronica's 
Closet,'' NBC, 14.3; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 14.2; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 14.1; ``Home Improvement,'' ABC, 12.9.

<HEADLINE> CART Driver Recovers From Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILLIARD, Ohio (AP) -- Bryan Herta, who drives for Team Rahal in  
the CART series, will be sidelined at least a week while recovering 
from an emergency appendectomy, the team announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation occurred Monday at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial  
Hospital in Herta's hometown of Valencia, Calif. The team's general 
manager, Scott Roembke, said Herta was resting comfortably at home 
and is expected to be driving in the season's opening race March 21 
at Homestead, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Herta, 28, was hospitalized after suffering abdominal pains late  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be in his fourth year with Team Rahal and sixth year on  
the CART circuit this season. Max Papis will replace Bobby Rahal as 
the other driver for the team, based in this Columbus suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Rahal retired as a driver at the end of last year after 16 CART  
seasons and remains the team's principal owner, with comedian David 
Letterman as minority owner.

<HEADLINE> Va. Minister Accused in Murder Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STERLING, Va. (AP) -- Police have arrested a minister who  
allegedly approached a parishioner and offered to kill his wife -- 
if the man killed his. 
</P>
<P>
	James Ogle, 46, has been charged with attempted murder and  
solicitation to commit a felony. If convicted of both, he could get 
25 years in prison. The parishioner, whose name was not released, 
turned Ogle in to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogle's court-appointed attorney, William Baker, had not spoken  
with his client Tuesday and police spokeswoman Kim Chinn refused to 
discuss a motive or when the alleged offer was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogle asked the parishioner to use a gun and promised to kill  
that man's wife after Judy Ogle was killed, Ms. Chinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Abel, a neighbor of the Ogles, said the couple has four  
children, and that Mrs. Ogle provides day care for about four 
preschool children. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Abel said the minister and his wife seemed to have  
financial problems since Ogle's church, Bull Run Bible Fellowship 
in Manassas, closed in January, but there was no hint of marital 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than something snapping in that man's head, I can't  
imagine what went on,'' Mrs. Abel said.

<HEADLINE> Head of NOAA Corps Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rear Adm. William L. Stubblefield, director of  
the NOAA Corps, the nation's smallest uniformed service, has 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Stubblefield left office effective Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has nominated Capt. Evelyn Fields to succeed  
Stubblefield and she is awaiting Senate confirmation. In the 
meantime, Adm. John C. Albright is serving as acting corps 
commander. 
</P>
<P>
	NOAA Corps, with about 400 officers, operates and manages the  
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's fleet of 
environmental research and survey ships and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Head of NOAA Corps since 1995, Stubblefield shepherded the NOAA  
Corps through troubled times, when it faced a four-year recruitment 
freeze and was targeted for dismantling. 
</P>
<P>
	Stubblefield joined NOAA Corps in 1971 as a lieutenant,  
following a six-year stint in the Navy and graduate school at the 
University of Iowa, where he received a master's degree in geology.

	Senate To Help With Y2K Glitches  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate moved to help small businesses deal  
with Year 2000 computer crashes as part of a ``Y2K Day'' devoted to 
making people more aware of the problems that could arise from 
computers not prepared for the new millennium. The panel voted 99-0 
to pass a bill that would funnel federal loans to small businesses 
to help them get their computers ready. The Senate says big 
businesses may have the wherewithal to prevent the problem, but 
estimates that 750,000 small businesses could be crippled.

	Paper: U.S. Used UN To Spy on Iraq

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S intelligence agents operating under the  
guise of U.N. arms control inspectors spied on the Iraq military 
for three years, The Washington Post reported today. The newspaper 
said the U.N. Special Commission was not aware it had been 
infiltrated and did not authorize or benefit from the operation. 
Clinton administration officials have acknowledged gaining valuable 
information about Iraq as a byproduct of its cooperation with 
UNSCOM. The Post said U.S. agents rigged inspection equipment to 
intercept Iraqi military communications.

	Hijacker Diverts Air France Plane

	PARIS (AP) -- An Air France airplane carrying 75 passengers was  
forced to detour over Paris today after a man on board threatened 
to blow it up, officials said. The plane, coming from Marseille in 
southern France, was due to land mid-afternoon at Orly airport, 
south of the capital. But the passenger insisted it head to Roissy 
airport, north of Paris, where it landed safely. Most passengers 
were released, but Interior Minister officials said 11 people -- six 
passengers and five crew members -- were held on the aircraft. The 
hijacker was not identified, but was speaking Italian.

	Foreign Tourists Killed in Uganda  
</P>
<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- At least five tourists died and six  
others, including an American, were rescued in a jungle gorilla 
reserve after being kidnapped by Rwandan rebels. Ugandan police 
said the deaths came in a shootout today but a survivor said rebels 
killed the victims with machetes. The survivors said that if there 
was a rescue operation, it was aimed at freeing Ugandans, not 
foreign tourists. Three Americans, six Britons, three New 
Zealanders, an Australian and a Swiss woman were among those 
kidnapped, Ugandan officials said. A Canadian citizen also was 
taken. The tourists were abducted at campgrounds on the edge of 
Bwindi National Park, the starting point for visitors hoping to 
glimpse the 320 mountain gorillas that remain along the border 
mountain's slopes.

	Court Nixes Bid for New Sentencing  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal prison inmates are not automatically  
entitled to a new sentencing because a judge failed to tell them of 
their right to appeal, the Supreme Court ruled today. The decision 
said a Pennsylvania inmate is not entitled to a new sentencing 
because he knew he had a right to appeal, and therefore was not 
harmed by the judge's error. Manuel D. Peguero pleaded guilty in 
1992 to conspiring to distribute cocaine in York, Pa. A federal 
judge sentenced him to 22 years and 10 months in prison but did not 
tell him he could appeal the sentence. Such notification is 
required by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

	More Original Content Found on Web  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newspapers and magazines are increasing the  
original material on their Web sites, part of a shift toward using 
the Internet as a groundbreaking medium rather than a distribution 
system. A new survey by a Columbia University professor found that 
58 percent of newspapers and magazines had a Web site. Of those, 31 
percent used original material for at least half their online 
content -- more than four times the number of publications that did 
so in 1996. Steve Ross said, however, that the emphasis on 
round-the-clock coverage led to inaccurate reporting and skirting 
ethical practices.

when the two-time Super Bowl champion Broncos signed free agent 
cornerback Dale Carter. Atwater has 24 career interceptions.

<HEADLINE>  Rockies' Helton Making a Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- He has talent, wealth and every reason to  
brag, but Todd Helton cannot bring himself to utter words of 
self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Helton rests his chin on the top of his bat and speaks  
in the humble tone of a man who has something to prove rather than 
one who represents the future of the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely not what you'd call a star by any means,''  
Helton said before signing a four-year, $12 million contract 
Tuesday. ``I don't like to talk about it. It's kind of awkward for 
me. I don't want to be put into the spotlight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helton, 25, emerged from the shadows last season by hitting .315  
with 25 homers and 97 RBIs. He led all rookies in the triple crown 
categories and finished second to Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood 
in the NL rookie of the year voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood finished nine points ahead of Helton in the closest vote in  
16 years. While the residents in Helton's hometown of Knoxville, 
Tenn., absorbed another perceived snub -- Tennessee quarterback 
Peyton Manning finished second in the 1997 Heisman Trophy voting -- 
Helton moved on quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was I disappointed? Yeah. For about 15 seconds,'' he said.  
``Did I think about it again? No. I just got sick of hearing people 
talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was going to win it, I didn't want to win it for myself.  
I wanted to win it for the Rockies because they've never had 
anybody win it. It would have been a good honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing the talent in front of them, the Rockies approached  
Helton before spring training and asked if he would be willing to 
think about signing a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sort of blew me away,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	While genuinely flattered by Colorado's interest, Helton was  
clearly uncomfortable talking about becoming a millionaire as the 
negotiations played out during the first two weeks of spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton and the Rockies eventually agreed on a four-year deal  
that will pay him $750,000 in 1999, $1.3 million in 2000, $4.95 
million in 2001 and $5 million in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I outplay my contract,'' Helton said when asked if he  
feared the contract would become paltry in the age of exorbitant 
salaries. ``That will mean the Rockies saved money and I'm playing 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The road to a six-figure contract unfolded slowly for Helton, a  
former first-round draft pick who was a two-sport star at 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with the pressure of replacing two-time All-Star Andres  
Galarraga, Helton floundered in his first month in the majors, 
hitting .259 with no homers and 12 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no normal reason a kid with his talent should go six  
weeks without falling into a home run,'' Rockies hitting coach 
Clint Hurdle said. ``It was just classic overtrying and not staying 
with his strengths and doing what he's capable of doing. Once he 
did that, he took off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helton hit his first homer of the season on May 5 and slowly  
proved he could handle left-handed pitchers. He was tireless in the 
batting cage and diligently worked to improve his defense at first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very appreciative young man for what's happened, and I  
think he's also one of those guys that found out that it's not 
going to be easy,'' Rockies manager Jim Leyland said, ``but he 
knows he can compete up here and he knows he can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced Helton was ready to play everyday, the Rockies traded  
utility player Greg Colbrunn to the Atlanta Braves on July 30, 
leaving Helton to sink or swim in August and September. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton responded by hitting .363 with eight homers and 41 RBIs  
over the final two months, giving voters something to think about 
as they pondered their choices for rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Helton finished second, he got a boost when Tennessee won  
college football's national championship in January. Throw in a new 
contract and life is good for one of baseball's richest second-year 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the big leagues,'' Helton said. ``They have to be going  
pretty well if I'm playing in the big leagues.''

think he's also one of those guys that found out that it's not 
going to be easy,'' Rockies manager Jim Leyland said, ``but he 
knows he can compete up here and he knows he can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced Helton was ready to play everyday, the Rockies traded  
utility player Greg Colbrunn to the Atlanta Braves on July 30, 
leaving Helton to sink or swim in August and September. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton responded by hitting .363 with eight homers and 41 RBIs  
over the final two months, giving voters something to think about 
as they pondered their choices for rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Helton finished second, he got a boost when Tennessee won  
college football's national championship in January. Throw in a new 
contract and life is good for one of baseball's richest second-year 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the big leagues,'' Helton said. ``They have to be going  
pretty well if I'm playing in the big leagues.''

<HEADLINE>  Hall of Fame Wait Over for Cepeda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Orlando Cepeda was handed roses, a glass of  
champagne and a jersey with ``Hall of Fame'' written on it. The 
room was filled with balloons. Speakers blared a Latin song 
entitled ``Viva Cepeda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impromptu celebration Tuesday afternoon, a couple of hours  
after Cepeda's selection to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans 
Committee, looked as though it had been carefully planned for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in fact, it had.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to explain the feeling when they called me this  
morning and told me I was selected to the Hall of Fame. I've been 
ready for this for 17 years,'' said Cepeda, a first baseman who 
retired in 1974 after a career that included 379 home runs, 1,365 
RBIs and a .297 average. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, who joins Roberto Clemente as the only Puerto Ricans in  
the Hall of Fame, was the NL's rookie of the year in 1958 with San 
Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, now a community relations representative for the  
Giants, found out about his selection in a morning phone call from 
former Giants teammate and Hall of Famer Juan Marichal. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they told me I was selected, I lost my mind,'' said the  
man known as the Baby Bull. ``Sometimes, when things come easy for 
you, you tend to take them for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giants owner Peter Magowan announced at the celebration that the  
team is retiring Cepeda's No. 30 uniform -- making him the ninth 
player in franchise history to be so honored. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda joins former teammates Marichal, Willie Mays, Willie  
McCovey and Gaylord Perry in the Hall of Fame. All played on the 
1962-66 Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cepeda's election to Cooperstown was not easy. Tuesday's  
honor capped a long campaign by the Giants to get Cepeda into the 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the problem was Cepeda's 1975 arrest for attempting to  
smuggle 160 pounds of marijuana into Puerto Rico. He was sentenced 
to five years and spent 10 months in a Florida prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed out on selection to the Hall of Fame by writers,  
falling just seven votes short of the necessary 342 votes in his 
15th and final year of eligibility in 1994. This was his second 
shot at selection by the Veterans Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	After his imprisonment, Cepeda turned to Buddhism and credited  
that philosophy with helping him deal with earlier disappointments 
in Hall of Fame voting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the day that proves the validity of Buddhism, the  
validity of friendship,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda was an immediate hit when he joined the Giants as a  
rookie in 1958, the team's first season after moving west from New 
York. He had 25 homers, 96 RBIs and 188 hits that year. 
</P>
<P>
	He was so popular that when he dropped by a San Francisco  
nightclub called the Blackhawk that season, the trio playing there 
-- Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley -- stopped 
their set to improvise a work just for Cepeda. 
</P>
<P>
	That piece was ``Viva Cepeda.''  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great day in the history of the San Francisco  
Giants. Our first homegrown star, the guy who hit the first home 
run on the West Coast,'' Magowan said. ``He was an exciting player 
and a very, very popular one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda played in nine All-Star games, often batting cleanup in  
NL lineups that included Mays, Clemente and Henry Aaron. 
Surprisingly, he was just 1-for-27 in All-Star games for an .037 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played ball for 17 years,'' Cepeda said. ``I've been through  
good things, bad things, but I was very blessed to be born with the 
talent to play baseball, to leave the ghettos of Puerto Rico and 
come to San Francisco, the city I love so much.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Gets Her Say in Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky is finally getting her say:  
about President Clinton (``a very sensual man''), Linda Tripp (``I 
pity her'') and her regret for hurting Hillary and Chelsea Clinton 
(``I am very sorry''). 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-hour interview to be televised Wednesday night, the  
woman whose trysts with the president led to the Senate impeachment 
trial offers the nation her apology ``for my part in this past 
year's ordeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive  
me,'' she says. ``But I would ask them to know that I am very sorry 
for what happened and for what they've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Walters of ABC News won the first interview with Ms.  
Lewinsky since the former White House intern burst into the 
headlines on Jan. 21, 1998. Ms. Lewinsky, who received immunity 
from prosecution for cooperating with investigators, was prohibited 
from speaking publicly until Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
office gave the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview was timed to help promote her book -- ``Monica's  
Story,'' written with Princess Diana biographer Andrew Morton -- 
which goes on sale Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv refused to comment. Asked if  
Ms. Lewinsky's words would finally bring an end to the story, Toiv 
said: ``I think I can safely say 'No' to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC released brief excerpts from the interview on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Is Bill Clinton a sensuous, passionate man?'' Walters asked  
the 25-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gosh, I'll probably get in trouble for saying this,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky began before describing the president as ``a very sensual 
man'' who feels conflicted because of his ``strong religious 
upbringing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he struggles with his sensuality because I don't think  
he thinks it's OK,'' she said. ``I think he tries to hold himself 
back. And then can't anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky had stinging words for her former friend, Linda  
Tripp, who secretly tape-recorded their telephone conversations 
about the president and turned them over to Starr's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pity her,'' Ms. Lewinsky said. ``I would hate to be her.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she was drawn to Mrs. Tripp at the Pentagon  
because both of them had worked at the White House, where Ms. 
Lewinsky longed to return. She said she confided the affair to Mrs. 
Tripp after her co-worker kept saying things such as ``You're just 
the type of girl the president would like'' and ``I bet you could 
have an affair with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News in New York also published excerpts from the  
interview on Tuesday. The newspaper said it had obtained a partial, 
unedited audio tape. ABC confirmed its authenticity but objected 
strongly to its being leaked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News said Ms. Lewinsky called Clinton her ``sexual  
soul mate'' and insisted their relationship was about a ``man and a 
woman, and not a president and an intern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She told Walters the president never discussed his marriage with  
her, and never told her he loved her. She said she didn't feel 
cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning there was a very intense sexual attraction,  
and I don't necessarily think a sexual attraction is a bad thing,'' 
she said. ``I didn't feel that way -- and I still don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, ``I never will have an affair with a married man  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, ABC News officials decried the publication of  
unedited material from the interview. The network's ``editorial 
process has been compromised by the illegal and irresponsible 
actions of some unknown person,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks' Ceballos Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Two broken wrists will sideline Dallas Mavericks  
small forward Cedric Ceballos for the remainder of the season 
rather than the six to eight weeks anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Screws were inserted Monday evening to repair the fractures.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 Ceballos was hurt Thursday in a 90-81 victory over  
the Denver Nuggets. Loren Meyer tossed Ceballos to the floor with 
both hands as the Maverick tried a layup in the final minute of the 
first quarter. Ceballos finished the game despite the injury, and 
managed to score 20 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the Mavericks placed Ceballos, an eight-year NBA  
veteran, on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	A more detailed exam over the weekend revealed the extent of the  
injury, and Ceballos had surgery at Baylor Hospital in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer, once a Mavericks first-round pick and a former teammate  
of Ceballos at Phoenix, was assessed a flagrant foul and later 
fined $5,000 and suspended for one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, Meyer spoke publicly about the incident for the first  
time, saying the incident wasn't intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was as bad as how it looked or whatever  
punishment I got out of the deal. I don't think it was that bad. Me 
and Ced always joked around in Phoenix. We were pretty good 
buddies, so it wasn't anything personal or nothing like that,'' 
Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he got up, I said, `I'm sorry, Ced, I went for the ball.'  
If you look at it, I kind of swiped at (the ball) with my left 
hand, but my body got him, too.''

<HEADLINE> Market Price of Sugar Falls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The wholesale market price of sugar -- a key export  
for dozens of developing countries -- fell this week to its lowest 
level in 12 years, said the International Sugar Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a double whammy,'' said Tomy Hannah, a senior economist  
for the London-based organization. ``Supplies are flooding on to 
the market at a time when demand is suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The intergovernmental agency's latest daily indicator of the  
wholesale market price of raw sugar is 65 cents a pound -- the 
lowest level since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannah blamed the drop in price on the fall in Asian demand for  
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market had become very dependent on strong growth in Asia,  
especially Indonesia,'' he said, adding that the other ``big blow'' 
was the sharp fall in demand by Russia, the world's largest single 
importer of the sweetener. 
</P>
<P>
	But while demand is falling, production is growing rapidly,  
particularly in Brazil, where this season's crop will be the 
biggest ever, Hannah said. Sugar is one of the top export earners 
for Cuba, the Dominican Republic and many Caribbean and Central 
American nations. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the sugar organization's most recent forecasts  
predict oversupply and an increase in stocks for the fourth season 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	The intergovernmental agency's latest assessment of the market  
balance puts raw sugar output at a record 127.73 million metric 
tons and consumption at 126.68 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Brantley Tries Comeback With Philly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies closer Jeff  
Brantley says he was ``miserable'' in St. Louis. Like his teammate 
Ron Gant, Brantley didn't get along with Tony La Russa, either. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the problem. Brantley rushed back from shoulder  
surgery and never regained his velocity or confidence -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he's throwing better than he has in years, the  
35-year-old reliever puckers his lips and exhales with a whistle -- 
the body language that means, ``Whew, smokin'.'' His incredulous 
grin says, ``I can hardly believe it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that if I can throw the ball the way I'm throwing the  
ball right now, it's going to be pretty fun,'' Brantley said. 
``Unlike last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 1997 season with Cincinnati ended in June with arthroscopic  
surgery on his right shoulder. When the Reds traded him to the 
Cardinals after the season, Brantley couldn't even play catch. 
</P>
<P>
	But he tried to hurry back from the surgery to prove himself to  
his new team. It was a disaster. Brantley was 0-5 with his first 
4.00-plus ERA since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``That mentality is probably not the greatest thing to have when  
you're hurt,'' Brantley said. ``But it's what got me here, man. 
That's why I'm still in the big leagues after 10 years. When the 
doctor said 18 months, I was thinking nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been hurt before. I didn't know how to handle that  
stuff. Nobody was telling me. I just figured, `I'm making $3 
million, I need to be out there pitching.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Brantley's few highlights was striking out Sammy Sosa for  
his 14th and final save. Embarrassed that he'd failed to do his job 
as closer, Brantley told the Cardinals after the season he thought 
a trade would be best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never was able to do the job on a consistent basis,''  
Brantley said. ``If you can't do it, then obviously it just isn't 
going to work out. It was a variety of reasons -- not really Tony -- 
but just some other instances that were there without digging into 
it and making it a real big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley was reluctant to discuss his relationship with La Russa  
in the wake of Gant's feud with their former manager. Asked if he 
got along with La Russa, Brantley said, ``Not really, but I don't 
want to get into it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't so much that I couldn't get along or anything like  
that. It was just that I couldn't pitch. I was miserable. I 
couldn't throw the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley can now. He velocity is back where it was when he tied  
for the NL lead with 44 saves with the Reds in 1996. And it's 
consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem was last year, I could throw seven or eight  
pitches in the bullpen, throw them all good, feel real fine,'' 
Brantley said. ``And I'd get out in the ballgame and throw one 
pitch 92 mph, throw the next one 82 and have no idea why they were 
coming out different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies, who traded closer Ricky Bottalico and Garrett  
Stephenson to the Cardinals for Gant, Brantley and right-hander 
Cliff Politte, are relieved that Brantley is healthy again. 
</P>
<P>
	When manager Terry Francona was with Milwaukee in 1989-90, he  
faced Brantley in spring training. Now, he stands behind the 
batting cage and revels in the pop Brantley's pitches make when 
they hit the glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks healthy to me,'' Francona said. ``Healthy's good  
enough. When he comes off that mound with a smile on his face, you 
can tell he's healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Brantley doesn't regain his form as a reliable closer, the  
Phillies bullpen will be in chaos. Even though it's early, there's 
no reason to worry yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like playing,'' Brantley said. ``And I'm good at what I do.  
I knew that if I could get the physical part back where I could 
just throw, then everything else would just fall into place. 
Because I know how to get hitters out. I know how to pitch.''

<HEADLINE> Timber Co., Gov't Reach Forest Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Pacific Lumber Co. and government  
authorities agreed late Monday on a $480 million plan to create a 
public preserve of ancient redwoods -- a dramatic reversal of the 
timber company's decision just three days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was struck two minutes before a midnight deadline. ``We  
have a deal,'' said Interior Department spokesman Tim Ahern. 
</P>
<P>
	The intense negotiations involving Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt, state resources officials and company executives and 
lawyers took place via telephone conference calls between 
California, Texas and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The original deal would have had Pacific Lumber and another  
logging company sell 10,000 acres of the Headwaters Forest -- 
including about 5,000 acres of old-growth redwoods -- to the United 
States and California. Some of the trees in the area 250 miles 
north of San Francisco are 1,500 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word whether the provisions of the  
agreement were substantially different than the plan rejected 
Friday by Pacific Lumber. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials had feared the plan's restrictions on logging  
near streams and wildlife habitat would ruin their business. The 
rules would be locked in for at least 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahern said the ``environmental protections were not changed, in  
either the federal or state proposal. This is a strong package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $250 million Interior Department appropriation would have  
disappeared without a deal by midnight Monday. The initial state 
share of the deal, $130 million, was scheduled to dissolve if the 
federal share disappears. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Lumber and its corporate parent, Maxxam Corp., have been  
the object of lengthy court fights and demonstrations -- including 
the nation's largest forest rally, a 1996 environmental protest in 
which more than 1,000 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the agreement was disclosed, Vice President Al Gore said  
the government wasn't backing off the terms it proposed as part of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think what was proposed is good for the American people,  
good for California, good for the environment and good for this 
company,'' he said during his visit to Oakland.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Americans' demand for sport utility vehicles,  
pickups and minivans is growing at a pace that continues to 
surprise the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Light trucks helped Ford, Toyota and Honda set February U.S.  
sales records. All of the big automakers that reported results 
Tuesday posted gains -- some in double digits -- over the same month 
of 1998. No. 1 General Motors Corp. was expected to report higher 
sales today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a great level of car and truck sales for six months  
now, since the end of the GM strikes,'' said analyst David Healy of 
Burnham Securities Inc. ``You've got to relate it to very flat or 
even lower vehicle prices, a very high level of consumer confidence 
and lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are willing to buy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG each experienced an 8  
percent improvement; Honda Motor Co. said its sales rose 14 percent 
on surging demand for its Odyssey minivan and SUVs; and Toyota 
Motor Corp. was up 19 percent. Even struggling Nissan Motor Corp. 
managed a 4 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ford, car sales fell 6 percent, but the No. 2 automaker's  
strong truck numbers were better than some analysts expected and 
helped it break the company's February sales mark set in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market's been roaring and nothing surprises me,'' said  
analyst Maryann Keller of ING Baring Furman Selz. ``The truck 
market this year is much stronger than I thought it would be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford set February records for sales of its F-series pickup -- the  
top-selling vehicle nationwide for 17 years -- and the compact 
Ranger pickup. F-series sales were up 27 percent over last year, 
while Ranger sales increased a surprising 46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``A strong economy, confident consumers and product innovation  
have proven to be a winning trifecta,'' said Bob Rewey, vice 
president of marketing and sales. ``We're heading into spring 
supported by strong employment, growing income, low interest rates 
and affordable products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said its car sales were up nearly 9 percent, not  
counting Mercedes-Benz, while truck sales rose 7 percent. Combined 
SUV sales at the German-American automaker were up 19 percent. The 
Jeep division set a February record. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Jameson, vice president of sales and marketing, said SUV  
demand remains strong despite increased competition. 
DaimlerChrysler's SUV sales were up 19 percent, led by the 
redesigned Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Durango. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're selling every one of those puppies we can build,''  
Jameson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's February sales total outpaced the record set in 1998 and  
was led by the automaker's best truck sales ever -- up 75 percent 
and beating its previous truck record set last August. The 
redesigned Odyssey minivan, made in Canada, had the biggest gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually we see things cool off in the first quarter, but there  
wasn't even a pause this year,'' said Dick Colliver, vice president 
of American Honda Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota posted double-digit gains in cars and trucks to break  
last year's February record. Strong sales of the Camry and Corolla 
helped boost car sales 16 percent, while big increases in demand 
for the Sienna minivan and Land Cruiser luxury SUV led to a 24 
percent gain in trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy continues to defy gravity,'' said Yale Gieszl, a  
Toyota vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales at Nissan's luxury division, Infiniti, helped drive  
Nissan's total up. 
</P>
<P>
	Among smaller automakers, new models helped Volkswagen AG post a  
79 percent sales gain. Audi AG's sales were up 28 percent. Volvo 
AB, whose sale to Ford is pending, said its U.S. car sales 
increased 15 percent. Subaru was up 12 percent, while Land Rover 
posted a 27 percent gain.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Move Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose sharply against the yen early  
Wednesday after a decline in Japan's short-term interest rates. 
Tokyo stocks rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.74 yen in early trading, up 0.66 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and more than its level of 120.23 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 115.50 points, or 0.83 percent, to  
close the morning session at 14,036.56. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 300.69 points, or 2.11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar surged against the yen in early  
Tokyo trading after the central bank drove short-term interest 
rates to nearly zero by flooding the interbank lending market with 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The overnight call rate, the rate banks charge each other for  
overnight loans, fell to as low as 0.02 percent, from 0.07 percent 
the day before. Other interest rates often fall in line with a 
decline in the call rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling interest rates hurt the Japanese currency by making  
holding yen less profitable than investing in other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 131.92 yen, up from 131.08 yen late  
Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei stock average rose as investors  
scooped up shares following Tuesday's sharp decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Capping the gains were worries that Japanese companies could  
sell shares they hold in other firms to boost profits ahead of the 
close of the fiscal year on March 31, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies have traditionally held shares in affiliated  
firms as a way of cementing business relationships. Many firms have 
been gradually selling these so-called ``cross-shareholdings'' 
because holding them carries fewer benefits than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 0.16 point, or 0.01 percent, to 1,091.92 points. 
The TOPIX closed down 15.73 points, or 1.42 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
fell to 1.730 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.805 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.55 yen from 99.96 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Rose Pulls for His Son As a Dodger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Pete Rose kept a low profile, sitting  
quietly in the stands at Dodgertown watching his son play in an 
intrasquad game. He hopes to be watching Pete Jr. playing in Los 
Angeles one of these days. 
</P>
<P>
	And Pete Jr. says it's going to happen, later if not sooner.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got what it takes,'' Pete Jr. said Tuesday. ``I  
plan on making the team. I don't plan on playing in (Triple-A) 
Albuquerque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if manager Davey Johnson sends him down?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bust my tail,'' Pete Jr. said. ``I'm going to be in LA at  
some time. I'm a guy who's got some pop. Left-handed pop looks to 
be a little scarce around here. I think Davey Johnson likes tough 
guys. I come to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Rose, the career hits leader who agreed to lifetime  
ban for gambling, called Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone 
during the winter to request a favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete asked me to give his son a chance,'' Malone recalled.  
``I've known both of them for years. They both have huge hearts. I 
figured it was a win-win situation. I told Pete it would be tough 
for (Junior) to make the team. He said, `No special treatment, all 
we ask is a chance.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's the deal. The younger Rose, a 29-year-old whose only  
major league experience was a brief spell with Cincinnati Reds 18 
months ago, signed a minor league contract with an invitation to 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	And here he is, giving it his best shot.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can tell me to stop chasing my dream,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He knows how to play, he's not going to give up,'' the elder  
Rose said. ``He's just now figuring out his m.o.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose referred to the change his son went through between the  
1996 and 1997 seasons. Essentially, Pete Jr., went from a clone of 
his father to a power hitter, bulking up in the gym from 200 pounds 
to around 230. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bigger than he is,'' the younger Rose said. ``It took me  
longer to figure things out. I had to make a change, and I did. 
Basically, I've been at this for only a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recently spent a week with his father, and it helped as he  
entered spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a plus when you have the hit-king on your side,'' he  
said. ``He's just unbelievable, a great person, a great dad, a 
great coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, obviously, a big fan of his son.  
</P>
<P>
	The younger Rose had his best season by far in 1997, hitting  
.308 with 25 homers and 98 RBIs in 112 games for Double-A 
Chattanooga. He was called up by the Reds and made his only 
big-league start on Labor Day, going 1-for-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd in Cincinnati, where Rose's father played most of his  
career and later managed, was 31,920. The majority of those tickets 
were sold after it was announced Rose was playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reds didn't give him a chance,'' dad said. ``They used him  
to make some money. I know it wasn't (owner) Marge (Schott). Marge 
likes Pete. If nothing else, he paid to go to spring training the 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't happen that way, and after the younger Rose was asked  
to go to Double-A in 1998, he refused and asked for his release. He 
wound up the year playing for the New Jersey Jackals of the 
independent Northeast League. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Rose remains somewhat bitter.  
</P>
<P>
	``Playing in Cincinnati was special, unbelievable,'' he said.  
``There will only be one thing better -- when I go there as a 
visitor and get the job done. And it's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The Dodgers) go to Cincinnati in May. I've already had dreams  
about playing against them, coming up in a big situation and 
getting a key hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite what happened, the elder Rose said he still pulls for  
the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play on Pete Rose Way, man,'' he said. ``I just don't  
like the way certain people treated him. I'm a Dodger fan now. I 
just don't want to make those flights to Albuquerque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Rose spoke, his son, a left-handed hitter wearing No. 74,  
came to the plate to face Onan Masaoka, a left-handed pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let you know if he's my son after he hits,'' Rose said to  
a fan. ``If he gets a hit, he's my son. If he doesn't, he's your 
son.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Expecting Big Lewinsky Audience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC isn't paying for its interview with Monica  
Lewinsky, but its advertisers certainly are. 
</P>
<P>
	To buy a 30-second commercial on Wednesday night's two-hour  
``20/20'' telecast of Barbara Walters' interview with Lewinsky, ABC 
is asking advertisers for five times what they would normally pay. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC is building anticipation for the interview by running  
``teaser'' ads that show Walters throwing questions at Lewinsky but 
revealing no answers. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has hiked the price for a half-minute commercial to  
about $800,000, said executives familiar with ad sales. ABC 
generally charges $160,000 for half-minute ads on regular editions 
of ``20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers who had bought time months ago expecting a regular  
``20/20'' will either have to pay the new price or drop out. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the nation's biggest advertisers have said they weren't  
interested in hawking their products as the former White House 
intern talks about her affair with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble, whose products include Ivory soap, Tide  
detergent and Crest toothpaste, normally avoids news programs 
because of potentially controversial topics, spokeswoman Gretchen 
Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola also is steering clear of Lewinsky. ``It just doesn't  
seem like something that would be right for our brands,'' 
spokeswoman Kari Bjorhus said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ad sales department is targeting movie studios and  
Internet companies, believing they're more willing to take a gamble 
on the material attracting a big audience, said Bob Flood of DeWitt 
Media, an advertising buying firm. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst predicted a huge night in the ratings for ABC,  
estimating that 45 percent of the nation's televisions in use that 
night will be watching Lewinsky. ``ER,'' the year's top-ranked 
entertainment show, has an average audience share of 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are sick of it, without a doubt, but no one has had a  
chance to sit down and hear what she's had to say,'' said Marc 
Berman of the advertising firm Seltel. ``This is an event. People 
are going to watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Schulman, who has his own advertising buying firm,  
predicts an audience share of between 25 and 30. None of his 
clients have bought ads on the show, and he advises them that it's 
overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think now that it's over, I'm not sure that everyone even  
cares to hear from Monica,'' Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Fox charged advertisers a record $1.6 million to buy  
30-second ads on the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	When Oprah Winfrey interviewed Michael Jackson in 1993, the show  
drew a staggering 56 audience share, Nielsen Media Research said. 
Two years later, when Jackson was interviewed by Diane Sawyer, it 
had a 42 audience share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ratings last week for its ``Dateline NBC'' interview with  
Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting 
her more than 20 years ago, were only slightly higher than a 
typical episode of the newsmagazine. It drew 15 percent of the 
available audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Because ABC only owns the domestic distribution rights to the  
interview, it won't be telecast on the Web, nor will the network 
make a full transcript available there. Instead, ABCnews.com will 
show some film clips online and show portions of the transcript, 
spokeswoman Michelle Bergman said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday and Friday, NBC's ``Today'' show will air a two-part  
interview with Andrew Morton, author of the Lewinsky biography, 
``Monica's Story.''

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Stamp Raises $5.2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A special breast cancer stamp that costs a  
little more than a regular stamp has raised $5.2 million to help 
research the disease, the Postal Service said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are proud of these accomplishments and are committed to  
sustaining the momentum and level of awareness required to generate 
sales of this stamp to raise funds for breast cancer research,'' 
Azeezaly S. Jaffer, director of stamp services, told the post 
office's board of governors. 
</P>
<P>
	The breast cancer stamp was the first so-called semi-postal  
stamp offered by the United States. Semi-postals sell for more than 
the normal price of a stamp, with the extra money going to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The breast cancer stamp costs 40 cents. With first class postage  
of 33 cents, up to 7 cents per stamp goes to research. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaffer said a special promotion campaign for the stamp is  
planned for Mother's Day and the stamp also will be promoted in 
partnership with the Revlon Run-Walk for Women in Los Angeles and 
New York.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lewinsky Discusses Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky calls President Clinton her  
``sexual soul mate,'' and insists in her ABC interview that their 
relationship was about a ``man and a woman, and not a president and 
an intern,'' the Daily News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would talk, we would laugh, we would tell jokes,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky says. ``He was very tender with me. He was very 
affectionate and I think you know when someone is attracted to 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News said it had obtained a partial, unedited audio  
tape of the interview between the former White House intern and 
Barbara Walters that is to air on ``20/20'' Wednesday night. The 
network confirmed its authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
	The quotes indicate the discussion ranged from Ms. Lewinsky's  
childhood to the affair that led to Clinton's impeachment. She told 
Walters that she didn't feel cheap and refused to take 
responsibility for the 18-month relationship that began with a 
``small, subtle, flirtatious gesture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning there was a very intense sexual attraction,  
and I don't necessarily think a sexual attraction is a bad thing,'' 
she says. ``I didn't feel that way -- and I still don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she says, ``I never will have an affair with a married man  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, 25, also apologized to first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton and Chelsea Clinton, saying she was sorry for ``what 
they've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the president never discussed his marriage with her,  
and never told her he loved her. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why she didn't walk away from Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky said  
there were people, including Linda Tripp, who encouraged the 
relationship. Tripp's tapes of their conversations were key in the 
investigation of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Lewinsky also said her own problems kept her trapped in  
an affair with a man she ``was in love with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have self-esteem and I'm self-confident in some  
ways, but I don't have the feelings of self-worth that a woman 
should have,'' she says. ``And that's ... been the center of a lot 
of my mistakes and a lot of my pain.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Carmody, who created The Washington  
Post's television column and wrote it for more than 20 years, died 
Monday of cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Captain Airwaves,'' Carmody devised the TV Column in  
1977 and then wrote for it five days a week for 21 years. Widely 
read by both television viewers and industry insiders, the column 
covered every aspect of television, from programming to ratings to 
hirings. 
</P>
<P>
	Carmody, who retired from the Post last fall, became serious  
about journalism in his 30s, after working for the U.S. Displaced 
Persons Commission in Frankfurt, Germany and for the Boeing Co. in 
his hometown of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired by the Rocky Mountain News in Denver in the late  
1950s, and went to the Post in 1962. He joined the staff of the 
Post's Style section in 1970.

of Paducah television station WPSD's ``Lions Club Telethon of 
Stars'' each year from 1968 until 1991. During a 30-year recording 
career, he released several pop, country, gospel and nostalgia 
albums.

</P>
<P>
	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Allan Gerhardt, a record producer  
and conductor who recorded classical performers of the 1950s and 
1960s, died Feb. 22 of complications from brain surgery. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerhardt joined the technical staff of RCA Victor in 1950, and  
by the early 1960s was overseeing RCA's productions in London. 
</P>
<P>
	His first major project as a producer was ``A Festival of Light  
Classical Music,'' in 1960. A year later, he produced a Beethoven 
cycle that has become a collector's item. 
</P>
<P>
	He formed an orchestra of London musicians in 1964. It was  
incorporated as the National Philharmonic Orchestra in 1970. 
Gerhardt conducted it on recordings of contemporary pieces and 
standard repertory works. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerhardt was best known for his collection of film scores that  
included volumes devoted to the works of Max Steiner, Franz Waxman, 
Miklow Rozsa, Alfred Newman, Bernard Hermann and John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	He produced ``The Sea Hawk'' in 1972 and was the first major  
overview of Erich Korngold's film music. In 1975, Gerhardt produced 
the first recording of the Korngold's opera, ``Die Tote Stadt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the RCA in 1986 and worked as a freelance  
producer until 1997.

</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Eugene Levin, who covered the terrorist attack at  
the 1972 Munich Olympics and other major stories during a 
quarter-century with The Associated Press, died Monday of cancer. 
He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	In three decades following World War II, Levin worked in Europe  
and Asia as a correspondent and editor. 
</P>
<P>
	He covered four U.S. presidents, four popes, three Olympic  
Games, the four-year Vatican Ecumenical Council and countless other 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin, a Denver native, began his career as a part-time  
correspondent for The Denver Post and the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted in 1945 and a year later began working for Stars  
and Stripes, covering the war crimes trial of top Nazi leaders in 
Nuremberg.

and joined the AP in 1950, working in New York, New Delhi, India, 
Rome, Tokyo and London over the next 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin was supervising editor for the 1960 Olympic Games at Rome,  
the 1964 Olympic Games at Innsbruck and the 1972 Olympic Games at 
Munich. He wrote the first news bulletins from Munich when Arab 
terrorists took Israeli athletes hostage. The siege ended with the 
deaths of 11 Israelis, German policemen and five terrorists.

and Greece, President Kennedy's visit to Italy and President 
Nixon's visit to London.

                       *Cora Cheney Partridge    	
</P>
<P>
	TACOMA PARK, Md. (AP) -- Cora Cheney Partridge, a writer of  
children's books and one of the oldest women to be ordained an 
Episcopal priest, died Feb. 21 of complications from a stroke. She 
was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Partridge wrote more than 20 books of fiction, history and  
folklore. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first book was ``Skeleton Cave,'' in 1954. It describes a  
boy who finds American Indian relics near his home. She went on to 
write as many as 15 children's novels, among them ``The Pegged Leg 
Pirate of Sulu,'' `The Girl at Jungle's Edge,'' ``Tales from a 
Taiwan Kitchen'' and ``The Case of the Iceland Dogs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was ordained an Episcopalian priest at age 65 and helped  
establish rural church missions in Vermont, Delaware and Florida. 
She worked with shut-ins and the elderly, often using a portable 
altar made from an ironing board. In 1989, Partridge helped 
organize an abortion rights march of ``the matriarchs,'' a group of 
women in their 60s and 70s, in Tallahassee, Fla.

                            *Betty Roche    	
</P>
<P>
	PLEASANTVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- Betty Roche, a singer who performed  
with Duke Ellington in the 1940s and 50s, died Feb. 16 at age 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Mary Elizabeth Roche, she sang with the Savoy Sultans in  
1941, before joining Ellington two years later. She scored high 
marks from critics for the suite ``Black, Brown and Beige,'' at 
Ellington's first Carnegie Hall concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Her feature of the ``Blues'' sequence was meant to express the  
feelings of blacks who settled into urban life in the start of the 
20th century. The song became one of Ellington's greatest pieces 
for a singer. 
</P>
<P>
	She also performed Ellington's signature song ``Take the A  
Train'' in the 1943 film ``Reveille With Beverly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Roche also performed and recorded with the pianist Earl  
Hines, the trumpeter Clark Terry and singer and pianist Charles 
Brown.

                         *Hughie Lee-Smith    	
</P>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Hughie Lee-Smith, a painter and former  
teacher at the Art Students League in New York, died Feb. 23 of 
cancer. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee-Smith was known for his paintings that frequently included  
symbolic figurative scenes. His works often included settings 
suggestive of theater stages or bleak urban or seaside landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, he won a prize for his work from the Detroit Institute  
of Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	While serving in the Navy he did a mural titled, ``History of  
the Negro in the U.S. Navy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He taught at the Art Students League for 15 years, beginning in  
1958. In 1963, he became the second black member elected to the 
National Academy of Design in New York City. He became a full 
member four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	His paintings are in many public collections, including the  
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the 
National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Schomburg Center for 
Research in Black Culture in New York City.

<P>
                           *Bill Talbert    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bill Talbert, a star tennis player who later  
became tournament director of the U.S. Open, died Sunday at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert, a 1967 enshrinee of the International Tennis Hall of  
Fame, was diagnosed at age 10 with diabetes. He was recognized as 
the first diabetic to compete in athletics at the highest 
international level. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached the singles finals at the U.S. Championships -- later  
known as the U.S. Open -- in 1944 and 1945 and the U.S. Indoor 
Championships in 1948-51. He was ranked among the top 10 in the 
United States from 1941 through 1955, and was a stalwart of the 
American Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	He starred in doubles, teaming with Gardnar Mulloy to reach the  
U.S. doubles final six times, winning in 1942, '45, '46 and '48. He 
also captured the U.S. Championship mixed doubles with Margaret 
Osborne four straight years -- 1943-46. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert teamed with Tony Trabert, another Hall of Famer, to win  
both the French and Italian doubles titles in 1950, and was U.S. 
Davis Cup captain from 1953-57, defeating Australia to win the Cup 
in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Mr. Tennis,'' Talbert was named director of the U.S.  
Open Championships at Forest Hills, N.Y. and served as chairman and 
director of the Open from 1971-75. When the Grand Slam tournament 
moved to Flushing Meadows, N.Y., Talbert returned as director from 
1978-87 and served as honorary vice chairman until his death. 
</P>
<P>
	He also co-authored eight books, including the acclaimed ``The  
Game of Doubles in Tennis,'' and his autobiography, ``Playing for 
Life.'' 

</P>
<P>
                            *H.E. Thyen    	
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Ind. (AP) -- H.E. ``Herb'' Thyen, co-founder of Kimball  
International Inc. and former mayor of Jasper, died Sunday of 
respiratory failure. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally founded in 1950 as The Jasper Corp., Kimball has  
grown from a company with less than 30 workers into an 
international corporation with about 9,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball International, as it became known in 1974, makes pianos,  
home and office furniture, television and audio cabinets, 
electronic assemblies, molded plastics, carbide cutting tools and 
metal stampings. It also produces lumber, plywood, processed wood 
materials and veneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Thyen served as a Democratic member of the Jasper City Council  
during the 1940s. When Mayor Charles Bartley died in office in 
1945, Thyen assumed the post. He ran for mayor in 1948 and was 
elected to a full term.

</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Xie Bingxin, a prominent children's novelist  
whose stories have been read by generations of Chinese students, 
died Sunday at age 99, state media reported. 
</P>
<P>

in Chinese schools, include ``For Small Readers,'' ``Little 
Tangerine Lamp'' and ``Ode to a Cherry Blossom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She continued to write into her 90s and was regarded as a  
possible contender to receive China's first Nobel Prize for 
Literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many intellectuals, Ms. Xie was purged during the early  
years of the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. She resumed 
her career after reappearing in public in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Book Already a Best-Seller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After reading the Starr report, watching the  
House vote and snoozing through the impeachment trial, is America 
going to pay to learn more about Monica? 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe so.  
</P>
<P>
	Two days before its release, ``Monica's Story'' was No. 5  
Tuesday on Amazon.com's best-seller list. St. Martin's Press is 
shipping 450,000 copies to book sellers and ``we're ready to 
reprint in a second,'' said Sally Richardson, president of the 
publisher's trade division. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many in the book industry expect the confessional to make  
a big initial splash, then fade away fast. And many readers claim 
to be absolutely, positively uninterested in seeing a single word 
more about Monica Lewinsky's affair with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's not worth reading and I wouldn't waste my time,''  
said Barbara Dolan, 48, as she browsed in a New York City 
bookstore. ``I find it very sad that there is a market for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So who are all those folks getting ready to plunk down $24.95 to  
read the former White House intern's collaboration with Princess 
Diana biographer Andrew Morton? 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says, `We're all sick of this,' and yet every book  
and every video has done well,'' said Amazon.com spokesman Bill 
Curry. ``You just know in the industry that certain books are going 
to be big with a capital `B.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And ``Monica's Story,'' he said, is likely to be one of them.  
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the book will give the world a glimpse of a  
Monica it hasn't seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been called a tramp and a whore and a homebreaker. She's  
had the vitriol of the world on her,'' Richardson said. ``The 
country's been at the edge of a cliff for a year, and this woman is 
the cause of it all. We think the book's going to be a major best 
seller.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com won't say how many copies the book has sold.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Ms. Lewinsky was at the center of the impeachment storm  
for more than a year, an agreement with Kenneth Starr prevented her 
from speaking publicly about the affair. Segments from her 
videotaped testimony in the Senate trial were released last month. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of Lewinsky media mania peaks this week, with ABC  
planning to air Barbara Walters' heavily promoted two-hour 
interview Wednesday on ``20/20.'' The book will be released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tabloids will be writing about it, and there'll be a lot  
of interest,'' said Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for the 
Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore chain, which has bought 45,000 copies of 
``Monica's Story.'' ``We anticipate that it is going to sell well 
in the first three weeks, and then it will drop off dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucianne Goldberg, the acerbic New York literary agent who set  
the impeachment scandal in motion when she urged Linda Tripp to 
tape her telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think its shelf life is somewhere between yogurt and milk,''  
she said. ``It'll probably be about 10 days. There's a great 
curiosity about her, and I think it will be totally satisfied 
between the book and the Barbara Walters interview.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Goldberg, Ms. Lewinsky's publicist, said the book will not  
be excerpted in any U.S. publications. A number of overseas 
newspapers, magazines and broadcast outlets have paid to interview 
Ms. Lewinsky and excerpt the book, and she plans a heavy 
promotional campaign in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Tobin, editor in chief and vice president of the  
Book-of-the-Month Club, said his company decided not to offer 
``Monica's Story'' to its readers. ``The story is so well covered 
in other media, this particular title wouldn't sell well enough to 
our particular membership,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Say 'Condo King' Hid Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- William Lilly was known as the ``Condo King'' for  
his wildly successful real estate ventures in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	After he went bankrupt and was convicted on bank fraud charges,  
Lilly gained another nickname in federal prison: ``King of 
Telephones,'' as he allegedly rebuilt his empire from behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	In one 10-month period, Lilly made nearly 10,000 phone calls,  
including 3,000 calls to the girlfriend he trained in the business, 
according to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's highly unusual telephone contact,'' Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Christopher Alberto said Tuesday. ``It suggests that more 
than just personal contact is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government is interested in Lilly's assets because it wants  
him to pay money stemming from his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly built thousands of condos in Massachusetts and southern  
New Hampshire in the 1980s before declaring bankruptcy and serving 
3 1/2 years in prison for bank fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his release on probation in 1997, Lilly, 53, has been  
under court order to pay $5 million in restitution for defaulted 
mortgage loans. He said he can afford only about $1,500 per month 
and will need more than 275 years to pay the total off. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors say they believe Lilly does have the money -- and  
is hiding it with the help of his girlfriend, Valerie Kaan, and 
three of his associates. Authorities have asked a judge to order 
all four to answer questions about their finances and dealings with 
the felon. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaan's phone number is not published, and attorneys for Lilly  
and Kaan did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaan went from health-club employee to successful developer  
while dating the former owner of Condo King Inc. She now employs 
him at her company, which has bought up condos in Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey and Florida in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The two live with their two children in an elegant Lynnfield  
home they call ``Camelot,'' Alberto said, adding that prosecutors 
don't believe the ``rags-to-riches'' story that has pushed Kaan's 
net worth from $30,000 in 1993 to more than $2 million in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is ``whether we can demonstrate some basis for the  
allegation that various parties are holding assets for him or 
assisting him to run his real estate business,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> CBS Renews 12 Shows for Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is so anxious to prove its stability to  
television viewers that it has already promised to bring back 12 of 
its prime-time series in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's entire Monday night schedule of comedies and its three  
newsmagazines were included in Tuesday's announcement. Networks 
usually announce their fall schedules in May, touching off a 
scramble by advertisers to place orders for millions of dollars 
worth of commercial time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we are sort of laying down the gauntlet that we  
will be stable,'' said Leslie Moonves, president and chief 
executive of CBS Television. ``It will say to our affiliates and 
advertisers that we're ready for next season. Why wait until May 
when we know where we are going?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shows that will return are ``Cosby,'' ``King of Queens,''  
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Becker,'' ``JAG,'' ``60 Minutes,'' 
``60 Minutes II,'' ``Touched By an Angel,'' ``Kids Say the Darndest 
Things,'' ``Nash Bridges,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``Candid Camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others shows will probably join them on the renewal list, but  
CBS can't announce them yet for contractual reasons, Moonves said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, NBC has said that seven of its shows will definitely  
return next fall: ``ER,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Friends,'' ``Dateline 
NBC,'' ``Just Shoot Me, ``Law and Order'' and ``3rd Rock From the 
Sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has already renewed ``The PJ's,'' ``That '70s Show'' and  
``Beverly Hills 90210.'' ABC, the WB and UPN have not announced any 
series renewals for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves said he expects advertisers to jump at the chance to  
place advertising orders for CBS's hottest shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa questioned the  
strategy, saying it would limit a network's chances to sell ad 
packages. Networks sometimes require advertisers to buy ads on new 
or lower-rated shows if they want to get a slot on a hit show like 
``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem short-sighted to sell their shows alone without  
using them as bait to get people to your new shows,'' Sassa said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's announcement is another indication that the traditional  
calendar for television seasons is slowly breaking down. Networks 
are more frequently premiering new programs outside of September, 
when the fall season usually starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves said CBS is likely to have the fewest number of new  
shows next fall than it has had in years. He said he was startled 
to see the number of pilots in development set in high schools or 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be such an obsession with teen-agers and  
animation that we're not going to go there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Lewinsky Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the ABC interview with Monica Lewinsky, provided  
by ABC News: 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I waited a long time to be able to express to the  
country how very sorry I am for my part in the past year's ordeal. 
And, of course, I've -- I've apologized in private to my family and 
to my friends that I would like to publicly acknowledge the pain 
and the suffering that they've gone through because of this. I 
wouldn't dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive me. 
But I would ask them to know that I am very sorry for what happened 
and for what they've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Walters: ``Is Bill Clinton a sensuous, passionate man?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Gosh, I'll probably get in trouble for saying this  
but. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walters: ``Not in any more trouble than you've already been in,  
Monica. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I have immunity.''  
</P>
<P>
	Walters: ``You have immunity here.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I think he is -- I think he is a very sensuous man  
who has a lot of sensual feelings. And I think he also has a very 
strong religious upbringing. And I think he struggles to -- I think 
he struggles with his sensuality because I don't think he thinks 
it's OK. And I think he tries to hold himself back, and then can't 
anymore.''

	Lewinsky: ``This is actually something that I don't think people  
have really understood in this past year. And it's important to 
understand it. I had met Linda Tripp from working in the Pentagon, 
and I think when I found out that she had worked at the White House 
that was sort of -- that was -- that was an attraction for me. That 
was clearly where I was longing to be, and was hoping and thinking 
I was going back to. She would say things to me like 'Oh, you're 
just the type the president would like.' And, 'You should, you 
know, think about going back to the White House. I bet you could 
have an affair with him.' And I thought, 'If she says to me one 
more time. ...' 
</P>
<P>
	``After the election, she said, 'Now you can go back to the  
White House. Now the election's over. This is it. This is your 
time.' Here I am, I am dying inside from the loss of this 
relationship, and finally I said 'Look, I had a relationship with 
him, and it's over. So you don't need to be thinking this is going 
to happen again.'''

<HEADLINE> Reds Sign Japan's Quezada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Alejandro Quezada, the first player made  
available to major league teams under an agreement with Japan, 
accepted a minor league contract Tuesday with the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Quezada, 20, received an undisclosed signing bonus and will  
start the season at Double-A Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the signing bonus, the Reds have to pay $400,001  
to the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, the team that Quezada played for last 
season. The Reds won the rights to negotiate with Quezada and had 
until Tuesday to sign him or pass on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a chance to be a very good, solid, major league  
player,'' Reds assistant general manager Doc Rodgers said Tuesday. 
``Like all players on draft day, there are high expectations but 
it's basically up to the player to get to the big leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds approached negotiations as if they were trying to sign  
a player taken in the June draft. They considered him farther along 
than a high school or college player because of his time in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Quezada, who is from the Dominican Republic, hit .311 with three  
homers in 61 at-bats for Hiroshima last year. He took batting 
practice and went through drills for the Reds last week at their 
spring training complex in Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The workout didn't strengthen Quezada's bargaining position -- he  
was rusty after four months away from baseball. Afterwards, general 
manager Jim Bowden said the team would not offer a major-league 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He undoubtedly is a talented young player, but the level of  
talent we have at the major leagues in this country, most would 
agree, is at a higher level than he's had success at,'' Rodgers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no one facet of his game that we see needs tremendous  
improvement. It's just whether he can continue to develop into the 
kind of player who can play at the major league level in this 
country. He runs, he throws and we believe he has a chance to 
hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quezada is the first player made available under an agreement  
signed in January by commissioner Bud Selig and the Japanese 
commissioner's office. Under the agreement, a Japanese team 
notifies Selig's office if it is willing to make a player 
available, and the 30 major league teams are allowed to bid for 
rights to negotiate with him. 
</P>
<P>
	If the player doesn't sign, the major league team doesn't have  
to pay the bid amount and the Japanese team can't make the player 
available again until the next November.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Helped bin Laden Disappear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) -- Two weeks ago, suspected terrorist  
Osama bin Laden disappeared from his refuge in southern 
Afghanistan. Since then, his whereabouts have been a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	Afghanistan's Taliban rulers say they have no idea where he is --  
even though, according to a top Taliban official, he was 
accompanied by 10 Afghan agents sent to both protect and spy on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities, who want bin Laden in connection with the Aug.  
7 bombings that devastated the U.S. embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania, also say they have no idea whether the Saudi national is 
still in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden arrived here nearly five years ago, taking refuge amid  
Afghanistan's anarchy after Sudan expelled him. His disappearance 
followed a U.S. missile attack against his training camps on Aug. 
21, and Taliban assertions that they were putting pressure on him 
to rein in his activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, who speaks for Taliban supreme leader  
Mullah Mohammed Omar, says the Taliban sent bin Laden his escorts 
on Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the escorts worked for the Taliban's Interior Ministry,  
a police organization. Their job was to protect bin Laden, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others worked for the secret service. Their job was ``to spy on  
him'' and still others worked for the Foreign Ministry ``because he 
is our foreign guest,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 13, Omar announced that bin Laden had disappeared.  
</P>
<P>
	As of Sunday, bin Laden's escorts had not returned to the  
Taliban's southern stronghold of Kandahar, militia officials claim. 
Nor is there any sign the escorts have left Afghanistan, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were told to go up to a place where he wants to go and  
where they can go,'' Muttawakil said. ``To leave the country would 
require formalities, passports, visas. I don't think they would 
have left the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about bin Laden's whereabouts, Omar, the Taliban leader,  
said in a written response: ``I am saying it with full authority 
that we have no information. ... And neither have we received any 
information about whether he is dead or alive. We did not ask him 
to leave Afghanistan. He was free to decide whether to stay in 
Afghanistan or whether to leave the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the West could be expected to believe the Taliban had  
no idea where bin Laden is, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hajji Fazle 
Mohammed said: ``That's the problem ... the West doesn't trust us 
and we don't trust the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kandahar, a dust-clogged city of 200,000 people where bin  
Laden lived only six miles from Omar, many people believe bin Laden 
is still in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe he has moved only 50 miles away, to the relative  
safety of Islam Dara, a warren of caves and stone barracks used by 
Afghans who fought against Soviet troops. Concealed in the crevices 
of Sheikh Hazrat Mountain, the base is protected by land mines and 
reachable only by a maze of foot paths. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks before bin Laden disappeared, scores of Arabs began  
arriving at Sheikh Hazrat, villagers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a single night they saw 20 minivans and off-road vehicles  
with their windows blackened, all carrying Arabs and following a 
dust-covered trail toward Sheikh Hazrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear that they were Osama's people ... The people of  
the village, everyone knew they were Osama's people and then the 
radio said he was gone,'' said Mohammed Nabi, who operates a 
ramshackle wheat milling shop in the nearby village of Chinar. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabi was not happy at the prospect of playing host to bin Laden.  
``Foreigners have destroyed our country,'' he said. ``They come 
here to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden's four wives and an unknown number of children have  
remained in Kandahar, according to Muttawakil, who said they live 
near the Kandahar airport in a compound of 300 homes built by bin 
Laden to house his Arab followers. 
</P>
<P>
	The family is not allowed any visitors, Muttawakil added.  
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban have refused several requests from the United States  
to hand over bin Laden, saying he is a guest and friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Muttawakil said that on Feb. 10, the Taliban took bin Laden's  
satellite telephone and banned him from meeting anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those were the rules ... (he) could not talk to anyone,'' said  
Muttawakil. ``Every human being has the right to discuss his ideas 
but we told him he can't even do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What prompted Bin Laden's disappearance?  
</P>
<P>
	Many people in Kandahar believe bin Laden left because the  
Taliban had received threats from the United States that another 
missile attack was being prepared on Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Muttawakil said the Taliban recently refused an American request  
to hand bin Laden to the United States, Saudi Arabia or to a third 
country where he could stand trial, but that there wasn't a direct 
American threat. He added, however, ``It won't be strange if they 
attack us again ... it's really our fate to be attacked by 
everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.  
Henry H. Shelton, refused to rule out new bombing raids on 
Afghanistan, saying: ``We will deal with him by whatever means we 
feel are appropriate.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Williams Trying Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Brian Williams has walked into the  
New York Giants locker room at least a thousand times in his 
career. But this time he got goose bumps. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that feeling of being a rookie center and first-round  
draft pick again, the unknown, the excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	This was even better. After missing the last two NFL seasons  
because of a freak eye injury that seemingly had taken away his 
career in its prime, Williams is coming back to the game he loves 
at 32 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess this a dream come true,'' Williams said after working  
out for the first time in a long time at Giants Stadium. ``It will 
take a lot, working out with the guys and getting the motions down 
and the terminology. My head is rolling, but it's all for good 
reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long comeback from the injury in the opening days of  
training camp in 1997. Just days after camp opened, Williams was 
engaged in a one-on-one blocking drill with Bernard Holsey when one 
of the defensive lineman's fingers slipped through the cage on 
Williams' mask and poked him in the right eye, fracturing his orbit 
and injuring the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial estimate was Williams would be out two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the injury also caused him to develop double vision and  
he never had more than 40 percent of his vision in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years, two surgeries and countless visits to the  
doctor's office, the Giants 1989 first-round draft pick is looking 
to reclaim his job. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnaround came when Williams had surgery in October during  
which a bigger plate was inserted around the orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Every morning after the surgery, Williams would walk into his  
bathroom and look at a grab bar on his shower. Morning after 
morning nothing improved. With each disappointing day, Williams 
would telephone a report to his doctors and look for reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before Christmas, Williams got the present he so long had  
waited for. His vision improved to the point where it's now 75 
percent in the eye. He has trouble casting his vision down while 
facing forward, but he notes when he wants to see something on the 
ground he looks in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'm not allowed to complain any more, my wife said,''  
Williams quipped. ``If I am hurting or tired, forget it. I'm not 
allowed to complain, but I do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of work being here, a lot of hardships. But there's  
a lot of great things that happen being a part of this and I'm 
looking forward to it,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who held the Giants starting job from 1994 until he  
was injured, said there was only one time he gave up hope of 
playing again. 
</P>
<P>
	During the entire span, he never used the word retired even  
though he would attend every Sunday and see Derek Engler and later 
Lance Scott make every snap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't, to me retired that meant no more, no more chances  
and like I said, I still had hope, and that's why I'm here,'' he 
said Monday after working out. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the battle is to get his body back in football shape after  
two seasons and to learn Jim Fassel's offense. Williams was just 
starting to do that when he was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Never one to work out with the team in the offseason, Williams  
plans to show up one week a month until training camp. During the 
season, he will wear a visor with tinted glass to protect his eye 
since the pupil no longer works properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just here because I have a job,'' Williams said. ``Am I  
going to be the starter? I have to earn the starting spot, but like 
I said, it will take a lot of hard work to get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's work Williams is going to enjoy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to hurt again but I can't wait to hurt again,''  
he added.

<HEADLINE> Sony Has More Powerful PlayStation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Computer Entertainment unveiled today a new  
version of its popular PlayStation video-game player, a more 
powerful system with better graphics and memory that is expected to 
be launched next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The widely anticipated player, provisionally named PlayStation  
II, will use a 128-bit microprocessor developed jointly with 
Toshiba Corp. It is four times more powerful than the current 
PlayStation on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The new machine will match the power of rival Sega's new  
Dreamcast game player, which went on sale in Japan last November 
and will be launched in the United States this fall. It will be 
twice as powerful as Nintendo's popular 64-bit system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony said the new PlayStation boasts higher resolution, faster  
processing speeds and greatly expanded memory capacity that 
translates into real-time responses to commands and computer 
graphic-quality images. 
</P>
<P>
	The PlayStation II stores data on DVD-ROM discs, a step up from  
the more common CD-ROM disc used for the current generation of 
PlayStation software. 
</P>
<P>
	All games sold for the old system will be compatible with the  
updated console, so the hundreds of software titles available for 
the classic PlayStation will not become obsolete overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony expects the new system to be available in stores in Japan  
next winter and in the United States by the fall of the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 million units of the original PlayStation have been  
sold worldwide since its debut in Japan in 1994 and in the United 
States a year later. It accounts for more than two-thirds of the 
game console market, eclipsing competitors such as Sega and 
Nintendo Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But by disclosing its plans for PlayStation II, Sony could see a  
sharp drop in sales of its current game hardware and software if 
consumers hold onto their money until the new version of the game 
player comes out. 
</P>
<P>
	That could hurt Sony's earnings, at least in the short term,  
because strong PlayStation sales have helped offset a slump in 
sales revenue from its other consumer electronics products in key 
markets such as the United States and Japan.

<HEADLINE> IBM Selling Recycled Plastic PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Rapid change in the high-tech business change has a downside: a  
mountain of obsolete computer components that ends up in landfills. 
IBM announced Monday it was trying to counter the trend, selling a 
commercial PC made of recycled plastic from old, discarded computer 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer, the IntelliStation E Pro CPU, has a $2,155 price  
tag, but International Business Machines Corp. expects the new PC 
to do well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly a lot more people are focused on the environment,''  
said Carla Davison, vice president of marketing for commercial PCs 
for the computer maker, which produced the PC at its plant in 
Research Triangle Park, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Davison said the computers don't cost more to make because of  
the recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Baker, director of consumer market research at Dataquest, a  
San Jose, Calif. high-tech research firm, called the PC a clever 
idea that will catch the attention of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game of PCs is the little things,'' he said, adding that  
no computer will sell if it doesn't offer consumers enough 
processing speed and power at the right price. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the little things that may nudge you toward one and away  
from the others,'' he said. ``If this is what appeals to people 
with `green' leanings, so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, about 10  
percent of the total weight of municipal landfill waste is plastic 
refuse. Around the world, IBM Worldwide Materials Recovery Centers 
process large amounts of plastic waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this will be a selling point in U.S. markets and  
that it will do especially well in other parts of the world, 
including Europe,'' Davison said. ``In the Nordic countries, 
environmental policies are extremely important in the 
marketplace.''

<HEADLINE>  Iraq Says Attack Halts Oil Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AIN ZALA, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. airstrikes on two communications  
centers in northern Iraq will stop the flow of oil through the 
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline indefinitely, an Iraqi oil official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the two strikes, which occurred one day and 70 miles  
apart, it will take ``a long time'' to resume pumping, said Hussein 
al-Fattal, head of operations for Iraq's Northern Oil Company. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt to resume pumping failed Monday, he said: ``We tried  
to restart pumping, but we lost communications and control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operator at the Ain Zala communications center, 300 miles  
north of Baghdad, was killed in Monday's bombing, al-Fattal said, 
and several people were wounded. Iraqi officials have said one 
person was killed and two were wounded in Sunday's bombing 70 miles 
south of Ain Zala. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British planes, which patrol the skies over northern  
and southern Iraq, have been striking Iraqi targets almost daily 
since late December. The allies have said they are attacking 
military targets in response to Iraq firing at the planes or 
locking its radar systems on to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Fattal and other Iraqi officials have denied the two centers  
hit were ever used for military purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Ain Zala center functioned as an oil relay station,  
carrying signals between Iraq and Turkey, and was used to maintain 
contact between branches of the company in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi engineers and technicians were clearing debris and trying  
to restore power to residents of Ain Zala, a relatively minor 
oil-producing town that pumps about 10,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The communications center, on the side of a tree-lined hill, is  
300 feet from about 50 houses for oil workers. Iraqi officials, who 
escorted journalists to see the damage, displayed a metal container 
about 20 inches long that they said was part of the two bombs that 
hit the center Monday. Metal scraps and debris from electricity 
poles and wires littered the area.

<HEADLINE>  Iraq Says Attack Halts Oil Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AIN ZALA, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. airstrikes on two communications  
centers in northern Iraq will stop the flow of oil through the 
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline indefinitely, an Iraqi oil official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the two strikes, which occurred one day and 70 miles  
apart, it will take ``a long time'' to resume pumping, said Hussein 
al-Fattal, head of operations for Iraq's Northern Oil Company. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt to resume pumping failed Monday, he said: ``We tried  
to restart pumping, but we lost communications and control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operator at the Ain Zala communications center, 300 miles  
north of Baghdad, was killed in Monday's bombing, al-Fattal said, 
and several people were wounded. Iraqi officials have said one 
person was killed and two were wounded in Sunday's bombing 70 miles 
south of Ain Zala. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British planes, which patrol the skies over northern  
and southern Iraq, have been striking Iraqi targets almost daily 
since late December. The allies have said they are attacking 
military targets in response to Iraq firing at the planes or 
locking its radar systems on to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Fattal and other Iraqi officials have denied the two centers  
hit were ever used for military purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Ain Zala center functioned as an oil relay station,  
carrying signals between Iraq and Turkey, and was used to maintain 
contact between branches of the company in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi engineers and technicians were clearing debris and trying  
to restore power to residents of Ain Zala, a relatively minor 
oil-producing town that pumps about 10,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The communications center, on the side of a tree-lined hill, is  
300 feet from about 50 houses for oil workers. Iraqi officials, who 
escorted journalists to see the damage, displayed a metal container 
about 20 inches long that they said was part of the two bombs that 
hit the center Monday. Metal scraps and debris from electricity 
poles and wires littered the area. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear whether the Ain Zala center could be repaired,  
said al-Fattal, who estimated the damage has cost Iraq at least 
$2.5 million. Officials have said 56 percent of Iraq's oil exports 
flow through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	In Turkey, meanwhile, the Anatolia news agency reported that a  
delegation of Turkish technicians had traveled to a communications 
center in Silopi, near the Iraqi border, to coordinate the 
re-establishment of communication with the Iraqis.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Bid for New Sentencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal prison inmates are not automatically  
entitled to a new sentencing because a judge failed to tell them of 
their right to appeal, the Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous decision said a Pennsylvania inmate is not  
entitled to a new sentencing because he knew he had a right to 
appeal, and therefore was not harmed by the judge's error. 
</P>
<P>
	``A district court's failure to advise the defendant of his  
right to appeal does not entitle him to ... relief if he knew of 
his right and hence suffered no prejudice from the omission,'' 
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel D. Peguero pleaded guilty in 1992 to conspiring to  
distribute cocaine in York, Pa. A federal judge sentenced him to 22 
years and 10 months in prison but did not tell him he could appeal 
the sentence. Such notification is required by the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Peguero did not file an appeal. But in December 1996 he filed a  
new court action, seeking a new sentencing and citing the judge's 
failure to tell him he could appeal his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing, Peguero's lawyer said he had told his client he  
could appeal, but that Peguero said he did not want to. Peguero 
testified he told his lawyer he wanted to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Harrisburg ruled against Peguero. The 3rd  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the error was harmless 
and did not result in a miscarriage of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the requirement that judges tell defendants of  
their right to appeal serves important functions, giving defendants 
an opportunity to announce their intention to appeal and ensuring 
they know about their right even if their lawyers fail to tell 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trial judges must be meticulous and precise in following each  
of the requirements of (the rule) in every case,'' Kennedy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But when a judge violates the rule, inmates such as Peguero are  
entitled to a new sentencing only when they show they were harmed 
by the court's error, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, (Peguero) had full knowledge of his right to  
appeal, hence the district court's violation ... by failing to 
inform him of that right did not prejudice him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Peguero vs. U.S., 97-9217.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Switch-Prostate Cancer Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A gene linked to advanced breast cancer in women also plays a  
key role in the final stages of prostate cancer in men, according 
to research published this month in the journal Nature Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The complicity of the HER-2 gene raises the possibility that  
Herceptin -- a breakthrough breast-cancer drug that has extended the 
lives of many critically ill women -- might do the same for men. 
</P>
<P>
	Herceptin already is being tested in several medical centers to  
treat prostate cancer, the second-leading cancer killer of men 
behind lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If HER-2 is indeed involved, we may see a new treatment sooner  
than we thought,'' said Tapio Visakorpi, a Finnish cancer 
researcher who reviewed the two journal studies of prostate cancer 
genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, an estimated 184,500 American men develop prostate  
cancer, and more than 41,000 die from it, according to the American 
Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1941, doctors have known that prostate cancer is  
stimulated by androgens, or male sex hormones. Since then, a 
standard treatment has been to surgically or chemically castrate 
patients to eliminate the cancer's primary source of androgens. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the cancer eventually can rejuvenate without androgens  
and fatally spread to surrounding bones and tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study at the University of California, Los Angeles,  
researchers determined that the cancer rebounds because the HER-2 
gene begins to overproduce a protein that mimics the male hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, the government approved the bioengineered drug  
Herceptin to treat late-stage breast cancer. Herceptin stimulates 
the immune system to produce an antibody that blocks excess HER-2 
activity. In about half of the breast cancer patients tested, 
Herceptin shrank tumors substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	More studies are planned to see if Herceptin can shrink prostate  
tumors, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers are not so sure Herceptin would be effective.  
</P>
<P>
	HER-2 plays a lesser role in prostate cancer than in some cases  
of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``An unanswered question is whether HER-2 is present as a result  
of cancer or whether it actually contributes to causing the 
cancer,'' said urologist Dr. Martin Sanda of the University of 
Michigan. ``The changes in HER-2 are more subtle than in breast 
cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate study, scientists at Johns Hopkins University  
found evidence that mutations in a gene that is supposed to 
suppress tumors may play a role in causing prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 87 percent of 55 cancerous prostates examined, the  
researchers found that the pp32 gene had been turned off in the 
tumor tissue but was present in the healthy surrounding tissue. 
They also found that two mutations of the gene had been turned on 
in the tumor tissue but not in the healthy tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rare commodity when you have whole prostate out and can  
look at cancer and normal tissue in the same patient,'' Dr. Gary 
Pasternak of Johns Hopkins. ``The first three out of the box 
displayed these changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the discovery of the pp32 genetic switch opens  
new possibilities for prostate cancer screening and treatment. 
``The p32 gene still is there. We're looking for the right key to 
turn it back on,'' Pasternak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists noted that the Johns Hopkins team has not shown  
that the mutations actually cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study is still very preliminary,'' said Robert Matusik,  
urology research director at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
``Gene expression is a very complex process, and developing 
therapies rapidly will be difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Inflation Is 0.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Annual inflation for the 11 euro zone  
countries was 0.8 percent in January, unchanged from December and 
up from 0.7 percent a year earlier, the EU statistics office 
Eurostat said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the latest data does not support a change in  
monetary policy by the European Central Bank when its governing 
council meets Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	For all 15 European Union countries - 11 that have the euro as a  
currency, plus Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece - the average 
annual inflation rate was 0.9 percent, down from 1.0 percent in 
December, Eurostat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak French and German figures last month were offset by  
stronger gains in Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual inflation amounted to 0.2 percent in Germany and 0.4  
percent in France, while Luxembourg saw inflation fall 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other rates included Spain at 1.5 percent, Italy at 1.5 percent  
and the Netherlands at 2.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Italian Sailor Makes His Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The Italian yachtsman who made a  
daring high seas rescue of a competitor two weeks ago moved into 
position to take the lead in the Around Alone regatta on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, Giovanni Soldini trailed Marc Thiercelin by 18  
hours, but the Frenchman's boat was in the Falkland Islands for 
repairs after it lost its mast. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini was expected to reach Punta del Este, Uruguay, Wednesday  
and win the third leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The around-the-world sailing competition began in September at  
Charleston, S.C., and is to end there in May after 27,000 nautical 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin led Soldini after leaving Auckland, New Zealand,  
heading for South America, but he lost his mast Thursday in the 
stormy South Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said repairs should keep Thiercelin in port for only  
8-10 days before he sails to Punta del Este to conclude the third 
leg -- and he still was given a shot at winning the overall race. 
The yachts are scheduled to leave Punta del Este on April 10 for 
the last leg to Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Giovanni will end up being several hours, maybe days  
ahead of Thiercelin's boat'' on the current leg, said race director 
Mark Schrader in Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``There's more than 5,000 miles of sailing left,  
so it's by no mean over. There will be a good race betweeen 
Giovanni and Marc Thiercelin'' to the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday Tuesday, Soldini was reported to be about 220 miles  
south of Punta del Este off the Argentine coast, carrying rescued 
yachtswoman Isabelle Autissier of France. 
</P>
<P>
	They were short on water and food, sharing supplies normally  
meant for one. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini rescued Autissier on Feb. 16 after being directed to  
leave the course to try and find the Frenchwoman's yacht, which had 
overturned in stormy seas. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived at 2 a.m., began a search, and found her 60-foot boat  
bobbing upside down. Soldini tossed a hammer at the hull to alert 
Autissier of his arrival, and she emerged after waiting more than 
24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin was criticized at the time because his yacht was  
actually closer to Autissier's -- 120 miles away to Soldini's 200 
miles. But he said problems with his boom would not allow him to 
move quickly upwind. His critics noted that he managed to build up 
a 400-mile lead during the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin ran into trouble of his own Thursday when his mast  
toppled, destroying navigation equipment in stormy waters 180 miles 
west of the Falklands Islands.

<HEADLINE> 800 People May Be Missing in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Hundreds of people have disappeared  
after being arrested by police or security forces in India's 
northern Kashmir state during a nine-year-old insurgency, Amnesty 
International said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report entitled ``If they are dead, tell us,'' Amnesty  
estimated there have been more than 800 unsolved disappearances 
since 1990. Ordinary people -- lawyers, businessmen, teachers, 
laborers -- disappeared and many had no links to the fighting 
between separatist militants and security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Government spokeswoman N.J. Krishna said she could not  
immediately comment on the London-based group's charges. In the 
past, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has acknowledged what he 
called isolated incidents of human rights violations by his 
security forces in Kashmir, but said his government was committed 
to rooting out abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty said it submitted a draft report to the Indian  
government in November 1998 and had offered to send an expert 
delegation to help locate some of the missing people. The 
government of India has yet to make a substantive response, Amnesty 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of groups in the state are fighting for an independent  
Kashmir or for a merger with neighboring Pakistan. As many as 
17,000 people have been killed since the fighting began. India 
accuses Pakistan of training and arming separatists, a charge 
Pakistan denies. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty said it did not underestimate the security problems in  
Kashmir where ``armed groups with foreign backing have committed 
terrible abuses against the common population.'' But it said this 
did not absolve the government of the responsibility to trace the 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report accused the state of obstructing justice, and said it  
was not aware of a single disappearance case where those 
responsible were convicted and sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, relatives of missing people were threatened and warned  
to give up their search, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Over 900 Women Sue Merrill Lynch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Taking the latest stand against bias on Wall  
Street, more than 900 current and former female employees at 
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. have filed discrimination complaints as part of 
a class-action settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of claimants joining the suit settled last June is  
three to four times what had been expected, plaintiffs' lawyers 
said on the eve of today's deadline to file a claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is closely watched, coming on the heels of an infamous  
discrimination case settled last year involving Smith Barney. The 
settlement is also helping change the way discrimination cases are 
handled on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, nearly all cases were handled through industry  
arbitration -- a system criticized as biased in favor of companies. 
Under the settlement, Merrill Lynch became the first Wall Street 
firm to end mandatory arbitration for civil rights claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's accountability and liability,'' said Linda  
Friedman, a partner in the Chicago law firm Stowell &AMP; Friedman, 
which is handling the Merrill Lynch case. ``Our hope is that this 
will change the balance of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firm also represented the plaintiffs in the Smith Barney  
suit, which grew out of allegations of sexual hijinks and pranks in 
a so-called ``boom room'' at the brokerage's Garden City, N.Y. 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	To some observers, the cases uncover common problems for women  
on Wall Street. ``It's one of the last bastions of discriminatory 
treatment and unequal standards in the country,'' said Laurel 
Bellows, former head of the American Bar Association's Commission 
on Women. ``The rest of corporate America seems to have figured out 
that they benefit from qualified, intelligent women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Merrill Lynch case, originally filed on behalf of eight  
plaintiffs, anyone complaining of discrimination will have their 
claim handled by a court-supervised mediator. If necessary, the 
complaint will go to binding arbitration. Financial consultants who 
worked at Merrill Lynch from January 1994 through June 1998 are 
eligible for redress. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no maximum or minimum amount of money available to the  
plaintiffs, but the first plaintiff, Marybeth Cremin, said Monday 
that given the high earning power of the women, millions of dollars 
could be involved. In additional to possible future awards, the 
eight original plaintiffs will share a $600,000 payment for being 
the first to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Most complaints in the case involve economic discrimination --  
the funneling of tips, clients and business to male brokers, the 
plaintiffs' lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Women were often paid lower salaries than less-qualified men,  
then told, '' 'Well, you have a husband,' or 'Men have a family to 
support,' '' said Mary Stowell, who is also representing the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a systemic problem,'' said Cremin, who worked at  
Merrill Lynch for 13 years. ``The accounts and assets were for a 
large part going to male brokers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch spokesman Bill Halldin said the company had ``not  
found any evidence of systemic discrimination'' against any 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take all complaints from employees very seriously because  
we have no tolerance for discrimination of any kind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that the company did away with mandatory arbitration  
because ``there was a perception of unfairness in arbitration and 
we're committed to making our workplace an excellent one and we 
thought this was an important step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights and employee groups have been pressuring the  
industry to do away with mandatory arbitration for years, and in 
the last year, regulatory organizations began joining Merrill Lynch 
in moving away from the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Jan. 1, the National Association of Security Dealers  
ended its requirement for arbitration in discrimination cases. 
Individual securities firms can still impose the mandate on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's rights advocates applaud the legal developments, which  
threaten firms with public exposure and payouts if they allow 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Litigation is frequently the first wave of change,'' observed  
Sheila Wellington, head of Catalyst, a group that works to advance 
women in business and is currently studying women on Wall Street. 
``We will be watching, and others will too.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Major Leaguer Faces Sentencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Former San Diego Padres player John D'Acquisto  
faces decades in prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and 
money laundering in an investment scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Acquisto, 46, who pitched for five major league teams from  
1973-1982, will be sentenced May 19 in San Diego Superior Court on 
charges he defrauded investors of about $7 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Acquisto admitted in court Monday that he persuaded investors  
to put millions of dollars into business entities he controlled. He 
falsely represented to those investors that several hundred million 
dollars was put in programs that could provide returns of 5 to 7 1/2 
percent per week. 
</P>
<P>
	He also generated false investment transaction reports, which  
claimed that some investments had grown by millions of dollars. In 
fact, little or no funds had been invested on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Acquisto used they money to buy three race horses, a $70,000  
Porsche, a contingent interest in a Mexican minor league baseball 
team and vacant land in Mexico, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces up to 10 years on each of the 34 counts of money  
laundering and five years for wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment scheme wasn't D'Acquisto's first. In 1996, he was  
sentenced to more than 5 years in prison after he was convicted of 
attempting to open a trading account at Prudential Securities Inc. 
in New York by presenting a forged $200 million certificate of 
deposit. He was later indicted on the California charges. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Acquisto talked big-money transactions for years, and once  
said he could write a check to buy the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	A Padres pitcher from 1977 to 1980, D'Acquisto also played for  
San Francisco, St. Louis and Oakland. He finished with a career 
record of 34-51, with his best season being a 12-14 mark with San 
Francisco in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Expelled Midshipmen Owe Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Some were too fat and couldn't do the  
required number of chin-ups. Others were expelled from the Naval 
Academy for misconduct and failing grades. And some just decided 
the Navy wasn't for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, an average of 44 midshipmen each year have broken  
``an agreement to serve'' that obligates them to repay the cost of 
their education if they resign or are expelled, The (Baltimore) Sun 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	One Pentagon agency says 121 former midshipmen owe a total of  
$2.8 million, but the amount could be three times as much, The Sun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Midshipmen who are kicked out or resign during their first two  
years are not obligated to repay the cost of their education. But 
juniors and seniors must, unless the academy agrees to let them 
serve two to three years as Navy or Marine Corp enlistees. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy says 265 midshipmen were expelled or resigned in  
their junior or senior years from 1993 to 1998. The 105 expelled 
for honor or conduct violations were told to pay the Navy $68,000 
to $94,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some former midshipmen say they've gotten away with refusing to  
pay. Others often have to pay 70 percent or 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One midshipman expelled for being overweight sued in federal  
court, claiming his weight problem was a medical condition. His 
debt was waived. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, one of the 15 midshipmen expelled in a 1995 drug  
scandal asked his senator to pressure the Pentagon, which waived 
his $86,000 debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Murphy Jr., an Annapolis lawyer who has helped midshipmen  
get their debts waived, said he knows many cases where debts have 
been forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally, there are no guidelines by which senior Pentagon  
officials make these decisions, and it leaves room for unfairness 
based on political unfairness,'' he said. ``With prospective 
clients, one of the first things I ask is whether you or anybody in 
your family knows anybody in Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Alou Ponders Future of Expos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- With the Montreal Expos' players wondering  
if the team will move after this season, manager Felipe Alou 
remembered back to 1965, when he played for the Braves during their 
final season in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had announced before the 1965 season the Braves would be  
moving to Atlanta in 1966,'' recalled Alou, a major league 
outfielder from 1958-74. ``We only drew 500,000 (555,584) the last 
year in Milwaukee. The fans knew it wasn't the players' fault, but 
we still heard about it on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal, which drew just 914,717, is facing a possible move  
following the rejection of government financing for a new ballpark. 
Commissioner Bud Selig is expected to announce that week that Expos 
team president -- who is feuding with others in the team's ownership 
group -- has permission to negotiate with out-of-town suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups in Northern Virginia and Washington are seeking a major  
league team, and a group in North Carolina talked last year about 
trying to buy the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our young players worry about their future, where they will be  
playing,'' Alou said. ``Some of players may want to sign long-term 
contracts to play in Montreal but they don't know where the team 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing we tell them is that these talks have nothing  
to do with what goes on between the lines, on the field. We tell 
them to keep working hard, try to get better, have a good season, 
and they will play major league baseball someplace.''

<HEADLINE> New Beacons Help Ships Avoid Reefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New navigational aids have been installed in  
the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary to help ships avoid 
grounding on fragile coral reefs, the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The beacons were purchased by the owners of a ship that grounded  
on a coral reef in 1997, as part of a damage assessment and 
restoration agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coral reefs of the Florida Keys are a national treasure.  
Providing a navigation system that will help prevent vessel 
groundings is a truly creative and innovative approach to repairing 
harm to the public's resources,'' said Terry Garcia, assistant 
secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The beacons are mounted on navigational structures along the  
Florida reef tract, stretching from Miami to Loggerhead Key in the 
Dry Tortugas, 70 nautical miles west of Key West. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices emit unique signals that appear on ship radar,  
allowing mariners to precisely identify the location of 
navigational aids and warn ships that they are nearing a reef. Each 
signal has a range of 15 to 20 nautical miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The beacons were provided by the owners of the containership  
Houston, a 613-foot vessel that went aground on a coral reef near 
Maryland Shoal off the lower Florida Keys. The Houston cut a swath 
through the reef, crushing and breaking corals for about 400 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal and state statutes, parties that harm resources in  
national marine sanctuaries are responsible for restoring the 
injured resources and the services they provide.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Would Help With Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House passed a bill Tuesday that would  
create a four-year, $15 million pilot loan program for small 
business owners and homeowners who want to improve their buildings 
or move to avoid likely natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, introduced by Rep. James Talent, R-Mo., the  
loans would be used to take preventative measures to lessen the 
impact of floods, hurricanes and other acts of nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Businesses have only been able to get help after it's too  
late,'' said Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y. ``This program will 
change that story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be drawn from existing disaster loan programs  
and would not constitute new spending, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program would be administered by the Small Business  
Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA 
has estimated that every dollar spent on preventative measures will 
save $2 in costs associated with damage caused by natural 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	No matching bill has yet been introduced in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 818.

<HEADLINE> Senate Takes Up Y2K Lawsuit Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate wants to help small businesses deal  
with Year 2000 computer crashes as part of a ``Y2K Day'' devoted to 
making people more aware of the problems that could arise from 
computers not prepared for the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	A special Senate panel on the Year 2000 computer problem also  
was releasing a report today detailing widespread disturbances that 
could occur on and after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the report, Sens. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, and  
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., wrote in a letter to their colleagues 
last week that all sectors of the economy ``are at risk, including 
public utilities, health care, telecommunications, transportation, 
banking and finance, commerce and small business and national 
security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One major concern, the report says, is that 90 percent of  
doctors haven't fixed their computers and could temporarily lose 
medical records and smaller hospitals may not be fully prepared for 
possible shutdowns in medical devices such as dialysis machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate planned to spend the afternoon discussing the report,  
which emphasizes that for most people disruptions will be minor -- 
phones will work and planes will keep flying -- but recommends that 
people stock extra food and water in the event of temporary 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also was voting today on a measure sponsored by Sen.  
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., that would require the Small Business 
Administration to guarantee loans for businesses trying to fix 
their own computers or threatened by the Y2K problems of their 
suppliers, customers or financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the noncontroversial legislation, the SBA is expected to  
guarantee about $500 million in loans through the end of the 
program on Dec. 31, 2000. Studies have concluded that up to 750,000 
small businesses could be severely hurt or be forced to shut down 
because of the glitch in many computers that keeps them from 
differentiating between the year 2000 and the year 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and Dodd also were going behind closed doors with other  
senators during the day to discuss Y2K-related national security 
and international issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon, which was explaining its Y2K readiness at a House  
hearing today, insists that its thousands of computer systems will 
be upgraded by the end of the year and there will be contingency 
plans in the event of any malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Of greater concern is the threat of a severe economic blow to  
the countries around the world lagging in their Y2K preparations. 
Russia in particular could face midwinter energy shortages and 
breakdowns in its nuclear power and missile systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday took up a more  
controversial bill, a measure sponsored by Sens. Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah, and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that would limit lawsuits 
arising from Y2K breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has strong backing from the business community, which  
warns that Y2K problems could result in up to $1 trillion in 
lawsuits. U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue told 
the Judiciary Committee that one estimate is that for every dollar 
spent fixing the problem, $2 or $3 will be spent in courts. 
``Obviously, this scenario would be a monumental tragedy for 
American businesses, workers and consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration, backed by trial lawyers, has blocked all  
previous efforts by the GOP-led Congress to reduce punitive damages 
in product liability cases. Assistant Attorney General Eleanor 
Acheson, at the hearing, questioned whether the legislation could 
undercut the incentives for fixing Y2K problems and ``prevent 
businesses and consumers with legitimate claims from vindicating 
their rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would set aside a 90-day ``problem-solving'' period  
allowing companies to remedy problems before lawsuits can be filed. 
It would encourage mediation, limit punitive damages and put some 
restrictions on class-action lawsuits. The Senate Commerce 
Committee is to vote Wednesday on a similar bill sponsored by its 
chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Teens Continue U.S. Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Miscommunication between two tour companies  
apparently was responsible for confusion about the whereabouts of 
32 Chinese students who disappeared from the airport, police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers said the students are staying in this country for  
additional study, not, as originally thought, because of a group 
defection plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, they're simply students here studying,'' police  
Cmdr. David Kalish said. ``They are all here legally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police tracked down all but seven of the students and were still  
seeking the remaining members of the group, Kalish said today. The 
25 students who had been located were staying with host families 
and have their parents' permission to be here, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18 girls and 14 boys, who had been studying English at the  
University of Redlands, were taken to Los Angeles International 
Airport by a chartered bus Monday morning, apparently for a flight 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, several Asian men approached the group, took  
their luggage and passports, and whisked them away in cars. 
Witnesses told police that the youths, who ranged in age from 14 to 
17, went with the men willingly. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how the miscommunication between tour companies  
occurred and why the students were taken to the airport and booked 
for a flight home if their extended stay was planned, Kalish said. 
He said he didn't have any additional details. 
</P>
<P>
	California in recent years has seen numerous attempts by  
smugglers trying to bring Chinese immigrants into the United 
States, and authorities initially suspected the students were 
defecting, although none of the teens was known to have applied for 
political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two of the students were found at homes in Covina,  
about 25 miles east of Los Angeles in the San Gabriel Valley, which 
has become home to growing numbers of Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Patterson, director of the training center that taught the  
students, said the teens lived with host families in the Redlands 
area while attending classes. Redlands is about 40 miles east of 
Covina.

<HEADLINE> Boat Deaths Prompt Safety Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After four sinkings along the East Coast killed 11  
clam fishermen in less than a month, a Coast Guard panel is 
expected to recommend mandatory inspections of fishing boats and 
licensing of skippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's recommendations, due March 19, are aimed at making  
the most dangerous occupation in America safer. Commercial fishing 
has 131 deaths per year per 100,000 employees, according to the 
Occupational Health and Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard panel, which includes representatives of the  
industry and the government, was created in January after the four 
sinkings between Dec. 28 and Jan. 18. Three accidents took place 
off New Jersey, and one off New Bedford, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Panel member Bob Higgins, a Coast Guard safety coordinator, said  
Tuesday that the panel is expected to recommend mandatory 
inspections of fishing boats and and licensing for skippers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Congress has shot down licensing requirements three  
times because of concern the industry already is over-regulated. 
And the recommendations will probably meet with widespread 
opposition from the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fishing fleet is in such a battle over fishing  
regulations, this will be one more thing they'll put out and the 
guys will go berserk,'' said William Adler, a lobsterman and member 
of the Coast Guard's commercial fishing enforcement working group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they're trying to stomp out all possible ways people  
can get killed and that's very important. But the sinkings are 
still going to take place.''

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Forces Pound Kosovo Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav forces pounded Kosovo's  
border with Macedonia with tank and mortar fire today, pressing an 
offensive that has driven thousands of ethnic Albanian civilians 
from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a political development that could boost international  
efforts to persuade ethnic Albanians to accept a plan for 
self-rule, Adem Demaci stepped down as political adviser for the 
Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	The influential hard-liner, outspoken in his opposition to the  
U.S.-backed peace plan for Kosovo because it falls short of 
independence, said the KLA leadership ``thinks they know more about 
politics than I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demaci's departure may signal that guerrilla leaders, who have  
promised to sign a deal worked out last month in Rambouillet, 
France, when peace talks resume March 15, will not abandon that 
pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting, meanwhile, has surged in Kosovo. Yugoslav forces have  
been hammering the area with tank and mortar fire for days to 
control a strategic artery in the Serbian province, even as 
international officials struggle to contain the fighting before 
peace talks resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the Serbian Media Center reported fighting today  
about 30 miles west of Pristina after KLA fighters attacked a 
military convoy near Klina. 
</P>
<P>
	In the south, Yugoslav troops and tanks have been massing at the  
border, and a bridge connecting Macedonia and Kosovo is mined -- 
preparations either to prevent NATO forces from coming in or keep 
diplomatic monitors and refugees from getting out. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has been increasing its troops in Macedonia in expectation  
of sending a peacekeeping force into Kosovo to enforce a peace 
agreement -- or to extract international monitors if a deal 
collapses and NATO carries out threatened airstrikes against the 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace deal -- partially worked out in talks last month in  
France -- aims to end a year of fighting between Serb forces and 
ethnic Albanians fighting for the independence of the 
Albanian-majority province. Some 2,000 people have died and more 
than 300,000 -- mostly ethnic Albanians -- have been displaced by the 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Associated Press photographers said Serb forces appeared today  
to have taken the village of Gajre, 2 miles from the southeastern 
border of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Armored personnel carriers and trucks filled with Yugoslav army  
troops and police were stationed along a 9-mile stretch of road 
between the nearby villages of Kacanik and Jankovic, firing mortars 
and anti-aircraft cannons into snow-covered hills where refugees 
are believed to have fled. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of ethnic Albanians were camped in the open near the  
border as the result of fighting that intensified after rebels 
ambushed a convoy on Sunday, killing the Kacanik police commander. 
About 7,000 people attended the police officer's funeral today. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency said some 3,000 displaced people were  
already packed into Jankovic, living with local families, with 
hundreds of others camped on a snowy hillside in plastic tents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first case in some time where people are staying  
in the open,'' said Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the Geneva-based 
agency. ``And it has brought the refugee problem to the doorstep of 
Macedonia for the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With violence worsening, Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut  
Vollebaek was meeting in the Kosovo provincial capital, Pristina, 
today with ethnic Albanian leaders and Serb authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Vollebaek met the day before with Yugoslav President Slobodan

<HEADLINE> Playful Sosa Joins Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Sammy Sosa insists he's ready to play ball  
following a whirlwind offseason that took him all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been busy. But I'm only 30 years old, and I don't get  
tired,'' the National League MVP said Monday. ``To get tired is 
mental, and I'm strong mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was seen everywhere following a season in which he and Mark  
McGwire staged baseball's greatest home run derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The frequent flier, who said he often slept on long plane rides,  
worked for Dominican Republic hurricane relief, made public 
appearances and picked up awards. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in Japan, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Miami, New York, Los  
Angeles, Arizona, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Washington, where he 
helped light the national Christmas tree and attended the State of 
the Union address. His longest stay at home was about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied because 66 is a lot of home runs, and a lot of  
people wanted to shake my hand,'' Sosa said. ``I've been meeting a 
lot of people I would have never dreamed about. The nicer you are 
to people, the more they want to be around you. I think I have 
earned that respect from everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a humanitarian award he won at the ESPYs meant as much  
to him as the MVP because it represented something other than his 
accomplishments on the field. It recognized his work for his own 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saved a lot of lives back home because of the help that came  
in,'' he said. ``I'm doing something great and will continue to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll also continue to joke and smile and pledged not to change,  
despite his celebrity status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never forget where I come from,'' the former shoeshine  
boy said. ``I'm still hungry, and I'm still humble. This is my 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no pressure, he said, to repeat his MVP season of a  
year ago. His goal, he said, is to play in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``The race with Mark was great -- back and forth. We were  
motivation for each other. I just hope I can continue doing the 
job. I don't know if I can have another year like that, but you 
never know what will happen,'' Sosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire won the home run race 70-66, but Sosa helped the Cubs  
reach the playoffs for the first time in nearly a decade by hitting 
.308 with 158 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	If pitchers don't give him anything to hit this year, Sosa said  
he's prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I'll go to first, take a walk,'' he said. ``This is not  
1998. We don't need to go out and break records anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's first spring workout was nothing if not painful.  
</P>
<P>
	When a fan tossed a ball over a high fence for Sosa to  
autograph, it came as a surprise and plopped on the head of the 
normally sure-handed right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa sent six batting-practice homers over the fence at Fitch  
Park, but facing reliever Rod Beck, Sosa fouled a ball off his 
groin area and fell to the grass in pain. He shook it off and 
moments later was able to participate in a base-running drill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got me pretty good,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On a brilliant day with temperatures in the 80s, fans followed  
his every move, chanting his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy-six this year,'' one yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	Bats, shirts, programs and even an Arizona license plate ``Maris  
61'' were presented for Sosa to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more pressure on him because of what he did last  
year,'' teammate Gary Gaetti said. ``He can handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's arrival Monday came three days after the team's first  
full-squad workout, but still one day ahead of today's mandatory 
reporting date. He also reported three days later than most of his 
teammates last season, and it certainly didn't hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to camp bigger than last season -- his muscular arms  
bulged, and there was a little roll around his middle. He said he 
was up to 222 pounds, which would be a 12-pound increase from what 
he was listed at last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all muscle, no fat,'' he said with a huge laugh. ``I'm  
probably just eating better.''

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The New York Mets can only hope all their games go this well.  
</P>
<P>
	In the first spring training exhibition of the year, the Mets  
beat St. John's University 12-3 Tuesday at Port St. Lucie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Franco homered during a seven-run burst in the third  
inning, and Melvin Mora and Mike Kinkade also connected for the 
Mets before a crowd of 1,431. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Tyner, New York's No. 1 draft pick last June, went 3-for-5  
and stole two bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows they did a good job of scouting in the draft, he's  
exciting,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Mets pitchers combined on a five-hitter. Mets closer John  
Franco, a St. John's alumnus, did not pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibitions between major league teams begin Friday. Many clubs  
are playing intrasquad games in the meantime, and those featured a 
couple of familiar faces Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With his father sitting in the stands, Pete Rose Jr. got a hit  
in the Los Angeles Dodgers' game at Vero Beach, Fla. But Garth 
Brooks was a miss -- the country singer struck out in the San Diego 
Padres' game at Peoria, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	After being reminded by manager Bruce Bochy to put on his  
batting helmet, Brooks managed to foul off two pitches before 
chasing a neck-high fastball from non-roster righty Salvador 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was cool. I guess four out of the five pitches I was proud  
of. The last one I wasn't. That's the one I'll remember,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was there. That's why I was apologizing to my teammates. I  
was there,'' he said. ``The guy on first has to be moved over and 
it was my job to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks did fine in left field, cleanly handling a single in his  
only chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Sr., baseball's career hits leader, watched his 29-year-old  
son swing away at Dodgertown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let you know if he's my son after he hits,'' Rose said to  
a fan. ``If he gets a hit, he's my son. If he doesn't, he's your 
son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Jr. is just hoping for a chance with the Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got what it takes,'' he said Tuesday. ``I plan on  
making the team. I don't plan on playing in (Triple-A) 
Albuquerque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bust my tail,'' Pete Jr. said. ``I'm going to be in LA at  
some time. I'm a guy who's got some pop. Left-handed pop looks to 
be a little scarce around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander David Wells, meanwhile, had back spasms and was in  
Toronto's training room in Dunedin, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wells has some lower right back inflammation,'' Blue Jays  
trainer Tommy Craig said. ``We're treating him now, and he seems to 
be responding to the treatment and exercises. We don't anticipate 
it being a long and drawn-out thing. We're just going to take it 
day to day right now, then ease him back up to the on-the-field 
stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Logging Deal Saves Redwood Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Groves of towering redwoods that were  
saplings when the Roman Empire was at its height have been saved in 
a middle-of-the-night deal with the timber company that owns the 
tract along California's fog-shrouded Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and federal government spent $480 million to buy 12  
square miles of the Headwaters Forest and two other redwood groves 
from the Pacific Lumber Co. and set the properties aside as public 
preserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was reached in last-minute negotiations just before  
Monday's midnight deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which concludes more than a decade of  
negotiations, also imposes timber-cutting restrictions for the next 
50 years on an additional 330 square miles of redwoods that Pacific 
Lumber still owns. That area includes 12 stands of redwoods dating 
back 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Headwaters Forest is the largest block of ancient redwoods  
in private hands in the United States. Some of the trees are 2,000 
years old, as tall as 20-story buildings and more than 12 feet in 
diameter. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of major environmental groups welcomed the deal, which  
appeared dead following an impasse late last week. 
</P>
<P>
	But other environmentalists condemned the plan for failing to  
restrict logging in more redwood forests, which are a symbol of 
America's national wonders and celebrated in the song ``This Land 
Is Your Land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What about the orphans of the Headwaters Forest agreement? Too  
many areas are sacrificed!'' Susan Moloney shouted during a 
ceremony with Gov. Gray Davis and environmental leaders outside the 
Capitol in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Pacific Lumber and politicians from the White House to  
the state Capitol, 250 miles southeast of the forest, called the 
purchase historic. 
</P>
<P>
	``These redwoods are a natural treasure, as much a part of our  
legacy as the world's great libraries and cathedrals,'' President 
Clinton said. ``I am truly grateful that we are able to bestow this 
priceless gift on generations to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal consists of $250 million in federal money and $230  
million in state money -- dwarfing the $63 million the federal 
government recently paid Utah for almost 1 million acres of desert 
in the Grand Staircase National Monument. The federal government's 
authorization to spend the $250 million expired at midnight Monday, 
forcing the last-minute talks. 
</P>
<P>
	As a condition of the sale, Pacific Lumber agreed to strict  
environmental protections on the rest of its property in rugged 
Humboldt County, such as avoiding logging on the steepest hillsides 
and near seasonal streams. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pacific Lumber takes down a tree in a no-cutting zone, the  
company would be fined $1,000 to $3,000, plus up to 250 percent of 
the tree's pre-milled value, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some environmentalists claim the largest redwoods are worth up  
to $100,000 in lumber, but the company won't reveal its figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions are a key issue for homeowners whose downstream  
properties have been damaged by erosion and flooding and for 
activists trying to protect endangered animals such as coho salmon, 
which use the streams to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Lumber had rejected the plan on Friday because of the  
restrictions. But president John Campbell said ``subtle changes'' 
had assured him the company will be able to make a profit 
harvesting timber. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the deal was amended to let the company  
selectively cut trees on unstable ground even before company water 
experts determine where the seasonal streams are and the ``no-cut'' 
zones will be. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes after years of protests against Pacific Lumber  
and Texas financier Charles Hurwitz, whose Houston-based Maxxam 
Corp. bought Pacific Lumber in 1985 in a hostile takeover financed 
by junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	People in Scotia, the small town where Pacific Lumber is  
headquartered, were pleased that logging will continue at the 
company's vast properties outside the Headwaters preserve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here in this town the real issue is, does anybody in this town  
have a job tomorrow,'' said Chuck Opitz, manager of the Scotia Inn. 
``There's no alternative to timber, there's nothing that pays as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some environmentalists don't plan to ease up on Pacific  
Lumber -- particularly Julia ``Butterfly'' Hill, a protester who has 
lived since Dec. 10, 1997, in a Pacific Lumber redwood tree not far 
from the Headwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our government has bowed down to Pacific Lumber every step of  
the way,'' she said Tuesday, speaking over stiff winds that blew 
into her cellular phone 18 stories above tree stumps the size of 
small cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goals for complete protection of old growth forests have  
not been realized. They have only protected a tiny fragment of what 
has already been fragmented.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Want To Keep Wood Healthier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood is regaining his color and the  
weight he lost from recent bouts with illness. Now, Chicago Cubs 
manager Jim Riggleman wants to keep his prize pitcher's arm healthy 
all year, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggleman would like to limit the 21-year-old's innings this  
season to no more than 200. 
</P>
<P>
	During his NL rookie of the year season in 1998, Wood worked 166  
2-3 innings, going 13-6 with a 3.40 ERA. He struck 233, including a 
record-tying 20 against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	But elbow problems caused the Cubs to shut him down for the  
entire month of September. Wood returned to start Game 3 of the 
Division Series against Atlanta, pitching five innings in a 6-2 
loss to the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw a lot of pitches per game, and I'm sure he will  
continue to do that,'' Riggleman said Tuesday. ``He threw a pretty 
significant number of innings. The only thing I can say is that 
hopefully Kerry is healthy, and I'm probably not going to want him 
to exceed 200 innings this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs had three pitchers with 200-plus innings pitched last  
season: Kevin Tapani, Steve Trachsel and Mark Clark, who left for 
the Texas Rangers as a free agent. Terry Mulholland, another Cub 
starter, also has worked more than 200 innings in past seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Tapani and Trachsel and Mulholland, we have some history  
to know how far they can go and still come back the next spring and 
give us innings,'' the manager said. ``We're still learning a 
little bit with Kerry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood is tentatively scheduled to work in an exhibition game  
against San Diego next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, general manager Ed Lynch said he hopes to have Wood's  
contract extension completed by the end of the week. Wood is a 
second-year player not eligible for free agency or salary 
arbitration, but the team would like to sign him to a long-term 
deal.

<HEADLINE> Ford, Toyota, Honda Set Feb. Marks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford, Toyota and Honda set February U.S. sales  
records on booming demand for pickups, sport utility vehicles and 
minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	Every major automaker that reported sales figures Tuesday posted  
improved results compared with February 1998. In nearly each case, 
the biggest gains were in light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG each had an 8 percent  
improvement; Honda Motor Co. said its sales rose 14 percent on 
surging demand for its Odyssey minivan and SUVs; Toyota Motor Corp. 
was up 19 percent; even struggling Nissan Motor Corp. managed a 4 
percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ford, car sales fell 6 percent, a reflection of consumers'  
increasing attraction to larger, more versatile and safer trucks. 
But Ford's robust truck numbers were better than some analysts 
expected and helped it break the company's February sales mark set 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market's been roaring and nothing surprises me,'' said  
analyst Maryann Keller of ING Baring Furman Selz. ``The truck 
market this year is much stronger than I thought it would be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford set February records for sales of its F-series pickup -- the  
top-selling vehicle nationwide for 17 years -- and the compact 
Ranger pickup. F-series sales were up 27 percent over last year, 
while Ranger sales increased a surprising 46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``A strong economy, confident consumers and product innovation  
have proven to be a winning trifecta,'' said Bob Rewey, vice 
president of marketing and sales. ``We're heading into spring 
supported by strong employment, growing income, low interest rates 
and affordable products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ranger sales were helped by $1,000 rebates, while buyers of  
F-series trucks received discount financing incentives. Combined 
SUV sales also set a record for the month, led by the Explorer, up 
16 percent, and Expedition, up 14 percent, without significant 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shift away from cars is continuing, and it's occurring in  
all classes,'' Keller said. ``There's not much to say about their 
car performance -- it's dismal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mustang and Escort were the only Ford cars that posted gains  
last month, thanks in part to rebates; among Mercurys, only Grand 
Marquis, Mystique and Tracer posted modest gains. Sales of Ford's 
highest-volume car, the Taurus, were down 23 percent, despite $500 
rebates. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said its car sales were up nearly 9 percent,  
while truck sales rose 7 percent. Combined SUV sales at the 
German-American automaker were up 19 percent. The Jeep division set 
a February record. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Jameson, vice president of sales and marketing, said SUV  
demand remains strong despite increased competition. 
DaimlerChrysler's SUV sales were up 19 percent, led by the 
redesigned Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Durango. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're selling every one of those puppies we can build,''  
Jameson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's February sales total outpaced the record set in 1998 and  
was led by the automaker's best truck sales ever -- up 75 percent 
and beating its previous truck record set last August. The 
redesigned Odyssey minivan, made in Canada, had the biggest gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually we see things cool off in the first quarter, but there  
wasn't even a pause this year,'' said Dick Colliver, vice president 
of American Honda Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota posted double-digit gains in cars and trucks to break  
last year's February record. Strong sales of the Camry and Corolla 
helped boost car sales 16 percent, while big increases in demand 
for the Sienna minivan and Land Cruiser luxury SUV led to a 24 
percent gain in trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales at Nissan's luxury division, Infiniti, helped drive  
Nissan's total up. Nissan's truck sales improved nearly 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. was scheduled to release its figures  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among smaller automakers, new models helped Volkswagen AG post a  
79 percent sales gain for its best February in the United States in 
18 years. Audi AG's sales were up 28 percent, its best February 
performance since 1986. Volvo AB, whose sale to Ford is pending, 
said its U.S. car sales increased 15 percent. Subaru was up 12 
percent, while Land Rover posted a 27 percent gain.

<HEADLINE> GOP Speeds Work on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders decided Tuesday to try  
rushing a plan through Congress that would permit Social Security 
funds to be used only for shoring up the massive pension system or 
shrinking the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	By shipping the measure to President Clinton before turning to  
tax cuts and other priorities, Republicans hope to inoculate 
themselves from politically potent Democratic accusations that the 
GOP is plotting to divert needed Social Security funds for tax 
reductions for the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they say, this year's budget fight would be fought on  
friendlier terrain: What to do with the rest of the huge budget 
surpluses projected for the next several years. And they believe 
the measure would let them proceed to tax cuts and other items 
before reaching a deal with Clinton on overhauling Social Security, 
which many Republicans think may not be attainable this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closed-door meeting Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told House 
and Senate budget writers to settle differences over how the 
measure would work so it can be announced this week. They would 
like Congress to send the bill to Clinton in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is on Social Security,'' House Majority Leader Dick  
Armey, R-Texas, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the plan still left Republicans vulnerable to  
accusations that they would raid Medicare, the health-insurance 
program for the elderly, to pay for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a disguise to cover up their lack of interest, lack of  
attention to Medicare,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, 
top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats even held a news conference to say that by reserving  
no money for Medicare, Republicans were assuring tax increases or 
benefit cuts to brace the program for a fiscal crunch it faces in 
2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has insisted that 62 percent -- or $2.8 trillion -- of the  
expected $4.9 trillion in budget surpluses over the next 15 years 
be used to buttress Social Security. He wants Medicare to get 15 
percent more, or $686 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv called the president's plan  
``the most sensible one,'' but said the administration would 
examine other proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey said Republicans would not be damaged by Medicare  
accusations because there is ``no doubt'' Republicans will set 
aside at least $200 billion more over the next decade for Social 
Security than Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are $200 billion over where the president was, so he is  
hardly in a position to criticize us,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has repeatedly called for reserving Social Security  
funds for the impending retirement of baby boomers. Republicans say 
that even so, Clinton would actually use at least $146 billion in 
Social Security funds during the next five years alone for his 
spending priorities, violating his own pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it is hard to make Social Security funds  
untouchable for lawmakers because future Congresses can simply vote 
to use the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to GOP problems are internal divisions. Many Senate  
Republicans want to require 60 votes to use Social Security money 
for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	But many House Republicans favor a plan by Reps. Wally Herger,  
R-Calif., and David Minge, D-Minn. It would gradually make Social 
Security money untouchable over three years, leaving diminishing 
amounts of interest earned by the program's big trust funds 
available for tax cuts or spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action echoing the brewing budget fight:  
</P>
<P>
	--The House voted 416-1 for a nonbinding resolution by Rep. Paul  
Ryan, R-Wis., declaring that any Social Security fix would not 
raise taxes or cut benefits for current retirees and those near 
retirement. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, cast the lone no vote. 
</P>
<P>
	--House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
questioned whether Clinton and congressional Democrats really 
wanted compromise on Social Security because of its potency as a 
political issue. And without offering details, he said he would 
unveil his own proposal to save Social Security ``for all time'' in 
the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Scouts OK Domestic Violence Patch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEYSER, W.Va. (AP) -- A Girl Scout council covering parts of four  
states is offering a patch to girls who make efforts to learn about 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-inch turquoise circle has the words ``Stop Domestic  
Violence'' written in red. It was designed by Junior Troop 47 in 
Wiley Ford and won national approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The patch will be unveiled March 20 at the Shawnee Council's  
annual meeting. The council serves 15 counties in Pennsylvania, 
Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiley Ford Troop Leader Linda Bratcher, a member of the Mineral  
County Task Force on Domestic Violence, said an achievement badge 
for girls in fourth through sixth grades will help raise awareness 
of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	To earn the patch, a girl must find out where victims can go for  
help and be able to contrast a healthy relationship with an 
unhealthy one. They also must read a book or watch a movie about 
domestic violence; list alternatives to violence in resolving 
family disputes; and complete a service project to benefit a youth 
shelter or victims of domestic violence.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Japan Stocks Tumble / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today as fresh  
Japanese data underscored a weakening of the economy. Japanese 
stocks tumbled amid increased selling of cross shareholdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.08 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.96  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 
119.76 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 300.69 points or 2.11  
percent, closing at 13,921.06. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Nikkei's lowest closing level since Feb. 9, when it  
finished at 13,902.66, and the first time since Feb. 12 that it has 
closed below 14,000. On Monday, the index shed 145.79 points, or 
1.01 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said sentiment toward the  
greenback was bullish at the start of trading after the National 
Association of Purchasing Management said Monday that U.S. 
manufacturing activity rose in January for the first time in eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency also gained momentum against the yen after the  
Japanese government reported today that the nation's jobless rate 
remained at a record high 4.4 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said the number of people  
seeking work after being forced out of their jobs rose by 340,000 
in January from a year earlier to 1 million the highest number 
since the government started compiling the data in its current form 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 119.68 yen and 120.30 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.08 yen, down  
from 130.86 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei average dropped mainly on the  
active unwinding of cross shareholdings by Japanese companies ahead 
of the March book closing and hedge selling by investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's fiscal year ends March 31.  
</P>
<P>
	Share prices remained range bound for most of the session, but  
selling accelerated in the late afternoon after futures dropped 
below a key technical support line, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traders sold cash issues actively as they judged that the  
market was top heavy,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager at 
Chuo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The March futures contract fell after it failed to remain above  
14,200, Ishikawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies were selling shares they traditionally hold  
in other companies, as keeping those shares carries fewer business 
relationship and financial benefits than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 457  
million shares, up from Monday's 420 million shares. Decliners 
outnumbered advancers 825 to 315, with 155 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 15.73 points, or 1.42 percent, to 1,092.08. 
On Monday, the TOPIX lost 12.22 points, or 1.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.815 percent from Monday's finish of 1.840 percent, 
pushing the price up to 99.88 yen from 99.68 yen.

<HEADLINE> Government Calls Intel a Monopolist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Portending a bitter legal struggle, the  
government is outlining its pending antitrust case against Intel 
Corp., the world's largest manufacturer of computer processors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission portrayed Intel as a monopolist  
that bullied at least three other companies until they surrendered 
valuable secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Intel rejected the FTC's characterization, arguing  
that even the government's own expert economist cannot point to any 
rivals harmed by its behavior, which it called ``fundamentally 
fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's lawyers, in legal paperwork made public Monday, called  
the pending case before an administrative law judge ``an assault on 
fundamental antitrust principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Intel and the FTC outlined their legal strategies Monday  
for the company's upcoming hearing, which starts March 9 and is 
expected to last six to 10 weeks. Together with the government's 
antitrust case in nearby federal court against Microsoft Corp., the 
legal actions confront two of the most important companies in the 
nation's technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC alleges that Intel illegally withheld from three  
companies advanced technical information about its upcoming 
microprocessors to ``extort'' valuable technology that the 
companies developed independently. 
</P>
<P>
	It called the company's actions ``a raw exercise of monopoly  
power to muscle competitors into signing over intellectual property 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply competing on the merits was insufficient,'' FTC lawyers  
wrote. ``Intel's victims had no choice but to accede to its 
demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which now owns Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, with $26.2 billion in sales last year, makes processors  
for more than 80 percent of the world's computers and last week 
introduced its fastest chip ever, the Pentium III. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said ``any hope of meaningful challenge'' to Intel's  
dominance relies on other companies developing rival technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 71-page filing that quotes the government's own expert  
economist more than anyone else, Intel did not deny that it 
withheld technical data about upcoming products. 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel contended it was legal for the company to decide which  
secrets to disclose to its customers about its upcoming products. 
That information typically was contained within ``color books'' -- 
with red covers for the most sensitive and yellow covers for less 
important paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel lawyers accused the FTC of trying ``to prevent Intel from  
using its intellectual property to barter in value-for-value 
commercial exchanges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the government's antitrust case comes during a  
period of unprecedented competition facing Intel from rival 
chipmakers, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National 
Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, an industry report showed consumers bought more  
computers in January with AMD processors than Intel -- knocking 
Intel from the No. 1 spot for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any reader of personal computer ads today can readily see that  
Intel faces intense competition,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said the government's own economist, Harvard University  
professor Frederic M. Scherer, found no evidence that innovation in 
the computer industry has suffered. Scherer also is quoted as 
calling Intel's behavior ``unfair'' but agreeing that its actions 
haven't directly affected chip prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Scherer predicted that Intel's efforts on the industry  
will ``unravel over a period of 10 or so years, and it's just too 
early to assess those consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel called that ``not a basis for imposing antitrust  
liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company indicated previously its witnesses will include  
Andrew Grove, Intel's high-profile co-founder and chairman, and 
Craig Barrett, who took over as chief executive officer last year.

<HEADLINE> East Carolina Dumps Coach Dooley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- East Carolina bought out the final year  
of basketball coach Joe Dooley's contract on Tuesday, ending his 
tenure with the team after four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooley had a 57-52 record, with losing seasons the past two  
years. East Carolina finished seventh in the Colonial Athletic 
Association both seasons, when the team's conference mark was 
12-20. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates were 13-14 this season, 7-9 in the CAA.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud of the progress our program had made in the past  
four years and wish the Pirates success in the future,'' Dooley, 
33, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooley's base salary was slightly more than $80,000, said sports  
information director Norm Reilly, who added that he did not know 
the full value of Dooley's compensation package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they're writing him a check for $80,000. I'm not  
sure how that worked out,'' Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly referred further questions about Dooley's salary to  
athletic director Mike Hamrick, who was traveling to Raleigh for a 
booster club meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooley was primarily responsible for recruiting during his four  
years on the staff of Eddie Payne, his coaching predecessor. When 
Payne left for Oregon State after the 1994-95 season, Dooley was 
promoted to coach.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Get Look at Pitcher Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers got a close look  
at Kevin Brown on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown pitched two innings in a simulated game and showed off his  
stuff in front of pitching coach Charlie Hough. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with Los  
Angeles in the offseason, threw 16 pitches in the first inning, 
then tossed 23 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of getting started back up, getting cranked up  
again,'' Brown said. ``I survived, didn't get hit in the face or 
anything, so there's a moral victory there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the session, Brown gave up a couple of shots that  
most likely would have been hits in a game, to Jose Vizcaino, Gary 
Sheffield and Raul Mondesi. Then he ended the session by striking 
out Eric Karros. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you leave a guy out there this long this time of year  
he'll make a mistake or two,'' Hough said. ``They had a couple 
balls they hit pretty hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brown looked solid during his brief stint, an encouraging  
sign to Hough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pretty impressive, good routine. I needed to see his warmup  
routine, his between-innings routines,'' Hough said. ``He got way 
more than six outs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he was satisfied with his short stint in the  
simulated game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time of the spring, if you're not hurting, if you're  
feeling pretty good, you're right where you need to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers got another piece of good news when they learned  
closer Jeff Shaw will be in camp on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw missed the first couple weeks of spring training while  
waiting at home with his wife, Julie, in Ohio for the birth of the 
couple's third child. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Davey Johnson said the expected due date had been pushed  
back to the middle of March, and Shaw would join the club at 
Dodgertown on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite missing some time in camp, Johnson said he didn't have  
any concerns about the kind of shape Shaw would be in. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a professional,'' Johnson said. ``I'm not worried about  
it.''

<HEADLINE> New Home Sales Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New home sales slipped for the second  
consecutive month in January but nevertheless remained 
exceptionally strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans purchased new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual  
rate of 918,000, down 5 percent from 966,000 in December, the 
Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales rate nevertheless was the third highest on record.  
Sales topped 1 million in November, the most since the government 
began tracking them in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	With mortgage rates remaining under 7 percent and jobs  
plentiful, at least so far this year, most economists expect strong 
new home sales in 1999, just not quite as strong as the record 
887,000 for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Regionally, the Midwest posted the worst drop -- 25 percent, the  
most since September 1996, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
133,000. It was followed by the Northeast, down 7.2 percent to a 
rate of 77,000, and the South, down 3.7 percent to a rate of 
437,000. Sales rose 8 percent in the West to a rate of 271,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in sales means new homes are somewhat more available  
nationally, in proportion to the number of buyers. The inventory of 
unsold homes at the end of the month was 302,000, the most in two 
years. That's a four-months supply at the current sales rate, up 
from 3.8 months in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The median price of a new home -- meaning half sold for more and  
half for less -- was 157,000 in January, up 6.1 percent from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that  
Americans purchased existing homes at a record seasonally adjusted 
rate of 5.07 million in January.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Town Changes Name to Killington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHERBURNE, Vt. (AP) -- The company town will soon have the  
company's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Sherburne voted Tuesday to change their town's name  
to Killington, the name of the East Coast's premier ski resort and 
the area's largest employer. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, which must now be approved by the state Legislature,  
restores the name given when the town was chartered 230 years ago 
at the base of the mountain called Killington Peak. 
</P>
<P>
	The name was changed from Killington to Sherburne in 1800 in  
honor of Col. Benjamin Sherburne, a land grantee. 
</P>
<P>
	The colonel's influence was forgotten over the years. Meanwhile,  
the Killington ski area came into being in 1958 and grew to 
dominate the economy and geography of not only the town but the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Killington now employs 360 people year-round and as many as  
1,800 people in the winter months. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest ski area in Vermont, Killington also supports a  
large and varied cluster of restaurants, ski stores, real estate 
and other establishments. 
</P>
<P>
	All that makes Killington the more appropriate name, said Annie  
Hager, a science teacher at the Killington Mountain School. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're associated with the mountain more than with some old guy  
named Sherburne,'' Hager said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most residents agreed, voting 197-51 by secret ballot at their  
town meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Town Moderator Horace (Red) Glaze predicted that people would  
start confusing the ski resort's offices with the town offices, and 
the resort would have to field calls about dog licenses and tax 
bills. He voted against the name change. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it isn't broke, don't fix it,'' Glaze said. But he added he  
already tells people he lives in Killington if it's convenient. 
``I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.''

<HEADLINE> Black Farmers Want USDA Deal Tossed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black farmers urged a federal judge Tuesday to  
throw out a pending settlement with the Agriculture Department, 
saying the deal does little to correct years of race discrimination 
that left them financially strapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement is not only a disgrace to black farmers but is  
totally and completely inadequate to accommodate the losses the 
black farm community has suffered,'' Thomas Burrell, a farmer from 
Covington, Tenn., told U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman. ``We hope 
you will not allow such inadequate, incomplete and defective relief 
to become record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell was one of hundreds of farmers who packed Friedman's  
courtroom to protest the settlement reached in January between 
plaintiffs' attorneys and the agency. They want attorneys to 
negotiate for more changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers' objections placed them squarely opposite their own  
attorneys, who pleaded with the judge to approve the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It pains me to have to stand here and have to agree with the  
government,'' said plaintiffs attorney J.L. Chestnut. ``No single 
class action can address all of the civil wrongs by USDA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black farmers sued two years ago because they had been denied  
access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	That settlement would allow farmers with less documented  
evidence of discrimination to take a $50,000 payment and have their 
government debts forgiven. Farmers with more evidence could opt to 
go before an independent arbitrator and seek larger damages. 
Farmers could also choose to opt out of the lawsuit and pursue 
their own cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman gave preliminary approval to the deal in January but  
scheduled the hearing Tuesday to get farmers' reaction. He said he 
would issue a final ruling later. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned farmers, however, that the law doesn't allow him to  
modify the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody has to understand what I can do is approve  
settlement of the lawsuit or disapprove,'' Friedman said. ``There 
are limits to what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the same farmers rallied outside the courthouse pulling  
a mule and carrying signs that read, ``Keep the $50,000. Give us 
our land back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, the tone was the same as, one by one, farmers expressed  
their discontent to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to concerns about the lack of long-term structural  
changes to prevent racism, farmers were concerned about monetary 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, they said in many cases they were denied simple  
things like loan applications, or that local USDA officials 
destroyed documents so they have no paperwork. That leaves them 
with little choice but to pursue the $50,000 option that many 
rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cash payment of $50,000 is certainly not enough,'' said  
Vernon Breckinridge, a farmer from Oklahoma. ``It won't buy a 
medium-sized tractor, much less the equipment to go with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not asking that you make all of the plaintiffs rich,''  
Breckinridge said. ``We're just asking for a fair settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers also expressed concern that they would be ineligible for  
other USDA loans -- as written in current law -- if they accepted the 
forgiveness of debts provision in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Laura Trivers, a USDA spokeswoman, said the settlement asks  
that black farmers be given priority for loans.

<HEADLINE> HMO Debate Targets 'Necessary' Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The debate in Congress over HMOs is  
increasingly centered on what may be the heart of the matter: Who 
decides what care is really necessary? 
</P>
<P>
	It's a battle of insurance companies and big business against  
doctors and consumers. Insurers know they have an uphill fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rhetoric of the sacred doctor-patient relationship is one  
that's hard to argue against,'' said Chip Khan, president of the 
Health Insurance Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry contends that doctors are looking for a blank check  
to spend money on what may not even be the best treatment 
available. And Khan argues that people who want more health care 
should demand it, and pay for it, when negotiating contracts with 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors argue a more simple case: Patients will be denied care  
they need by cost-conscious HMOs without a legal guarantee. The 
American Medical Association points to health insurance contracts 
that specifically give the HMO ``sole discretion'' to determine 
whether care is medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress considered but could not agree on HMO legislation last  
year. Chances are better this year, with a slew of bills introduced 
by both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the most contentious issue has been whether to give  
patients new rights to sue their health plans when the plans deny 
coverage. Insurers and business groups said Tuesday they are 
equally committed to defeating so-called medical necessity 
provisions that require plans to cover treatments if they are 
consistent with ``generally accepted principles'' or ``prevailing 
standards'' of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this arose in the days before managed care dominance,  
when insurance companies generally paid for whatever doctors 
ordered. Now health maintenance organizations and other managed 
care plans attempt to control costs by, among other things, denying 
what they deem unneeded care. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say the plans are turning down care that is, in fact,  
medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``This standard is increasingly challenged by health plans that  
determine medical necessity primarily in terms of financial 
considerations,'' Dr. Richard F. Corlin of the AMA told a Senate 
committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents respond that doctors and their Democratic allies are  
simply trying to restore a system where doctors ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the frustration is coming from the American Medical  
Association and frustration that HMOs can overrule their (doctors') 
positions,'' said Larry Atkins of the Corporate Health Care 
Coalition, a group of large businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	At separate briefings Tuesday, groups representing insurance  
companies and businesses argued that just because particular 
treatments are generally accepted doesn't mean they are best. 
</P>
<P>
	In certain communities, for instance, it may be generally  
accepted practice to treat certain breast cancer patients with 
radical mastectomy, even if national experts recommend lumpectomy 
and radiation instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Healthcare Leadership Council, a group of  
executives from hospitals, drug companies and other industry 
groups, point to evidence that many doctors do not follow 
procedures scientifically determined to be best. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's a dispute between a doctor and a health plan, the  
group said, patients should be able to appeal to a panel of experts 
outside the company. In fact, the council said it could support 
legislation that would require health plans to allow their patients 
binding, independent appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Insurance Association of America, which represents  
insurance companies, took a slightly different tack. People and 
their employers should insist on appeal rights as they choose 
health plans, if that's important to them, Khan said.

	``Consumers can walk with their dollars,'' he said. ``They're  
paying the premiums.''

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks' Day on the Diamond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Here's how it went for Garth Brooks on  
Tuesday at spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks played in the Padres' intrasquad game,  
taking over in left field in the top of the seventh and striking 
out in his only at-bat. He cleanly handled the one ball hit to him, 
a single. 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOW NOTE:* With a runner on first and one out, Brooks had a  
decent at-bat against non-roster righty Salvador Rodriguez, fouling 
off two pitches before chasing a neck-high fastball for strike 
three. He also had to be reminded by manager Bruce Bochy to 
remember to put on his batting helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``It was cool. I guess four out of the five  
pitches I was proud of. The last one I wasn't. That's the one I'll 
remember. I was there. That's why I was apologizing to my 
teammates. I was there. The guy on first has to be moved over and 
it was my job to do it.'' -- Brooks.

<HEADLINE> 5 Foreign Tourists Killed in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Ugandan army troops trying to rescue up  
to 15 kidnapped foreign tourists traded gunfire today with the 
Rwandan rebels holding them. Five tourists were killed in the 
crossfire and seven rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescue operation was carried out this morning in a rain  
forest in southwestern Uganda, where the rebels -- armed with 
semi-automatic weapons -- had held the foreigners since late Sunday, 
police spokesman Eric Naigambi told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Americans, six Britons, three New Zealanders, an  
Australian and a Swiss woman were confirmed to have been among 
those kidnapped late Sunday, government officials said. Canada said 
one of its citizens also had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports put the number of abducted at 14, but a U.S.  
official said three tourists were still being held, which would 
raise the total number of people seized to 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Names and nationalities of the killed and rescued tourists were  
not immediately available today. The bodies were taken to Kambuga 
Hospital in Rukungiri, a district in western Uganda, Naigambi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Embassy spokesman James Okanya said the U.S. government sent an  
aircraft today to pick up the surviving hostages and bring back the 
five bodies to Entebbe Airport outside the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair, in Milan, Italy, for a  
conference of Socialist leaders, called the affair ``a tragic 
incident'' today and said his government was frantically trying to 
determine what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists were abducted at campgrounds on the edge of Bwindi  
National Park, known as the Impenetrable Forest, the starting point 
for visitors hoping to glimpse the 320 rare mountain gorillas that 
remain along the border mountain's slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy in Kampala said it was told that six, not  
seven, of the western hostages had been released and that five 
bodies had been recovered. ``Three people are still being held,'' 
said Sara Stryker, assistant political affairs officer. 
</P>
<P>
	She said officials were still trying to establish the tourists'  
identities and notify their next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ugandan government imposed a news blackout on the situation  
today, and Defense Minister Stephen Kavuma said the government 
would read a statement to Parliament later in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	British and American diplomats headed today to the campground  
where the tourists were taken. U.S. Embassy press attache Virgil 
Bodeen said the envoys would talk to investigators, but would not 
say if they planned to attempt a meeting with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congo-based rebels attacked the campsite on the northern  
edge of the park late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Unconfirmed reports from private tour operators Monday said one  
tourist and two Ugandans were killed in the initial attack, one of 
them an employee of the state-owned Uganda Wildlife Authority. 
Details on that slain tourist were not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who escaped was Elizabeth Garland, 29, an  
anthropology student at the University of Chicago. She told her 
father, James Garland, by telephone Monday that the rebels had 
singled out American and British nationals as hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting between the Rwandan Hutu rebels and the Uganda People's  
Defense Forces continued Monday along the forested border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hutu rebels fled Rwanda after they took part in a 1994  
genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically 
moderate Hutus. They are angry at Uganda, a former British colony, 
for supporting the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels have been crossing the border from bases in eastern  
Congo, often ambushing vehicles and kidnapping or killing the 
passengers in both Uganda and Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, the rebels kidnapped four foreign tourists and seven  
Congolese guides and porters on a trek to observe the gorillas. 
They later released a Canadian tourist and all the Congolese 
escorts. 
</P>
<P>
	The three other tourists -- two Swedes and one New Zealander --  
have not been heard from since.

<HEADLINE> Senate Studies Y2K Computer Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate dedicated Tuesday to the Year 2000  
computer problem, looking at threats ranging from small-business 
bankruptcies to Russian missile malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forecasting Y2K is a lot like predicting weather,'' Sen.  
Christopher Dodd said: ``You can only track the storm and watch the 
effects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd, D-Conn., and Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, who head a special  
Senate panel on the ``Y2K'' problem, issued a 160-page report 
outlining serious potential problems in health care, energy supply 
and government services if action isn't taken to change computers 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	They also emphasized that, for most Americans, disruptions in  
vital services will be minimal. People can expect, Bennett said, 
``a bump in the road, but it will not be crippling, and it will not 
last for an undue length of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to allay fears of widespread social and economic chaos,  
Dodd said people should have canned goods and water on hand Dec. 31 
as a normal procedure, but there is no need to stockpile food. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, by 99-0, passed a bill establishing a Small Business  
Administration program to provide loan guarantees to small 
companies trying to repair computers or affected by interruptions 
in supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Federation of Independent Business said more than  
half the nation's small firms that use computers have yet to act to 
make their systems immune to the Y2K bug. ``The majority of small 
businesses are not ready, and they are not even preparing,'' Sen. 
John Kerry, D-Mass., said. ``It may come down to a choice between 
debt or dissolution or rolling the dice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, S.314, still needs House consideration.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bennett-Dodd report concurred that small businesses and  
local governments that lack the money or expertise to repair their 
systems faced the biggest risks. 
</P>
<P>
	It said 64 percent of hospitals, mostly smaller units, haven't  
tested their Y2K repairs, and more than 80 percent of doctors' 
offices aren't prepared. The effects could be temporary loss of 
medical records, or, more serious, breakdowns in computerized 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Biomedical devices, the report said, are the ``Trojan horses in  
the health-care industry's compliance.'' Malfunctions in blood gas 
analyzers, for example, could shut down operating rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	While the pharmaceutical industry is generally well prepared, 80  
percent of ingredients used in drugs comes from abroad, many from 
countries that could face serious Y2K disruptions, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said telecommunications and power systems are in  
relatively good shape, but there's real reason to worry about oil 
imports from such major suppliers as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and 
Nigeria. All are 12 to 18 months behind the United States in 
addressing Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and Dodd also held a secret session for senators to  
discuss national security and international issues rising from 
disruptions that could occur when computers misread the year 2000 
as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett saw little chance of an accidental nuclear weapons  
launch but ``medium probability of economic disruptions that will 
lead to civil unrest in certain sectors of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, he said, has serious problems and ``deterioration of  
their military capabilities because of Y2K simply adds to their 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Y2K events:  
</P>
<P>
	--Representatives of the food industry discounted at a hearing  
chaired by Bennett and Dodd the possibility of interruptions in 
food supplies. C. Manly Molpus, president of the Grocery 
Manufacturers of America, cited a report that concluded ``consumer 
behavior, fueled by misconceptions, could actually present the 
greatest threat'' through ``needless and frivolous stockpiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Pentagon's assistant inspector general, Robert Lieberman,  
told a House hearing that the Defense Department got off to a slow 
start in dealing with Y2K because managers underestimated the 
problem's complexity. More than 600 mission-critical systems remain 
unready, although the Pentagon has given assurances it will be 
prepared in time. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Securities and Exchange Commission voted to seek public  
comment on a plan to shut down brokerage firms and stock-transfer 
agents by mid-October if their computer systems aren't ready for 
the date change.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Completes Telecom Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- After nearly two years of  
negotiations and a sometimes-violent labor strike, Puerto Rico on 
Tuesday completed the $2 billion sale of its telephone company to a 
consortium led by GTE Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Pedro Rossello called the sale of Puerto Rico Telephone Co.  
``a significant step'' in his ambitious privatization agenda, which 
includes sales of hotels and private management of state utilities 
and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission approved the deal on Feb.  
12. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, about 6,400 workers went on strike to protest the sale,  
fearing widespread layoffs. Weeks of protests, service outages, an 
airport blockade and sabotage of phone lines failed to derail the 
deal, although tens of thousands of customers temporarily lost 
telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE, of Irving, Texas, pledged there would be no layoffs for at  
least a year after it assumed control. GTE serves about 21 million 
local phone customers in the United States and has agreed to be 
acquired by Bell Atlantic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Public sector workers comprise a quarter of Puerto Rico's 1.2  
million-strong work force but have lost ground under the Rossello 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The GTE consortium is acquiring a controlling stake in PRTC. To  
appease labor interests, Rossello said that 4 percent of the stock 
would be distributed to company workers. The government retains 46 
percent of stock which it has said also could be put up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex deal also provides millions of dollars to finance  
improvements to Puerto Rico's water system and to fund a public 
pension. 
</P>
<P>
	PRTC provides local and long distance phone service and Internet  
access to business and residential customers. It has 1.3 million 
phone lines, more than 155,000 cellular customers and more than 
237,000 paging customers. 
</P>
<P>
	PRTC had a monopoly in this U.S. commonwealth of 3.8 million  
people until 1996, when the law changed. Now, it faces competition 
from private firms and has been forced to cut rates.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Religious Group Balks at Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A Florida religious organization was  
ordered to pay $6.4 million in fines after it sidestepped a court's 
ruling to stop promoting its ``Double Your Blessings'' investment 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	But an attorney for pastor Gerald Payne of Greater Ministries  
International Church, based in Tampa, Fla., said Payne will not pay 
because that would violate God's law. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said in a statement last week that to cooperate with Judge  
Eunice Ross' order would be to place the state above God, thus 
violating the biblical admonition to render unto God what is God's. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney repeated the argument Monday, citing several  
scriptural passages. ``If he were to pay the fine, he would be 
stealing from God,'' Albert Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Mark Stewart said Payne and associates  
ran what they called the ``Double Your Blessings'' program in which 
investors put up amounts ranging from $250 to $5,000 on the promise 
that they would double their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater Ministries allegedly told participants that the church  
was investing their money in gold and diamond mines and other 
extensive holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office and the Pennsylvania  
Securities Commission say the organization is in effect operating 
as an unregistered securities dealership and want to open the 
ministry's books. 
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment doesn't give any person or any religious  
organization a license to violate the law,'' said Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Ross ordered the ministry to stop soliciting money  
for the program in Pennsylvania. Instead, the organization changed 
the name of the program to the ``Faith Promise Plan'' and continued 
to solicit investors, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the ministry promoted the new program in mass  
mailings, on a central Pennsylvania television station, on a World 
Wide Web site and at prayer meetings of as many as 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine levied Monday was for each instance the ministry  
violated the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in California, Ohio and Florida also have taken  
action against Greater Ministries or associates in other matters, 
but the Pennsylvania case is the first civil court proceeding 
against the organization, said Luci McClure, an attorney with the 
Pennsylvania Securities Commission.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Authorities have arrested two police  
captains for possible negligence in the slaying of a Marxist 
Congressman, a judge said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaime Hurtado, a vocal opponent of President Jamil Mahuad's  
centrist government, and two assistants were shot to death near 
Congress by three men waiting in ambush. 
</P>
<P>
	A police informant arrested in connection with the murder said  
he had warned Capt. Edison Gallardo and Capt. Byron Viteri of the 
planned murder, but that they did nothing, Judge Angela Sarmiento 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallardo and Viteri say they were told that a team of Colombian  
hitmen had arrived in Ecuador, but not that they planned to kill 
Hurtado, Sarmiento said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the informant told police that Hurtado, 62, was  
murdered by a hit squad sent by right-wing paramilitary leaders in 
neighboring Colombia, who thought Hurtado was aiding leftist 
Colombian guerrillas.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Eight Cubans who were rescued from  
a 10-foot wooden boat off the Bahamas were returned to Cuba on 
Tuesday by the U.S. Coast Guard.

	The Coast Guard rescued the Cubans on Friday south of Cay Sal  
Banks, off the Strait of Florida. All were interviewed by U.S. 
immigration agents before being returned to Cuba, the Coast Guard 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Coast Guard rescued five Cubans from a sinking  
boat five miles west of the Bahamas. They were transferred to 
Bahamian authorities later Tuesday.

	MENDOZA, Argentina (AP) -- A mountain patrol in the snowcapped  
Andes has retrieved the frozen remains of a climber who died 19 
years ago on towering Aconcagua peak, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The police used mules to carry down the body of Norbert Rainer  
Bruckmayer, who perished after a fall in January 1980 near the 
summit of the 22,955-foot mountain, the highest in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruckmayer was part of an eight-member Swiss expedition  
attempting to scale the peak when he fell. 
</P>
<P>
	A six-member police team trained in high-mountain rescue found  
the body at about 18,600 feet, said Enrique Taranto, a government 
spokesman in the nearby city of Mendoza, 640 miles west of Buenos 
Aires. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, thousands of people attempt to scale Aconcagua, part

that were brought up,'' Mexican Labor Secretary Jose Antonio 
Gonzalez said during a joint public appearance with Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	On the last day of her visit, Herman attended a conference that  
addressed the problems working women face in Mexico and met 
privately with President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman's visit to Mexico comes almost a year after she met with  
Mexican officials to discuss job discrimination complaints related 
to a common practice in Mexico of requiring women to undergo 
pregnancy testing in order to get a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Pregnant women are often refused employment. Such discrimination  
is particularly common in the primarily U.S.-owned assembly plants

consumed tens of thousands of acres in scattered areas across park 
and private lands near the mountainous border with Chile. 
</P>

	Newspapers reported that the rainfall allowed firefighters to  
edge closer to the fires in such parks as Nahuel Huapi, close to 
Bariloche, 870 miles southwest of Buenos Aires.

<HEADLINE> Defense Rests in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Defense attorneys have rested their  
case after four days of testimony designed to show that a Marine 
pilot flew his best before his jet severed a ski gondola cable in 
Italy, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments were possible late today.  
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged  
with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count each of 
destroying private property, destroying government property, 
dereliction of duty and improper flight planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was at the controls of the EA-6B Prowler when it hit the  
cable of the Mount Cermis ski gondola on Feb. 3, 1998, near 
Cavalese, Italy. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 206 years if 
convicted of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the last defense witness narrated a computer  
simulation of the flight. Gan Wang of Cambridge Research Associates 
said the government's three sources of data used to plot the flight 
didn't show the same path. Two tracks actually showed the 
radar-jamming jet flying through a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who presented 11 days of testimony, have questioned  
several witnesses about whether Ashby violated flight rules by not 
using a ``hot mike,'' a voice-operated system that allows the pilot 
to talk to his crew without pressing the mike button. 
</P>
<P>
	But air crash investigator Jeff Edwards testified Monday that  
the hot mike wasn't reliable and that the pilot could turn it off 
and easily press the mike button. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said his review of tests showed the jet's radar  
altimeter wasn't functioning. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a member of the Marine investigation board  
testified that Ashby's superiors didn't provide all the navigation 
information he needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct of the flight with what was available to the air  
crew was very reasonable,'' said Col. Thomas Blickensderfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ashby was reckless and violated the mission's  
517-mph speed limit and 2,000-foot altitude restriction. His jet 
cut the cable about 370 feet above the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said he thought the altitude restriction was 1,000 feet  
and claims he was unaware of a speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys also contend that Ashby's map didn't have the  
gondola marked on it, his radar altitude gauge malfunctioned and 
that he suffered from an optical illusion that made him think he 
was flying higher than he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, faces similar  
charges and a separate court-martial.

<HEADLINE> Logging Deal for Timber Co., Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- In a dramatic 11th-hour deal, Pacific  
Lumber Co. and the government ended years of negotiations by 
agreeing to a $480 million plan to set aside an ancient California 
redwood grove for the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, California and Pacific Lumber reached the  
agreement moments before Monday's midnight deadline, drawing praise 
from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``These redwoods are a natural treasure, as much a part of our  
legacy as the world's great libraries and cathedrals,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement preserves some 10,000 acres of forest -- about half  
of which is covered with old-growth redwoods -- in the coastal hills 
near Fortuna about 250 miles north of San Francisco. As a condition 
of the sale, Pacific Lumber agreed to a number of stringent 
environmental rules on the rest of its 211,000 acres in rugged 
Humboldt County. 
</P>
<P>
	About $250 million comes from the federal government and $130  
million from the state, plus an additional $100 million in state 
money next year. The deal had to be reached Monday to secure the 
federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	The intense negotiations involved Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt, state resources officials and company executives and 
lawyers via telephone across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Lumber had rejected the proposed deal Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear why the company shifted ground  
Monday since state and federal officials said the provisions of the 
agreement had not changed -- including the environmental rules the 
company initially denounced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a grueling experience, but the results are  
acceptable,'' Pacific Lumber President John Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rules limit how close the company can log near streams, how it  
builds logging roads and paths, and requires protections for 
threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules would be locked in for at least 50 years and remain in  
effect even if the company sells the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Lumber and its parent, Maxxam Corp., have been the  
object of lengthy court fights and demonstrations, including the 
nation's largest forest rally, a 1996 environmental protest at 
which more than 1,000 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists remained skeptical. Earth First! spokesman  
Darryl Cherney wondered if government officials had given in to 
timber company demands. If so, he said, ``it's going to be a very 
sad day for the forests.''

<HEADLINE> Man Hijacks Air France Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- An Air France plane carrying 75 passengers was  
forced to detour over Paris today after a man on board threatened 
to blow it up, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most passengers were released, but Interior Minister officials  
said 11 people -- six passengers and five crew members -- were held 
on the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they were negotiating with the hijacker, who they  
said claimed to have an explosive device. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline said the man was demanding to hold a news  
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, an Airbus A-320 coming from Marseille in southern  
France, had been due to land at Orly airport south of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hijacker insisted it head to Roissy-Charles de Gaulle  
airport, north of Paris, where the jet landed safely. 
</P>
<P>
	The hijacker was not identified, but was speaking Italian.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him at the front of the plane,'' one of the released  
passengers, Jean-Yves Lehuede, told television channel TF1. ``He 
was arguing with the flight attendants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehuede said the hijacker insisted that the passengers on the  
first row of the plane stay on board.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes-Benzn Hires Omnicom Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz of North America, moving quickly  
after firing its ad agency three weeks ago, has hired Omnicom 
Group's Diversified Agency Services to handle all its marketing 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Omnicom agency Merkley Newman Harty will take  
the lead in creating ads for the luxury car imports from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The car importer, based in Montvale, N.J., declined to say how  
much it spends on advertising a year but published estimates value 
the account at $100 million to $125 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz dismissed its agency of more than five years, Lowe  
&AMP; Partners/SMS, and two affiliates last month even though its sales 
had soared 39 percent to a company record of 170,245 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company cited ``a substantial void within the agency's upper  
management team'' and worries about a potential conflict of 
interest since Lowe's sister agencies under parent Interpublic 
Group of Companies work for rival General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz is part of DaimlerChrysler, created late last year  
with Daimler-Benz AG's purchase of Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Eberhardt, vice president of marketing for Mercedes-Benz of  
North America, said Tuesday he had talked with officials at Omnicom 
and True North Communications, two huge ad holding companies who 
work for Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Omnicom's Diversified Services Agency was selected in  
part because Mercedes officials like its management philosophy of 
letting their agencies operate as independent business units. 
</P>
<P>
	He said another reason was that several Diversified Services  
Agencies specialist shops were already working for Mercedes-Benz on 
graphic design, database management and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Those shops, The Designory, Rapp Collins and Alcone Marketing  
Group, are getting expanded responsibility for Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
	Merkley Newman, created almost six years ago, will be the lead  
agency in creating ads for Mercedes in the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Its clients include the regional phone company BellSouth Corp.  
and the candy maker Mars Inc. It has no automotive advertising 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eberhardt said he was impressed with how the agency  
presented itself to the car company and its creative talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz plans to use ads from Lowe &AMP; Partners through the  
first half of this year, and Eberhardt said he expects to start 
running new work in the summer.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Helps Korean War Vets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Growing up in Philadelphia in the 1960s, Susan  
Burgess sometimes found herself in the attic with a family 
scrapbook and a child's curiosity. She wondered at the newspaper 
clippings about her Uncle Donald, an Air Force pilot who died in a 
prisoner-of-war camp in North Korea on a summer morning in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	The family never learned the full story of Donald S. Sirman's  
death, never fully came to grips with the loss. The only remnant of 
him sent home was a small pocket Bible with Sirman's name on the 
front cover. ``He was the golden boy of the family,'' Ms. Burgess 
says, but she knew precious little about him. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last fall she discovered an Internet site called the Korean  
War Project. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Korean War Project put me in touch with people who helped  
me learn more about my Uncle Donald in a week than I knew in my 
entire lifetime,'' Ms. Burgess, 40, wrote in an e-mail response to 
an informal Associated Press survey of users of the Internet site, 
which gets about 1 million visitors a month. She described these 
revelations -- including conversations with men who knew her uncle 
and remembered the Bible he had shared with fellow prisoners at 
great risk to himself -- as ``one of the most remarkable events of 
my life.'' She also learned of the merciless marches to POW camps 
her uncle and other captives endured and details of his murder by a 
prison guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burgess and a growing number of war veterans and their  
relatives are turning to the Internet as a way of rediscovering -- 
and in some cases realizing for the first time -- the meaning of the 
sacrifices made in combat, whether on the battlefields of Europe, 
Korea or Vietnam or in other lesser-known conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 33,000 American troops were killed in the three-year  
Korean War, which ended in 1953. Many fell in what is still 
communist North Korea, and about 8,000 men remain missing. The 
Korean War Project has created a human link to that traumatic, 
little understood period of Cold War history. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burgess and untold numbers of other devotees of the Korean  
War Project are worried, however, that it may be forced offline for 
lack of financial support. The site's founders and sole operators, 
brothers Hal and Ted Barker of Dallas, say that after four years of 
sinking their own money into the Korean War Project, their 
self-described cyberspace obsession is on the brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to go back to making a living,'' Hal Barker, 51,  
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barker brothers' father, Edward L. Barker, of Crockett,  
Texas, was a Marine Corps helicopter pilot and Korean War hero. He 
was awarded a Silver Star for his role in a failed attempt to 
rescue a downed American airman in October 1951 on Heartbreak 
Ridge. The Korean War Project is dedicated to the memory of that 
lost airman, Marine Corps 2nd Lt. Arthur Donald DeLacy, of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barkers have built an Internet resource that is a forum for  
communication among people interested in the war, but it also 
offers reference materials such as a database of men listed as 
killed in action and missing in action, and it is helping to fill 
gaps in official information about missing POWs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean War Project also has given veterans and their loved  
ones a renewed pride, a sense of value in the painful memories from 
their long-forgotten war, a conflict that took a terrible toll on 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
	George F. Drake, of Bellingham, Wash., says the Korean War  
Project is a labor of love for the Barker brothers and a virtual 
outlet for the long-buried emotions of veterans traumatized by the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their labor is of significance to veterans such as I who use  
the project to `go back' to Korea via their Web page and come out 
of it again a bit healthier for having had this contact with 
memories good or bad,'' wrote Drake, who served in a radio 
intelligence unit in Korea during the war's final two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Curran, of Diamond Bar, Calif., was 3 years old when her  
father, Navy Lt. Charles Garrison, was shot down over North Korea 
in May 1951 and never heard from again. She used the Korean War 
Project to find the person who last saw ``Snapper'' Garrison alive 
in a prisoner-of-war camp. She has collected enough other 
information to hold out hope that his remains might be unearthed 
and returned home. 
</P>
<P>
	For Gail Morris, of San Anselmo, Calif., the Korean War Project  
brought a moment of exhilaration when she received an e-mail 
message from a Scottsdale, Ariz., man who had flown fighter 
missions with her father, Air Force Maj. Thomas Ellis Myers, and 
remembered poignant moments they had shared. 
</P>
<P>
	He told her, for example, of being with Myers when he received  
the announcement of Ms. Morris's birth. Five months later he was 
shot down in his F-80, captured and imprisoned. He never made it 
home and never saw his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how happy I am'' to have learned details for  
the first time of his wartime experiences, she said in an 
interview. ``I had always had this cloud hanging over me, never 
knowing.''

<HEADLINE>  Orlando Cepeda Makes Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Orlando Cepeda, the Baby Bull who earned his  
reputation with a big bat, and three others were elected to the 
Hall of Fame today by the Veterans Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Former umpire Nestor Chylak, turn-of-the-century manager Frank  
Selee and Negro Leagues pitcher Smokey Joe Williams also were 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member Veterans panel, which included former Cepeda  
teammate Juan Marichal, Ted Williams and Stan Musial, passed over 
Bill Mazeroski, Dom DiMaggio, former manager Dick Williams and 
umpire Doug Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates needed 75 percent -- nine votes -- for election. Voting  
totals were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a rookie on the Veterans Committee, I'm glad he got in on  
my first year,'' Marichal said of Cepeda. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the type of player who had no fear, the type of player  
you wanted playing behind you,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies will be held July 25 at Cooperstown, N.Y.  
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were elected in January by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda was the NL's rookie of the year in 1958 with San  
Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. The first baseman hit .297 with 379 home runs and 1,365 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also called ``Cha-Cha,'' Cepeda played in nine All-Star games  
and often batted cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda played on great Giants teams with Willie Mays, Willie  
McCovey and Marichal, all of them Hall of Famers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election  
five years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last 
year in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Cepeda was arrested at an airport on charges of trying  
to pick up 160 pounds of marijuana. He was sentenced to five years 
and served 10 months -- widely believed to have worked against him 
in previous bids for the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope this time I make it,'' Cepeda, a community  
relations representative for the Giants, said a few days before the 
voting. ``It would be the highest thing. It's hard to describe how 
much it would mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda's father, Pedro, was called ``The Bull'' and also the  
``Babe Ruth of Puerto Rico.'' Cepeda joins Roberto Clemente as the 
only Hall of Famers born in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, the eighth umpire elected to the Hall, worked in the  
American League from 1954-78 and called five World Series and six 
All-Star games. He died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee managed from 1890 to 1905 in the National League with  
Boston and Chicago, and had a winning percentage of .598. He died 
in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee became the 15th manager elected to the Hall.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams, also nicknamed ``Cyclone,'' pitched from 1910-32 with  
several teams, including the Homestead Grays and New York Lincoln 
Giants. He was credited with a winning percentage of .624. He died 
in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was the 16th player elected for his accomplishments in  
the Negro Leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans panel was down to 12 from its usual 15 because of  
the retirement of longtime executive Buzzie Bavasi and the health 
of writer Leonard Koppett and Hall of Fame shortstop Pee Wee Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vets could elect one person from each of four categories:  
former major leaguers, Negro Leaguers, 19th century players and 
personnel, plus a composite of managers, umpires, executives and 
Negro leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the final year of a five-year plan to add a  
supplemental vote for two of the categories -- Negro Leaguers and 
19th century players and personnel.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Town Changes Name to Killington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHERBURNE, Vt. (AP) -- For years, many folks just assumed the  
Killington ski resort was in Killington. They would have been right 
when the town was chartered 230 years ago, and they will soon be 
right again. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents voted 197 to 51 Tuesday to drop the name Sherburne for  
Killington, the name the town was given in the first place -- and 
which most people call it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The change now goes to the state Legislature for approval.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're associated with the mountain more than with some old guy  
named Sherburne,'' said Annie Hager, a science teacher at the 
Killington Mountain School. 
</P>
<P>
	That ``old guy'' is Col. Benjamin Sherburne, a land grantee for  
whom the town was renamed in 1800. The colonel's influence was 
forgotten over the years while the Killington ski area grew to 
dominate the economy of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Killington employs 360 people year-round and as many as 1,800  
people in winter months. The largest ski area in Vermont, 
Killington also supports a varied cluster of restaurants, ski 
stores, real estate and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to change Sherburne's name started when the AAA  
automobile club said it would stop listing local businesses under a 
Killington address in their tour guides. Business owners said that 
would add to the confusion of tourists who already think the town 
is called Killington but can't find it on maps. 
</P>
<P>
	Out-of-towners also mixed up Sherburne with Shelburne, a town  
100 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killington is our town; we really don't have any other  
business here besides the mountain,'' said Town Clerk Judy Hansen. 
``We are a company town, no question about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Town Moderator Horace Glaze predicted that people would start  
confusing the ski resort with the town offices, and the resort 
would have to field calls about dog licenses and tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it isn't broke, don't fix it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Glaze acknowledged he sometimes tells people he lives in  
Killington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to lose any sleep over it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Chemistry of Change' Opens in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Smokey is the wisest, most moral and most  
intriguing character in ``The Chemistry of Change.'' Why, he might 
even be the devil incarnate. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlane Meyer's audience-friendly tale of quirky characters  
arriving at happy endings is off-Broadway at Theater Four, which 
the Women's Project and Productions has bought for its 20th season 
of presenting plays written and directed by women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chemistry of Change'' is no feminist manifesto. It's about  
the power of love, briskly paced for the most part, and 
exceptionally well acted under the direction of Lisa Peterson, 
resident director at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin Glynn has all the funny lines in the first act as Lee, a  
woman determinedly wrongheaded about her family and herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee is living in California in the 1950s with her sister and her  
four children, three adult and one teenage, whom she supports by 
marrying and divorcing a succession of well-to-do men. But 
something new and unimaginable is about to happen to her -- she will 
fall in love. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chemistry of Change'' opens with Lee dressed for her 10th  
wedding, to a junkyard owner. Waiting near City Hall for her 
fiance, she meets Smokey, dressed like the devil, outside his scary 
carnival ride. Two days later she brings home her new husband. It's 
Smokey, not the junkyard man. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Pine plays Smokey low-key, strong and sexy. He's enigmatic  
and reticent about his past. The audience is teased; he knows more 
about this family than can be logically explained. Maybe he really 
is the devil. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's sons, played by Christopher Innvar, Barry Del Sherman and  
Hamish Linklater, aren't happy. They have been content to lead idle 
lives, financed by their mother's multiple marriages. Smokey 
threatens to disrupt the idyll and they try to drive him away. But 
Smokey unobtrusively takes charge. One by one, through Smokey's 
connections, the sons and Lee's sister (Brenda Wehle) find jobs, 
while Lee's daughter Corlis (Jodi Thelen) gets money for nurses' 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	As the play ends with Frank Sinatra singing ``That Old Devil  
Moon,'' Lee's chance encounter outside City Hall turns out to have 
produced a marriage made in heaven, with happy consequences for all 
concerned.

<HEADLINE>  Hamilton, James Are Beast of East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Connecticut swingman Richard Hamilton, the Big  
East player of the year last season, was selected Tuesday to share 
the award this season with Miami forward Tim James. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's Leonard Hamilton was chosen coach of the year and Notre  
Dame's Troy Murphy was selected rookie of the year in a voting of 
the league's coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	It was third time in the league's 20-year history that player of  
the year honors were shared. Chris Mullin of St. John's and Patrick 
Ewing of Georgetown did it as juniors and seniors in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, a 6-foot-6 junior, joins those two as the only players  
to win the award more than once. Mullin also won it as a sophomore 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton led the Huskies to the conference regular-season title  
and was the league's scoring leader in conference games this season 
at 22.1 points. His 1,020 points are the most any player has had 
after three years in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	James, a 6-7 senior, averaged 18.9 points and 8.3 rebounds for  
the second-place Hurricanes and this season became just the seventh 
player in league history to have 1,000 points and 500 rebounds in 
conference play. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-9 Murphy led the conference in rebounding at 10.3 -- the  
first freshman to ever do that -- and field goal percentage at .534. 
He averaged 18.9 points, which was fourth best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Hamilton, who was coach of the year in 1995, led the  
Hurricanes to a 21-5 overall mark and 15-3 in the league, easily 
the best marks since they joined the Big East in 1991. Miami was 
8-1 on the road in the conference this season, a record even more 
remarkable since the school had a total of 11 league road wins in 
its history before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse junior center Etan Thomas was chosen the league's  
defensive player of the year. Thomas, who was named the league's 
most improved player last season, averaged four blocked shots per 
game and his total of 167 has him in fifth place on the career 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami junior Johnny Hemsley, a first-team all-league choice this  
season, was selected as most improved player after averaging 17.4 
points.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Connecticut swingman Richard Hamilton, the Big  
East player of the year last season, was selected Tuesday to share 
the award this season with Miami forward Tim James. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's Leonard Hamilton was chosen coach of the year and Notre  
Dame's Troy Murphy was selected rookie of the year in a voting of 
the league's coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	It was third time in the league's 20-year history that player of  
the year honors were shared. Chris Mullin of St. John's and Patrick 
Ewing of Georgetown did it as juniors and seniors in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, a 6-foot-6 junior, joins those two as the only players  
to win the award more than once. Mullin also won it as a sophomore 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton led the Huskies to the conference regular-season title  
and was the league's scoring leader in conference games this season 
at 22.1 points. His 1,020 points are the most any player has had 
after three years in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	James, a 6-7 senior, averaged 18.9 points and 8.3 rebounds for  
the second-place Hurricanes and this season became just the seventh 
player in league history to have 1,000 points and 500 rebounds in 
conference play. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-9 Murphy led the conference in rebounding at 10.3 -- the  
first freshman to ever do that -- and field goal percentage at .534. 
He averaged 18.9 points, which was fourth best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Hamilton, who was coach of the year in 1995, led the  
Hurricanes to a 21-5 overall mark and 15-3 in the league, easily 
the best marks since they joined the Big East in 1991. Miami was 
8-1 on the road in the conference this season, a record even more 
remarkable since the school had a total of 11 league road wins in 
its history before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse junior center Etan Thomas was chosen the league's  
defensive player of the year. Thomas, who was named the league's 
most improved player last season, averaged four blocked shots per 
game and his total of 167 has him in fifth place on the career 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami junior Johnny Hemsley, a first-team all-league choice this  
season, was selected as most improved player after averaging 17.4 
points.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charles Morey, a retired sports director for The  
Associated Press Broadcast Department, died Tuesday after a series 
of illnesses. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Morey joined the AP in 1945 in New York as a sports writer for  
the new division that provided stories and scripts to radio 
stations. During his career, it grew to serve television as well as 
radio, providing video, audio and graphics along with scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	He previously had been with United Press as a member of its  
racing wire staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Horse racing and the New York Giants, both the baseball and  
football variety, were Morey's favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	He fancied himself a pretty good handicapper of thoroughbreds  
and was often seen at Aqueduct or Belmont racetracks in his 
trademark bowtie. 
</P>
<P>
	Morey took over as the department's sports director in 1954 and  
authored ``The Sportsman,'' a sharply written daily script of news 
and analysis that was carried by many broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	After his retirement in 1982, he occasionally wrote sports  
stories for the AP's Newsfeatures department. 
</P>
<P>
	Morey, who was born in Brooklyn and lived in Manhattan, is  
survived by his wife, Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no funeral.

<HEADLINE> MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tom Seaver and Yogi Berra finally returned to spring training  
for the New York teams they starred on. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, the Hall of Fame catcher who had boycotted the New York  
Yankees since George Steinbrenner fired him 14 years ago, attended 
an intrasquad game in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tremendous. It's a great feeling,'' said Steinbrenner,  
who wants Berra at the regular-season home opener against Detroit 
on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner apologized two months ago for firing Berra after a  
slow start in April 1985. Berra has not been back to the ballpark 
for a Yankees game since. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called, he wanted to apologize and he said the right thing.  
If he didn't, I wouldn't be here,'' Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't commit to the home opener, but made clear he's  
likely to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what happens,'' Berra said, adding, ``Let's keep it  
a secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, the Hall of Fame right-hander who has spent the last 11  
years away from the team, arrived at camp in Port St. Lucie, Fla., 
in his new role as special instructor for the team's pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just look at him and are kind of overwhelmed,'' said Jason  
Isringhausen, one of Seaver's first pupils. ``I will listen to 
anything he says to me. It is a total respect thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, who also will broadcast the team's games this season,  
said he is anxious to help out wherever he can, especially with 
Hideo Nomo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing about Nomo that is on my checklist is to see  
what he is like at his release point,'' Seaver said. ``All the 
other stuff can be superfluous, but the more the movement, the more 
the release point becomes inconsistent and fatigue can set in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like watching Arnold Palmer swing a golf club. You  
say a guy can't swing that way, but when he gets to the contact 
point, he's in the right spot. It might be the same way with 
Nomo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa also arrived at spring training Monday, three days  
after most of his teammates made it to Cubs' camp in Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel happy,'' he said. ``Everybody is here waiting for  
me. I love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire won the home run race 70-66, but Sosa helped the  
Chicago Cubs reach the playoffs by hitting .308 with 158 RBIs. Sosa 
spent a whirlwind offseason traveling the world, picking up awards, 
working for Dominican Republic hurricane relief and making public 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in Japan, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, New York, Los Angeles,  
Arizona, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Washington, D.C., where he helped 
light the national Christmas tree and attended the State of the 
Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, McGwire went on vacation to Australia and made  
almost no personal appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied because 66 is a lot of home runs and lot of  
people wanted to shake my hand,'' Sosa said. ``I've been meeting a 
lot of people I would have never dreamed about. The nicer you are 
to people, the more they want to be around you. I think I have 
earned that respect from everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other camp news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Boston Red Sox said they may be interested in signing ace  
pitcher Pedro Martinez's brother Ramon, who is recovering from 
shoulder surgery. ``He was pretty positive about maybe signing 
here,'' said Pedro, who spoke Saturday to Ramon. Boston GM Dan 
Duquette went to Santo Domingo two weeks ago to watch Ramon throw 
in his comeback from the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- McGwire won't make his spring debut until Saturday, when the  
Cardinals play in Jupiter, Fla., against Montreal. McGwire won't 
make the 90-minute bus trip to Vero Beach for St. Louis' spring 
opener against Los Angeles on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Giants left fielder Barry Bonds was back at work after missing  
most of workouts Sunday because of spasms in his lower back. Bonds 
took turns in the batting cage, hitting line drives into the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Clearwater, Fla., negotiations broke down between Bobby  
Abreu's agent and the Philadelphia Phillies, who don't expect to 
get their starting right fielder signed to a multiyear contract 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Todd Helton, the runner-up in last year's NL rookie of the  
year voting, will sign a four-year, $12 million contract with the 
Colorado Rockies on Tuesday. Sources said Helton will make $750,000 
in 1999, $1.3 million in 2000, $4.95 million in 2001 and $5 million 
in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Once Jose Rijo's baseball academy in the Dominican Republic is  
complete, he intends to try to resurrect his baseball career one 
more time. Despite nearly four years of elbow operations and 
waylaid comeback attempts, Rijo isn't ready to retire. He said 
Monday that he hopes to sign another minor league contract with the 
Cincinnati Reds in a few weeks, once he's done supervising 
construction on the academy.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The curtain has come down early on ``The Blue  
Room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Due to the lingering bronchial infection of its star, Nicole  
Kidman, one of Broadway's hottest tickets canceled its final eight 
performances, show spokesman John Barlow said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am truly devastated not to complete the last week of the run  
and deeply apologize to the people who have planned to attend those 
performances,'' Ms. Kidman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The play was scheduled to end its sold-out run Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kidman missed four performances last week because of the  
infection. The David Hare drama opened Dec. 13 and played 82 
performances. Its final performance was last Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Yamaguchi To Face Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Michelle Kwan vs. Kristi Yamaguchi? Not  
a bad matchup, one that will highlight the Hershey's Kisses Figure 
Skating Challenge pro-am on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, who goes after her third world championship this month, is  
the top Olympic-eligible women's skater, a winner in her last 10 
competitions since taking the silver medal at the Nagano Olympics. 
Yamaguchi, who turned professional soon after winning the 1992 
Olympics, has dominated on her level for most of the 1990s, but 
rarely competes anymore. Yamaguchi will be competing in an ISU- 
judged event for the first time since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Kwan, who won her third U.S. national championship in  
February, and Yamaguchi will be two-time Olympic champion Katarina 
Witt of Germany, 1998 world bronze medalist Maria Butyrskaya of 
Russia and three-time world silver medalist Surya Bonaly of France. 
Only Kwan and Butyrskaya still hold Olympic eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's field will feature five-time U.S. champion Todd  
Eldredge, two-time Olympic silver medalist Elvis Stojko of Canada 
and current world champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia. Stojko and 
Yagudin first will face each other at the world championships in 
Helsinki, Finland, in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entered in the men's competition are current U.S. champ  
Michael Weiss, 1992 Olympic champion Viktor Petrenko of Ukraine and 
1996 U.S. champion Rudy Galindo. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairs event will feature 1998 world champions Elena  
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze against their conquerors at 
Nagano, Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev. The Russian couples 
have not met since Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenging the Russians will be U.S. champions Danielle and  
Steve Hartsell, and American silver medalists Kyoko Ina and John 
Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice dancing will feature 1998 world champions Anjelika Krylova  
and Oleg Ovsiannikov of Russia and five-time U.S. champions 
Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow, who now are professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	The event will also feature an exhibition by 1999 U.S. silver  
medalist Naomi Nari Nam, a 13-year-old phenom from Costa Mesa, 
Calif.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Panel Urges Execution Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- A state panel recommended that a German  
man scheduled to be executed Wednesday get a 60-day reprieve to 
allow his government to appeal to the International Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Board of Executive Clemency on Tuesday refused to  
reduce Walter LaGrand's death sentence to life without parole but 
voted 2-1 for the reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
	It is up to Gov. Jane Hull to decide whether to grant it. A  
spokesman said Hull would have a statement later. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemency Board Chairman Edward Leyva said the board took the  
action to give the German government time to appeal to the 
International Court in the Netherlands. The court can request an 
order staying the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter LaGrand was the second of two German brothers condemned  
to die for stabbing a bank manager to death during a botched 
robbery in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother Karl was executed last week by injection after  
appeal efforts failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brothers requested they be executed in the gas chamber in  
an effort to get the method ruled cruel and unusual, and therefore, 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal maneuver worked for a short time for Karl, when the  
9th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the execution. But hours later, 
the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl LaGrand then changed his mind and asked for a lethal  
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter LaGrand would be the first person to die in Arizona's gas  
chamber since voters approved use of lethal injection in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Agents Arrest Suspect for Glowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A suspect in an extortion attempt was caught when  
his hands and clothes glowed from allegedly touching money that had 
been dusted with a fluorescent substance. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents arrested Eugene Reynolds early Sunday near his home  
in Dryden, shining an ultraviolet light on him to get their man. 
Reynolds, 56, was charged with extortion and released on an 
electronic tether. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds had allegedly slipped two sisters a threatening note  
and made phone calls demanding $1 million, then $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters called the FBI. They withdrew $20,000 in cash from a  
trust fund, and agents dusted it with a substance that glows under 
UV light. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents then watched as the husband of one of the sisters  
delivered the cash to a dropoff spot. Reynolds was arrested a few 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Reynolds' home Tuesday went unanswered.

<HEADLINE>  Tennis Great Bill Talbert Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bill Talbert, a star player who later became  
tournament director of the U.S. Open, is dead at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1967 enshrinee of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in  
Newport, R.I., Talbert died Sunday in his Manhattan home. Cause of 
death was not immediately known, but he had been confined to a 
wheelchair for the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
	William F. Talbert, born in Cincinnati on Sept. 4, 1918, was  
diagnosed at age 10 with diabetes. He was recognized as the first 
diabetic to compete in athletics at the highest international 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached the singles finals at the U.S. Championships -- later  
known as the U.S. Open -- in 1944 and 1945 and the U.S. Indoor 
Championships in 1948-51. He was ranked among the top 10 in the 
United States from 1941 through 1955, and was a stalwart of the 
American Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	As a player, he starred in doubles, teaming with Gardnar Mulloy  
to reach the U.S. doubles final six times, winning in 1942, '45, 
'46 and '48. He also captured the U.S. Championship mixed doubles 
with Margaret Osborne four straight years -- 1943-46. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert teamed with Tony Trabert, another Hall of Famer, to win  
both the French and Italian doubles titles in 1950, and was U.S. 
Davis Cup captain from 1953-57, defeating Australia to win the Cup 
in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Mr. Tennis,'' Talbert was named director of the U.S.  
Open Championships at Forest Hills and served as chairman and 
director of the Open from 1971-75. When the Grand Slam tournament 
moved to Flushing Meadows, Talbert returned as director from 
1978-87 and served as honorary vice chairman until his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Having played in both the longest men's doubles match and mixed  
doubles match on record, Talbert was instrumental in introducing 
the tiebreaker in a major tournament in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chairman emeritus of the Hall of Fame, served on the Hall  
of Fame's executive committee and was tournament chairman of the 
Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the National Diabetes Advisory Board, the  
President's Advisory Council of the American Diabetes Association 
and a director of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. Last year, 
Talbert marked 50 years of service with the U.S. Banknote 
Corporation in New York, where he was a vice president from 1953 
until his death. 
</P>
<P>
	He also co-authored eight books, including the acclaimed ``The  
Game of Doubles in Tennis,'' and his autobiography, ``Playing for 
Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert was married to the former Nancy Pike, an editor for  
Vogue and Life Magazine, from 1946 until her death in 1995. He is 
survived by two sons, W. Pike and Peter, and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of the family, funeral services will be private.

<HEADLINE> BoxCar Willie Home From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- Country singer BoxCar Willie is back on  
track in his battle against leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old entertainer gained enough strength to return  
home from the hospital Tuesday and resume chemotherapy. He had been 
hospitalized for two weeks after the cancer treatments left him ill 
and weak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing a little better,'' said his daughter, Tammy LaCore.  
</P>
<P>
	BoxCar Willie was diagnosed with leukemia in 1996. He was  
declared cancer-free in 1997 and returned to performing. But the 
disease returned last April.

<HEADLINE> Utah To Ban Guns From Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Don't take your guns to town if you're  
headed to the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers passed a bill Tuesday that would ban concealed  
weapons at the games' venues in a state where 22,400 out of 1.7 
million residents are licensed to pack heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Only biathletes -- who ski and shoot in the biathlon -- will be  
allowed to carry guns under the legislation given final approval by 
the House. A spokeswoman said Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt plans to 
sign it into law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that was absolutely essential for our security  
planning for the games. It was a very important bill for us,'' said 
Shelley Thomas, vice president for communications for the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. ``It was not our aim ... to address broader 
issues regarding gun control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah lawmakers traditionally have bristled at any gun-control  
legislation, and the state has some of the most lenient firearms 
laws in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, backed by the National Rifle Association, mandates  
that facilities be set up outside Olympic venues where spectators 
attending Olympic events can check their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Violating the ban would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to a  
$1,000 fine and six months in jail.

<HEADLINE> WTO Postpones Banana Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Plans by the U.S. government to slap big tariffs  
on European products in a long-running battle over banana imports 
were in limbo Tuesday after the World Trade Organization delayed a 
ruling on the amount of money involved. 
</P>
<P>
	A WTO arbitration panel said it needed more information before  
it could decide on the level of damages -- if any -- inflicted on 
U.S. banana traders by the European Union's import policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement cast doubt on whether the United States would  
go ahead as planned Wednesday to demand authorization for punitive 
import duties against European products including cashmere 
sweaters, Parma ham, cheese, French luxury bags, batteries, sweet 
biscuits and pastries. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has put the value of the sanctions at $520 million,  
the amount it maintains U.S. banana distributors have lost from the 
EU's preferential deals on banana imports with former colonies in 
Africa and the Caribbean such as Jamaica, the Dominican Republic 
and the Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions could price the products involved off the American  
market and jeopardize the existence of small European producers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the United States indicated last month that it would  
abide by the decision of a WTO arbitration panel charged with 
assessing the size of the damages. The panel was meant to report 
Tuesday in advance of Wednesday's WTO meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have requested the parties to supply us with additional  
information,'' said Stuart Harbinson, chairman of the arbitration 
panel. The delay puts a ruling off until at least the middle of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial U.S. reaction to the delay was muted as trade  
representatives debated what to do next. In recent days Washington 
has toned down its rhetoric against Brussels on the banana issue, 
and behind-the-scenes negotiations have been going on to find a 
peaceful solution. The delay could provide the necessary breathing 
space to reach a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The banana row has plunged the WTO into untested legal territory  
and officials appear to be at a loss as to how to deal with it. 
Under the dispute, which has been brewing for years, Europe 
maintains it has changed its import rules sufficiently to bring 
them in to line with international standards, an assertion that 
Washington rejects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans are under pressure to champion the cause of their  
former colonies, many of whom are poor and greatly dependent on 
banana exports. The Clinton administration, meanwhile, is squeezed 
by the banana distributors Chiquita Brands International Inc. and 
Dole Food Co., who have big political clout. 
</P>
<P>
	Angry at being threatened with huge sanctions and worried that  
more might follow in a looming fight over beef hormones, the 
European Union asked the WTO to rule on the legality of the U.S. 
301 trade law which authorizes the use of retaliatory tariffs. This 
request was granted earlier Tuesday, although it will be six months 
before a judgment is issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU and Japan have complained before about the 301 law,  
saying the use of unilateral muscle to force open markets is 
against the WTO's international rules. ``It's something we feel 
strongly about,'' said EU negotiator Roderick Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes accused the Europeans of using  
tactics to hide the fact that they were in the wrong over bananas. 
``It's a case of sour grapes over bananas,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Takes Anthrax Hoaxes Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Virtually every day for several weeks, the FBI  
has heard about an anthrax threat somewhere in America. So far, 
they have all been hoaxes, but the bureau responds seriously to 
every one. 
</P>
<P>
	``My personal fear is that someday there will be a real anthrax  
threat, and American society will react by saying, `There's another 
hoax','' Neil J. Gallagher, FBI Assistant Director in charge of the 
national security division, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporadic threats of contamination with the potentially lethal  
anthrax bacterium date back several years. But beginning last fall 
and accelerating in the past few weeks, the FBI has seen a spate of 
letters, containing a sticky substance or dark powder and the 
ominous warning: You've been contaminated by anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters have been received in almost every region of the  
nation. They often arrive in bunches, at 10 or 15 similar targets 
in a city. The targets have been quite varied: Abortion clinics, 
Catholic schools, nightclubs, department stores, hospitals, post 
offices, courthouses, news media offices, FBI offices and even the 
Old Executive Office Building beside the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a day goes by without us hearing from somewhere in the  
United States about an anthrax threat,'' Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anthrax threats have become what bomb threats once were or  
product tampering threats in the 1980s'' after the Tylenol 
poisoning in Illinois, said FBI spokesman Bill Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to slow this down is for us to prosecute  
someone,'' said Gallagher's deputy Dale L. Watson. ``So we are 
diligently investigating'' the hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the hoaxes are federal felonies.  
</P>
<P>
	Mailing a threat to injure someone is punishable by up to six  
years in prison. Threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction, 
including a biological agent like anthrax, can bring life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles accountant Harvey Craig Spelkin, 53, was charged at  
yearend with such a biological threat. Federal prosecutors allege 
he tried to avoid a Dec. 18 appearance in U.S. Bankruptcy Court by 
telephoning the courthouse with a warning that anthrax might be in 
the air conditioning system. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man was charged in January with telephoning anthrax  
threats to a Los Angeles area hospital and is undergoing 
psychiatric tests. 
</P>
<P>
	They are among very few people charged so far, none of them with  
the letter-threat hoaxes. The FBI has investigated 42 incidents 
since the beginning of this year; the Justice Department could not 
say exactly how many people have been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Letter threats are difficult to prosecute, Gallagher said.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't walk into a post office where they can be spotted.  
They use a remote mailbox. You can't trace a letter to a particular 
mailbox, only to a time of day and a part of town,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the sender obviously wants to publicize a cause, as in  
the letters to abortion clinics. Others are just copy cats. 
Sometimes the motive isn't apparent. Sometimes, agents believe, the 
sender wants to get a look at the response of law enforcement and 
rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When some people see that large response, it encourages others  
who want the same response,'' Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexington, Ky., is one of several cities where a batch of  
letters have been postmarked. Nearly 30 letters and cards 
postmarked from Lexington have been sent to women's clinics 
nationwide in the last few weeks, but tests showed none contained 
anthrax spores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hazardous Materials Response Unit from the FBI laboratory  
responds when local authorities are not equipped to handle the 
call. They can do tests on the scene that indicate whether anthrax 
is present, said Tom Kubic, deputy assistant director of the lab. 
Further testing at the lab can show the purity of any anthrax that 
might be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The availability of anthrax harmful to individuals is fairly  
small,'' Kubic said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention keeps a registry of those who have purified strains. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steps to purify anthrax to a hazardous or deadly level are  
not generally available to the public,'' Kubic said. 
</P>
<P>
	And exposure isn't always fatal. Anthrax is destroyed by bleach,  
Kubic said, which is why people at some threat sites have been 
rinsed with a bleach solution as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax takes one to six days to take effect, producing flu-like  
symptoms in people who inhale its spores. Once the disease is fully 
established, it can kill within 24 hours if not treated with 
antibiotics.

<HEADLINE> Bennett Convicted on Some Counts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Businessman Patrick Bennett was convicted  
Tuesday of perjury and obstructing a federal investigation of his 
company but a jury deadlocked on more serious charges alleging he 
orchestrated the biggest pyramid scheme in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had charged Bennett with swindling more than 22,000  
investors out of $700 million, but the jury did not reach a 
conclusion on those charges after the two-month trial in U.S. 
District Court in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the jury said it was deadlocked on those charges  
despite a plea by Judge Thomas P. Griesa to continue deliberating. 
</P>
<P>
	``After considering the court's appeal to try once more to find  
some ground for agreement on the disputed counts, we have been 
unsuccessful,'' the jury said in a note. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Khuzami, chief of the securities and commodities fraud  
unit of the federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan, said 
prosecutors will retry Bennett on all counts on which the jury did 
not reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had accused Bennett of using Bennett Funding Group  
to cheat investors in 46 states by enticing them to invest in 
leases for office equipment that sometimes had been bought with 
cash or did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett then lined his own pockets with more than $13 million  
and used some of it to buy Vernon Downs racetrack near Syracuse, 
prosecutors said. They alleged he also ordered that tens of 
millions of the company's money be spent on gambling ventures, 
including $19 million for a gambling barge. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett testified on his own behalf during the trial, admitting  
that he lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission after the 
watchdog agency began investigating the company in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The lies, prosecutors said, stalled the SEC until March 1996,  
causing investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bennett said he never intended to defraud investors.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pat Bennett did not intend to defraud the investors of Bennett  
Funding Group,'' his lawyer, Mark Gombiner, said in closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told you that he lied to the SEC. He admitted those lies to  
you and he is prepared to pay the consequences for them,'' Gombiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett was convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy to obstruct the SEC investigation. He faces up to five 
years in prison on each of the charges.

<HEADLINE> Eagle Has Surgery To Fix Eyesight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Doctors implanted an artificial lens in  
the eye of a blind bald eagle named ``Moose'' and reported Tuesday 
that the bird is beginning to see again. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we shine a very bright light in her eye she blinks  
immediately. So she can definitely sense the light is coming into 
her eye,'' ophthalmologist Dr. Margaret Cawrse said, a day after 
the surgery at the University of Tennessee Veterinary Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Cecere, president of the National Foundation to Protect  
America's Eagles, said the surgery was a first for an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long ago, Moose's future looked bleak. She was starving  
because she couldn't see her food. And she wasn't inclined to 
hand-feeding from her caregivers at the eagle foundation, based at 
Dolly Parton's Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our only alternative was to euthanize her,'' Cecere said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cawrse and colleagues proposed a form of cataract surgery they  
routinely perform on dogs and cats. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors planned to operate on both eyes, but the surgery took  
longer than expected and they decided to wait to do the right eye 
in a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Webster Hubbell May Get Probe Memos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a new threat to Kenneth Starr's office, a  
federal judge indicated today he may require the prosecutor to 
supply presidential friend Webster Hubbell with investigative memos 
and grand jury testimony that spell out the inner workings of the 
Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson suggested he may hold a  
pretrial hearing into how Starr came to indict Hubbell for 
allegedly concealing his and Hillary Rodham Clinton's work on a 
fraudulent Arkansas land development called Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	Castle Grande was owned by Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater partner,  
Jim McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell says Starr's case is tainted by business records and  
testimony which the former associate attorney general gave the 
prosecutor in 1996 under a limited grant of immunity from 
prosecution. Starr provided the limited immunity as part of an 
investigation into whether the Clinton White House arranged ``hush 
money'' payments to Hubbell in 1994 to keep him quiet in Starr's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said Hubbell has a right to be assured that evidence  
from the ``hush money'' probe was ``not imported to the grand 
jury'' that indicted him in the Castle Grande case. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said there is a question as to whether Starr decided  
to bring the Castle Grande probe because of the immunized evidence 
produced in the ``hush money'' probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said the argument by prosecutors that ``Castle Grande  
is unrelated to'' the ``hush money'' probe and a tax evasion 
indictment arising from it ``is rejected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said he will consider the request of Hubbell lawyer  
John Nields that prosecutors provide memos written inside Starr's 
office and grand jury transcripts detailing the history of how the 
Castle Grande case came to be brought. The judge will review any 
such material before deciding whether to turn it over to Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	If Robertson finds that some of the immunized material found its  
way into the Castle Grande probe, Starr would then have to 
demonstrate in pretrial court hearings that no aspect of the case 
was derived from the material. If Starr were unable to make such a 
showing, the Castle Grande case would collapse, just as 
prosecutions against Iran-Contra figures Oliver North and John 
Poindexter collapsed a number of years ago due to immunized 
testimony the defendants' provided to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At a court hearing, prosecutor Eric Dreiband stated that the  
prosecution team in the Hubbell case involving Castle Grande has 
never even seen the business records Clinton's friend supplied to 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreiband said there is no connection between the Castle Grande  
case and the tax evasion case stemming from the ``hush money'' 
probe.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Island Has Junk Car Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIHUE, Hawaii (AP) -- Surfers and tourists love the crystal-blue  
waters off Kealia Beach, a stretch of picturesque white sand along 
the eastern shore of Kauai, the ``Garden Island'' of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Yards away on the beautiful beach are four junked cars. And  
across the island, there are hundreds of rusting hulks amid the 
lush greenery that has been a Hollywood favorite for decades; 
``South Pacific'' and ``Jurassic Park'' were filmed here. 
</P>
<P>
	The Garden Island has become the ``Garbage Island'' to some  
frustrated Kauai residents, who for more than three years have had 
no place to legally dump unwanted vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pathetic,'' said Kealia surfer Jimmy Dread, adding that  
friends who visit joke the junks bring a certain ``Third World 
charm'' to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be hyperbole, but local officials fear any negative  
publicity will stunt efforts to return tourism -- Kauai's No. 1 
industry -- to levels enjoyed before Hurricane Iniki decimated the 
island in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Iniki left thousands of vehicles inoperable, and their disposal  
was complicated by a 1994 law prohibiting the dumping of cars at 
the county landfill. 
</P>
<P>
	The complication became a crisis when the company that removed  
junks was shut down in 1996 for not paying its state lease, and the 
proliferation of roadside clunkers followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become somewhat of a tradition,'' said a recent editorial  
in The Garden Island newspaper, which publishes a weekly chart 
listing the number of junks collected and the number of new ones 
spotted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dump the heap somewhere, let the scavengers forage for parts,  
watch as the stripped vehicle is filled with garbage and more junks 
pile up around it,'' the newspaper wrote. ``Then wait for the 
county to clean up the mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abandoned cars also are found on Oahu, Maui and Hawaii, but it's  
become a much more serious issue for Kauai. 
</P>
<P>
	The island has been removing junks in recent months -- and claims  
to have cleared the largest and most notorious dump sites -- but 
pockets of junkers remain, sometimes a dozen or more together. 
</P>
<P>
	Kauai County maintains no junked cars can be seen from the main  
roads circling the 552-square-mile island, but a dozen line the 
road leading to the National Tropical Botanical Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicles there and at Kealia Beach are on private property  
and can't be removed by the county, said Mayor Maryanne Kusaka, who 
pledged after her 1994 election to remove the junks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't take those out,'' Kusaka said. ``We have made every  
effort to address this matter with all the resources available to 
us and within the confines of applicable regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the fine is just $150, police typically have been  
unenthusiastic about citing junkers. The county wants to increase 
fines, and there's been talk of publishing the names of those 
cited. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a towing company has received two contracts totaling  
about $500,000 to remove cars, and the Puhi Meadows Recycling 
Center will be allowed to accept unwanted cars from their owners 
for shipment off the island later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,700 vehicles were shipped last year, compared to about  
1,500 in 1996. Another 1,400 are expected to leave under a current 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, a mound of about 500 cars three stories high and a  
football field long await processing at Puhi Meadows. Those twisted 
scraps of metal are juxtaposed against majestic Haupia Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	No big deal, said Gary Baldwin of the Kauai Economic Development  
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not had a single visitor tell me that junk cars are a  
detriment to his or her vacation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Alcatel To Buy Internet Firm Xylan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French telecommunications company Alcatel SA is  
buying the California-based Internet equipment maker Xylan Corp. 
for about $2 billion in cash in a move that will boost Alcatel's 
profile in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase will allow Alcatel to strengthen its position as an  
equipment supplier to U.S. telephone companies, using Xylan's 
expertise in making switches and routing gear needed for high-speed 
data networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alcatel is implementing a comprehensive strategy to become a  
key worldwide player in the Internet field,'' Alcatel Chairman 
Serge Tchuruk said today in a statement announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	With the volume of data traffic worldwide growing much more  
rapidly than old-fashioned voice telephone calls, established 
companies such as Alcatel are increasingly investing in Internet 
equipment makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel already owns 6.5 percent of Xylan, which was founded in  
1993 and is based in Calabasas, Calif. Alcatel bought the stake in 
Xylan from an investment in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It has agreed to pay $37 a share for Xylan in a cash tender  
offer beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is  
subject to clearance by antitrust regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to be completed in the beginning of April.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Kim, Xylan's president and chief executive, said his  
compny ``has grown beyond anyone's expectations over the last five 
years'' and the deal with Alcatel will give Xylan a ``dramatic 
boost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Xylan has acquired more than 4,000 customers and annual revenue  
has risen to $348 million in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview today, Kim said the deal will allow  
Xylan to compete more effectively against larger competitors such 
as Cisco Systems Corp., Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he was frustrated because though Xylan continued to  
grow, the stock price didn't. ``Today's investors are favoring the 
large companies,'' he said. ``They see us as still small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said Xylan will also give Alcatel the boost it needs to make  
inroads into the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a very little presence in the U.S. data and voice  
(industry) and they're going to use us as a vehicle to penetrate 
into the U.S. market,'' Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris-based Alcatel opeates in 130 countries.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Convicted in Pedophile Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A university professor was convicted Tuesday on  
federal charges that he brought a teen-age Honduran boy into the 
country to have sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said it was the first federal case prosecuted  
involving charges of bringing a juvenile into the country for the 
purpose of sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Hersh, a computer science professor at Florida Atlantic  
University in Boca Raton, was convicted on 10 counts, including 
passport fraud, alien smuggling and child pornography. Hersh, 59, 
faces a maximum sentence of more than 100 years in prison when he 
is sentenced July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed Hersh preyed on the family's young boys,  
trading toys, clothing and money for sex and eventually a chance to 
bring the teen-ager to his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine how the victims in this sort of case feel  
towards Americans?'' Assistant U.S. Attorney John McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hersh's defense claimed that the teen-ager was a son born to him  
out of a liaison with a Honduran woman and that his interest in him 
was purely parental. But the mother and her sons testified against 
Hersh, and his ex-wife described him as an admitted pedophile. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, now 18, testified last month that he submitted to the  
man's desires for several years, first in Honduras and later in the 
United States, because he needed financial help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did it due to the poverty,'' the teen said. ``I had the need  
and wanted (him) to help my family out. That's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teen moved into Hersh's Boca Raton home in August 1995. The  
two shared the same bed, the teen said. He said Hersh enrolled him 
in the fourth grade at a school -- he was small for his age -- and 
told him to tell people he was 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, the teen admitted he had numerous  
opportunities to tell police and teachers about his relations with 
Hersh before he finally told them the two were having sex. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that when authorities began investigating the  
relationship, he lied at first ``for fear of being left on the 
street and by embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence in Hersh's home showed the boy was living in the master  
bedroom with the defendant, U.S. Assistant Attorney Thomas O'Malley 
told the jury Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley asked jurors to focus on the defendant's own words  
found in letters on his computer. In one, Hersh wrote to a friend 
on how he was able to secure documents to pass the boy off as his 
own son. ``As you can imagine I'm ecstatic how things have turned 
out,'' Hersh stated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does that sound like a parental relationship? Or does that  
sound like a high school love affair?'' O'Malley asked the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney David Tucker, in a boisterous prop-filled  
closing argument, cited the boy's failure to tell authorities about 
the allegations and told the jurors they shouldn't trust the 
testimony of the mother, the brother and other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said an FBI agent promised the mother housing in Honduras  
and her sons residency in the United States in exchange for their 
testimony. The family's home was destroyed by a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Hersh was suspended from his job at Florida Atlantic University  
after being arrested in April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Daniel Gajdusek  
pleaded guilty in February 1997 in Maryland state court for 
sexually abusing a teen-age boy he brought home from a research 
trip to Micronesia. He was released from prison last April.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Recover / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices advanced early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, continuing a recovery tied to 
expectations for an increase in exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans benefited from heavy buying by fund houses  
following Monday's unexpectedly strong rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans advanced after the government reported export  
inspections jumped 14 percent last week, although market 
participants expected gains to be limited today on reports of 
increased exports from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat advanced as market participants eyed an improved outlook --  
at least in the near-term -- for export business. Egypt over the 
weekend made a large purchase, while Pakistan was considering 
buying from either the United States, Australia or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.57 1/4 a bushel; May  
corn rose 3 cents to $2.14 1/4 a bushel; May oats rose 1/2 cent to 
$1.06 3/4 a bushel; May soybeans rose 2 cents to $4.65 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .05 cent to 68.30 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .18 cent to 73.77 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .42 cent to 43.05 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell .77 
cent to 48.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Duke Tops AP Men's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A six-game winning streak propelled  
Tennessee back into the Top 25 just when it matters most. 
</P>
<P>
	``You like playing good this time of year, and I think we are,''  
Volunteer coach Jerry Green said Monday as Tennessee (20-7) 
re-entered The Associated Press college basketball poll at No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers were ninth in the preseason poll, but were out of  
the Top 25 by the fifth week of the regular season. A 90-62 loss at 
now-No. 4 Auburn on Jan. 2 was the low point. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the Vols are 12-3, including their first season  
sweep of border-state rival Kentucky in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee closed the regular season with a 68-61 victory over  
the defending national champion Wildcats on Sunday to capture the 
Southeastern Conference East Division crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said preseason predictions were based on center Charles  
Hathaway returning strong from surgery for a blood clot, freshman 
forward Vincent Yarbrough living up to impact-player expectations 
and ``everybody else playing the way they did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't happen, at least not at first.  
</P>
<P>
	Hathaway's play is still limited, but Yarbrough is averaging  
nearly eight points and five rebounds. Meanwhile, guards Brandon 
Wharton and Tony Harris rediscovered their shooting touch and are 
now averaging 13 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think now we have kind of got all the right buttons  
pushed,'' Green said. ``We are not good enough to just show up and 
win a game. We've got to play well. But I like where we are. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the conference championship in the East has certainly  
given us more confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols get a first-round bye in this week's SEC tournament in  
Atlanta. Unless Vanderbilt upsets them, Mississippi State, the last 
team to beat the Vols, will face Tennessee on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how good this team is,'' Green said. ``They have  
to answer that for themselves. We can be marginal if we don't give 
a great effort. How good it can be, I will leave up to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three other teams re-entered the Top 25 Monday -- Arkansas,  
Minnesota and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, which made school and conference history last weekend, was  
No. 1 for the fourth straight week, while No. 2 Michigan State 
reached its highest ranking in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (29-1) capped the first 16-0 season in Atlantic  
Coast Conference history on Saturday with an 81-61 victory over 
North Carolina, extending their winning streak to a school-record 
24 games. For the second straight week, Duke received all but one 
of the first-place votes from a national media panel, getting 71 
and 1,799 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (26-4) again got the other No. 1 vote and had  
1,694 points to move from third to second, its highest ranking 
since being No. 1 for two weeks during the 1978-79 season. The 
Spartans, led by sophomore Magic Johnson, won their only national 
championship that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut moved up one place to third, and Auburn, which lost  
at Arkansas last week, dropped two places to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland and Stanford remained fifth and sixth and were followed  
by Cincinnati, Utah, Miami and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, 12th last week, is back in the top 10 for the first time  
since the first poll of the regular season. The return trip to the 
top 10 was a little longer for Miami, which was last there in the 
final poll of the 1959-60 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State dropped one spot to No. 11 and was followed by UCLA,  
Arizona, Kentucky, North Carolina, College of Charleston, Indiana, 
Tennessee, Wisconsin and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five teams were Florida, Arkansas, Minnesota, Missouri  
and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The next-to-last poll of the season had a sizable shakeup as 14  
ranked teams lost at least one game last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas (20-9) returned at No. 22 after a three-week absence.  
The Razorbacks lost at Alabama on Saturday, but they beat Auburn 
and Kentucky in their previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (17-9) was out of the Top 25 the last two weeks and  
returned at No. 23 having won three of four. Missouri (20-7) is 
ranked for the third time in the last five weeks, this time coming 
in off a road victory at Texas on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the four teams that fell out of the rankings had been in  
the Top 25 all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (19-10), which was as high as eighth this season, dropped  
out from 23rd following losses to Minnesota and Michigan State. 
Syracuse (19-10), which had been as high as No. 12, dropped out 
from 24th following Sunday's loss to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple (19-9), which was tied for 24th last week, fell out after  
one week back in the poll after losing to Massachusetts on Sunday. 
Texas (18-11) made its first poll appearance of the season last 
week at No. 22, but was gone after the loss to Missouri.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Acquire Denver QB Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers have acquired quarterback  
Jeff Lewis from the Denver Broncos for undisclosed draft picks in 
1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff's schooling during the early stages of his career has  
been in a similar offensive system, and this is a plus,'' Panthers 
coach George Seifert said Monday. ``His mobility and desire to 
compete is a plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert said Steve Beuerlein is still the Panthers' starter.  
</P>
<P>
	``Going into training camp, Steve Beuerlein is our quarterback  
and we have a great deal of respect for his ability and what he has 
accomplished,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 25, was Denver's fourth-round pick in the 1996 draft out  
of Division I-AA Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 211-pound Lewis did not play in 1998 after  
suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while 
playing basketball in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Lewis was the Broncos' second-string quarterback for  
the first 13 games of the season. He was moved to third string when 
Denver acquired Bubby Brister. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has played in just five NFL games, completing 10 of 19  
passes with no touchdowns and one interception.

<HEADLINE> Computer, Music Industry Reach Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Stereophiles rejoice. Top computer  
companies were expected to announce Wednesday that they have 
reached a content protection agreement for DVD-Audio systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of such an agreement has kept DVD-Audio from being  
commercially introduced into the music marketplace even as DVDs 
begin to make headway in the video industry. 
</P>
<P>
	DVD, or digital video disc, is a five-inch disc that debuted in  
1997 as a new technology that made vidoes more vivid and lifelike. 
About the size of a CD, the laser-read optical discs sell for about 
$24 each and their players cost about $500 each. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year following the DVD's debut, the audio industry began  
developing audio-only DVDs to serve as an upgrade to compact discs. 
In addition to agreeing on the format, the group set out to find 
common ground on content protection. 
</P>
<P>
	A framework to protect content for the DVD video disc had  
already been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry sources told The Associated Press that on Wednesday,  
IBM Corp., Intel Co., Matsushita Electric (Panasonic) and Toshiba 
Corp. will jointly announce the development of a content protection 
framework for DVD-Audio. 
</P>
<P>
	The framework has received the endorsement of each of the five  
leading music industry companies, BMG Entertainment, EMI, Sony 
Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies would not officially discuss the framework before  
the scheduled announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The public release of this music industry-supported copy  
protection framework will enable DVD-Audio to appear on the market 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association says that  
DVDs, which can hold as much as 13 times more information than a 
CD, can provide six-channel surround sound, giving people a more 
crisp and lucid listening experience.

<HEADLINE> GOP Speak-No-Evil Edict Won't Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a political commandment, the Republican  
admonition against speaking ill of each other is durable but 
fictional, regularly recited and as regularly ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be again in the 2000 presidential campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	And so the party chairman who said he will play referee and blow  
the whistle on GOP candidates who attack Republican rivals is not 
going to stop play or even slow it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Nicholson's attempt is in the tradition of party leaders who  
try to deal in advance with the divisions that are inevitable among 
contestants for nominations. The aim is damage control, so that 
disputes of the primary campaign won't last to hurt the nominee in 
the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an adversary, and it is not us; it is them,''  
Nicholson said in Des Moines, Iowa, where the 2000 competition 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's not running or managing a candidate. For those who are,  
the adversaries in the first round are other Republicans, since 
only one of them can win and take on the Democrats on Nov. 7, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a crowded field, it's an elimination contest, to be played  
out more rapidly than ever before because of the profusion of major 
state primary elections due before springtime next year. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 11th Commandment works best for leaders, as it did for  
Ronald Reagan, patron of the notion when he first ran for office 33 
years ago. ``Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican,'' it 
read. While Reagan always said it, he didn't always observe it when 
he was a challenger, trying to wrest the 1976 nomination from 
Gerald Ford -- and saying the president had neither vision nor 
leadership, but a spendthrift pork barrel of gift projects to 
barter for votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan insisted that he wasn't breaching the motto he'd adopted  
but was campaigning on issues and policies, not personal attacks. 
It was a distinction that made no difference for Ford, who narrowly 
won the nomination but lost the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	That claim echoes, too.  
</P>
<P>
	It is what Steve Forbes said in defending his negative  
television campaign against Bob Dole, a tactic that stalled the 
former senator in early 1996 primaries and scarred him later in his 
lost challenge for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been based on principles, issues and record,''  
Forbes says now. ``They were never personal attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course Dole had his own attack ads, designed to block Lamar  
Alexander, the former Tennessee governor. Alexander is running 
again and says this time he is prepared to counterattack to defend 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	And conservative Patrick J. Buchanan, who spares no one when he  
gets going, as against George Bush in 1992 and Dole in 1996, has 
yet to get started. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly a promising setting for Sen. John McCain's request of  
party activists to withhold support from GOP candidates who attack 
other GOP candidates. ``Scorched earth Republican primaries will 
lead directly to an Al Gore presidency,'' McCain told California 
Republicans at their weekend convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``What does he think this is, some sort of tea party?''  
Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he thinks it may be a way to move up in the rankings, by  
taking his stand for harmony against the bitter political backdrop 
left by impeachment. For him or any of the other lesser-known 
candidates to become real contenders, front-runners like Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole will have to be slowed. There'll 
be plenty of money and plenty of TV ads aimed at the leaders. And 
that just might create an opening for a candidate like McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	The speak-no-evil commandment came originally from a doctor  
named Gaylord Parkinson, the California Republican chairman, in the 
bitter aftermath of the 1964 Democratic landslide. When Reagan ran 
for governor of California in 1966, he used it to advantage against 
a more seasoned challenger for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	It's more complicated now. That was before the era of high-cost,  
high-intensity TV campaigns, and the attack ads that can undercut a 
leader. And the price tag is not only in political insults. An 
embattled leader can be forced into spending that leaves him 
scrimping long before the general election campaign. That happened 
to Dole in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	It could happen again.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Md. County Votes for Smoking Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Despite intense opposition from  
restaurants, officials in Maryland's second-most-populous county 
banned smoking in bars and restaurants on Tuesday -- effective in 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time we're recognizing the rights of restaurant  
workers and patrons to enjoy smoke-free air,'' said Larry Couch, a 
member of a coalition of organizations that endorsed the bill for 
Montgomery County, a suburban area just north of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The county joins Phoenix and the state of California in  
implementing a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 employees from such establishments had signed  
petitions warning the ban ``would destroy the work environment on 
which we depend to make a living.''

<HEADLINE> Taliban Helped bin Laden Disappear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) -- Two weeks ago, suspected terrorist  
Osama bin Laden disappeared from his refuge in southern 
Afghanistan. Since then, his whereabouts have been a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	Afghanistan's Taliban rulers say they have no idea where he is --  
even though, according to a top Taliban official, he was 
accompanied by 10 Afghan agents sent to both protect and spy on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities, who want bin Laden in connection with the Aug.  
7 bombings that devastated the U.S. embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania, also say they have no idea whether the Saudi national is 
still in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden arrived here nearly five years ago, taking refuge amid  
Afghanistan's anarchy after Sudan expelled him. His disappearance 
followed a U.S. missile attack against his training camps on Aug. 
21, and Taliban assertions that they were putting pressure on him 
to rein in his activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, who speaks for Taliban supreme leader  
Mullah Mohammed Omar, says the Taliban sent bin Laden his escorts 
on Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the escorts worked for the Taliban's Interior Ministry,  
a police organization. Their job was to protect bin Laden, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others worked for the secret service. Their job was ``to spy on  
him'' and still others worked for the Foreign Ministry ``because he 
is our foreign guest,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 13, Omar announced that bin Laden had disappeared.  
</P>
<P>
	As of Sunday, bin Laden's escorts had not returned to the  
Taliban's southern stronghold of Kandahar, militia officials claim. 
Nor is there any sign the escorts have left Afghanistan, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were told to go up to a place where he wants to go and  
where they can go,'' Muttawakil said. ``To leave the country would 
require formalities, passports, visas. I don't think they would 
have left the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about bin Laden's whereabouts, Omar, the Taliban leader,  
said in a written response: ``I am saying it with full authority 
that we have no information. ... And neither have we received any 
information about whether he is dead or alive. We did not ask him 
to leave Afghanistan. He was free to decide whether to stay in 
Afghanistan or whether to leave the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the West could be expected to believe the Taliban had  
no idea where bin Laden is, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hajji Fazle 
Mohammed said: ``That's the problem ... the West doesn't trust us 
and we don't trust the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kandahar, a dust-clogged city of 200,000 people where bin  
Laden lived only six miles from Omar, many people believe bin Laden 
is still in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe he has moved only 50 miles away, to the relative  
safety of Islam Dara, a warren of caves and stone barracks used by 
Afghans who fought against Soviet troops. Concealed in the crevices 
of Sheikh Hazrat Mountain, the base is protected by land mines and 
reachable only by a maze of foot paths. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks before bin Laden disappeared, scores of Arabs began  
arriving at Sheikh Hazrat, villagers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a single night they saw 20 minivans and off-road vehicles  
with their windows blackened, all carrying Arabs and following a 
dust-covered trail toward Sheikh Hazrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear that they were Osama's people ... The people of  
the village, everyone knew they were Osama's people and then the 
radio said he was gone,'' said Mohammed Nabi, who operates a 
ramshackle wheat milling shop in the nearby village of Chinar. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabi was not happy at the prospect of playing host to bin Laden.  
``Foreigners have destroyed our country,'' he said. ``They come 
here to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden's four wives and an unknown number of children have  
remained in Kandahar, according to Muttawakil, who said they live 
near the Kandahar airport in a compound of 300 homes built by bin 
Laden to house his Arab followers. 
</P>
<P>
	The family is not allowed any visitors, Muttawakil added.  
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban have refused several requests from the United States  
to hand over bin Laden, saying he is a guest and friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Muttawakil said that on Feb. 10, the Taliban took bin Laden's  
satellite telephone and banned him from meeting anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those were the rules ... (he) could not talk to anyone,'' said  
Muttawakil. ``Every human being has the right to discuss his ideas 
but we told him he can't even do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What prompted Bin Laden's disappearance?  
</P>
<P>
	Many people in Kandahar believe bin Laden left because the  
Taliban had received threats from the United States that another 
missile attack was being prepared on Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Muttawakil said the Taliban recently refused an American request  
to hand bin Laden to the United States, Saudi Arabia or to a third 
country where he could stand trial, but that there wasn't a direct 
American threat. He added, however, ``It won't be strange if they 
attack us again ... it's really our fate to be attacked by 
everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.  
Henry H. Shelton, refused to rule out new bombing raids on 
Afghanistan, saying: ``We will deal with him by whatever means we 
feel are appropriate.''

<HEADLINE> Life Sentence in Subway Bomb Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Palestinian-born man who intended to ``martyr  
himself'' and kill Jews by putting a nail-filled pipe bomb on a New 
York City subway train has been sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Reena Raggi handed down the sentence Monday  
after Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, 25, read a rambling statement 
expressing no remorse. He insisted he was a victim of Israeli and 
U.S. oppression. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said Hitler killed 6 million, but that's a lie,'' he  
said. ``If there is justice in the world, the Israeli leaders 
should be tried as war criminals for genocide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raggi told Mezer his statement demonstrated he is ``as much of a  
risk now as the night you were arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Raggi: ``Whatever has caused it, you are consumed by hate.  
You have your own narrow view of your situation, and apparently no 
one is going to dissuade you from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury convicted Mezer last year on charges of conspiring to use  
a weapon of mass destruction in the July 1997 suicide-bomb plot. 
During the trial, he testified that he wanted to ``martyr'' himself 
and kill ``as many Jews as I could take'' with a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the FBI, Mezer targeted a subway train in Brooklyn  
because it serves the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Borough 
Park. The plan went awry when a police SWAT-team raided his 
apartment just hours before the intended blast, wounding him and a 
roommate in a brief shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The police found an elaborately constructed pipe bomb rigged to  
explode, an unfinished bomb and a letter protesting the United 
States' Middle East policies and demanding freedom for the Arabs 
held in American and Israeli prisons for previous terrorist 
activities.

<HEADLINE> Auditors: Clinton Plan Breaks Caps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget would  
exceed spending limits for that year by $30 billion, according to 
the Congressional Budget Office, shattering caps enacted two years 
ago to control federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO analysis, distributed Tuesday evening to congressional  
budget aides, also says Clinton's budget would leave surpluses $73 
billion smaller than he says they would be over the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	That reduction would occur discounting the president's plans for  
using anticipated federal surpluses for shoring up Social Security, 
Medicare, and other programs. If Clinton's Social Security plan is 
factored in, the surpluses would be $364 billion smaller through 
2004, CBO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tables illustrating CBO's findings were obtained by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by Congress' nonpartisan budget office is sure to be  
used by congressional Republicans to argue that the $1.77 trillion 
budget that Clinton proposed last month spends more and saves less 
than he claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget asserted it lives within the spending limits by  
paying for several initiatives with higher taxes on cigarettes, 
other fee increases and spending reductions in some programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to aides familiar with a Capitol Hill briefing new  
CBO chief Dan Crippen gave Tuesday evening, the congressional 
auditors discounted many of those savings because budget rules 
disallow them in calculating compliance with the spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending limit in question -- $537 billion for fiscal 2000,  
which begins Oct. 1 -- applies to so-called discretionary spending. 
This includes everything but automatically paid benefits such as 
Medicare and payments to holders of federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The limits were enacted as part of the 1997 budget-balancing  
pact between Clinton and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Staying within that spending cap is proving a problem for  
Republicans as well. The GOP is struggling to determine how to live 
within them while accommodating bipartisan calls for extra spending 
for defense, schools and perhaps other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers and aides have acknowledged it is likely  
they will eventually have to exceed the spending limit. Publicly, 
however, many GOP lawmakers insist they are still hoping to live 
within that spending cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to keep the caps as they are,'' Senate Minority  
Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., told reporters Tuesday. ``It would be a 
mistake to come out and say, 'Let's spend more money.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In its study, CBO was more optimistic than the White House when  
it came to predicting the size of federal surpluses over the next 
decade without any tax or spending changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for 2009, CBO envisions a bigger surplus than Clinton did  
for every year, a total of nearly $200 billion more than him over 
the decade. For the next five years alone, CBO sees surpluses 
totaling $953 billion, some $125 billion more than the White House 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Without any action, CBO envisions a 1999 surplus of $111  
billion, growing to $133 billion next year and hitting $383 billion 
by 2009. The White House projected a $79 billion surplus this year, 
$117 billion next year and $393 billion in 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget would leave the 2000 surplus at $113 billion  
without his Social Security plan, and $80 billion with it, CBO 
said.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods, Caddie Appear on Outs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan could be the next casualty in  
the maturation of Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowan wasn't on the bag when Woods won three weeks ago in the  
Buick Invitational, and Woods raised eyebrows again last week when 
he used an old high school friend, Bryon Bell, in the $5 million 
Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said he only wanted to help Bell pay for medical school,  
but those inside the Woods camp admit there are problems with 
Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there friction? Yes,'' Butch Harmon said during the  
Doral-Ryder Open. ``They have some issues to work out. But it's 
nothing more than what goes on with players and caddies all the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harmon declined to describe the source of the friction, but Golf  
World magazine quotes an unidentified source as saying, ``Tiger 
just got tired of Fluff's act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods did not exactly give a ringing endorsement of Cowan at La  
Costa. Asked whether Cowan would caddie for him at Augusta, Woods 
said, ``I don't know. Probably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowan was a perfect fit when he left Peter Jacobsen for Woods in  
1996. He gave Woods tour experience that a 20-year-old lacked, knew 
all of the courses and was a steadying influence. 
</P>
<P>
	But Woods has been branching out on his own lately, as evidenced  
by his firing of agent Hughes Norton. Asked what primary asset he 
needs from a caddie now, Harmon said trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowan may have breached that by detailing his financial contract  
with Woods in an interview with Golf Digest. And one veteran caddie 
verified to Golf World reports of verbal confrontation between 
Woods and Cowan during the Nissan Open, the last time Cowan was on 
the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'll tell you something else,'' the caddie, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, told Golf World. ``Tiger did his own 
yardage book at L.A., and when that happens it's a bad sign for the 
caddie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether a breakup is imminent might not be known until Woods  
plays again in the Bay Hill Invitational in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RANKINGS RESPONSE:* PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem does not  
buy into the eight problems and solutions with the world rankings 
that were outlined by Dean Knuth, who created the USGA's slope and 
course rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Knuth said the current system did not  
respond quickly enough to current level of play, points were not 
evenly distributed, Japanese and Australasian tours were getting 
too many points and the European tour wasn't getting enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Knuth noted that the rankings were particularly out of sync at  
the bottom -- critical in determining which players get in the $5 
million Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was interesting,'' Finchem said. ``But the upshot of all  
the suggestions was a net effect of four players, and three came 
from one suggestion -- the Australasian and Japanese tours getting 
half points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finchem also dismissed the proposal that Europe get equal points  
in strength of field because of its performance in the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means nothing to me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Finchem doesn't mind a healthy debate on the rankings,  
and he's been getting an earful since they began to matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been studying the ranking system for three years,'' he  
said. ``We have eight or nine changes that are under intense 
scrutiny at any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RYDER CUP REVIEW:* The Match Play Championship could have gone  
a long way toward shaping the Ryder Cup team for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Faldo, who wants to make his 12th straight team without  
having to be a captain's pick, pinpointed Match Play as his chance 
to move up the points list because of the money at stake -- $50,000 
for getting to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Faldo earned the minimum $25,000 by getting trounced in  
the first round by Tiger Woods, and he only moved from 36th to 
32nd. 
</P>
<P>
	The way he played, does European captain Mark James even want  
him? 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of our top players have turned 40, and it may be time  
for some of them to miss a Ryder Cup,'' James said. ``But we have a 
lot of good young players coming through, and they are very 
different from the young players emerging 15 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those young players to watch is Patrik Sjoland, who was  
headed toward the quarterfinals when John Huston won four of the 
last five holes to beat him 1-up. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FUTURES SPONSOR:* Less than two months after the Futures Tour  
signed on as the official developmental tour of the LPGA, it has a 
national sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour announced a three-year agreement with SBC  
Communications Inc., effective immediately. It's the first time 
since its inception that the Futures has had a major international 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This landmark agreement illustrates the increased  
marketability of women's golf,'' said Zayra Calderon, chief 
executive officer of what is now called the SBC Futures Tour. ``It 
will clearly spark additional interest in women's golf with the 
public and corporate sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SBC Futures Tour has a 19-tournament schedule with a total  
purse of $1 million, although the prize money will increase the 
next two years because of the agreement. Also, SBC will sponsor two 
events and the player of the year award. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with the LPGA, the top three money-winners on  
the Futures Tour will be exempt on the LPGA Tour, and Nos. 4-10 
will gain entry to the finals of Q-school. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Nick Faldo looked uncomfortable on the driving range  
at Doral, not just because of his swing. Right next to him was 
David Frost, working under the watchful eye of David Leadbetter, 
Faldo's former swing doctor. ... By winning the Match Play 
Championship, Jeff Maggert move up to No. 15 in the world rankings, 
still one spot below Jumbo Ozaki. Nick Faldo, who lost his points 
from winning the Nissan Open two years ago, is now No. 86. ... 
Orchards Golf Club in suburban Detroit will have the 2002 U.S. 
Public Links Championship. ... Arnold Palmer will design a new TPC 
at River's Bend in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* After winning the Australian Masters with a  
26-under 262, Karrie Webb's scoring average is 68.20, a full stroke 
better than anyone else on the LPGA. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD:* ``Just because this is the first $5 million purse  
I've played in doesn't mean I can't play for trophies, too.'' -- 
Andrew Magee, runnerup in the Match Play Championship, on his 
desire to make the Ryder Cup team.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Helton Making a Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- He has talent, wealth and every reason to  
brag, but Todd Helton cannot bring himself to utter words of 
self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Helton rests his chin on the top of his bat and speaks  
in the humble tone of a man who has something to prove rather than 
one who represents the future of the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely not what you'd call a star by any means,''  
Helton said before signing a four-year, $12 million contract 
Tuesday. ``I don't like to talk about it. It's kind of awkward for 
me. I don't want to be put into the spotlight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helton, 25, emerged from the shadows last season by hitting .315  
with 25 homers and 97 RBIs. He led all rookies in the triple crown 
categories and finished second to Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood 
in the NL rookie of the year voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood finished nine points ahead of Helton in the closest vote in  
16 years. While the residents in Helton's hometown of Knoxville, 
Tenn., absorbed another perceived snub -- Tennessee quarterback 
Peyton Manning finished second in the 1997 Heisman Trophy voting -- 
Helton moved on quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was I disappointed? Yeah. For about 15 seconds,'' he said.  
``Did I think about it again? No. I just got sick of hearing people 
talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was going to win it, I didn't want to win it for myself.  
I wanted to win it for the Rockies because they've never had 
anybody win it. It would have been a good honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing the talent in front of them, the Rockies approached  
Helton before spring training and asked if he would be willing to 
think about signing a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sort of blew me away,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	While genuinely flattered by Colorado's interest, Helton was  
clearly uncomfortable talking about becoming a millionaire as the 
negotiations played out during the first two weeks of spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton and the Rockies eventually agreed on a four-year deal  
that will pay him $750,000 in 1999, $1.3 million in 2000, $4.95 
million in 2001 and $5 million in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I outplay my contract,'' Helton said when asked if he  
feared the contract would become paltry in the age of exorbitant 
salaries. ``That will mean the Rockies saved money and I'm playing 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The road to a six-figure contract unfolded slowly for Helton, a  
former first-round draft pick who was a two-sport star at 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with the pressure of replacing two-time All-Star Andres  
Galarraga, Helton floundered in his first month in the majors, 
hitting .259 with no homers and 12 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no normal reason a kid with his talent should go six  
weeks without falling into a home run,'' Rockies hitting coach 
Clint Hurdle said. ``It was just classic overtrying and not staying 
with his strengths and doing what he's capable of doing. Once he 
did that, he took off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helton hit his first homer of the season on May 5 and slowly  
proved he could handle left-handed pitchers. He was tireless in the 
batting cage and diligently worked to improve his defense at first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very appreciative young man for what's happened, and I  
think he's also one of those guys that found out that it's not 
going to be easy,'' Rockies manager Jim Leyland said, ``but he 
knows he can compete up here and he knows he can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced Helton was ready to play everyday, the Rockies traded  
utility player Greg Colbrunn to the Atlanta Braves on July 30, 
leaving Helton to sink or swim in August and September. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton responded by hitting .363 with eight homers and 41 RBIs  
over the final two months, giving voters something to think about 
as they pondered their choices for rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Helton finished second, he got a boost when Tennessee won  
college football's national championship in January. Throw in a new 
contract and life is good for one of baseball's richest second-year 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the big leagues,'' Helton said. ``They have to be going  
pretty well if I'm playing in the big leagues.''

<HEADLINE> USOC Plans Changes After Salt Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spared the brunt of an elite ethics report on  
the Salt Lake bribery case, the U.S. Olympic Committee is preparing 
changes to assure such scandals don't recur. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricter rules for American cities bidding for the Olympics and  
tighter reins on USOC programs could be among the items discussed 
by committee president Bill Hybl at a Washington news conference 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, the Senate Commerce Committee  
scheduled a hearing for April 14 on the ``scandals plaguing the 
Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican on the committee and the  
author of the federal law governing the Olympics in the United 
States, is considering legislation that would strip the 
International Olympic Committee of its tax-exempt status, limit tax 
deductions for IOC sponsorship and move control of billion-dollar 
U.S. television rights fees from the IOC to the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl was scheduled to discuss possible changes with the USOC  
executive committee in a conference call Tuesday night, and it was 
uncertain what specific programs he might announce. 
</P>
<P>
	But sources familiar with the committee, speaking on the  
condition he not be identified, said Hybl will recommend 
``far-reaching'' reforms that would ``really clamp down'' on the 
type of actions that led to the million-dollar vote-buying scheme 
in Salt Lake's victorious quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	More open meetings, internal policy changes on bid-city  
policies, tighter oversight of foreign athlete training programs 
and more athlete involvement in USOC decisions were among the 
topics that Hybl might include in his program, according to the 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the changes could be accomplished by executive order but  
others could require changes to the USOC Constitution, which could 
not be done until an October board meeting, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC board meetings already are open, and committee staff and  
officials must abide by an 11-page ethics code instituted at the 
start of Hybl's term in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl also will issue the USOC's response to the ethics committee  
report on Salt Lake presented Monday by former Senate Majority 
Leader George Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	That report said the Salt Lake scandal grew from a ``culture of  
improper gift giving'' in the Olympic community. While it 
criticized the USOC and Salt Lake Olympic officials, it saved its 
harshest words for the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the conduct ``tolerated by the IOC is potentially  
illegal and inevitably corruptive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC should no sooner tolerate improper gifts by candidate  
cities to its members than it would tolerate such gifts by athletes 
to judges,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of the USOC focused on the case of Alfredo La Mont,  
who resigned as the committee's international relations director in 
January after revealing he had worked as a consultant for Salt Lake 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also the USOC should open an independent office to  
oversee American bid committees; bar bid and candidate cities from 
international assistance programs and strictly follow guidelines 
for USOC-run programs; and strengthen guidelines and contracts for 
U.S. cities seeking the games.

<HEADLINE> Southern Miss, Coach Parting Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) -- Kay James, who led Southern  
Mississippi to 403 victories and eight NCAA tournament appearances, 
will not return for a 23rd season as the Lady Eagles coach. 
</P>
<P>
	James told WDAM-TV of Hattiesburg on Tuesday that Southern Miss  
officials reneged on an offer to extend her coaching contract 
another season. She said she learned that during a talk with 
outgoing athletic director Bill McLellan. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach, who said she had been offered a one-year extension  
last week, went to McLellan's office Monday to tell him that she 
would like to come back for at least another season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Mac told me they had decided differently and decided that  
they need to go another route,'' James told the Hattiesburg 
television station. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous calls placed to James' home telephone in Hattiesburg on  
Tuesday night were met with busy signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Miss finished 11-17 this season, losing 77-73 to  
Louisville in the second round of the Conference USA tournament on 
Saturday after beating South Florida 89-76 in the C-USA opener 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	McLellan, the Southern Miss athletic director since 1986 who is  
retiring at the end of June, had already left for Birmingham, Ala., 
site of this week's Conference USA men's basketball tournament, and 
was not available for comment Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Miss won at least 20 games 10 times under James, who  
had a 403-224 record (.643 winning percent) with the Lady Eagles. 
Before that, James was 85-20 in five seasons at Berry College in 
Georgia, which won the AIAW small college national championship in 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Eagles had seven 20-win seasons between 1988-96,  
winning at least 26 games three times during that eight-year span. 
In 1993-94, Southern Miss went 26-5 and advanced to the NCAA round 
of 16. 
</P>
<P>
	But since a 22-8 record and another NCAA tournament appearance  
in 1996, Southern Miss has had a combined record of 38-44. 
</P>
<P>
	James, who is two years shy of being eligible for full  
retirement as a state employee in Mississippi, has been offered a 
teaching position at Southern Miss. She said she is still 
considering that offer.

<HEADLINE> Panel Discusses DNA Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A national commission of legal, scientific and  
medical experts is studying the possibility of tracking criminals 
by taking DNA samples from everyone who is arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence, during a  
two-day meeting here, also tackled privacy and police-harassment 
conflicts that could arise if authorities created a database of the 
genetic information. 
</P>
<P>
	All states are permitted to take DNA from convicted sex  
offenders, murderers and child molesters, but experts said a lack 
of financing means 450,000 samples haven't been analyzed or added 
to the FBI's national database. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking care of the backlog is the concern before we even reach  
the civil-liberties issues,'' said defense lawyer Barry Scheck. 
``To do all this costs a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Panel members estimate it would cost at least $22 million just  
to analyze the current backlog in the FBI database of 40,000 
profiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheck, a forensics expert, also echoed the concerns of many  
civil libertarians when he said mass DNA testing has the potential 
to discriminate against some people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Justice has taken no position on the subject.  
Officials in New York, Louisiana and North Carolina have made 
legislative proposals to permit such testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will convene in other cities over the next five months  
in response to Attorney General Janet Reno's request to study the 
issue.

<HEADLINE> Salt-N-Pepa To Launch Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Salt-N-Pepa plan to spice things up on the  
road. 
</P>
<P>
	The rap trio announced plans for their first North American tour  
in four years on Monday. The 40-city ``Greatest Hits'' tour is 
scheduled to kick off next week in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't toured in a while, so we're enormously excited  
about being out there with our people because even when we take 
some time off, our fans have always been incredibly loyal,'' said 
Cheryl ``Salt'' James. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1997 release of their last album ``Brand New,'' Sandi  
``Pepa'' Denton has had her second child, while James and Dee Dee 
``Spinderella'' Roper have concentrated on spa/salons they opened 
in the New York City area. 
</P>
<P>
	James says the ladies won't be rusty, despite the down time:  
``We might all be moms, but we still know how to strut our stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Drafts New Salt Lake Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- An ad hoc committee has come up with draft  
policies intended to make the Salt Lake Organizing Committee more 
open to public scrutiny, accountable and free of conflicts of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee chairman Nolan Karras, the governor's stand-in on the  
SLOC management committee, called the first drafts ``exposure 
documents'' that will be published for public and the SLOC board 
comment. They were discussed at a meeting late Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt last month charged the committee with devising  
nuts and bolts policies to guide a more open and ethical Olympics 
organization in the wake of the Olympic scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Christensen, a Salt Lake City council member appointed to  
the SLOC board of trustees during its Feb. 11 reorganization, 
pressed repeatedly for more openness in the policies suggested by 
the SLOC lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This community really owns the games,'' Christensen said.  
``Our job is to craft fair, open and understandable policies. The 
more open we can be, the better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the policies the committee endorsed was that the SLOC post  
its meeting minutes, agendas and other material on its Internet Web 
site. And Christensen pressed for the postings to last for 90 days 
rather than the SLOC staff's proposed 15-day limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Katz, a lawyer for the SLOC, conceded that the committee  
in the past did not comply with its own open records policy. The 
staff grew so fast, ``People didn't even know the policy existed,'' 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Kelly Flint warned the ad hoc group away from requiring  
disclosure of sponsor and licensee agreements or even the names and 
bid amounts of those vying for the SLOC contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Such openness would have a chilling effect, he said, because  
sponsors don't want other customers to know what discounts they 
were willing to give to the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Flint also urged the committee to let anonymous donors remain  
anonymous, but Christensen noted that even then, there should be a 
presumption that the donor may want something from the SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK until they start leaning on someone for something,''  
he said. ``Openness is the answer for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee approved a list of 15 types of documents that  
anyone in the public could readily get, but any deeper research 
would cost $25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Flint and Katz said the SLOC will need to hire at least one more  
staffer to do records research and then delete confidential 
information before letting documents out. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen, who at first didn't like the idea of a $25 per hour  
fee, succeeded in persuading his colleagues to set up an appeals 
process for times when the staffer decides a document should be 
kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't have a records czar making the final decision,''  
Christensen said. ``I just don't think the records keeper should be 
the final arbiter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also successfully argued that the SLOC should tell those  
seeking documents whether the search will take longer than 30 days. 
The staff had suggested 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee discussed conflicts of interest at length, and  
settled on the idea that trustees or management committee members 
should resign if they or family members have a direct economic 
interest in a company doing business with the SLOC or 5 percent or 
more ownership in a company doing business with the organizing 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also discussed what financial entanglements trustees,  
management committee members and the SLOC employees should be 
required to disclose each year, but left it to staff to write the 
specific rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee endorsed a policy requiring board of trustee and  
management committee members to attend 75 percent of all meetings 
within any 12-month span, and deleted an 
``out-of-town-on-business'' excuse for not attending. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Pace, a longtime opponent of the Olympics, attended the  
meeting and was dubious that the policies will pry the SLOC open. 
``This is a meeting about closing records,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karras described the process as wrenching. ``It's not an easy  
decision to cut some of these babies in half,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Wallaby Wanders in Tennessee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- The first report to police about the  
``kangaroo'' came Sunday from a man who said he had waited 30 
minutes before calling ``just to be sure I was sober.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, he had spotted a wallaby, a gray, 3-foot-tall animal  
that looks like a kangaroo. It escaped from an exotic-animal farm 
owned by Herbert Fritch and has had some residents in this 
Nashville suburb rubbing their eyes in disbelief as they watch it 
hop through their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
	It was spotted again Monday, and an officer was sent to look for  
it but had no luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallabies originate in Australia and like fruit, vegetables and  
bread. They can be litterbox-trained and kept indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Owning a wallaby in Brentwood is legal, but if it gets loose the  
owner can get in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Fritch also owns four giraffes, two tapirs, two buffalos and  
some small monkeys.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Life in Wife's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ADA, Okla. (AP) -- A man who beat and stomped his wife to death  
while his children hid in a bedroom, listening to their mother's 
screams, was sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Leslie ``Bear'' Tyson, 40, pleaded guilty Monday to  
murder in the Aug. 24 slaying of Deanna Tyson, 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's daughters, ages 10, 11 and 15, had said they wanted  
their father put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we'd get the death penalty from a jury, but at the  
cost of having to put the children on to testify against him,'' 
prosecutor Chris Ross said. ``And they're already dealing with 
hearing and seeing their mother being murdered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One daughter testified that Tyson put on brass knuckles and  
steel-toed boots before beating and stomping their mother almost 
all night. The children hid in a bedroom until the following 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson told investigators he had used methamphetamine and didn't  
remember killing his wife.

<HEADLINE> Spelling's 'Melrose Place' Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Goodbye was too hard to say for Aaron  
Spelling. 
</P>
<P>
	After his steamy Fox TV drama ``Melrose Place'' was canceled,  
the producer couldn't tell the actors and crew in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't go on the set this time. It's the first time I  
haven't gone on the set. I wrote everyone a little note,'' Spelling 
told the syndicated TV show ``Hard Copy'' in an interview for 
broadcast today. 
</P>
<P>
	Spelling has visited the set to tell stars of the such shows as  
``Charlie's Angels'' and ``Dynasty'' that the series was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I ever get used to it, if it's not emotional, I'll quit the  
business because that means you don't care,'' Spelling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the talk of television with its attractive cast and steamy  
plot twists, ``Melrose Place'' fell on hard times in the ratings. 
Its stars include Heather Locklear, Jamie Luner, Thomas Calabro and 
husband-and-wife actors Josie Bissett and Rob Estes.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Says US Planning Mass Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Texas congressman accused the Clinton  
administration of planning to grant amnesty to thousands of illegal 
immigrants without congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stop before you break the law,'' Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas,  
said Tuesday. ``Do not throw out 30 years of legal precedent for 
political gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith expressed objections to a plan that would grant illegal  
immigrants from Central America eligibility for amnesty under a 
blanket ``presumption of hardship,'' instead of requiring each 
immigrant to prove hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Congress passed a law granting amnesty to some  
Nicaraguans and Cubans who had been in the United States since Dec. 
1, 1995, and allowing them to apply for status as legal permanent 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, Guatemalans and Salvadorans who had been in the  
country for seven years would be considered for a suspension of 
deportation under less-stringent rules that existed before 1996 
immigration legislation. It was to be on a case-by-case basis 
requiring them to prove ``extreme hardship'' if they were returned 
to their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the proposal for a blanket presumption of hardship  
goes against the intent of the 1997 law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew full well how to give amnesty,'' Smith said. ``We gave  
it to certain Nicaraguans and Cubans who were our allies in the 
Cold War against communism. If we wanted to give it to other 
groups, we would have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service has not yet made a  
final decision on presumption of hardship, agency spokeswoman Maria 
Cardona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrant advocacy groups have lobbied in support of a rule  
presuming hardship, and a Clinton administration official said 
members of Congress also have submitted written comments that 
mostly favor the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	A Feb. 23 letter signed by seven senators, including Senate  
Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Sen. Connie Mack, 
R-Fla., told Attorney General Janet Reno that the presumption of 
hardship would ``foster administrative efficiency and be 
fundamentally fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, it would avoid imposing any further hardship on  
applicants, who waged a long legal battle over the issue. ``The 
experiences shared by this group as a class support a determination 
of extreme hardship,'' the letter to Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even before Hurricane Mitch, these countries were considered  
among the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. When Hurricane Mitch 
struck the region in November 1998, the little progress these 
countries had made in rebuilding their economies, infrastructures 
and communities after the end of the civil wars was substantially 
reversed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith said a blanket presumption would give as many as  
240,000-plus illegal aliens a benefit that Congress declined to 
give them in 1997. He and 28 other House members signed a letter to 
President Clinton asking him to reject the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House is shamelessly bowing to special interests and  
thumbing its nose at Congress, the American people and every legal 
alien who played by the rules and waited his or her turn to come to 
America,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, when someone received an unexpected benefit,  
amnesty in this case, they feel indebted to those who provided the 
benefit. The White House is looking at long-term political 
support.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Concentration Probe Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan coalition of nearly two dozen  
senators is pressing President Clinton to launch a full examination 
of concentration within agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``While thousands of farmers are being forced out of agriculture  
due to collapsed commodity prices, many of our nation's food 
processors are posting exceptional returns and record profits,'' 
the senators wrote in a letter sent Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition, led by Sens. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Chuck  
Hagel, R-Neb., asked the administration to complete a ``full-scale, 
detailed examination'' within six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agricultural commodity markets, particularly in livestock,  
have become tilted against the producer and are failing to provide 
effective competitive returns,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	America's farm sectors already were still reeling from last  
year's low prices when the Agriculture Department last week 
predicted another year of low prices and lagging exports, lowering 
U.S. farm export projections to $49 billion, compared with last 
year's $53.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that Congress have a clear picture regarding  
the impacts of the rapid increase in market concentration in 
agriculture and what steps may need to be taken,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration established an interagency panel last  
year to look at concentration, and several agencies within the 
Agriculture Department are conducting their own studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to address the changing structure of agriculture,''  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told a forum last week as he 
released the price and export projections. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem of concentration came to prominence in November when  
Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's No. 1 grain company, 
announced plans to buy the worldwide operations of second-ranked 
Continental Grain Co. The Justice Department is reviewing the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, both the House and Senate have held hearings. Some  
lawmakers have pressed for a meeting with Attorney General Janet 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	According to USDA figures, as of 1997, the four largest packing  
firms accounted for 80 percent of cattle slaughter, 54 percent of 
hog slaughter and 70 percent of sheep slaughter.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Announces White House Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, the pugnacious  
conservative whose insurgent campaigns hobbled Republican 
front-runners in 1992 and 1996, launched a third White House bid 
Tuesday with a pledge to fight ``a moral deficit that has become 
America's great enemy within.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suggesting that the Clinton administration has contributed to  
``a polluted and poisoned'' culture, Buchanan delivered a 
full-throated attack on the Democratic White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``This temple of our civilization has been desecrated, used to  
shake down corporate executives, to lie with abandon to the 
American people, a place to exploit women,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to stand against unfettered imports, freewheeling  
immigration, abortion, euthanasia, expanded judicial powers, a 
shrinking American sovereignty and, at times, his own party -- all 
familiar themes of a Buchanan candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he has a history of exceeding their predictions, many GOP  
strategists and conservative activists believe Buchanan's third 
race won't be charmed. Working against him this time: a swelling 
field of like-minded candidates, a greater demand for money and a 
relatively late start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Pat and agree with much of what he stands for, but I  
can't construct a scenario where he has a chance to win,'' said 
Paul Weyrich, a leading conservative intellectual from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's, like, ho-hum,'' said the Rev. Lou Sheldon, a  
conservative leader from California. ``He's failed twice and will a 
third time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan was hearing none of it.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need a new patriotism in America that puts country first, a  
new conservatism of the heart that puts people first, and a new set 
of priorities where our party stands for something higher and 
greater than the bottom line on a balance sheet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of at least 300 yelled, ``Go Pat, Go!''  
</P>
<P>
	``It is our calling to recapture the independence and lost  
sovereignty of our republic, to clean up all that pollutes our 
culture and to heal the soul of America. And, to that end, I 
declare my candidacy for president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Closing with his traditional battle cry, Buchanan grabbed the  
hand of his wife, Shelley, and shouted: ``As we say, mount up and 
ride to the sound of the guns!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat can win if Washington doesn't demonize him,'' said Tom  
Hamill of Braintree, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's third campaign began where his others peaked, in this  
first-in-the-nation primary state. He beat eventual nominee Bob 
Dole in the New Hampshire primary four years ago and put a scare 
into President Bush in 1992, finishing a close second. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, both times, Buchanan ran out of money and votes.  
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who took a leave of absence from CNN's ``Crossfire''  
to run, is trying to overtake the early GOP front-runners, Bush's 
son, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and Dole's wife, former Red Cross 
president Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his previous campaigns, when Buchanan was the early  
alternative to the GOP front-runner, he will compete this time 
against other conservative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Millionaire Steve Forbes, activist Gary Bauer and former Vice  
President Dan Quayle recruited several members of the 1996 Buchanan 
team before he even entered the race. Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire was the first candidate to formally enter the race. And 
former Education Secretary Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who will 
declare his candidacy next week, announced Tuesday that former Iowa 
Gov. Terry Branstad would be his national chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, borrowing from his days as President Nixon's  
speechwriter, has proven adept at stitching together sound bites 
that incite and entertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has not merely failed, it has ``soiled its  
place in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton trade policies are not simply wrong, they are a product  
of ``blind and craven appeasement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Clinton is not just a bad commander in chief, he's one of  
those ``aging '60s radicals who loathed the military then and do 
not love her now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Patrick Buchanan was born in Washington 60 years ago, the  
third of nine children. His accountant father made the Buchanan 
boys attack punching bags -- 300 swats a session -- to ready them for 
back ally scraps and the tough life promised by their Jesuit 
teachers. Buchanan has said he learned conservatism at the dinner 
table and soaked it up in a Catholic high school where priests 
emphasized, first and foremost, the ``salvation of your immortal 
soul, Buchanan.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Reports Mixed on Teaching Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal program for poor and other  
disadvantaged children has encouraged higher standards in schools 
and thus helped to increase learning, the Education Department says 
in a new report. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say the federal program is hindering state reform  
and have called for its overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first study of the $8 billion Title I program, the  
department concluded Monday that, by encouraging higher state 
standards, the program had closed some of the learning gaps between 
rich and poor children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have evidence of improving achievement in urban school  
districts enrolling significant numbers of poor and minority 
children,'' Education Secretary Richard Riley recently told a 
congressional panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was changed in 1994 to require states to apply high  
academic standards to schools and students participating in Title I 
programs. And schools with 50 percent poor students can use the 
money on all students, rather than providing extra help to a 
limited number of students. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a group of education scholars and state officials  
released a report last week contending that federal education 
programs, including Title I, which date back to the 1960s, have 
hindered significant school reform at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should consider a major overhaul of the federal role  
in K-12 education, '' said Chester E. Finn, Jr., an education 
official under President Reagan and president of the Thomas B. 
Fordham Foundation, which released the report. The group is not 
affiliated with Fordham University. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time for tweaking,'' said Finn, who urged  
Congress to consider fresh approaches as it prepares to renew the 
nation's major education laws this year. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Diane Ravitch, a former assistant secretary of  
education in the Bush administration, calls for an overhaul of 
Title I, turning it into a ``portable entitlement,'' meaning that 
federal money would follow poor children to the schools they 
choose. 
</P>
<P>
	Other critics, such as Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's  
superintendent of public instruction, said the federal programs 
were too restrictive for the states. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to stop insisting that our representatives in  
Washington figure out what to do about education,'' Keegan said. 
``We'll figure it out for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department's report says states that have followed  
the standards found in the federal program generally show increased 
achievement levels in high-poverty schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual states have made notable progress very quickly, Riley  
told Congress. For example, North Carolina more than doubled the 
percentage of its eighth-graders scoring at the proficient or 
advanced levels on a national math test, from 9 percent in 1990 to 
20 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, a research arm of the Education Department reported  
that 51 percent of the nation's instructional rooms in schools -- 
either classrooms, computer labs or school libraries -- are hooked 
up to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	That figure for 1998 was up from 27 percent in 1997, according  
to the National Center for Education Statistics. In 1994, just 3 
percent of such rooms had Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The share of schools that have Internet access somewhere in the  
school was 89 percent in 1998, up from 78 percent the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	High-poverty and smaller schools are as likely to have access to  
the Internet as larger and more affluent schools, Riley noted. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, while hailing the results, said the nation's  
schools need to spend more to train teachers to use the Internet in 
ways that help children learn. A recent report from the statistics 
agency found that only 20 percent of teachers surveyed last year 
said they feel very well-prepared to use modern technology in their 
schools.

<HEADLINE> GAO Reports Rail Shipper Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A process that shippers find expensive and  
burdensome keeps them from seeking federal recourse even when they 
believe railroads are charging too much, according to congressional 
auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the General Accounting Office, being released today  
at a Senate hearing, shows that large numbers of rail shippers feel 
they are systematically being overcharged by rail carriers who have 
monopolies in their region. But at the same time, a majority 
believe federal regulators don't provide accessible relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency in charge of fielding complaints about rates  
-- the Surface Transportation Board -- has a process that seems too 
complicated and unwieldy for many shippers to undertake, according 
to the report by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of providing rate relief is so expensive and so  
cumbersome that it is almost unworkable,'' says Sen. Byron Dorgan. 
D-N.D., one of the lawmakers who requested the report. ``When 
shippers are held captive by a monopoly, they don't have an 
effective way to complain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 75 percent of the 700 shippers surveyed by GAO  
auditors said they are paying unreasonable rates for rail service. 
And 70 percent said the time, complexity and costs in filing 
complaints with the STB are barriers that often preclude them from 
seeking relief. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the GAO said, shippers who file a complaint that a  
railroad is using its market dominance to overcharge must create a 
model for the STB, demonstrating how much an optimally efficient 
railroad should charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 72 percent of shippers told the GAO that constructing  
such a model is a difficult task, particularly for small 
businesses. ``The time and cost associated with the model's 
development may outweigh the compensation afforded the shipper 
should the board determine that the challenged rate was 
unreasonable,'' GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors tracked the 41 complaints filed with the STB since  
1990 and found that shippers spent about $500,000 to $3 million 
preparing each case. The process can also be timely -- with the STB 
taking anywhere from several months to, in one instance, 16 years 
to resolve a case. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was to be introduced today as an exhibit in a Senate  
subcommittee hearing on reauthorizing the Surface Transportation 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan said the GAO study will give the surface transportation  
and Merchant Marine subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee 
``a road map'' in determining what changes are needed at the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially in a period when you have so many railroad mergers,  
you either need effective regulation or a complaint process that is 
simple,'' Dorgan said. He stressed that extra costs are eventually 
passed down to farmers and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate survey, the GAO interviewed the nine major freight  
railroads. They expressed satisfaction with the rate review process 
and said no change in the process is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The board has implemented some measures to streamline its  
complaint process, the GAO said. For example, it eliminated product 
and geographic competition as criteria for determining market 
dominance by a railroad. It also has implemented guidelines to 
simplify complaints involving smaller dollar amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A second GAO report analyzing the rates shippers pay freight  
railroads is scheduled for release in April.

<HEADLINE> WTO Panel To Probe U.S. Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization launched an  
investigation Tuesday into the legality of a key U.S. trade law 
used to justify sanctions against countries accused of keeping out 
American products. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO panel has six months to complete its report. It will  
likely cause uproar if it finds that Washington's so-called 301 law 
breaches international standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union asked for the investigation after being  
threatened with more than $520 million in retaliatory tariffs as 
part of a long-running dispute with Washington over bananas. 
Washington says U.S. distributors like Chiquita Inc. have lost 
hundreds of millions of dollars in sales to European countries 
because of EU laws favoring banana imports from former colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States plans to formally seek WTO authorization for  
the tariffs at a meeting Wednesday. If they are imposed, they will 
hit European products ranging from cashmere sweaters to handbags to 
cheese, possibly pricing them out of the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said she was confident the  
panel would vindicate the 301 trade law. But she made clear her 
anger at the EU move. ``It's a case of sour grapes over bananas,'' 
Hayes told journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe and Japan have long complained about the U.S. trade law,  
which they say is one-sided and undermines the international 
trading system. ``It's something we feel strongly about,'' said EU 
trade ambassador Roderick Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the EU would persist with its case against U.S. trade  
law even if there was a satisfactory solution on bananas.

<HEADLINE> Study: Cleaning House Reduces Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Keeping a clean house can significantly reduce  
the amount of toxic lead that children absorb into their blood, 
according to a study published this month in Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers followed 99 urban children with high levels of lead  
in their blood for nine to 15 months after dividing their families 
into two groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In one group, the children's caretakers received education and  
free housecleaning to reduce lead levels in their homes; in the 
other, caretakers received education only. 
</P>
<P>
	The cleaning removed dust containing lead particles, presumably  
from peeling paint, which was found in most of the children's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the homes cleaned, two workers visited an average of every  
eight to 13 days and vacuumed floors and carpets with a 
high-efficiency vacuum cleaner. They also wet-wiped or mopped 
walls, horizontal surfaces and uncarpeted floors with a detergent 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the study, lead levels among the 46 children whose  
homes had been cleaned fell an average of 17 percent. Children 
whose homes had been cleaned the most -- 20 or more times -- averaged 
a 34 percent blood-lead reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood-lead levels among the other children did not change  
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regular home cleaning, accompanied by maternal education, is a  
safe and partially effective intervention that should be 
recommended for the large majority of lead-exposed children for 
whom, unfortunately, removal to lead-safe housing is not an 
option,'' said the researchers, led by Dr. George Rhoads of the 
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood 
Johnson Medical School and Rutgers University.

<HEADLINE> IOC Exec Contests Mitchell Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A senior IOC official Tuesday disputed a U.S.  
ethics panel's contention that the international committee fostered 
a ``culture of improper gift giving'' that led to corruption in the 
Olympic bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee panel, headed by former Senate  
Majority Leader George Mitchell, leveled most of the blame for the 
Salt Lake City vote-buying scandal on the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kevan Gosper, an IOC executive board member from Australia,  
said Mitchell's report failed to acknowledge that since 1987 the 
committee has had rules on gifts, travel and other items related to 
the bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite unacceptable to say that the IOC has created an  
environment which has enabled gift giving and rewards to run out of 
control,'' Gosper said in a telephone interview from Melbourne. ``I 
take strong objection to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its report issued Monday, the panel said the conduct  
``tolerated by the IOC is potentially illegal and inevitably 
corruptive.'' It said leaders turned a blind eye to corruption that 
was ``flourishing'' even as the Olympics grew into a billion-dollar 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the International Olympic Committee created the  
atmosphere responsible for the scandal over cash payments and other 
improper inducements stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the IOC set ``very specific'' limits for bid cities,  
and ``constantly refined'' the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``An organization like ours relies on candidate cities and IOC  
members to comply with those rules,'' he said. ``If they had 
complied, we wouldn't have had the problems we did in Salt Lake 
City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper conceded, however, that IOC leaders should have done more  
to enforce the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't sufficiently pursued the compliance in terms of IOC  
members and the candidate cities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper welcomed Mitchell's recommended reforms, which include  
opening the IOC's books to annual public audits and having the bulk 
of IOC members elected to limited terms by other sports bodies. The 
IOC traditionally picks its own members to virtual life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept that (Mitchell) has a case for increased transparency  
and a number of reforms,'' Gosper said. ``We should make some 
structural changes to strengthen our accountability and our 
transparency. We continue to work on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Gosper said, the IOC was planning to set up an  
ethics committee and introduce a code of conduct for its members at 
a special general assembly on March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper warned that a radical overhaul of the IOC cannot take  
place in one sitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have to understand we are not a bureaucracy with bars  
on our shoulders and rings around our sleeves that can drive this 
overnight,'' he said. ``It's a much more complex process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper expressed concern the IOC was not being credited for its  
achievements, particularly in delivering successful Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going through a difficult period at the moment,'' he  
said. ``But we are not out of business. It is our job to recover 
our position sensibly and quietly with some sensible reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the focus has been on a few people who acted improperly,  
the IOC does comprise very responsible people. It has been pretty 
hard to get that message through the static of the last few 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he expected the executive board to convene by  
conference call this week to deal with remaining cases of members 
implicated in the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was especially important to exonerate any members  
found innocent of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be through the process by Friday,'' Gosper said.  
``We need to take those names who have mentioned out of limbo and 
clear them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper predicted that fellow Australian IOC member Phil Coles,  
accused of accepting excessive hospitality during several visits to 
Salt Lake City, would be exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he will be cleared of improper conduct,'' he said.  
``My analysis of all the information is he didn't seriously breach 
the (bidding) guidelines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper said Coles needs to account publicly for his  
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be wise for him to sit down and quietly explain his  
events to the press and be as open and transparent as possible,'' 
Gosper said. ``I'm sure he will do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, nine IOC members have either resigned or been ousted in  
the Salt Lake affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The special IOC inquiry commission, headed by vice president  
Dick Pound, met in Switzerland over the weekend to review the 
remaining cases. The panel will make recommendations to the 
executive board for action. 
</P>
<P>
	Three cases are still pending from the initial phase of Pound's  
inquiry and 10 new names were implicated last month in a report by 
the Salt Lake ethics board. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said Monday the panel was looking at an additional six  
members whose names were included in the board's working papers. 
That brings the total number of members implicated to 30, more than 
one-fourth of the total membership.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Cops Patrol Growing Crops / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- Ventura County Sheriff's Detectives Mike  
Horne and Eric Nelson often find themselves crouched deep in the 
area's orchards at night, hoping to catch their criminals 
red-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are known as ``avocado cops'' at their station house.  
Their mission: to catch rustlers snatching hundreds of thousands of 
dollars worth of fruit from trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take it seriously. We're dedicated to it. When a guy comes  
up to us and says, 'I just lost half of my income,' that's 
serious,'' said Horne, one-half of the sheriff's Agricultural 
Crimes Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The coastal county, 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles, is rich  
in agriculture. In addition to avocados, citrus, row crops and sod 
are also grown. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, growers lost an estimated $609,000 to thieves stealing  
various kinds of crops, farm and irrigation equipment and 
chemicals. Horne and Nelson brought that down to $195,000 last 
year, the first year the team was on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The December cold snap contributed to a low avocado crop, and  
the higher prices will be a great motivator for thieves, Horne 
said. The avocado season has just begun. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a restaurant owner that use a lot of guacamole, you  
can save lots of money buying stolen fruit -- no questions asked,'' 
Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracking down perpetrators is difficult.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are never any witnesses because it all happens in such  
remote areas,'' Horne said. ``And I've yet been able to get a 
fingerprint off an avocado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson has a degree in agricultural business and Horne was a  
nine-year narcotics detective. As many as 75 percent of the thefts 
are motivated by drug use, Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you, it's not Mom coming by who wants some avocados  
to make guacamole dip for dinner,'' Horne said. ``The biggest part 
of it is people doing this to supply their addiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The detectives follow footprints and tire tracks and talk to any  
witnesses they can find. They are also experimenting with ways to 
use high-tech equipment to catch the crooks among the crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've even called the FBI to find out how I can put a tracking  
device in an avocado,'' Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug users usually sell their purloined fruit to local  
markets and restaurants, but in some cases the user swaps avocados 
or stolen farm equipment directly for drugs, Sheriff Bob Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a completely different kind of crime than people  
think,'' Brooks said. ``We are finding more and more ties to either 
organized crime rings or narcotics crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horne and Nelson spent a few nights in December hiding in a  
Santa Paula avocado orchard. The thief never came. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, weeks later, a grower reported seeing a man and woman  
pushing a shopping cart brimming with avocados, and the avocado 
cops jumped on the call. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it turns out, they were both homeless and trying to support  
their heroin addiction. They sold the avocados to pay for drugs,'' 
Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, convicted on two counts of grand theft and one count  
of petty theft, was sentenced to 240 days in jail. Her boyfriend 
got 16 months in prison on the same charges, the stiffer sentence 
due in large part to his criminal record.

<HEADLINE> Man Awarded $1.2M in Abuse Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A jury awarded $1.2 million to a man who  
claimed he repressed all memory of being molested by his priest 
until he was chewed out by his boss almost 30 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Bachmann, 47, claimed that the now-retired Rev. James  
Gummersbach sodomized him in the basement of a church in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was so traumatized that he wiped it from his mind  
until 1992, when the reprimand from his boss brought the memories 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Bachmann settled his lawsuit against Gummersbach for  
an undisclosed amount but pressed on with his case against the St. 
Louis Archdiocese for allegedly failing to supervise the priest. 
</P>
<P>
	Archdiocese lawyers said they will appeal Monday's verdict. They  
disputed Bachmann's ``recovered memory'' and contended he never 
forgot the alleged incidents, and so his legal claim expired under 
the five-year statute of limitations.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Eatery Loads Up on Pork </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was almost like taking a vegetarian to a  
steakhouse. Missouri Rep. Ike Skelton took a hog farmer from home 
to a pork-free restaurant: the dining room at the U.S. House. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmer, Phil Howerton of Chilhowee, Mo., opened his lunch  
menu to find no bacon, no ham, no tenderloin. It was late last 
year, when the price of a pound of pork had sunk from $4.55 the 
previous year to 80 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I was with a congressman, I thought, well, this  
would be a nice joke,'' Howerton said. ``I thought it would be cute 
to say something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton took him seriously, calling over a manager to complain  
and following up with a couple of phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The result? The chef went hog wild.  
</P>
<P>
	``The famous Capitol Bean Soup, prepared with ham hocks, will of  
course remain the signature soup,'' James Rodgers, the House's food 
services director, wrote Skelton in a Feb. 10 letter. ``A shredded 
barbecue pork sandwich, a popular special in the past, is now on 
the daily menu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, there's now bacon in the Cobb Salad and a bacon, lettuce  
and tomato sandwich, along with chef's specials featuring pork 
chops, roasted pork loin and other pork selections. And for 
breakfast, the restaurant serves pork sausage links, patties and 
bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, they're featuring pork in a big way,''  
said Skelton, a 12-term Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a continuing battle for hog farmers, who in the past year  
have convinced about 40 percent of the nation's top 200 restaurant 
chains to add pork to their menus, according to the National Pork 
Producers Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri ranks seventh in pork production nationwide. And as in  
other states, Missouri's farmers are losing money on every hog they 
sell. ``Prices have gone up a little bit, but they're still not to 
break-even levels,'' said Howerton, an officer of the Missouri Pork 
Producers Association.

<HEADLINE> Baker Finally Shows All-Star Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Vin Baker, stuck in the biggest slump  
of his career, sat in his hotel room and kept telling himself he 
was ready to break out. A few hours later, he was getting hugged as 
a hero by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	The sense of relief was clear on the face of Baker, a four-time  
all-star whose poor shooting had left him in tears last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was definitely my best game of the year,'' Baker said  
after going 15-for-19 from the field and scoring 31 points in the 
Seattle SuperSonics' 105-102 victory Monday night over the 
Sacramento Kings. ``This was important to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also was important to the Sonics, who have been stumbling  
recently after starting the season with six straight victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been coming along,'' Seattle coach Paul Westphal said.  
``It was inevitable he was going to have a game like this in which 
he broke out, and we needed every point of his tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, who has averaged 18.5 points per game in a career that  
included four seasons in Milwaukee and last year in Seattle, was 
averaging just 11.3 points a game this season heading into the 
contest against the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat alone in his hotel room Monday afternoon and tried to  
bolster his confidence by saying, ``This has got to be the game for 
me -- quit thinking about it and just go out and play.'' Then he did 
just that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings focused on point guard Gary Payton, who drew attention  
inside by trying to post up. That gave Payton the chance to swing 
the ball outside to Baker, a 6-foot-11 forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was obvious they weren't going to rotate to me. After a  
while you would think they might adjust, but they didn't,'' Baker 
said. ``I've prayed and worked more than anybody in the league. I'm 
just glad it is starting to pay off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Baker just has to hope that carries over to the foul line,  
where he continues to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	A 63 percent career shooter at the line, he began the season  
0-for-18 on free throws -- including an air ball that landed a foot 
short of the basket -- and is still just 7-for-42 (17 percent) after 
going 1-for-5 against the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	For Westphal and the Sonics, having more production from Baker  
is crucial on a team that has relied much too heavily on Payton for 
its offensive spark this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Westphal was particularly happy that Baker, who also had nine  
rebounds, three assists and three steals in 38 minutes against 
Sacramento, was able to keep up the offensive surge despite playing 
the last few minutes with five fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball was going in to him (Baker) and that got him  
confidence and he was feeling comfortable the whole night,'' 
Westphal said. ``We just thought we'd ride him until he fouled out, 
and he did a great job on both ends, hit some huge shots for us.''

	Bush Forms Presidential Committee  
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, eldest son of  
the former president, announced today he will form a presidential 
exploratory committee to raise money and measure support for a 
White House bid of his own in 2000. Bush, 52, stopped short of 
formally entering the presidential race. But he has begun 
assembling a fund-raising team and has been consulting policy 
advisers for weeks. In New Hampshire, Pat Buchanan, the 
conservative whose insurgent campaigns hobbled Republican 
front-runners in 1992 and 1996, today announced a third White House 
bid.

	Independent Counsels May Be Gone  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration withdrew its  
support for the independent counsel law today, saying the 
Watergate-inspired investigations statute ``has failed in its goal 
of removing politics from the process.'' Congress should let the 
law expire on June 30, officials said. Less than three weeks after 
the Senate acquitted President Clinton of perjury and obstruction 
of justice impeachment charges that were approved by the House on 
the recommendation of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, Deputy 
Attorney General Eric Holder's remarks underscored the bipartisan 
crumbling of support for the act. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Anti-Carjacking Law Upheld  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court preserved the broad sweep of  
a federal anti-carjacking law today, rejecting a legal challenge 
that would have limited it to cases in which robbers intend to hurt 
their victims no matter what. The court, by a 7-2 vote, ruled that 
the law also covers crimes committed with the ``conditional 
intent'' of harming victims who refuse to comply with the robbers' 
demands. As amended by Congress in 1994, the law makes it a crime 
to take a motor vehicle by force ``with the intent to cause death 
or serious bodily harm.''

	Eight Tourists Killed in Uganda

	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Eight tourists were killed and six others  
were rescued after being kidnapped by Rwandan rebels. Ugandan 
police said the deaths came in a shootout, but an American survivor 
said that the rebels brutally hacked some victims to death with 
machetes. A U.S. State Department spokesman said two Americans were 
murdered as they were being marched away by their captors. The 
remaining six victims were killed the same way, he said. The 
tourists were abducted by the Rwandan rebels at campgrounds on the 
edge of Bwindi National Park.

Police earlier said he belonged to an independence movement. The 
Airbus A-320, coming from Marseille in southern France, had been 
due to land at Orly airport south of Paris. But the hijacker 
insisted it head to Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport, north of the

Clinton and the whole nation in an ABC-TV interview. The former 
White House intern whose sexual encounters with President Clinton 
led to his impeachment spoke to Barbara Walters for an interview to

Linda Tripp, who secretly taped her conversations with Ms. 
Lewinsky. ``I would hate to be her,'' Ms. Lewinsky said.

carjacking conviction of a New York man who says he never intended 
to seriously hurt the people whose cars he stole at gunpoint. The 
justices ruled that a federal anti-carjacking law covers crimes 
with ``conditional intent'' to harm victims who refuse to comply 
with the robber's demands. Prosecutors said Francois Holloway's 
plan was steal cars for their parts, but said he would have used 
the gun if victims had given him a ``hard time.''

the flow of oil through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline indefinitely. 
Hussein al-Fattal, head of operations for Iraq's Northern Oil 
Company, said it will take a ``long time'' to resume pumping. He 
denied that the areas hit had military purposes. Al-Fattal 
estimated the damage has cost Iraq at least $2.5 million. Officials 
have said 56 percent of Iraq's oil exports flow through the

too high an altitude, and failed to descend despite being reminded

of 44 midshipmen each year have broken ``an agreement to serve'' 
that obligates them to repay the cost of their education if they

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Gets Her Say in Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky is finally getting her say:  
about President Clinton (``a very sensual man''), Linda Tripp (``I 
pity her'') and her regret for hurting Hillary and Chelsea Clinton 
(``I am very sorry''). 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-hour interview to be televised Wednesday night, the  
woman whose trysts with the president led to the Senate impeachment 
trial offers the nation her apology ``for my part in this past 
year's ordeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive  
me,'' she says. ``But I would ask them to know that I am very sorry 
for what happened and for what they've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Walters of ABC News won the first interview with Ms.  
Lewinsky since the former White House intern burst into the 
headlines on Jan. 21, 1998. Ms. Lewinsky, who received immunity 
from prosecution for cooperating with investigators, was prohibited 
from speaking publicly until Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
office gave the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview was timed to help promote her book -- ``Monica's  
Story,'' written with Princess Diana biographer Andrew Morton -- 
which goes on sale Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv refused to comment. Asked if  
Ms. Lewinsky's words would finally bring an end to the story, Toiv 
said: ``I think I can safely say 'No' to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC released brief excerpts from the interview on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Is Bill Clinton a sensuous, passionate man?'' Walters asked  
the 25-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gosh, I'll probably get in trouble for saying this,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky began before describing the president as ``a very sensual 
man'' who feels conflicted because of his ``strong religious 
upbringing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he struggles with his sensuality because I don't think  
he thinks it's OK,'' she said. ``I think he tries to hold himself 
back. And then can't anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky had stinging words for her former friend, Linda  
Tripp, who secretly tape-recorded their telephone conversations 
about the president and turned them over to Starr's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pity her,'' Ms. Lewinsky said. ``I would hate to be her.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she was drawn to Mrs. Tripp at the Pentagon  
because both of them had worked at the White House, where Ms. 
Lewinsky longed to return. She said she confided the affair to Mrs. 
Tripp after her co-worker kept saying things such as ``You're just 
the type of girl the president would like'' and ``I bet you could 
have an affair with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News in New York also published excerpts from the  
interview on Tuesday. The newspaper said it had obtained a partial, 
unedited audio tape. ABC confirmed its authenticity but objected 
strongly to its being leaked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News said Ms. Lewinsky called Clinton her ``sexual  
soul mate'' and insisted their relationship was about a ``man and a 
woman, and not a president and an intern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She told Walters the president never discussed his marriage with  
her, and never told her he loved her. She said she didn't feel 
cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning there was a very intense sexual attraction,  
and I don't necessarily think a sexual attraction is a bad thing,'' 
she said. ``I didn't feel that way -- and I still don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, ``I never will have an affair with a married man  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, ABC News officials decried the publication of  
unedited material from the interview. The network's ``editorial 
process has been compromised by the illegal and irresponsible 
actions of some unknown person,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> White House To Attack Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is withdrawing its  
support from the independent counsel law and intends to urge 
Congress to let the Watergate-inspired statute expire in June, 
according to a senior administration official. 
</P>
<P>
	With both Democrats and Republicans in Congress increasingly  
opposed to the law, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder was 
announcing the administration's reversal before a House Judiciary 
subcommittee chaired by Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., today. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder planned to tell the panel that the law, which provides  
for an independent counsel selected by three judges to investigate 
allegations against several dozen top administration officials, is 
``fundamentally flawed'' and should not be renewed this summer, 
this administration official said Monday night, requesting 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder planned to testify that a study group he chaired  
concluded that the Justice Department is capable of investigating 
and prosecuting most of the officials now covered by the law, the 
senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In rare cases in which there is a genuine conflict of interest,  
the attorney general could use long-standing statutory authority to 
hire a special counsel to conduct an investigation, Holder will 
say, according to the official. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder will cite the use of special counsels appointed by the  
attorney general in several scandals, including Teapot Dome and 
Watergate, as serving the country well, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the Independent Counsel Act directly reverses the  
Clinton administration's stance five years ago, when both President 
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno successfully urged Congress 
to renew the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The new position was developed by the Justice Department task  
force and then cleared with the Office of Management and Budget and 
the White House as acceptable administration policy, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law has never been popular among career Justice Department  
attorneys, many of whom viewed it as calling into question their 
integrity. But the first version was passed in 1978 with bipartisan 
support in Congress, largely in reaction to President Nixon's 
firing five years earlier of special counsel Archibald Cox during 
the Watergate investigation. Cox, who had been appointed by the 
attorney general, was replaced by Leon Jaworski, appointed by 
another attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	In essence, Holder intended to tell the committee that the wrong  
lesson had been drawn from that episode, arguing that Jaworski did 
an effective job and independent investigators appointed by judges 
were not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for the law among Republicans has been eroded by two  
events in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	They objected to the length of Lawrence Walsh's multiyear  
investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan and Bush 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Republicans have groused about Reno's refusal to  
turn over to an independent counsel her department's investigation 
of campaign financing activities of Clinton, Vice President Al Gore 
and other Democrats in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have turned against the law because of the length and  
conduct of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of 
Clinton over the Whitewater affair, his relationship with White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky and several other matters. Starr 
recommended Clinton's impeachment to the House last September. The 
Senate acquitted Clinton last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Justice Department, officials have felt that some of  
the record seven independent counsels sought by Reno over the past 
six years overreached and exceeded their intended mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current law, the attorney general must ask a  
three-judge panel to select an independent counsel if she believes 
there is enough evidence to warrant a full criminal investigation 
of certain top administration officials. The independent prosecutor 
is given an unlimited budget to hire aides and conduct an 
investigation with no time limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno is scheduled to testify on the issue later this month  
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

<HEADLINE> Bush Forms Presidential Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Moving another step closer to a White House  
bid in 2000, Gov. George W. Bush announced Tuesday that he is 
forming a presidential exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do have a compelling reason to consider running for  
president. For my family and for every family in America, I want 
the 21st century to be prosperous,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 52, said the first job of the committee will be to raise  
money while he remains in Texas until the state Legislature's 
session ends on Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Bush said, he will travel around the country to  
personally gauge support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a formal date in mind yet,'' Bush said of his  
timetable for deciding whether to run for the office is father once 
held. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor often has cited his worries about the impact of a  
national campaign on his family -- wife Laura and their twin 
17-year-old daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he has been buoyed by the parade of elected officials  
who have trekked to Austin to urge him to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's announcement came as no surprise. Advisers had been  
putting out the word for more than a week, but it is the first 
formal, public step Bush has taken toward a White House race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exploratory committees aren't much, but they are signals,''  
said Larry Sabato, political science professor at the University of 
Virginia. ``It does have some significance, because for the first 
time in a concrete way, he's showing some leg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush picked the same day that Pat Buchanan, the conservative  
commentator whose low-budget campaigns shocked the Republican 
establishment in 1992 and 1996, opened his third presidential race 
in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he's not worried about losing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't fear failure. I really don't,'' he said. ``Should I  
decide to run, if things don't work out, that's just the way it 
goes. And if things do work out, I don't fear success, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formation of the exploratory committee allows Bush to raise  
funds, something he's been prolific at in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign finance records show that he raised about $16 million  
in his 1994 challenge of Democratic Gov. Ann Richards, and $17.7 
million for last year's re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush got about 53.5 percent of the vote against Richards in 1994  
and a whopping 69 percent against Democrat Garry Mauro in 1998 -- 
the most by any Texas gubernatorial candidate since John Connally 
32 years before. 
</P>
<P>
	During that first term as governor, Bush forged what he now  
calls ``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His education proposals included making sure all Texas children  
read by the third grade; helping students who fail with in-school, 
after-school or summer programs; and ending automatic social 
promotion of students.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hopes for US-China Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left China  
today with hopes of striking a trade deal with Beijing this spring 
even after admonishing Chinese officials to halt a crackdown on 
political dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our relationship with China, these are neither the best of  
times nor the worst of times,'' Albright said, summing up a 
three-day visit marked by confrontation on human rights and Taiwan 
and growing cooperation on North Korea and possibly trade. 
</P>
<P>
	In her talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu  
Rongji and other Chinese officials, Albright said she made clear 
that the Clinton administration ``deplores'' China's fresh 
crackdown on dissent. She urged Chinese officials to release 
political prisoners, including those trying to form an opposition 
democratic party, and to ratify two international human rights 
covenants that guarantee personal freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important for there to be a change in atmosphere and  
an end to the crackdown,'' Albright said at a news conference 
ending her visit before heading to Thailand. ``There has to be a 
release of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright didn't win any concessions on human rights, however.  
Instead, the Chinese said it was an internal affair and they 
complained about a State Department report that condemned the 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States will never apologize for speaking or  
publishing the truth,'' Albright said of the report. She said she 
told Chinese officials, ``Societies are more, not less, likely to 
be stable when citizens have an outlet to express their political 
views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she thought a multiparty system is needed in  
Communist-run China, Albright said, ``I do think that is an 
important prerequisite of an open society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the deep differences, however, Albright said that the  
Clinton administration remains committed to engaging China to 
develop a ``strategic partnership'' and that the relationship ``can 
withstand sharp disagreements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Albright said there's a chance the United States and  
China will reach a deal for China to join the World Trade 
Organization and that U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky 
was coming to China this week with ``a new proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A successful outcome will be a great step forward in  
integrating China into the world economy,'' she said, adding that a 
deal could help reduce the U.S.-Chinese trade deficit, which hit a 
record $57 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The hope is to complete negotiations in time for an announcement  
when Zhu visits the White House in April to see President Clinton, 
U.S. and Chinese officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The atmosphere is good, but the devil is in the details when  
it comes to trade agreements,'' said State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright told Chinese leaders that Zhu, who is in charge of  
economic matters in China and badly wants a WTO deal, must come to 
Washington ready to make progress on human rights and other tough 
issues such as high technology transfers and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``No subject is off the table,'' Albright said.  
</P>
<P>
	Joining the WTO would give China low-tariff access to export  
markets and protect it from some sanctions. The United States wants 
Beijing first to lower more of its tariffs on goods and get rid of 
other trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	On China's concerns about U.S. development of a missile defense  
system, which could protect Taiwan, Albright said she told the 
Chinese it will be years before such a system could be technically 
developed so it's a ``hypothetical'' question. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's not hypothetical is the threat of missiles,'' she  
declared. ``I think this is an issue we have to work on together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also urged the Chinese to use their influence to get  
North Korea to halt its missile development, which she called ``the 
real source of the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao indirectly  
accused the United States today of distorting North Korea's missile 
threat to drum up support for a theater missile defense system and 
provide a pretext to make Taiwan a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current situation on the Korean peninsula on the whole is  
stable,'' he told reporters. ``Therefore we oppose the moves by 
some countries to make an excuse of this situation to strengthen 
military alliances and to build up defense capabilities that exceed 
legitimate needs. That is not conducive to peace and stability and 
may trigger arms races and do no good to no countries in the final 
analysis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China already is cooperating in maintaining a freeze on North  
Korea's nuclear weapons program and on completing a peace agreement 
for the Korean Peninsula, Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said that as a permanent member of the United Nations  
Security Council, China plays an important role in helping solve 
international security problems. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, she said she chastised Chinese officials for  
vetoing a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Macedonia, which borders 
volatile Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing vetoed the mission last week in retaliation for  
Macedonia's starting diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which China 
considers a renegade province.

<HEADLINE> Rose Pulls for His Son As a Dodger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Pete Rose kept a low profile, sitting  
quietly in the stands at Dodgertown watching his son play in an 
intrasquad game. He hopes to be watching Pete Jr. playing in Los 
Angeles one of these days. 
</P>
<P>
	And Pete Jr. says it's going to happen, later if not sooner.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got what it takes,'' Pete Jr. said Tuesday. ``I  
plan on making the team. I don't plan on playing in (Triple-A) 
Albuquerque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if manager Davey Johnson sends him down?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bust my tail,'' Pete Jr. said. ``I'm going to be in LA at  
some time. I'm a guy who's got some pop. Left-handed pop looks to 
be a little scarce around here. I think Davey Johnson likes tough 
guys. I come to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Rose, the career hits leader who agreed to lifetime  
ban for gambling, called Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone 
during the winter to request a favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete asked me to give his son a chance,'' Malone recalled.  
``I've known both of them for years. They both have huge hearts. I 
figured it was a win-win situation. I told Pete it would be tough 
for (Junior) to make the team. He said, `No special treatment, all 
we ask is a chance.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's the deal. The younger Rose, a 29-year-old whose only  
major league experience was a brief spell with Cincinnati Reds 18 
months ago, signed a minor league contract with an invitation to 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	And here he is, giving it his best shot.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can tell me to stop chasing my dream,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He knows how to play, he's not going to give up,'' the elder  
Rose said. ``He's just now figuring out his m.o.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose referred to the change his son went through between the  
1996 and 1997 seasons. Essentially, Pete Jr., went from a clone of 
his father to a power hitter, bulking up in the gym from 200 pounds 
to around 230. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bigger than he is,'' the younger Rose said. ``It took me  
longer to figure things out. I had to make a change, and I did. 
Basically, I've been at this for only a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recently spent a week with his father, and it helped as he  
entered spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a plus when you have the hit-king on your side,'' he  
said. ``He's just unbelievable, a great person, a great dad, a 
great coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, obviously, a big fan of his son.  
</P>
<P>
	The younger Rose had his best season by far in 1997, hitting  
.308 with 25 homers and 98 RBIs in 112 games for Double-A 
Chattanooga. He was called up by the Reds and made his only 
big-league start on Labor Day, going 1-for-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd in Cincinnati, where Rose's father played most of his  
career and later managed, was 31,920. The majority of those tickets 
were sold after it was announced Rose was playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reds didn't give him a chance,'' dad said. ``They used him  
to make some money. I know it wasn't (owner) Marge (Schott). Marge 
likes Pete. If nothing else, he paid to go to spring training the 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't happen that way, and after the younger Rose was asked  
to go to Double-A in 1998, he refused and asked for his release. He 
wound up the year playing for the New Jersey Jackals of the 
independent Northeast League. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Rose remains somewhat bitter.  
</P>
<P>
	``Playing in Cincinnati was special, unbelievable,'' he said.  
``There will only be one thing better -- when I go there as a 
visitor and get the job done. And it's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The Dodgers) go to Cincinnati in May. I've already had dreams  
about playing against them, coming up in a big situation and 
getting a key hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite what happened, the elder Rose said he still pulls for  
the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play on Pete Rose Way, man,'' he said. ``I just don't  
like the way certain people treated him. I'm a Dodger fan now. I 
just don't want to make those flights to Albuquerque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Rose spoke, his son, a left-handed hitter wearing No. 74,  
came to the plate to face Onan Masaoka, a left-handed pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let you know if he's my son after he hits,'' Rose said to  
a fan. ``If he gets a hit, he's my son. If he doesn't, he's your 
son.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs $500M for Farm Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House is trying to ease a farm credit  
crunch by making as much as $500 million available to guarantee 
loans to farmers and ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a bill passed Tuesday by voice vote, the money is not to  
be lent directly to farmers but is to be used to back up loans and 
ward off default. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department is running out of money to make loans  
at a time when demand for them is high because of natural disasters 
and low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The money also is intended to help farmers until Congress has a  
chance to vote on whether to grant President Clinton's request for 
$153 million in extra money this year for emergency loans and for 
hiring temporary government workers to handle a heavy demand for 
disaster help. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of the money targeted in Tuesday's House bill is limited  
until April 1 to a program for beginning farmers and ranchers. 
After that, the government may make it available to anybody 
eligible for USDA-guaranteed loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would make the money available for loan  
guarantees immediately because the funds are not being used and are 
not expected to be used, according to a statement released by the 
Republican House Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Freeing up the Beginning Farmer guaranteed loan money, which  
is not being used, will be of great benefit to agricultural 
producers,'' Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take action to make sure they survive and give them  
an opportunity to prosper,'' said Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also requires the agriculture secretary to give  
priority to guaranteed loan applications from beginning farmers and 
ranchers under any additional money Congress allocates for this 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	No corresponding bill has yet been introduced in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	The House measure's sponsor, Agriculture Committee chairman Rep.  
Larry Combest, R-Texas, said he's holding Washington bureaucrats 
accountable for ``failing to deliver farms disaster aid to 
producers authorized by Congress nearly 4 1/2 months ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department's plans for distribution of disaster relief  
payments means farmers probably won't see the money until May. 
``Help is many months past producers' expectations and the 
department's own promises,'' Combest said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Clinton said economic turmoil in Asia and elsewhere  
continues ``to make it difficult for American farmers and ranchers 
to export their goods overseas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal would provide $1.1 billion in direct  
loans or loan guarantees for an estimated 10,000 producers who 
can't get credit from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 882.

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire May Adopt Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire, the ``Live Free or Die''  
state, may not be free of an income tax much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	A state Supreme Court order to overhaul the way schools are  
funded threatens New Hampshire's long-cherished distinction as one 
of seven states with no personal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire is also one of only two states with neither an  
income tax nor a general sales tax. (Alaska is the other.) The 
state depends instead on a mishmash of taxes on such thing as 
businesses, restaurant meals, hotel rooms, property sales, 
cigarettes and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	All of that may change as lawmakers scramble to comply with an  
April 1 court deadline to implement a fairer way to pay for 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the court ruled the state no longer could rely on local  
property taxes, which vary widely from place to place, to pay 90 
percent of the cost of public education. The court ordered the 
state to use state taxes to ensure every child receives an adequate 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	The court left it to the state to define an adequate education,  
which lawmakers estimate will cost $700 million to $1 billion. That 
would double the state's overall budget. 
</P>
<P>
	As the deadline nears, lawmakers are not exactly embracing an  
income tax. But they're no longer holding it at arm's length, 
either, because it can easily raise the money needed to solve the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	One idea on the table is a combination of a 4 percent income tax  
and a uniform, statewide property tax. Together, they would raise 
$970 million for education. 
</P>
<P>
	The property tax would be set at a rate lower than what most  
towns are paying already. As a result, the overall tax burden on 
most people in New Hampshire would fall, according to backers of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at this crisis point, and the fundamental question is:  
Do we stick with the property tax or do we change?'' said state 
Sen. Clifton Below, one of the sponsors. ``It's something people 
are just coming to grips with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, sporadic attempts to enact an income tax have  
been blocked by political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Sherman Adams, who went on to be President Eisenhower's  
chief of staff, proposed a 1 percent income tax in 1949 but 
abandoned the idea after failing to win much support from 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades later, conservative Republican Gov. Meldrim Thomson  
coined the campaign slogan ``Ax the Tax,'' and every governor since 
has taken ``The Pledge'' to veto broad-based taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Current Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, was no exception, but  
she has left the door open by saying she supports allowing voters 
to choose a solution to the school funding problem through a 
binding referendum -- something not attempted in New Hampshire in 
more than 100 years. The high court is deciding whether a 
referendum would be constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the Republican-controlled House, Speaker Donna  
Sytek, opposes an income tax. But the Democrats control the Senate 
for the first time since 1912 and are led by Sen. Clesson 
Blaisdell, a longtime income tax supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's only statewide newspaper, the fiercely  
conservative Union Leader of Manchester, has led the way in 
vilifying broad-based taxes. But income tax supporters say the 
paper's influence is declining. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're no longer the only Sunday paper. We have a lot of  
strong regional papers now, and every other paper editorially is 
much more open to an income tax,'' Below said. 
</P>
<P>
	The income tax idea is competing with a statewide property tax  
plan sponsored by Sytek. And the governor is expected to unveil her 
own statewide property tax plan soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argue an income tax would destroy something that  
attracts people to New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	House Finance Chairman Neal Kurk said an income tax is ``not the  
New Hampshire way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't come to New Hampshire because of our climate. And  
while our mountains are beautiful, there are other mountains,'' he 
said. ``People come to New Hampshire because we have a different 
social attitude and different economic environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``New Hampshire isn't just a place,'' Kurk said. ``It's a state  
of mind. Let's not mess with it.''

<HEADLINE> Dole's Help Asked in Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to nail down at least half an agreement  
to end fighting in Kosovo, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is 
asking for help from Bob Dole. The 1996 Republican presidential 
nominee apparently is willing to try. 
</P>
<P>
	``She spoke with him on the telephone, and he has agreed to  
travel to the region to urge agreement on the interim settlement 
plan,'' deputy State Department spokesman James P. Foley said 
Monday. ``I believe the details on his schedule and itinerary are 
still being worked out, so there's been no formal announcement 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of a second round of mediation by Albright last  
month, she announced that the ethnic Albanians had accepted in 
principle a self-rule plan proposed by the United States and five 
other nations to end fighting in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	With another round due to open March 15, the Kosovo Albanians  
are considering whether to set aside their aspirations for 
independence and accept the settlement offered to them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs, meanwhile, have not accepted all provisions of the  
self-rule arrangement. Nor were they willing to have NATO 
peacekeeping troops deployed in Kosovo, which is the other half of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still believe a political settlement is in our grasp,''  
Foley said, referring to the autonomy half of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Albright was enlisting Dole's help, Foley said: ``He  
is someone who has stood up for the Kosovar Albanians for many 
years. He's well-known to them, and he would be able to speak to 
them on behalf of the United States as someone who is concerned 
about their situation and their future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole could not be reached for comment. His spokesman, Douglas  
MacKinnon, said he did not know about Dole's plans but said of the 
Balkans: ``It's clearly an issue that is very important to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Dole said NATO should conduct air strikes against  
military installations in Serbia unless Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic halted his attacks in Kosovo and agreed to peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Clinton administration had been too tolerant of  
Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate majority leader in 1995, Dole supported President  
Clinton's decision to dispatch U.S. troops to Bosnia to help 
enforce a settlement that ended an ethnic conflict among Serbs, 
Croats and Muslims in that former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Kansas senator and Senate leader also may go to  
Belgrade to try direct diplomacy on Milosevic and other Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, leaders of the ethnic Albanians have accepted in  
principle an administration invitation to attend talks with U.S. 
officials in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no decision when the talks would be held or which  
Albanians would come, Foley said. But, he said, ``It is our 
expectation some will come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Tirana, Albania's capital, the Kosovo Liberation Army's  
Kosova Press announced the delegation. It includes chief negotiator 
Hashim Thaci and Jakup Krasniqi, Ram Buja, Bashkim Jashari, Ramush 
Haradinaj, Bislim Zyrapi. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also called Dole last month while holding talks with  
the two sides in Rambouillet, France, and asked him to intercede 
with the ethnic Albanians, many of whom seek independence and not 
just the self-rule promised by the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusing both the Serbs and ethnic Albanians of bloody attacks  
in recent days, Foley condemned the continuing violence and said 
the United States is keeping close watch on a buildup of Serbian 
troops on the Kosovo border. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Cohen threatened a  
NATO response if innocent Kosovars are attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Serbs, by virtue of their heavy armor and their  
artillery, start to engage in massive assaults upon innocent 
villagers, that would constitute a violation of the agreement that 
was negotiated ... back in the fall, and that would prompt an 
attack by the NATO forces,'' Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Gore To Lead Agenda Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Determined to demonstrate party unity,  
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore will hold a Capitol 
Hill pep rally with Democratic lawmakers Wednesday to tout a 
``families first'' agenda touching on Social Security, Medicare, 
education and heath care. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agenda represents, again, a clear demonstration of the  
kind of unity that exists right now among Democrats about what we 
think the priorities for this country ought to be,'' Senate 
Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Gore will travel to the Library of Congress across  
the street from the Capitol for the session. Democratic officials 
are eager to demonstrate they have moved beyond the president's 
impeachment and to showcase their unity at a time when majority 
Republicans are laboring to develop tax and spending plans as part 
of their budget. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an outline made available in advance, the elements  
of the legislative program were drawn largely from Clinton's State 
of the Union message and included no new initiatives. These include 
the president's call to reserve 77 percent of budget surpluses to 
pay down the debt, designed to help buttress Social Security and 
Medicare; money to hire more school teachers; targeted tax cuts 
rather than the sweeping, across-the-board reductions that some 
Republicans favor. Clinton and Gore are also expected to renew 
their call for legislation to strengthen the hand of patients 
dealing with managed care companies. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans, led by Majority Leader Dick Armey, have  
scheduled a rally of their own on Wednesday to underscore their 
commitment to tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	And the party's leadership decided Tuesday to try and rush  
legislation to the floor designed to ensure that Social Security 
surpluses are used only for that program or to reduce the national 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional Republicans have yet to reach agreement on  
what type of tax cut to promote or to finalize numerous other 
details on their budget. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Democrats say they are largely united behind their  
agenda. The meeting also comes several weeks after House Democratic 
Leader Dick Gephardt announced he would forsake a campaign for the 
White House in 2000 to stay in Congress. That eliminated the 
almost-constant jockeying between his staff and Gore's, and cleared 
the way for the White House and congressional Democrats to work 
together more smoothly on their effort to win control of both 
houses in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from reserving part of the surplus to help Social Security  
and Medicare, Democrats favor tax credits for school construction 
and additional funds to fulfill a commitment for hiring 100,000 new 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal for funding for after-school programs is also  
included, and is expected to be debated this week in the Senate, 
when Republicans bring legislation to the floor to loosen strings 
on aid to education. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic tax cut agenda calls for breaks for child care  
and long term care, as well as Clinton's call for personal 
retirement accounts. The government would supervise investment in 
the stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Other proposals include an increase in the minimum wage and  
money for more police.

<HEADLINE> Test May Cut Colon Cancer Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A simple screening test for blood in the bowel  
can reduce by up to one-third the death rate from colon cancer, the 
second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, a study 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding, to be published Wednesday in the Journal of the  
National Cancer Institute, is prompting a national campaign to 
encourage people over age 50 to take the test, because they account 
for most of the 56,000 U.S. colon cancer deaths each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota researchers monitoring the health of 46,000 volunteers  
since 1976 have found that those who take the fecal occult blood 
test each year have 33 percent fewer deaths from colon cancer than 
people who do not take the test. Those tested every other year, the 
study found, have a 21 percent reduced rate of colon cancer death. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a positive test for blood, the likelihood of  
finding a growth in the colon is about 35 percent,'' said Dr. John 
H. Bond, the study's co-author. ``About 9 percent will have cancer, 
and the rest will have significant precancerous polyps in the 
colon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of the long-running study in 1993 suggested that  
annual tests could reduce deaths from colon cancer, and now the new 
analysis shows that even biennial tests can have a dramatic effect, 
said Bond, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota 
and a staff physician at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very valuable way to identify people who are healthy  
and have no symptoms, who nevertheless have a developing cancer in 
their colon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results confirm findings from two earlier studies in Europe,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prompted by the research results, federal health agencies on  
Tuesday announced a new campaign to encourage all Americans over 50 
to take the fecal occult blood test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that we can prevent many deaths from  
colorectal cancer through screening,'' said Surgeon General David 
Satcher. ``If you've celebrated your 50th birthday and have never 
been screened for colorectal cancer, start now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a program that went into effect last year, Medicare now  
pays for the screening, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 129,000 Americans, most past the age of 50, are diagnosed  
each year with colorectal cancer, and about 56,000 die each year. 
It is the second most common cancer killer, just behind lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal occult blood test used in the Minnesota research has  
long been a common part of physical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a card with small inserts, patients collect specimens for  
the tests at home. Fecal specimens from several bowel movements are 
placed into the insets, and the self-sealing card is then mailed or 
delivered to a doctor's office where a chemical is applied to each 
specimen. If the chemical turns blue, it is evidence of blood. 
</P>
<P>
	If the test is positive, patients then undergo a full colon  
examination with a flexible tube, Bond said. This exam, called a 
colonoscopy, will find any evidence of cancer or of precancerous 
growths called polyps. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the polyps, performed during the full colon exam, stops  
the growth from becoming cancer in most cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of cancer is preceded in 95 percent of the cases by  
slowly growing polyps,'' Bond said. ``By taking out the polyps, one 
can reduce subsequent development of cancer by 90 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal blood tests give false positives 65 percent of the  
time, Bond noted. But he said ``that 35 percent (where a growth is 
found) is sufficiently high to warrant the examination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal blood test costs about $10, said Bond. The follow-up  
colonoscopy examination can cost several hundred, but he said it is 
``very cost effective'' from a public health viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of the screening and the follow-up tests is much less  
than finding and treating the cancer later, not only in money, but 
in the pain and suffering of the patients,'' said Bond.

<HEADLINE> McDougal May Summon Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move that would intensify interest in her  
upcoming trial, lawyers for Whitewater defendant Susan McDougal are 
considering summoning Monica Lewinsky and another figure from the 
recent impeachment drama to testify as defense witnesses, sources 
familiar with the trial say. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said Mrs.  
McDougal's defense team is discussing whether to subpoena Ms. 
Lewinsky and Julie Hiatt Steele to testify about their experiences 
with prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Both women have been critical of the 
independent counsel's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, the former business partner of President Clinton  
and his wife, Hillary, is set to be tried next week in federal 
court in Little Rock, Ark., on criminal contempt and obstruction of 
justice charges for refusing to cooperate with Starr in the 
Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said that subpoenas have not yet been requested from  
U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr., who is overseeing the trial, 
but that Starr's office was aware of the defense team's idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Jackie Bennett said Tuesday he could  
not comment on the matter. Attorney Mark Geragos, who represents 
Mrs. McDougal, also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Summoning Ms. Lewinsky would transform Mrs. McDougal's trial  
from a sideshow in the long-running Whitewater investigation to a 
major event. Mrs. McDougal's lawyers probably would have to show 
that Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Steele have testimony directly relevant 
to the alleged offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who along with her late ex-husband, James, formed  
the Whitewater land venture with the Clintons, is charged with 
defying a judge's order and refusing to answer Starr's questions 
before a federal grand jury investigating Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions concern a Whitewater-related loan from the  
McDougals' savings and loan firm and Mrs. Clinton's work on a 
fraudulent Arkansas land venture called Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has repeatedly said she refused to answer Starr's  
questions because she did not trust the prosecutor, a Republican, 
and believes Starr has waged a vendetta against the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	She has said she believed Starr would prosecute her if she  
failed to deliver damaging evidence against the Clintons. She says 
she does not know of any wrongdoing on the part of the first 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	But her former husband, a longtime Clinton supporter who  
defended the first family for years, reversed course a year and a 
half before his death and testified that the president and first 
lady were involved in wrongdoing in their Arkansas business 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said Mrs. McDougal's legal team would like to use  
testimony from Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Steele to argue that their 
experiences bore out their client's fears about cooperating with 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has alleged that Starr's prosecutors, during their  
initial encounter with her, threatened her with prosecution if she 
refused to cooperate against the president, kept her at a hotel for 
hours and urged her not to call her lawyer. Ms. Lewinsky also 
alleges they urged her to wear a body wire to try to implicate 
Clinton in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of tortuous negotiations, the former White House  
intern struck a deal to cooperate with Starr in exchange for 
immunity from prosecution but she harbors bitterness toward him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, who along with her lawyer has sharply criticized  
Starr, was charged earlier this year with three counts of 
obstruction of justice and one of making a false statement for 
providing testimony that cast doubt on her former friend Kathleen 
Willey's allegation that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr alleged he has evidence showing Ms. Steele made up her  
account. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyer, Nancy Luque, has not been contacted about  
her client testifying in the McDougal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was convicted in 1996 as part of the Whitewater  
investigation, along with her ex-husband and Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy 
Tucker. She was convicted of four felony fraud counts involving an 
illegal loan from a federally backed lending company. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't begin serving her two-year sentence until March 1998,  
however. Before that, she served 18 months for civil contempt for 
refusing to answer questions before the Whitewater grand jury. She 
was released in June 1998 because of a back condition.

<HEADLINE> Maz Mentors Pirates' Second Baseman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- The player who hit the biggest home run  
in College World Series history was working diligently on his 
double play pivot with the player who struck arguably the biggest 
homer in World Series history. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Morris, meet Bill Mazeroski.  
</P>
<P>
	Morris and Mazeroski are best known for two magical swings of  
the bat, but were concentrating on defense Tuesday now that the 
Pittsburgh Pirates have put Morris on the fast track to replacing 
Tony Womack at second base. 
</P>
<P>
	And what better defensive mentor than Mazeroski, who was denied  
entry into the Hall of Fame during Tuesday's Veterans Committee 
vote but is widely regarded as the slickest fielding second baseman 
ever? 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good listener, he works hard -- he can do some things,''  
Mazeroski said of Morris, a rookie traded by Texas to Pittsburgh 
last season. ``He does just about everything well. He's a pretty 
good athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Didn't they say the same thing 43 years ago about a rookie  
second baseman named Mazeroski, who went on to win eight Gold 
Gloves but is recalled mostly for his Game 7 homer to beat the New 
York Yankees in the 1960 World Series? 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Morris will never be forgotten for his dramatic two-run  
homer in the ninth inning that beat Miami 9-8 in 1996 and gave LSU 
its third College World Series title in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarkably, it was the only homer that season for Morris, who  
was out for nearly a month with a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``People always seem to bring that up,'' Morris said. ``They  
say, `Yeah, you're the guy who hit that home run ...' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds familiar to Mazeroski, who is working in the Pirates'  
camp for the first time since 1973 as an infield instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless I don't go out of the house that day, somebody almost  
always brings up the home run,'' Mazeroski said of the only 
ninth-inning homer to decide a World Series Game 7. ``It's nice to 
hear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 25, and Mazeroski, 62, share more than an affinity for  
dramatic home runs. Mazeroski was only a .260 career hitter, but 
former teammate Willie Stargell said he always had as many big hits 
as anyone on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris hit .412 for the 1996 U.S. Olympic team with five homers,  
most in key spots, and 10 RBIs. He had 103 RBIs -- an exceptionally 
high total for a second baseman -- in only 139 games with Double-A 
Tulsa and Carolina last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Benjamin, who split time at second base for Boston last  
season, will likely open the season at second base, but many in the 
Pirates' organization will be surprised if Morris doesn't end the 
season there. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, if the Pirates were sending him a signal by trading  
Womack to Arizona last week, Morris is intentionally trying to 
overlook it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing is to go out and do my thing and play, not worry  
about the front office moves and who's going to be where,'' Morris 
said. ``The more you get caught up in that, that's when it gets in 
your head and starts affecting your play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski had a similar philosophy of always trying to keep his  
head about him even in pressure situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything I can pick up from him is a plus,'' said Morris, who  
will work daily with Mazeroski through Monday. ``I'm just trying to 
get inside his head and pick his brain. People say he was the 
greatest defensive second baseman to ever play the game, so why 
wouldn't you want to learn from somebody like that?''

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Russia Steel Pact Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American companies that rely on Russian-made  
steel, a labor union that blames imports for widespread layoffs and 
a Russian exporter all told the Clinton administration Tuesday that 
they don't like import limits negotiated by the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. and Russia have agreed to varying import limits on 16  
different types of steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which has not yet been finalized, would  
essentially roll back exports of those products to around 1997's 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Dillon, president of DSC Limited of Trenton, Mich.,  
implored the Commerce Department's International Trade 
Administration to make an exception for the kind of steel on which 
his business depends. 
</P>
<P>
	He said DSC buys from Russia because it's difficult to get a  
reliable source of U.S.-produced slab steel. Integrated mills use 
all they produce and other manufacturers buy as much as mini-mills 
are able to turn out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No steel mill wants to sell slabs -- it's the low link on the  
food chain,'' he testified. ``There is no domestic supply of slabs 
and our business depends on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dillon said his company is in the process of bringing modern  
facilities on-line that will mean expanding its work force, but if 
the Russian agreement is finalized as it's proposed, ``We will not 
be able to open our mill and employ new workers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Bethlehem Steel Co., representing larger steel  
companies, opposed the deal in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russian steel cannot be sold fairly in the U.S. market,'' said  
attorney Alan Wolff. ``It can only be dumped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the large domestic steel makers' point of view, every  
import level in the agreement was set too high. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest Russian steel producer, JSC Severstal, said it  
intends to ask Russia's trade officials to negotiate modifications 
to the deal, described by its representative, Peter O. Suchman, as 
vague and ``totally unbalanced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Carl Frankel of the United Steelworkers of America panned  
the Clinton administration's entire approach to recent surges in 
low-priced steel arriving on U.S. docks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union cannot support the proposed agreement unless it is  
part of a global solution,'' he said, complaining that when one 
nation's steel imports are cut back some other country steps up its 
imports, forcing new trade cases that take some 13 months to 
resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter to a steel worker whether he's laid off  
because the steel came from Russia, the steel came from Japan or 
the steel came from Korea ... shifting from one country to another 
is not compelling to a steel worker,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel said the administration should come up with a broader  
steel agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary for Import Administration Robert LaRussa  
responded that the entire administration ``has made it a priority 
to alleviate the impact of last year's steel crisis on steel 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration took steps to speed up the processing of  
trade complaints, cutting 25 days out of the system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That does not minimize the pain felt by steel workers but we  
are working hard on this,'' said LaRussa. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is both one of the world's largest steel exporters and  
one of the countries suffering drastic hardships as a result of the 
global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to complaints that it was dumping steel on the U.S.  
market at below-market prices, it agreed last month to limit 
shipments of hot-rolled steel to 1996 levels and restrict shipments 
of 16 other types of steel to 1997 levels. Tuesday's hearing did 
not address the hot-rolled steel issue.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsels Losing Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration withdrew its  
support for the independent counsel law Tuesday, saying the 
Watergate-inspired investigations statute ``has failed in its goal 
of removing politics from the process.'' Congress should let the 
law expire on June 30, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The act was supposed to increase trust in our government;  
unfortunately, it has diminished it,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder told the House Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative 
Law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The climate of politicization pervades the process regardless  
of which way a specific decision, investigation or prosecution 
comes out,'' he said in prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than three weeks after the Senate acquitted President  
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice impeachment charges 
that were approved by the House on the recommendation of 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, Holder's remarks underscored 
crumbling support for the act among both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Clinton administration had gone on  
record against the statute. The president and Attorney General 
Janet Reno successfully lobbied for its renewal five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton ``concurs  
with the judgment of the Justice Department that the statute should 
not be renewed -- that its flaws outweigh its benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said Clinton's judgment was ``a policy decision based on  
his observation of how the law's been implemented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from subcommittee chairman Rep. George Gekas,  
R-Pa., Holder told the panel that he first secured Reno's approval, 
then submitted his testimony to White House Counsel Charles Ruff 
late last week. ``He indicated to us that we proceed,'' Holder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder spoke less than a week before his department is required  
by a panel of judges to respond to the Landmark Legal Foundation's 
complaint that contends the Justice Department cannot investigate 
Starr's conduct while the independent counsel is investigating 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder said Justice officials believe Landmark had no standing  
to file that motion. He said Justice officials met with Starr 
recently and listened to his objections to being investigated by 
the department, but no negotiation occurred. Reno will make any 
final decisions about who will conduct the investigation, Holder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law provides for an independent counsel selected by three  
judges to investigate allegations against specified administration 
officials. Reno has had seven independent counsels appointed in 
Clinton's six years in office, more than any other attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	Battered by Starr's probe, however, Clinton's allies plan a  
sustained attack against the law. After Holder's remarks, Clinton's 
personal attorney, Robert Bennett, was expected to make a similar 
case Wednesday before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno is to testify to the same panel later this month.  
</P>
<P>
	They will speak to a Congress already hostile to the law's  
renewal. Angered for years over independent counsel investigations 
of President Reagan and then of Clinton, lawmakers of every stripe 
agree the act cannot be renewed without at least a major overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	House members and senators have suggested ways to fix the law.  
At the hearing Tuesday, for example, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, 
D-Miss., pushed his bill to reimburse legal costs incurred by 
investigation targets who are later acquitted. Rep. Jay Dickey, 
R-Ark., meanwhile, pressed for his bill to require Congress to 
approve an independent counsel's budget if an investigation lasts 
longer than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	But with no consensus on how to fix the law, momentum is growing  
to let it expire. If it does, investigations of high-ranking 
government officials would revert to the Justice Department. The 
attorney general, Holder said, could appoint special prosecutors in 
cases where conflicts of interest clearly exist. 
</P>
<P>
	That was how the system worked until President Nixon fired  
special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal. 
Nixon's move convinced Congress that probes of presidents and other 
high-ranking officials should be conducted by outsiders not 
accountable to those they investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one years after its inception, Republicans and Democrats  
complain the law does not hold independent counsels accountable for 
their conduct of investigations or for the millions of public 
dollars they spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder emphasized several times that the administration's  
reversal ``does not have to do with any particular inquiry or 
investigation. It has to do with the fact that the types of 
decisions we are talking about here can be controversial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is due in part, he said, to the law's reliance on an action  
of the attorney general, the decision to ask for a counsel's 
appointment, although the attorney general is not accountable for 
the independent counsel's actions once the appointment is made. 
</P>
<P>
	``An attorney general is, after all, a member of the president's  
cabinet, and the act does not remove that purported conflict of 
interest,'' Holder told the panel. ``Instead, it creates an 
artificial process that divides responsibility and fragments 
accountability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the law confers the power to prosecute without meaningful  
checks ``on an inferior officer who is not subject to the ordinary 
controls of any branch of government,'' Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, an attorney general must answer to Congress.  
</P>
<P>
	``Congress' substantial oversight and funding powers, when  
coupled with the power of the press, constitute a structure of 
accountability,'' Holder said.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard To Restructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co., a pioneer of the  
high-tech age and one of the largest computer companies in the 
world, is hoping to boost some of its sagging businesses by 
splitting into two separate ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	The company joins a growing list that have voluntarily broken  
themselves up to become more profitable, including AT&AMP;T Corp. and 
ITT Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a granddaddy around here. We've also grown very  
large,'' said Hewlett-Packard president Lewis E. Platt on Tuesday. 
``By making this move, we believe we can make two new companies 
that are more focused and more nimble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Founded 60 years ago in a Palo Alto garage by Stanford  
University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the company 
first gained notoriety as a maker of electronic testing gear. 
</P>
<P>
	It is now the 22nd largest company in the United States. Its  
major products now include the powerful computers called servers 
that run networks of desktop machines. It also has a large printer 
business along with a range of roughly 29,000 products used by 
consumers, industry, engineering, science, medicine and education. 
</P>
<P>
	The split will form a company with the computer and imaging  
businesses, with roughly $40 billion in revenue, and second much 
smaller company including testing and measuring, components, 
chemical analysis and medical segments. This one will have about $7 
billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower prices for personal computers have cut into HP's profits  
of late, contributing to a stock price that has lagged behind the 
overall stock market over the past two years. The measurement and 
testing businesses have been more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	In its most recent quarter, the company beat Wall Street  
expectations as it reported earnings of $960 million. But 
Hewlett-Packard called revenue growth weak, and reported softness 
in some of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	After the splitup, executives hope the companies can be more  
entrepreneurial. In addition, investors will have a clearer choice 
when deciding which stock to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's board of directors approved the realignment plan  
at a special meeting Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Each company will also have its own headquarters and board of  
directors. The computer business will retain the Hewlett-Packard 
name, while the second company will get as yet undetermined title. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street was enthusiastic over the planned split.  
Hewlett-Packard stock closed up $2 3/4 a share to $68 5/8 a share in New 
York Stock Exchange Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were equally optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have demonstrated tremendous ability over the years to  
adapt to changing markets and technologies,'' said Nathan Brookwood 
at Insight 64, in Saratoga, Calif. ``I think this is one more good 
move in a long tradition of sound business decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, Inc. in  
Campbell, Calif. said that each of the two new businesses can take 
their own focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the PC side is going to need to be more nimble and  
responsive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one the most significant of Corporate America's recent  
splitups, AT&AMP;T in 1996 separated its long-distance, 
telecommunications equipment and computer segments into three 
companies. The telecom company, Lucent Technologies, in particular 
has achieved rapid profit growth and its stock market value last 
year surpassed AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	ITT split its manufacturing, hotel and insurance businesses in  
1995. Those companies have seen varied results. 
</P>
<P>
	Platt, who joined Hewlett-Packard in 1966, said that he will  
remain as chairman of the board, president and chief executive 
officer throughout the restructuring. But he said that at the age 
of 58, he is looking toward retiring within the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be here to complete the separation,'' he said. ``What  
happens after that is not yet known.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Teens Found at Hosts' Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thirty-two Chinese exchange students who  
disappeared at an airport just before their flight home did not 
defect, as suspected, but are staying in this country for 
additional study. 
</P>
<P>
	The mix-up over Monday's disappearance was blamed Tuesday on a  
miscommunication by two tour companies after police found the 
majority of the teen-agers with host families. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for the students began Monday at Los Angeles  
International Airport after they stepped off a charter bus about 
11:30 a.m. from the University of Redlands, where they studied 
English for four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	They were scheduled to depart for Shanghai, China, but vanished.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities searched the airport and delayed the flight until  
they got word the teen-agers had been whisked away in private cars 
with several Asian men. 
</P>
<P>
	Police thought the students may have attempted to defect,  
although none of the teens was known to have applied for political 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Police located two teen-age girls at a home in Covina about 25  
miles east of Los Angeles hours later and eventually tracked where 
they believed 23 others were staying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Detectives have contacted their families in China and they  
have permission to be here,'' Kalish said. He said he believed most 
of the group also had parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The students had six-month visas and said they had planned to  
stay in Southern California for additional study. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a bizarre incident, but it appears it will have  
a happy ending,'' Los Angeles Police Cmdr. David Kalish said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how exactly the miscommunication occurred between  
the tour companies and why the students were taken to the airport 
and booked for a flight home if their extended stay was preplanned.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 30 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher this morning, as investors  
awaited more data on the economy and Monday's rise in interest 
rates gaves signs of halting. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 30.43 at 9,355.21. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 18.20 at  
9,324.78, after erasing an 83.40-point loss that was tied to an 
increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index up 1.10 at 1,237.26, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index up 3.48 at 2,298.66. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the 30-year Treasury bond was up 1/8 point, with its  
yield, which falls when prices rise, traded at 5.66 percent, down 
from 5.67 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-8 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 83.14 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors got further confirmation that the economy is growing  
with two reports this morning. The Conference Board, a New York 
private research group, reported today that its index of future 
economic activity rose 0.5 percent to 106.9 in January from a 
revised level of 106.4 in December, pushed up in part by rising 
stock prices. The rise signalled that the U.S. economy will 
continue growing through at least mid-year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly better than the 0.4 percent increase  
economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the U.S. Commerce Department said new home  
sales slipped for the second consecutive month in January. They 
were down 5 percent from December, but nevertheless remained 
exceptionally strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.11 percent, amid  
signs of further deterioration in Japan's economy. In afternoon 
trading in Europe, Germany's DAX index was down .32 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up .12 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
.09 percent.

<HEADLINE> Impulses May Ease Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Treating back pain by shooting painless  
electrical impulses into muscles through fine needles brought 
patients modest relief and improved movement, researchers found in 
a study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the patients  
were an unusual group and results may not be applicable to most 
people with back problems. Even among the 60 subjects, improvements 
were very modest, the outside experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, a therapy called PENS, for percutaneous electrical  
nerve stimulation, helped patients with chronic low-back pain feel 
better, move better and use less pain-relieving medicine within 
three weeks, researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Findings of the study, led by Dr. El-sayed A. Ghoname of the  
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, are 
reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	PENS worked better than three other therapies the researchers  
compared it to: using the acupuncture-like needles without 
electricity; stimulating nerves and muscles electrically without 
the needles; and having patients do simple exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Using electrical stimulation without needles -- via electrode  
pads placed on top of the skin -- is called TENS, or transcutaneous 
electrical stimulation. Past studies found TENS provided some 
relief to back-pain patients, the researchers noted. 
</P>
<P>
	PENS uses the same kind of fine needles used in acupuncture with  
tiny amounts of electrical energy pulsing through them. But PENS 
differs in that the needles are inserted only at 10 points on the 
lower back. Acupuncturists often insert needles at various points 
throughout the body. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not include acupuncture.  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said PENS was the only significantly effective  
treatment tried, and all patients received each therapy three-times 
weekly for three weeks, with a one-week rest period between each 
method. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nortin M. Hadler, a back-pain expert at the University of  
North Carolina School of Medicine, said the subjects were highly 
unusual in that all were relatively young (in their 40s), were not 
overweight and had injuries that were not complicated by 
psychological or job-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with studying such a group,'' Hadler  
said. ``You just have to realize at the outset that whatever their 
findings, it may not generalize to any other group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even among subjects, relief was ``very modest,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another back-pain expert, Dr. Richard A. Deyo of the University  
of Washington in Seattle, agreed. Deyo also criticized the type of 
exercise studied, a simple bending and straightening, as being 
inadequate by today's standards.

<HEADLINE> Manson Helps Teach College Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Students at Newman University will get some  
input about the U.S. legal system this fall from one of the 
nation's most infamous mass murderers: Charles Manson. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Beattie, who teaches political science, asked for  
Manson's help in re-staging the trial in which he was found guilty 
of the bloody 1969 killings of actress Sharon Tate and six others 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wrote him several weeks ago, telling him what I planned to  
do in the class, but never expected to get a reply,'' Beattie said 
Monday. ``He's probably the most famous or most notorious prisoner 
on the planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Manson wrote back from the maximum-security California State  
Prison at Corcoran, Calif., and agreed. On Jan. 22, he gave Beattie 
a 45-minute interview that Newman students will use as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have 50 years of experience in incarceration,'' Manson told  
Beattie in a taped conversation. ``I pretty much have a leg up on 
the law from an underworld perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beattie -- who cleared his plan with school administrators -- said  
the mock trial will involve students as jurors, with Beattie 
presenting both prosecution and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Beattie also wants to set up a phone link so that Manson can  
testify in his own defense -- something Manson didn't do in his 
trial three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is learning and education,'' Beattie said. ``Students  
learn a lot more in a class if they do something more hands-on; 
it's much more valuable and enlightening than a lecture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manson, who has maintained his innocence, has been calling and  
writing Beattie frequently during recent weeks in preparation for 
the class. 
</P>
<P>
	Tate and four friends were butchered at her estate on Aug. 9,  
1969, and the following night, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were 
stabbed to death at their home. Both crime scenes were marked by 
bloody scrawlings of messages that prosecutors said was an effort 
to start a race war. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson and three of his followers were were convicted and  
sentenced to death. The sentences were changed to life in prison in 
1972 when a U.S. Supreme Court decision temporarily ended capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District  
Attorney's Office, said Manson has volunteered to help students 
before. ``He likes to interact with young people,'' she said. ``He 
thinks he can pass along something to them.''

<HEADLINE> Sony Has New PlayStation Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sony Corp. is adding more firepower to tighten  
its grip on the video game business. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony on Tuesday unveiled a new version of its popular  
PlayStation video game player that is twice as powerful as its 
closest rival, Nintendo 64, and promises much higher-quality 
graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	The new machine, for now known as PlayStation II, should be in  
stores in Japan next winter and in the United States by the fall of 
2000. Despite the long wait, the announcement of PlayStation II 
gives Sony a good chance to boost its already powerful share of the 
$6 billion video game player market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nintendo is surely working on their next-generation machine.  
But I don't think they will have it in the marketplace -- at least 
not in the U.S. -- before Sony,'' said Sean McGowan, an analyst at 
Gerard Klauer Mattison. 
</P>
<P>
	A Nintendo spokeswoman did not return calls seeking comment on  
the company's plans for upgrading its video game player. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony currently accounts for about 60 percent of the U.S. market  
for such machines, while Nintendo holds more than 30 percent and 
Sega stands at less than 5 percent, according to McGowan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega is trying to catch up to its larger rivals with the new  
Dreamcast game player, which began selling in Japan last November 
and will arrive in U.S. stores this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The new machines from both Sony and Sega use 128-bit processors,  
which provide four times the power of Sony's current PlayStation 
and twice as much as Nintendo 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony said the new PlayStation boasts higher resolution, faster  
processing speeds and greater memory capacity, which would 
translate into faster responses to commands and computer 
graphic-quality images. 
</P>
<P>
	The PlayStation II will store data on DVD-ROM discs, a step up  
from the more common CD-ROM disc used for the current generation of 
PlayStation software. 
</P>
<P>
	A key feature is that all games sold for the old system will be  
compatible with the updated console, so the hundreds of software 
titles available for the current PlayStation will not become 
obsolete overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony would not disclose a price for the new PlayStation, but  
analysts predicted strong sales if it sells near or below $300. The 
current PlayStation and Nintendo 64 both sell now for $129.99, but 
Sony has dominated sales because its games are cheaper and it 
offers many more choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony would not comment on whether it will reduce the price of  
the current PlayStation to prevent falling sales while consumers 
await the new version. The fact that existing games will work on 
the new machines should help keep sales brisk, especially if the 
price of the player is slashed, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't anticipate much of an impact. The current PlayStation  
is still selling extremely well. I think they're probably going to 
have another really good year out of it in '99,'' said John Taylor, 
an analyst with Arcadia Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	PlayStation is the fastest-selling product in Sony's 50-year  
history. More than 50 million units of the original PlayStation 
have been sold worldwide since its debut in Japan in 1994 and in 
the United States a year later, offsetting slumping sales of Sony's 
other consumer electronics products.

<HEADLINE> Marine Cable Car Case Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Prosecution and defense experts cast  
doubt Tuesday on the other's analysis of how fast a Marine jet was 
flying before it hit an Italian ski lift, sending 20 people to 
their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	After the brief session in the court-martial of Capt. Richard  
Ashby, lawyers for both sides began preparing final arguments, 
which were scheduled to begin Wednesday morning. An eight-man 
military jury will then decide Ashby's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecution expert Robert Duarte said the government's analysis  
produced ``highly correlated data'' that showed Ashby's EA-6B 
Prowler speeding along the route in the Alps last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense expert Jeff Edwards disagreed, saying the government's  
data was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has tried to show speed is an issue,'' Edwards  
said outside court. ``All of the witnesses so far have said speed 
is not an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>

	Ashby, 31, is accused of being reckless, flying too low and too  
fast. He is charged with involuntary manslaughter and other counts 
and could get 206 years in prison if convicted of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
	He contends that the jet's radar altimeter malfunctioned, that  
the ski lift was not on his map, and that he suffered from an 
optical illusion that made him think he was flying higher than he 
was.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Amish Labor Exemptions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amish families would get special exemptions to  
employ young people in settings the Labor Department deems 
hazardous under legislation the House passed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the bill, sent to the Senate on a voice vote, said  
the measure would help resolve a conflict between government 
regulations and Amish religious traditions, which call for 
youngsters to work in apprenticeship settings beyond eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is extremely important that we strike a delicate balance  
between honoring the differences between religions of this country 
and having a safe and healthy workplace,'' said Tim Roemer, D-Ind. 
``This legislation strikes this principal compromise between these 
two interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics questioned the wisdom of subjecting teen-agers to  
hazardous occupations and the constitutionality of exempting 
members of one religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad safety policy,'' said Rep. William Clay of Missouri,  
ranking Democrat of the House Education and Workforce Committee. 
``It's bad health policy. It's bad employment policy. It's bad 
constitutional policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would let Amish teen-agers work in sawmills,  
woodworking shops and other industries considered essential by the 
Amish but harmful by the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal child-protection laws prohibit children under 16 from  
working in manufacturing operations such as sawmills and children 
under 18 from working in other hazardous occupations, even for 
tasks that do not require operating mechanical equipment. Amish 
businesses have been fined thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish are known for shunning modern conveniences and taught  
to live apart from the world and abstain from worldly goods. Some 
150,000 Amish live in 22 states and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Their religious traditions forbid formal schooling beyond eighth  
grade, and youngsters are supposed to work with family and 
community members to gain hands-on experience in a craft. Although 
the Amish livelihood has traditionally been rooted in agriculture, 
many families have turned to woodworking and other small industries 
because of the growing costs of farming. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Amish view this work as part of their schooling,'' said  
Rep. Joseph Pitts, R-Pa., the bill's chief sponsor. ``The 
regulations have severely threatened the lifestyle and religion of 
this humble community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, teen-agers would be able to work in  
limited woodworking settings and still would be prohibited from 
directly operating mechanical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation passed the House last year but died in the  
Senate, partly over doubts about its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the labor committee,  
urged lawmakers to disregard the constitutional considerations, 
saying that was for the courts and not Congress to resolve.

<HEADLINE> Japan Probes Failed Bank's Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Three bankers and a businessman were arrested  
Wednesday in connection with the collapse of a bank in northern 
Japan, marking the first criminal charges against executives in the 
series of bank collapses over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, which went under in  
November 1997, Japanese police are also believed to be 
investigating other failed banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long-term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank were  
taken over by the government late last year after they were hobbled 
by a huge burden of bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of the Hokkaido prefectural police said police  
bought a charge of aggravated breach of trust against the three 
former Hokkaido Takushoku executives for extending more than $117 
million to hotel management firms starting in 1994, even though 
they allegedly knew that the loans were irrecoverable. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also arrested Yoichi Nakamura, president of the Therme  
group, on the same charge, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Therme International Hotel System and Therme International Hotel  
Sapporo received loans from Takushoku for a resort they were 
developing in Sapporo, 518 miles northwest of Tokyo. The 
development failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The four men face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Celebrate Military Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Thousands of Ethiopians poured into  
the streets Tuesday to celebrate their military gains last week 
over neighboring Eritrea and their victory against Italian 
colonizers a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In the capital, Addis Ababa, thousands of people waving  
Ethiopian flags sang and danced in the streets as they went to 
Meskel Square, or the Holy Cross Square. Police estimated the crowd 
at 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials claimed the celebrations took place  
throughout the Horn of Africa nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopian troops broke through Eritrean lines at Badme, where  
the fight between the two neighbors over their 620-mile border 
first erupted last May and 1,000 people were killed. The latest 
round of fighting erupted Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no new reports of fighting Tuesday between Ethiopia  
and Eritrea, which told the U.N. Security Council on Saturday that 
it had finally agreed to an African peace plan to end the dispute. 
The Ethiopians have not yet officially reacted to the Eritreans' 
concession. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1896, Ethiopian soldiers defeated an Italian army in the  
battle of Adwa in northern Ethiopia. Adwa is 50 miles south of the 
Badme region. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Italian officers in the battle of Adwa were either  
killed or captured, and the Italians' defeat by an African army 
sent shock waves through Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Ethiopians failed to drive the colonizers from Eritrea,  
which remained a colony until British troops chased away the 
Italians in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia and Italy signed several agreements but the border with  
Eritrea was never demarcated, leading to the current conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Italian defeat in the World War II, Eritrea was  
administered by Britain and then federated to Ethiopia by the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Emperor Haile Sellasie annexed Eritrea in 1962,  
triggering a 30-year war of independence. Eritrea won independence 
from Ethiopia in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Report, Pentagon Disagree by $300M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional report says it wouldn't cost a  
cent more to house military men and women recruits in separate 
barracks, but the Pentagon sees it costing $300 million plus. 
</P>
<P>
	After examining Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine training  
facilities around the country, the General Accounting Office 
concluded Monday that the military is generally meeting 
requirements that it house men and women separately in basic 
training, often by creating separated quarters in the same 
barracks. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is support in Congress for requiring the military to  
house men and women recruits in completely separate barracks, and 
armed services committees asked for an estimate of how much that 
would cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report concludes it wouldn't cost anything and that any  
construction over the next five years would be to house additional 
recruits, not because they have to be separated by gender. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army put the price tag at $271 million to provide separate  
barracks buildings for female recruits and the Navy's estimated $32 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force estimated that although it did not have to add  
barracks to make the change, it would have to halt planned 
renovations and incur some additional cost in operating another 
building at its only basic training site, Lackland Air Force Base, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Solis, GAO assistant director, said the Pentagon estimates  
are based on the idea of leaving large parts of barracks unused. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're saying you could probably move another troop or company  
of men into that bottom floor they would just leave vacant,'' he 
said. The GAO plan may not be ``what they would like to do,'' Solis 
said, ``but at the same time, we can't see where you would just 
leave 30 buildings basically vacant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen in June announced that men and  
women will continue to train together at boot camp throughout most 
of the military, but will have to sleep in separate quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	A law passed last year requires the services to provide separate  
and secure housing for male and female recruits with separate 
entrances and with sleeping and latrine areas separated by 
permanent walls. 
</P>
<P>
	The military wants to maintain some flexibility in how it does  
that and objects to being required to designate separate buildings 
for men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army, Navy and Air Force have chosen to conduct combined  
training with separate quarters but often in the same barracks so 
they can keep training units together. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a different course, the Marine Corps has separate  
training for men and women with generally separate barracks at its 
only training facility, Parris Island, S.C. Only one unit has men 
and women in the same building, but the women's bay is separated by 
alarmed doors and a security watch whenever it is occupied. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy trains all of its recruits at Great Lakes Naval Recruit  
Training Command in Illinois. The Army uses Fort McClellan, Ala., 
to conduct gender integrated training but plans to move that 
function to Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., this summer. It also uses Fort 
Jackson, S.C., and plans to use Fort Sill, Okla., beginning in May.

<HEADLINE> Fed. Anti-Carjacking Law Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today upheld the federal  
carjacking conviction of a New York man who says he never intended 
to seriously hurt the people whose cars he stole at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 7-2 vote, the justices ruled that a federal anti-carjacking  
law covers crimes with ``conditional intent'' to harm victims who 
refuse to comply with the robber's demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The law makes it a crime to take a motor vehicle by force ``with  
the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the court upheld Francois Holloway's conviction under that  
law, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, ``The intent requirement ... 
is satisfied when the government proves that at the moment the 
defendant demanded or took control over the driver's automobile the 
defendant possessed the intent to seriously harm or kill the driver 
if necessary to steal the car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holloway was sentenced to over 50 years in prison for his part  
in a carjacking ring that sold parts of stolen vehicles dismantled 
in a Queens ``chop shop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Holloway, on at least three occasions in the  
fall of 1994, confronted motorists with a gun and demanded that 
they surrender their car keys. When one man hesitated, Holloway 
punched him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	An accomplice testified that their plan was to steal cars  
without harming the drivers, but that he would have used his gun if 
any of the victims had given him a ``hard time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal judge who presided over Holloway's trial told jurors  
they could find the required intent if they thought Holloway would 
have seriously hurt victims who did not comply with his demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Holloway's  
conviction, ruling that such a common-sense interpretation was 
valid despite what it called the law's somewhat ambiguous language. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens wrote for the nation's highest court today that Congress  
surely meant to have the law cover such conditional intent to harm 
carjacking victims. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas disagreed. In a  
dissenting opinion for the two, Scalia said the law's wording makes 
it clear Congress meant to limit the law to crimes where the intent 
was certain, not conditional. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusually personal opinion, Scalia said, ``I have a friend  
whose father was killed, and whose mother was nearly killed, in 
just such an incident -- after the car had already been handed over. 
It is not at all implausible that Congress should direct its 
attention to this particularly savage sort of carjacking -- where 
killing the driver is part of the intended crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Holloway vs. U.S., 97-7164.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Stage Partial Recovery / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds mounted a partial recovery Tuesday as  
signs of weaker demand for new homes eased concerns about an 
inflationary spurt in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 25/32  
point, or $7.81 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.61 percent from late Monday's 
six-month high of 5.66 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains erased most of Monday's fall, but barely put a dent in  
the steep decline of the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds have been weighed down by a series of strong economic  
reports that may prompt the Federal Reserve to slow borrowing and 
spending with a boost in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears eased some on Tuesday as the Commerce Department  
reported that new home sales unexpectedly fell 5 percent in 
January, the second straight monthly decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates hurt bonds by making their yields less  
competitive, while inflation makes fixed-income investments less 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Monday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities rose 1/8 point to 3/16 point, while intermediate 
maturities rose 5/16 to 17/32, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.84 
points to 1,278.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.66 percent as the  
discount fell 0.03 percentage point from Monday's auction rate to 
4.54 percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.74 percent, as the 
discount fell 0.03 percentage point from Monday's auction rate to 
4.56 percent. One-year yields rose to 4.78 percent, while the 
discount was fell 0.09 percentage point to 4.57 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from 5.25 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/8 point to 124 1/32. The average yield 
to maturity held steady at 5.23 percent.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Mayor Quits Over Racial Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.C. (AP) -- The long-time mayor of this tiny coastal  
town resigned Tuesday over derogatory remarks he made about blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Town Council member Charles Jones said Mayor Joffree Leggett,  
81, gave him a resignation letter. A man who answered the phone at 
Leggett's home Tuesday hung up on a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal lawsuit against Trenton, about 90 miles southeast of  
Raleigh, accuses the town of 200 of denying blacks a voice on the 
town council and in town affairs through restrictive annexations 
policies. No annexations have occurred since the early 1900s. The 
town has 23 registered black voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Three adjacent unincorporated areas are predominantly black.  
</P>
<P>
	Leggett told The Free Press of Kinston in a story published Feb.  
24 that if three blacks were working together in a store, ``within 
a few years, they'd be stealing from each other and they'd be out 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not leaders. A black man would rather work for a white  
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Leggett told The Sun-Journal of New Bern that he was  
partially misquoted, he confirmed his comment about black 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit will continue with Leggett's departure, said Daniel  
Johnson Willis, one of six plaintiffs. Leggett was mayor for 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The state NAACP had called for Leggett's resignation. On Friday,  
the town council did the same, adopting a resolution saying Leggett 
``made certain reprehensible and derogatory comments.''

the tip of her husband's tongue when he tried to kiss and make up 
after an argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Geraldine Van Zandt, 35, was charged with mayhem and disorderly  
conduct. She initially told police that her husband, David Van 
Zandt, had bitten his own tongue during the argument Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A deputy noticed the bite mark was curved inward, however,  
indicating someone else had bitten the husband's tongue, a criminal 
complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor who treated the man also said he thought someone else  
had bitten off the end of the man's tongue ``based on the severity 
of the injury and the curvature of the bite,'' the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Zandt lost a piece of his tongue the size of a quarter.

<HEADLINE> Longtime Illinois St. Coach Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAL, Ill. (AP) -- Illinois State women's basketball coach Jill  
Hutchison said Tuesday she is resigning after 28 years, the longest 
tenure of any woman at an NCAA Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Redbirds posting an 8-20 record this season, Hutchison  
said it was time for a new coach. In her time at Illinois State, 
Hutchison was 460-323 record with 12 national tournament 
appearances, including three in the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our program needs a shot of energy and enthusiasm that a new  
coach can bring,'' Hutchison said. ``I strongly regret not having 
put a winning team on the floor the past two seasons. ... My 
decision is greatly influenced by the lack of success we have 
experienced. This program deserves better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison, 53, will stay on to work on special projects,  
including the choice of her successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson, a four-time national president of the Women's  
Basketball Coaches Association and three-time coach of the year in 
the Missouri Valley Conference, is credited by her peers as one of 
the early leaders in promoting women's college basketball to its 
current popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you come into the Missouri Valley, you have great respect  
for Jill for all she's done for basketball,'' said Drake coach Lisa 
Bluder. ``I've tried to model my development as a basketball coach 
after her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina coach Sylvia Hatchell called Hutchison a pioneer  
in women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been instrumental in changes and developments in  
women's basketball more than anyone I know of,'' Hatchell said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Fines Penny Hardaway $7,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Penny Hardaway of the Orlando Magic was fined  
$7,500 by the NBA on Tuesday for criticizing officials following a 
loss to the Miami Heat last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 84-78 defeat Sunday, Hardaway laced into the officials  
for failing to call enough fouls on Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't said one thing about the refs in my six years in  
Orlando, but I'm tired of it,'' Hardaway said after he made just 3 
of 14 shots and finished with 10 points. ``This is really 
ridiculous. I go 3-for-14 or 3-for-16 and half of those shots are 
plays where I get fouled and it isn't called. My stats are awful 
because of this stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of one particular play, when Hardaway thought he was fouled late  
in the game and with his team trailing by a point, he said: ``I 
went baseline and Dan Majerle got all arm. I got fouled right in 
front of the ref's face. I looked at him and he said, `Not now. Not 
in crunch time.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway indicated that he did not remember which official made  
that statement. The crew consisted of Ronnie Nunn, Sean Corbin and 
Rashan Michel.

<HEADLINE> HMO Debate Targets 'Necessary' Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Congress works toward passing a ``patient  
bill of rights'' to address frustration with HMOs, the battle is 
shifting to a central question: Who decides what medical care is 
really needed? 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors contend they need a legal guarantee that cost-conscious  
HMOs will not deny patients needed care. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies and business say doctors just want a blank  
check to spend money on what may or may not be the best treatment 
available. And they argue that consumers who want more health care 
covered should demand it, and pay for it, when negotiating 
contracts with insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress considered but could not agree on HMO legislation last  
year, but the chances are better this year, with a slew of bills 
introduced by both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the most contentious issue has been whether to give  
patients new rights to sue their health plans when the plans deny 
coverage. But insurers and business groups said Tuesday they are 
equally committed to defeating so-called ``medical necessity'' 
provisions that require plans to cover treatments if they are 
consistent with ``generally accepted principles'' or ``prevailing 
standards'' of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days before managed care dominance, none of this was an  
issue. Insurance companies generally paid for whatever doctors 
ordered. But health maintenance organizations and other managed 
care plans attempt to control costs by, among other things, denying 
what they believe to be unneeded care. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say the plans are turning down care that is, in fact,  
medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``This standard is increasingly challenged by health plans that  
determine medical necessity primarily in terms of financial 
considerations,'' Dr. Richard F. Corlin of the American Medical 
Association told a Senate committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA points to health insurance contracts that specifically  
give the HMO ``sole discretion'' to determine whether care is 
medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents respond that doctors and their Democratic allies are  
simply trying to restore a system where doctors ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the frustration is coming from the American Medical  
Association and frustration that HMOs can overrule their (doctors') 
positions,'' said Larry Atkins of the Corporate Health Care 
Coalition, a group of large businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	At separate briefings Tuesday, groups representing insurance  
companies and businesses argued that just because particular 
treatments are ``generally accepted,'' that doesn't mean they are 
best. 
</P>
<P>
	In certain communities, for instance, it may be ``generally  
accepted'' practice to treat certain breast cancer patients with 
radical mastectomy even if national experts instead recommend 
lumpectomy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Healthcare Leadership Council, a group of  
executives from hospitals, drug companies and other industry 
groups, point to evidence that many doctors do not follow 
procedures scientifically determined to be best. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's a dispute between a doctor and a health plan, the  
group said, patients should be able to appeal to a panel of experts 
outside the company. In fact, the council said it could support 
legislation that would require health plans to allow their patients 
binding, independent appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Insurance Association of America, which represents  
insurance companies, took a slightly different tack. Its president, 
Chip Khan, said consumers and their employers should insist on 
appeal rights as they choose health plans, if that's important to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers can walk with their dollars,'' Khan said. ``They're  
paying the premiums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that many companies already offer independent appeals,  
recognizing that this is what customers want. But he's opposed to 
government requiring it. 
</P>
<P>
	An insurance company, he added, has a responsibility to its  
other customers not to pay for unneeded care.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Encourages Lively 2000 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley said Tuesday  
that a lively race with Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic 
presidential nomination would be an ``energizing event'' and good 
for the party. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Bradley said it's far too early to draw  
distinctions with Gore, and that he feels no pressure to clear the 
field for a sitting vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Democrats, a string of potential candidates have opted not  
to oppose Gore, who holds a commanding lead in the battle for the 
party's nomination. Only Bradley has chosen to contest the race, 
and he's been campaigning steadily in key early states like Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Iowa in particular, a good battle in the caucuses is good  
for the party,'' Bradley said. ``It brings more people into the 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he's spoken with each of the hopefuls who opted not  
to run, and none have suggested he step aside for Gore. In Iowa, he 
argued, Democrats gain when there's a contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are interested in the Iowa Democratic Party,'' Bradley  
said. ``They want to have an energizing event. There's no better 
energizing event ... than a presidential caucus battle.''

<P>
	Cold fronts moving through the central United States were  
pushing foul weather into the Great Lakes through the central South 
today, while another storm system in the Northwest was building. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of inches of snow were forecast from northern Minnesota  
to northern Michigan, and rain changing to snow was due later today 
across southern Wisconsin and the rest of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	To the south, rain showers were likely across the Ohio Valley,  
with thunderstorms south of the Ohio River. Parts of western 
Kentucky south into Mississippi faced the risk of severe weather, 
with 70 mph winds, heavy rain, large hail and isolated tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Light rain fell early in Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and northern  
Missouri and some flurries were reported in the Dakotas and western 
Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	But a ridge of high pressure building in the Rockies and Plains  
was forecast to spread across those regions, though winds could 
gust to 30 mph in the central Plains as a cold front passes 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	Another in a series of storm systems was moving into the western  
United States, bringing afternoon rain and higher elevation snows 
from western Oregon south into northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 8 inches of snow could fall on the Oregon Cascades and  
northern Sierra Nevadas, while coastal rain may cause flooding, 
particularly in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Washington state should remain dry under cloudy skies,  
with clear to partly cloudy skies elsewhere in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	In the East, light flurries were possible over northern New  
England as low pressure moved out of the Northeast and the rest of 
the Northeast expected clearing skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunny weather was due from the mid-Atlantic states to Florida.  
</P>
<P>
	Highs today were forecast in the 20s and 30s from the northern  
Plains across to northern New England, and in the northern Rockies; 
in the 60s, 70s and even some 80s from California across the 
southern states and as far north as Kentucky and Virginia; and in 
the 40s and 50s elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures Monday ranged from a high of 93 degrees at Del Rio,  
Texas -- breaking the 1972 record of 89 -- to a low of 7 degrees in 
Grand Marais, Minn.

	Pat Buchanan Running for President  
</P>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Firebrand conservative Pat Buchanan said  
today he will make his third try for the Republican presidential 
nomination, promising to ``clean up all that pollutes'' America. 
The former Nixon aide and CNN commentator ran for the GOP nod in 
1992 and 1996. Buchanan attacked the Clinton White House, calling 
it a ``place (used) to exploit women,'' and called for a moratorium 
on immigration. But many GOP strategists believe Buchanan peaked 
four years ago when he finished ahead of eventual GOP nominee Bob 
Dole in the New Hampshire primary.

	Foreign Tourists Killed in Uganda

<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Four women and one man were killed today  
as Ugandan troops battled with Rwandan rebels during an attempt to 
rescue 15 foreign tourists abducted over the weekend. The 
nationalities of the dead were not immediately released, but three 
Americans, six Britons, three New Zealanders, an Australian and a 
Swiss woman were among those kidnapped, government officials said. 
A Canadian citizen also was taken. The tourists were kidnapped by 
Rwandans at campgrounds on the edge of Bwindi National Park, known 
as the Impenetrable Forest, the starting point for visitors hoping 
to glimpse the 320 rare mountain gorillas that remain along the 
border mountain's slopes.

resume in two weeks. Adem Demaci, the political adviser for the 
Kosovo Liberation Army, was outspoken in his opposition to the 
U.S.-backed peace plan for Kosovo, saying it fell short of 
independence for the province. Meanwhile, Yugoslav forces pounded 
an area along Kosovo's border with Macedonia with tank and mortar 
fire today, pressing an offensive that has driven thousands of 
ethnic Albanian civilians from their homes.

	Polls: Support for Tax Cuts Soft

<P>
	GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A new poll shows about half of those  
surveyed support using the projected budget surplus for a tax cut. 
The poll conducted for The Associated Press by ICR of Media showed 
49 percent of American adults said a tax cut is the best use for 
the surplus left after Congress sets aside a large share for Social 
Security. An additional 35 percent chose making payments on the 
national debt, while 13 percent chose spending more on government 
programs. Nearly half of those surveyed said education should be 
the top priority if money is earmarked for programs instead of tax 
cuts.

suspended indefinitely by Macomb Community College because of a 
complaint of sexual harassment. A student filed a complaint in 
November, saying she found John Bonnell's words ``dehumanizing, 
degrading and sexually explicit.'' Bonnell says it's hard not to 
teach some literature without using a few saucy words. He said he 
begins the semester by warning students that graphic language may 
be used in class. School policy defines sexual harassment as 
``unwelcome verbal or physical conduct.''

Hilton, 52, was arrested Saturday after telling police she set the 
Feb. 24 fire, apparently to deflect the suspicion that had settled 
on her son, Charles Loayza. Witnesses said Loayza, 22, had 
threatened to torch the building where his ex-girlfriend and her 
two children lived. Ms. Hilton has been institutionalized for 
mental illness and has suffered from seizures since age 5, her

<HEADLINE> Rose Pulls for His Son As a Dodger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Pete Rose kept a low profile, sitting  
quietly in the stands at Dodgertown watching his son play in an 
intrasquad game. He hopes to be watching Pete Jr. playing in Los 
Angeles one of these days. 
</P>
<P>
	And Pete Jr. says it's going to happen, later if not sooner.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got what it takes,'' Pete Jr. said Tuesday. ``I  
plan on making the team. I don't plan on playing in (Triple-A) 
Albuquerque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if manager Davey Johnson sends him down?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bust my tail,'' Pete Jr. said. ``I'm going to be in LA at  
some time. I'm a guy who's got some pop. Left-handed pop looks to 
be a little scarce around here. I think Davey Johnson likes tough 
guys. I come to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Rose, the career hits leader who agreed to lifetime  
ban for gambling, called Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone 
during the winter to request a favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete asked me to give his son a chance,'' Malone recalled.  
``I've known both of them for years. They both have huge hearts. I 
figured it was a win-win situation. I told Pete it would be tough 
for (Junior) to make the team. He said, `No special treatment, all 
we ask is a chance.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's the deal. The younger Rose, a 29-year-old whose only  
major league experience was a brief spell with Cincinnati Reds 18 
months ago, signed a minor league contract with an invitation to 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	And here he is, giving it his best shot.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can tell me to stop chasing my dream,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He knows how to play, he's not going to give up,'' the elder  
Rose said. ``He's just now figuring out his m.o.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose referred to the change his son went through between the  
1996 and 1997 seasons. Essentially, Pete Jr., went from a clone of 
his father to a power hitter, bulking up in the gym from 200 pounds 
to around 230. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bigger than he is,'' the younger Rose said. ``It took me  
longer to figure things out. I had to make a change, and I did. 
Basically, I've been at this for only a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recently spent a week with his father, and it helped as he  
entered spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a plus when you have the hit-king on your side,'' he  
said. ``He's just unbelievable, a great person, a great dad, a 
great coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, obviously, a big fan of his son.  
</P>
<P>
	The younger Rose had his best season by far in 1997, hitting  
.308 with 25 homers and 98 RBIs in 112 games for Double-A 
Chattanooga. He was called up by the Reds and made his only 
big-league start on Labor Day, going 1-for-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd in Cincinnati, where Rose's father played most of his  
career and later managed, was 31,920. The majority of those tickets 
were sold after it was announced Rose was playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reds didn't give him a chance,'' dad said. ``They used him  
to make some money. I know it wasn't (owner) Marge (Schott). Marge 
likes Pete. If nothing else, he paid to go to spring training the 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't happen that way, and after the younger Rose was asked  
to go to Double-A in 1998, he refused and asked for his release. He 
wound up the year playing for the New Jersey Jackals of the 
independent Northeast League. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Rose remains somewhat bitter.  
</P>
<P>
	``Playing in Cincinnati was special, unbelievable,'' he said.  
``There will only be one thing better -- when I go there as a 
visitor and get the job done. And it's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The Dodgers) go to Cincinnati in May. I've already had dreams  
about playing against them, coming up in a big situation and 
getting a key hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite what happened, the elder Rose said he still pulls for  
the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play on Pete Rose Way, man,'' he said. ``I just don't  
like the way certain people treated him. I'm a Dodger fan now. I 
just don't want to make those flights to Albuquerque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Rose spoke, his son, a left-handed hitter wearing No. 74,  
came to the plate to face Onan Masaoka, a left-handed pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let you know if he's my son after he hits,'' Rose said to  
a fan. ``If he gets a hit, he's my son. If he doesn't, he's your 
son.''

<HEADLINE> Alcatel To Buy Internet Firm Xylan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French telecommunications company Alcatel SA is  
buying the California-based Internet equipment maker Xylan Corp. 
for about $2 billion in cash in a move that will boost Alcatel's 
profile in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase will allow Alcatel to strengthen its position as an  
equipment supplier to U.S. telephone companies, using Xylan's 
expertise in making switches and routing gear needed for high-speed 
data networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alcatel is implementing a comprehensive strategy to become a  
key worldwide player in the Internet field,'' Alcatel Chairman 
Serge Tchuruk said today in a statement announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	With the volume of data traffic worldwide growing much more  
rapidly than old-fashioned voice telephone calls, established 
companies such as Alcatel are increasingly investing in Internet 
equipment makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel already owns 6.5 percent of Xylan, which was founded in  
1993 and is based in Calabasas, Calif. Alcatel bought the stake in 
Xylan from an investment in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It has agreed to pay $37 a share for Xylan in a cash tender  
offer beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is  
subject to clearance by antitrust regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to be completed in the beginning of April.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Kim, Xylan's president and chief executive, said his  
compny ``has grown beyond anyone's expectations over the last five 
years'' and the deal with Alcatel will give Xylan a ``dramatic 
boost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Xylan has acquired more than 4,000 customers and annual revenue  
has risen to $348 million in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview today, Kim said the deal will allow  
Xylan to compete more effectively against larger competitors such 
as Cisco Systems Corp., Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he was frustrated because though Xylan continued to  
grow, the stock price didn't. ``Today's investors are favoring the 
large companies,'' he said. ``They see us as still small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said Xylan will also give Alcatel the boost it needs to make  
inroads into the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a very little presence in the U.S. data and voice  
(industry) and they're going to use us as a vehicle to penetrate 
into the U.S. market,'' Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris-based Alcatel opeates in 130 countries.

<HEADLINE> USOC Responds to Salt Lake Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Olympics and their scandals are in the  
spotlight in the nation's capital, and a potentially earthshaking 
encore could be in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee planned to respond today to a  
scathing ethics panel report on management of the games and the 
corruption it has fostered, with recommendations expected on how to 
make sure the bribery case of Salt Lake City's 2002 Winter Olympics 
never recurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricter rules for American cities bidding for the Olympics and  
tighter reins on USOC programs could be among the items discussed 
by committee president Bill Hybl at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate Commerce Committee announced an April 14  
hearing into the ``scandals plaguing the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, a committee member and the author of the  
federal law governing the Olympics in the United States, is 
considering a bill that would hit the International Olympic 
Committee right in the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	It would strip the IOC of its tax-exempt status, limit tax  
deductions for IOC sponsorship and move control of billion-dollar 
U.S. television rights fees from the IOC to the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Committee chairman Sen. John McCain said witnesses for  
the hearing would be announced later closer to the April date. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl discussed possible changes with the USOC executive  
committee in a conference call Tuesday night, and it was uncertain 
what specific programs he might announce. 
</P>
<P>
	But sources familiar with the committee said that Hybl would  
recommend far-reaching reforms that would clamp down on the type of 
actions that led to the million-dollar vote-buying scheme in Salt 
Lake's victorious quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	More open meetings, internal policy changes on bid-city  
policies, tighter oversight of foreign athlete training programs 
and more athlete involvement in USOC decisions were among the 
topics that Hybl might include in his program, according to the 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the changes could be accomplished by executive order,  
but others could require changes to the USOC Constitution, which 
could not be done until an October board meeting, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC board meetings already are open, and committee staff and  
officials must abide by an 11-page ethics code instituted at the 
start of Hybl's term in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl's conference also was expected to address the ethics  
committee report on Salt Lake presented Monday by former Senate 
Majority Leader George Mitchell, which said the Salt Lake scandal 
grew from a ``culture of improper gift giving'' in the Olympic 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	While it criticized the USOC and Salt Lake Olympic officials, it  
saved its harshest words for the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the conduct ``tolerated by the IOC is potentially  
illegal and inevitably corruptive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC should no sooner tolerate improper gifts by candidate  
cities to its members than it would tolerate such gifts by athletes 
to judges,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said the USOC should open an independent office  
to oversee American bid committees; bar bid and candidate cities 
from international assistance programs and strictly follow 
guidelines for USOC-run programs; and strengthen guidelines and 
contracts for U.S. cities seeking the games.

<HEADLINE> Group To Help Death Row Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- When Ronaldo Cruz was freed from death row three  
years ago, it did not mark the end of his troubles -- just the 
beginning of new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had nothing,'' said Cruz, who was released after he was  
acquitted during a third trial for the 1983 rape and murder of a 
10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had promises of a job, promises of help, and all those  
promises were broken,'' he said. ``It took me a long time to 
recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Cruz is banding together with other men freed from Illinois'  
death row to make sure others do not go through the same trauma. 
Cruz's new organization, which does not yet have a name, will aid 
ex-convicts who faced execution and help prisoners they believe are 
innocent but still face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Cruz in the organization are Dennis Williams, Perry  
Cobb, Darby Tillis and Dickey Gaines, all freed from death row 
after new evidence found they did not commit the crimes for which 
they were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be here, now, for our brothers and sisters who get  
out,'' Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people have been freed from Illinois' death row since the  
state reestablished the death penalty in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The plight of Anthony Porter, released Feb. 5 after nearly 16  
years on Death Row, brought attention to the problems faced by 
those newly freed. Porter was released after another man confessed 
on videotape to the crime; the new suspect was uncovered by 
Northwestern University student journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Black Contractors United announced Monday it has found an  
entry-level construction job for Porter, which pays $23.67 an hour. 
Porter also will get counseling, according to spokesman Calvin 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz will head the new group, which will operate temporarily out  
of his home in the Chicago suburb of Cicero. He said advisors to 
the organization will include state Rep. Coy Pugh, who is 
sponsoring legislation that would impose a moratorium on executions 
in Illinois, and Bill Ryan, head of the Death Penalty Moratorium 
Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz, 35, was twice sentenced to death and imprisoned for the  
1983 killing of Jeanine Nicarico before being acquitted at his 
third trial in 1995 by a judge who was highly critical of 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	A March 9 trial date has been set for seven law enforcement  
veterans accused of railroading him.

<HEADLINE> Feds Say 'Condo King' Hid Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Federal authorities thought they had settled  
things when they put the ``Condo King'' away for crooked real 
estate dealings in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	But now they are back on William Lilly's case, alleging he  
rebuilt his empire from behind bars, where he made nearly 10,000 
phone calls in one 10-month period, including 3,000 to the 
girlfriend he trained in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's highly unusual telephone contact,'' Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Christopher Alberto said Tuesday. ``It suggests that more 
than just personal contact is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reason the government is so interested in Lilly's business  
dealings is that it wants him to repay the money he owes from his 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly was a wildly successful developer in the 1980s, building  
thousands of condos in Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire 
before declaring bankruptcy and serving 3 1/2 years in prison for bank 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his release on probation in 1997, Lilly, 53, has been  
under court order to pay $5 million in restitution for defaulted 
mortgage loans. He says he can afford only about $1,500 per month 
and will need more than 275 years to pay the total off. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say they believe Lilly does have the money and is  
hiding it with the help of his girlfriend, Valerie Kaan, and three 
of his associates. Authorities have asked a judge to order all four 
to answer questions about their finances and dealings with Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kaan, who went from health-club employee to high-flying  
developer while dating the former owner of Condo King Inc., now 
employs him at her company, which has bought up condos in 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Florida in the past 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The two now live with their two children in an elegant Lynnfield  
home they call ``Camelot,'' Alberto said, adding that prosecutors 
don't believe the ``rags-to-riches'' story that has pushed Ms. 
Kaan's net worth from $30,000 in 1993 to more than $2 million in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue now before the court is whether we can demonstrate  
some basis for the allegation that various parties are holding 
assets for him or assisting him to run his real estate business,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kaan does not have a published phone number, and attorneys  
for Lilly and Ms. Kaan did not immediately return calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, authorities contend that from Pennsylvania's  
Allenwood federal prison, known to some as a ``country club'' for 
white-collar criminals, Lilly directed the activities of Ms. Kaan 
and the three other associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly -- who was known as the ``King of Telephones'' among prison  
officials -- made more than 9,600 calls from Allenwood between 
January and October 1996, according to court documents. Prisoners 
at Allenwood can make unlimited calls if they have money in their 
commissary account.

<HEADLINE> Government Calls Intel a Monopolist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Portending a bitter legal struggle, the  
government is outlining its pending antitrust case against Intel 
Corp., the world's largest manufacturer of computer processors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission portrayed Intel as a monopolist  
that bullied at least three other companies until they surrendered 
valuable secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Intel rejected the FTC's characterization, arguing  
that even the government's own expert economist cannot point to any 
rivals harmed by its behavior, which it called ``fundamentally 
fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's lawyers, in legal paperwork made public Monday, called  
the pending case before an administrative law judge ``an assault on 
fundamental antitrust principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Intel and the FTC outlined their legal strategies Monday  
for the company's upcoming hearing, which starts March 9 and is 
expected to last six to 10 weeks. Together with the government's 
antitrust case in nearby federal court against Microsoft Corp., the 
legal actions confront two of the most important companies in the 
nation's technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC alleges that Intel illegally withheld from three  
companies advanced technical information about its upcoming 
microprocessors to ``extort'' valuable technology that the 
companies developed independently. 
</P>
<P>
	It called the company's actions ``a raw exercise of monopoly  
power to muscle competitors into signing over intellectual property 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply competing on the merits was insufficient,'' FTC lawyers  
wrote. ``Intel's victims had no choice but to accede to its 
demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which now owns Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, with $26.2 billion in sales last year, makes processors  
for more than 80 percent of the world's computers and last week 
introduced its fastest chip ever, the Pentium III. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said ``any hope of meaningful challenge'' to Intel's  
dominance relies on other companies developing rival technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 71-page filing that quotes the government's own expert  
economist more than anyone else, Intel did not deny that it 
withheld technical data about upcoming products. 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel contended it was legal for the company to decide which  
secrets to disclose to its customers about its upcoming products. 
That information typically was contained within ``color books'' -- 
with red covers for the most sensitive and yellow covers for less 
important paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel lawyers accused the FTC of trying ``to prevent Intel from  
using its intellectual property to barter in value-for-value 
commercial exchanges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the government's antitrust case comes during a  
period of unprecedented competition facing Intel from rival 
chipmakers, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National 
Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, an industry report showed consumers bought more  
computers in January with AMD processors than Intel -- knocking 
Intel from the No. 1 spot for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any reader of personal computer ads today can readily see that  
Intel faces intense competition,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said the government's own economist, Harvard University  
professor Frederic M. Scherer, found no evidence that innovation in 
the computer industry has suffered. Scherer also is quoted as 
calling Intel's behavior ``unfair'' but agreeing that its actions 
haven't directly affected chip prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Scherer predicted that Intel's efforts on the industry  
will ``unravel over a period of 10 or so years, and it's just too 
early to assess those consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel called that ``not a basis for imposing antitrust  
liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company indicated previously its witnesses will include  
Andrew Grove, Intel's high-profile co-founder and chairman, and 
Craig Barrett, who took over as chief executive officer last year.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Slightly Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen early  
Wednesday, while Tokyo's main stock index advanced slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.12 yen in early trading, up 0.04 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo but below its level of 120.23 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 10.55 points, or 0.08 percent, to  
13,931.06 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 300.69 points, or 2.11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved in a narrow range,  
lacking clear direction amid a lack of major market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants said they were somewhat cautious ahead of a  
Bank of England meeting later Wednesday and the European Central 
Bank's meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.04 yen, up from  
131.08 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei index started slightly higher as  
investors scooped up shares following Tuesday's fall in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But trading was likely to remain calm as many investors refrain  
from activity to monitor corporate earnings forecasts and overseas 
markets before the end of Japan's fiscal year on Mar. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	There remains some fear of further unwinding of  
cross-shareholdings and arbitrage selling, traders said. The former 
was behind the tumble in prices Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies sold shares they traditionally hold in other  
companies, as keeping them carries fewer business relationship and 
financial benefits than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 3.46 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,088.62 
points. The TOPIX closed down 15.73 points, or 1.42 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
fell to 1.745 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.805 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.43 yen from 99.96 yen.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Stocks End Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices fell on Wall Street Tuesday, giving up  
strong early gains after a pessimistic sales forecast from computer 
maker Micron Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.17 to 9,297.61, its  
fifth decline in the last seven trading days. The blue chips 
fluctuated throughout the session, rising as much as 96 points 
before giving up their gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow derived what strength it had Tuesday from  
Hewlett-Packard, which rose 2 3/4 to 68 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard, which makes a diverse range of 29,000 different  
products, said it will split into two separate companies, one for 
Hewlett-Packard's computer and imaging businesses and the other to 
include its testing and measuring, components, chemical analysis 
and medical segments. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the move would give Hewlett-Packard more power to  
boost all its business lines, while at the same time making its 
stock more available to a wider range of investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Dow components had a mixed day. Citigroup dropped 2 1/4 to  
59, although fellow bank and Dow component J.P. Morgan gained 7/16 
to 112 1/16, as interest rates fell in the bond market. The yield 
on the Treasury's 30-year bond dropped to 5.61 percent from 5.67 
percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar fell 1 3/4 to 47 7/16. Union Carbide rose 3 1/8 to 44  
13/16 on persistent takeover rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Many technology stocks fell, pushing the Nasdaq composite, which  
is heavily weighted in technology shares, down 36.15 to 2,259.03, 
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index down 10.66 to 1,225.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks fell after Micron Electronics said its  
second-quarter earnings will fall below first-quarter results 
because of slower PC sales. Micron Electronics' shares were down 2 5/8 
to 11 13/16 in Nasdaq trading. Shares of its parent company, Micron 
Technology, fell 3 1/4 at 54 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictions of lower personal computer sales have rattled  
technology stocks for several sessions. Compaq Computer dropped 
19/32 to 31 19/32 and was the most active NYSE issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said Tuesday its index of future economic  
activity rose 0.5 percent to 106.9 in January from a revised level 
of 106.4 in December, a gain attributed in part to rising stock 
prices. The increase in the Leading Indicators Index was 
interpreted as a sign that the U.S. economy will continue growing 
through at least mid-year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was tempered somewhat by news from the Commerce  
Department that new home sales slipped 5 percent in January, 
although they remained at very high levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin.  
Volume on the NYSE was moderately heavy at 903.72 million shares, 
up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot was airline stocks, which climbed on heavy  
volume after Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. boosted its rating on three 
carriers. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 1 3/4 to 57 7/8; 
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, rose 3 3/8 to 65 3/8 and Continental 
Airlines' Class B shares rose 15/16 to 37. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.49 to 582.94, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.92 to 699.21. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.04 to 394.43. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, the Nikkei 225 stock average fell 2.11  
percent amid concern about flagging corporate earnings in Japan. In 
Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt rose 0.41 percent, the FT-SE 100 
in London ended flat, while the CAC in Paris rose 0.41 percent.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Southern Fires Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATESBORO, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia Southern fired men's basketball  
coach Gregg Polinsky on Tuesday after he failed to produce a 
winning season during his four-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the move Tuesday, athletic director Sam Baker said  
``the determination has been made to move the Eagle program in 
another direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being hired in 1995, the former Alabama assistant went  
37-46, including 11-17 last season. Polinsky had no previous head 
coaching experience when hired, but was the recruiting director for 
Alabama and had been promoted to assistant head coach the season 
before he left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles never finished above fourth place in the Southern  
Conference, had only one player named All-Southern Conference under 
Polinsky, and didn't qualify for postseason play.

general election defeat in 1994, died Monday of cancer at age 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Heerma took over the CDA leadership during its first spell in  
opposition following the party's general election defeat, a loss 
which ended a run of popularity that saw the party or one of its 
predecessors included in every ruling Dutch coalition this century. 
</P>
<P>
	Heerma was forced to leave the post in 1997 by a party  
disappointed by its low profile in parliament. He was replaced by 
Jaap de Hoop Scheffer.

<P>
	LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- John Lusk, a major developer of  
Southern California housing, offices and commercial malls starting 
with the post-World War II boom, died Sunday at age 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Lusk built 40,000 homes and a huge personal fortune after  
leaving the banking business in 1946. Forbes magazine listed him 
among the nation's richest people in 1987, when his worth 
approached $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also a philanthropist, contributing millions of dollars  
to education, medical and social programs in Southern California 
and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Lusk worked 21 years with then-Security Pacific Bank, and  
eventually rose to vice president of its Beverly Hills office 
before quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	He later assembled a group of craftsmen to build high-end  
housing in Beverly Hills, Brentwood and Bel Air. He later turned to 
affordable tract housing in southern suburbs of Los Angeles and 
Orange County. By the 1960s he diversified, adding office buildings 
and shopping malls to his projects. 
</P>
<P>
	His fortunes rose steadily until the late '80s when he began a  
huge project near Lake Elsinore, the 1,977-acre Menifee planned 
community designed for 3,404 homes, two golf courses and a lake. 
But sales stalled as a recession grew in 1990, and by 1992 Lusk 
gave up chairmanship of the company he built. Three of his four 
children remain active in the Lusk Co.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charles Morey, a retired sports director for The  
Associated Press Broadcast Department, died Tuesday after a series 
of illnesses. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Morey joined the AP in 1945 in New York as a sports writer for  
the new division that provided stories and scripts to radio 
stations. During his career, it grew to serve television as well as 
radio, providing video, audio and graphics along with scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	He previously had been with United Press as a member of its  
racing wire staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Morey took over as the department's sports director in 1954 and  
authored ``The Sportsman,'' a sharply written daily script of news 
and analysis that was carried by many broadcasters.

<HEADLINE> Packers Cancel Stadium Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers said Monday they  
will cancel a stadium-expansion plan because of a need for spending 
money on players' contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Ron Wolf has assurances that ``we would give him  
everything he needed to build a competitive team,'' club president 
Bob Harlan said. ``We owe that to him and (coach) Ray Rhodes and 
our fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cancelation affects two phases of a $75 million construction  
program at Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase included remodeling the press box, widening a  
concourse area, opening an apparel shop and adding concession 
stands. The second involved building a dining hall, raising the 
south-end scoreboard and altering club seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The team hoped to finance the work through a stock sale. By  
1998, the sale produced only $24 million toward a goal of $80 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers announced during the weekend an increase in ticket  
prices, saying more money is needed for players' contracts. For 
most seats, the price this fall rises between $5 and $7. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's budget restrictions similarly make it wise to invest  
construction money in personnel, Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided, rather than put it in concrete, we would put it  
into the football field,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Shopkeeper Egged Over Ho Poster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- A Vietnamese shopkeeper who angered  
residents by displaying a poster of Ho Chi Minh in his video store 
was egged as he attempted to open his business. 
</P>
<P>
	Police escorted Truong Van Tran away in a squad car after  
Monday's confrontation with 25 protesters in Little Saigon. No 
arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got him away from the scene he became ill,'' Lt. Bill  
Lewis said. ``He started vomiting and complained about his heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tran, 37, was treated and released from a hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	Tran has said he put up the flag and portrait of the late  
communist leader because he wanted to encourage Vietnamese to view 
their homeland in a new way. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters have gathered outside Tran's HiTek store since  
mid-January, when residents learned about the display inside. A 
judge initially ordered him to take down the items but then 
reversed her decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran, who was slapped or punched at least twice in previous  
confrontations with protesters, re-hung the flag and poster in his 
store on Feb. 20 as 200 police officers protected him. There were 
1,500 demonstrators outside the shop. 
</P>
<P>
	As of last week, police overtime to keep peace at the store has  
cost the city $109,000, Lewis said.

<HEADLINE> Chaos Erupts in Alabama Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The Alabama Senate erupted in chaos  
Tuesday when the Republican lieutenant governor ignored the shouts 
and shaking fists of Democrats and gaveled through new rules that 
restore much of his power to control the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate president pro tem, a Democrat, was so furious about  
his loss of power that he threatened to have the governor, also a 
Democrat, call out the National Guard and to begin impeachment 
proceedings against Lt. Gov. Steve Windom. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom, the first Republican elected lieutenant governor this  
century, lost most of the traditional powers of the Senate's 
presiding officer in January during an organizational session 
controlled by new Democratic Gov. Don Siegelman and his allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom, taking it back on a quick voice-vote that set off  
howling protests, said, ``An important, necessary step was taken 
today in the name of democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate President Pro Tem Lowell Barron said, ``They have  
done nothing but create anarchy and chaos. We are fearful of giving 
this power to a madman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules, among other things, allow Windom to appoint six  
new Senate committees to consider all major bills and let him 
decide which committee considers each piece of legislation. But the 
rules could be rewritten again when the Senate meets on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 1999 regular session started at noon Tuesday, Windom gave  
an emotional speech about how his opponents had tried to destroy 
his family during last year's campaign with unfounded allegations 
by a former prostitute. Then he talked about how he wanted to use 
the gavel to make sure there were no second-class senators and that 
no senators had a death grip on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate is in terrible shape. There is still blood on the  
floor,'' said education lobbyist Paul Hubbert, who has been around 
the Legislature for 30 years.

the Senate impeachment trial, offers the nation her apology ``for 
my part in this past year's ordeal.'' Lewinsky, who received

the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO analysis also says 
Clinton's budget would leave surpluses $73 billion smaller than he 
says they would be over the next five years. The study by Congress' 
nonpartisan budget office is sure to be used by congressional 
Republicans to argue that the $1.77 trillion budget that Clinton 
proposed last month spends more and saves less than he claims.

<HEADLINE> End of U.S. Debt Seen conceivable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is on the threshold of a  
truly remarkable turnaround in financial fortunes: the tantalizing 
prospect that the booming economy could make the federal government 
debt-free in just 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	And it could happen, for only the second time in the nation's  
history, with seemingly no heavy lifting. 
</P>
<P>
	If politicians simply leave current policies alone, the  
president's Office of Management and Budget projects the $3.7 
trillion debt held by the public will be wiped out in 2014. The 
Congressional Budget Office is even more optimistic, predicting 
publicly held debt could be gone by 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	With politicians eager for tax cuts and more spending, no one  
expects lawmakers actually to leave well enough alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress over the long haul abhors surpluses. They will be  
dispensed in some fashion, either as tax cuts or increased 
spending,'' predicts Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, both President Clinton and the Republicans who  
control Congress are pledging to use the bulk of future surpluses -- 
roughly two-thirds -- to reduce the national debt as a way to shore 
up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics note that leaves the other third of the $4.5 trillion  
in projected future surpluses for spending increases or tax cuts. 
And that means both parties are, in essence, already running behind 
the debt paydown schedule that would occur if there are no changes 
in policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 2014, the year the OMB projects that debt held by the public  
could be eliminated with no changes in policy, Clinton's budget 
instead sees a publicly held debt of $1.17 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is even worse if the total national debt is  
considered. That figure now is $5.6 trillion -- a total that 
includes the $3.7 trillion in debt held by the public and the $1.9 
trillion in debt held by the government in trust funds, primarily 
Social Security's. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's complex plan to shore up Social Security, the  
government IOUs held by the retirement program would actually 
increase -- an approach Republicans insist amounts to double 
counting. 
</P>
<P>
	After five years, the national debt under Clinton's plan,  
including the extra IOUs for Social Security, will grow to $6.8 
trillion, compared to $5.9 trillion under the OMB forecast with no 
policy changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration defends the extra IOUs as a way to lock in,  
for Social Security, benefits of paying down the public debt. 
Private economists generally are neutral, arguing that because the 
trust funds exist only as bookkeeping entries, it's the debt held 
by the public that actually matters for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On that point, economists generally give the administration high  
marks for using the bulk of the surpluses to pay down the public 
debt, and thus put the government on a sounder footing to meet 
future retirement demands of 73 million baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently told Congress  
the best use for surpluses would be shrinking the national debt, 
thus freeing money for investment by private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``By wiping out the debt held by the public, we increase  
national savings, keep interest rates low, build our capital stock 
and fuel long-term growth,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's national 
economic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also stresses that reducing the  
public debt will trim the government's interest bill. Because of 
skyrocketing deficits during the Reagan years -- overall, the debt 
held by the public quadrupled in two decades -- interest is now the 
government's third-biggest expense, behind Social Security and 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest payments accounted for 15 cents of every budget dollar  
in 1997. In all, they totaled $243 billion, which bought not a 
single battleship nor paper clip. Interest payments this year will 
amount to 11 percent of the budget. Clinton projects they will drop 
to 2 percent in 2014 before disappearing in 2018, the year he says 
the public debt will disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO forecasts public debt gone by 2012. But it also notes  
that era will be short-lived as escalating payments to retirees put 
the nation back in debt by 2040. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, all long-range forecasts need to be taken with a  
grain of salt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, with a good economy, we have had unrelentingly good  
news, but that could change quickly,'' former CBO director Robert 
Reischauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the experience of President Andrew Jackson, the only  
president to eliminate the debt, should also serve as a cautionary 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1832 campaign for the White House, Jackson called the  
debt a ``national curse'' and in 1835 fulfilled his pledge to wipe 
it out, creating a surplus of $440,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But even before he left office, the debt was rising again as the  
country entered a six-year recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paying off the national debt doesn't automatically mean  
economic good times,'' historian John Steele Gordon said. ``After 
Jackson did it, the country went into the longest recession in its 
history.''

	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Ugandan army troops trying to rescue up  
to 15 kidnapped foreign tourists traded gunfire today with the 
Rwandan rebels holding them. Five tourists were killed in the 
crossfire and seven rescued. Three Americans were confirmed to have 
been among those kidnapped late Sunday, government officials said. 
The tourists were abducted at campgrounds on the edge of Bwindi

Albanian civilians from their homes. The days-old operation appears 
to be an ominous military effort to control a strategic artery in 
the Serbian province, even as international officials struggle to 
contain the fighting and seal up a peace deal. Yugoslav troops and 
tanks have been massing at the border, and a bridge connecting 
Macedonia and Kosovo is mined -- preparations either to prevent NATO 
forces from coming in, or keep diplomatic monitors and refugees 
from getting out.

<HEADLINE> Mazeroski Makes `Defense' for Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Bill Mazeroski, arguably the best  
defensive player in baseball history, still thinks there's just as 
much room for a glove man in the Hall of Fame as there is for a big 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Just not this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski, who played second base for the Pittsburgh Pirates  
with as much skill and creativity as Ozzie Smith did shortstop for 
St. Louis, said Tuesday he thinks the Hall of Fame will someday 
recognize defense, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski was seen as a leading candidate for Hall of Fame  
enshrinement, but was passed over in Tuesday's Veterans Committee 
vote for Orlando Cepeda, the power-hitting first baseman from 
Mazeroski's era known as the Baby Bull. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, just as it always seems to do in baseball's  
popularity contests, offense won out over defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defense has not been recognized, but it is beginning to be  
recognized now,'' said Mazeroski, won who eight Gold Gloves and 
turned more double plays than any second baseman ever. ``Finally, 
because of all the TV coverage and (ESPN) SportsCenter, defense is 
getting some recognition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Mazeroski, he played from 1956-72 -- before  
most televised games were recorded on video tape and defensive gems 
were a fixture on the nightly sports highlight shows. Most of 
Mazeroski's great defensive plays are preserved only in the 
memories of those who saw him play. 
</P>
<P>
	And his biggest moment in baseball came at the plate -- his  
momentous homer to beat the New York Yankees in 1960, still the 
only home run to end a Game 7 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Baseball, major league baseball's official encyclopedia,  
rates Mazeroski as the 75th best player of all time. More than 150 
players ranked lower are in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Was he as good defensively as Smith, the back-flipping Cardinals  
shortstop who may be a first ballot Hall of Famer in 2002? Or 
former Baltimore third baseman Brooks Robinson, who single-handedly 
decided the 1970 World Series with his defense? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think so. I know I played defense as well as anybody ever  
played it,'' Mazeroski said in a rare candid moment for a player 
remembered as much for his quiet modesty as his athleticism. ``I 
know I could turn the double play as well as anybody ... and catch 
the ball as well as anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski was so prolific at turning the double play on the  
rock-hard infield of Pittsburgh's now-demolished Forbes Field that 
he accounted for more (1,760) double plays than all but three first 
basemen. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mazeroski said he never got his hopes up this year, even  
though the Veterans Committee chairman was Joe L. Brown, the 
Pirates' general manager throughout Mazeroski's career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really not disappointed,'' said Mazeroski, who is back in  
the Pirates camp for the first time since 1973 as an infield 
instructor. ``This was the first year I thought I had a shot, but I 
wasn't holding my breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown thinks Mazeroski will eventually get into the Hall of Fame  
as voters begin to recognize more than just hitters and pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really? I didn't know that,'' Mazeroski said. ``Who knows,  
maybe next year.''

<HEADLINE> Sydney May Sell Game Hosting Tips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympic organizers may sell  
information about how to host a games to other cities considering 
bidding for major events. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG chief executive officer Sandy Hollway said SOCOG was  
collating a blueprint of ``intellectual property'' to sell to other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said that when SOCOG began planning for the 2000  
Olympics it had no guide on how to run the games, despite input 
from the organizing committees of the Atlanta and Barcelona 
Olympics and the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we have developed systematic, documented information that  
we wish to make available,'' Hollway said. ``If I was a private 
consultant I would be charging a fortune for this. I do not wish to 
charge cities a fortune but I'm a very poor man and I would like 
some (recompense) for this intellectual property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said if a city purchased the SOCOG blueprint, the information  
would be followed up with seminars and contacts with 
representatives from related government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney Lord Mayor Frank Sartor said a substantial amount of work  
had been put in to preparing the blueprint for major events, work 
which would potentially save future organizers about 12 months of 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG is more than $124 million short of its marketing target  
for the games.

<HEADLINE> Pap Smear Urged For Some Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers have found that non-urban white girls  
in New England had high rates of cervical cell abnormalities, which 
are often caused by a sexually transmitted virus and can lead to 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings argue for early Pap-smear screening of all sexually  
active girls, not just those who live in inner cities and belong to 
minority groups, where such high rates have been found before, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, led by Dr. Sharon Mount of the University of Vermont,  
was published in the March issue of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Past studies indicate human papillomavirus, or HPV, is the most  
common sexually transmitted virus in the United States, affecting 
13 percent to 46 percent of young women, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among U.S. adolescent girls, about one-third are sexually active  
by ninth grade and about two-thirds by 12th grade. That puts them 
at high risk for catching HPV, which is well known to cause 
cervical cell changes that can lead to cancer, the researchers 
said. Abnormal cells revealed by Pap smears can be removed before 
they become malignant. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers reviewed 10,296 Pap smear diagnoses made over a  
one-year period for females ages 10 to 19 in suburban and rural 
Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. Almost all were white and were 
patients at family planning clinics, private doctors' offices, 
student health clinics and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found 3.8 percent of the Pap smears showed cell  
abnormalities of the type that might later develop into cancer, and 
14.6 percent of the smears bore evidence of infection. The smears 
did not reveal the proportion of infections caused by HPV. No 
cancers were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``This high rate of abnormal Pap smear results of both an  
infectious and precancerous nature in this population may reflect a 
high level of sexual activity among adolescent girls,'' the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 10- to 14-year-olds, seven cases of precancerous changes  
were found in a total of 378 Pap smears, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	An accompanying editorial by experts at Harvard Medical School  
praised the study for contributing valuable data about ``strikingly 
high'' rates of cell abnormalities in females that many might 
consider low-risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``A primarily white and rural or suburban population might be  
expected to have rates of abnormal Pap smears lower than a 
population of urban women of mixed race and ethnicity,'' the 
editorial said.

<HEADLINE> ABC Expecting Big Lewinsky Audience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC isn't paying for its interview with Monica  
Lewinsky, but its advertisers certainly are. 
</P>
<P>
	To buy a 30-second commercial on Wednesday night's two-hour  
``20/20'' telecast of Barbara Walters' interview with Lewinsky, ABC 
is asking advertisers for five times what they would normally pay. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC is building anticipation for the interview by running  
``teaser'' ads that show Walters throwing questions at Lewinsky but 
revealing no answers. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has hiked the price for a half-minute commercial to  
about $800,000, said executives familiar with ad sales. ABC 
generally charges $160,000 for half-minute ads on regular editions 
of ``20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers who had bought time months ago expecting a regular  
``20/20'' will either have to pay the new price or drop out. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the nation's biggest advertisers have said they weren't  
interested in hawking their products as the former White House 
intern talks about her affair with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble, whose products include Ivory soap, Tide  
detergent and Crest toothpaste, normally avoids news programs 
because of potentially controversial topics, spokeswoman Gretchen 
Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola also is steering clear of Lewinsky. ``It just doesn't  
seem like something that would be right for our brands,'' 
spokeswoman Kari Bjorhus said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ad sales department is targeting movie studios and  
Internet companies, believing they're more willing to take a gamble 
on the material attracting a big audience, said Bob Flood of DeWitt 
Media, an advertising buying firm. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst predicted a huge night in the ratings for ABC,  
estimating that 45 percent of the nation's televisions in use that 
night will be watching Lewinsky. ``ER,'' the year's top-ranked 
entertainment show, has an average audience share of 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are sick of it, without a doubt, but no one has had a  
chance to sit down and hear what she's had to say,'' said Marc 
Berman of the advertising firm Seltel. ``This is an event. People 
are going to watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Schulman, who has his own advertising buying firm,  
predicts an audience share of between 25 and 30. None of his 
clients have bought ads on the show, and he advises them that it's 
overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think now that it's over, I'm not sure that everyone even  
cares to hear from Monica,'' Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Fox charged advertisers a record $1.6 million to buy  
30-second ads on the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	When Oprah Winfrey interviewed Michael Jackson in 1993, the show  
drew a staggering 56 audience share, Nielsen Media Research said. 
Two years later, when Jackson was interviewed by Diane Sawyer, it 
had a 42 audience share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ratings last week for its ``Dateline NBC'' interview with  
Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting 
her more than 20 years ago, were only slightly higher than a 
typical episode of the newsmagazine. It drew 15 percent of the 
available audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Because ABC only owns the domestic distribution rights to the  
interview, it won't be telecast on the Web, nor will the network 
make a full transcript available there. Instead, ABCnews.com will 
show some film clips online and show portions of the transcript, 
spokeswoman Michelle Bergman said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday and Friday, NBC's ``Today'' show will air a two-part  
interview with Andrew Morton, author of the Lewinsky biography, 
``Monica's Story.''

<HEADLINE> Dunkin' Donuts Leaves Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANDOLPH, Mass. (AP) -- Add doughnuts to the list of victims of  
Russia's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunkin' Donuts, the Randolph, Mass.-based doughnut and coffee  
chain, has closed its two shops in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Lopdrup, chief executive officer of parent company Allied  
Domecq Retailing International, said Tuesday the economic crisis 
led to shutting one downtown shop last week that employed 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales were impacted by the economic collapse and it simply  
made sense to cut losses for the short term and return later,'' he 
said, adding that sales have been cut in half since August. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the other closure was due to a poor relationship with a  
franchisee who was also peddling liquor and meat pies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunkin' Donuts had been in Moscow about three years, Lopdrup  
said.

<HEADLINE> Some Black Farmers Protest Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black farmers opposed to the  
multimillion-dollar settlement of a discrimination lawsuit against 
the Agriculture Department demonstrated outside a federal 
courthouse today, hoping to rally support for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 farmers staged the protest outside U.S. District  
Court, where Judge Paul Friedman held a hearing to review the deal. 
Friedman said he would not decide today whether to give final 
approval to the settlement, but would issue a written opinion 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farmers are having some real issues with what has been  
proposed,'' said Gary Grant, president of the Black Farmers and 
Agriculturists Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both sides announced a settlement in January to  
the discrimination lawsuit brought by farmers two years ago because 
they were denied access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would allow farmers with less documented evidence to  
take a $50,000 tax-free payment and have their government debts 
forgiven. Farmers with more evidence could opt to go before an 
independent arbitrator and seek larger damages. 
</P>
<P>
	But the farmers demonstrating today pulled a mule and carrying  
signs that said ``$50,000 is not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., attended the rally and said: ``I think  
the settlement is a step in the right direction. But also, it is 
not a complete settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the settlement is unclear, because neither the  
number of farmers who will join the class nor settlement options 
they will choose is known. The cost could reach $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the agreement, many farmers hailed the end of  
sometimes contentious negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, many plaintiffs say that after reading the agreement  
they're not sure they are getting a fair deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $50,000 payment ``does not compensate somebody who has lost  
their home, their farm, their credibility, their credit rating'' 
Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
	And farmers will have a hard time proving a preponderance of  
evidence to seek larger damages, Grant said. ``We're talking about 
elderly people who have little formal education, who operated in an 
atmosphere of racism and bigotry. People who did not necessarily 
file complaints,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel as though the burden of proof shouldn't be on the  
farmer,'' said John Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the things farmers have mentioned including in the  
settlement are a review board to look over the arbitrator's rulings 
and the firing of department officials in the counties that 
participated in the discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely want a settlement,'' Boyd said, ``but we want a  
settlement that's going to be fair to the black farmers who have 
been victims of the Department of Agriculture.''

<HEADLINE> Alcatel To Buy Internet Firm Xylan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Alcatel SA is paying $2 billion for network  
equipment maker Xylan Corp. in a move designed to help the French 
telecommunications company catch up to competitors in Internet and 
data transmission markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will also substantially boost Alcatel's presence in the  
United States. Xylan is based in the Los Angeles suburb of 
Calabasas and counts several leading U.S. companies among its 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel is a leader in providing traditional voice telephone  
systems, but is behind companies such as Lucent Technologies Inc. 
and Cisco Systems that provide systems that also include data 
transmission and Internet connections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world of communications and networking is undergoing  
fundamental changes,'' said Olivier Houssin, executive vice 
president of Alcatel Telecom. ``Voice and data are converging. The 
new world will not contain voice companies and data companies. It 
will only contain information companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Xylan's expertise is in making switches and routing gear needed  
for high-speed data networks. Alcatel bought 6.5 percent of Xylan 
in 1995 and for several years has sold Xylan products to complement 
its own systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel agreed to pay $37 per share for Xylan, which was founded  
in 1993 and has grown at rates of more than 60 percent during the 
past two years. Xylan's shares soared on news of the deal, rising 
$8.91 1/4 or 33 percent to $35.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is part of a campaign to broaden Alcatel's services and  
products. During a news conference in Paris to announce the Xylan 
acquisition, Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk said Alcatel would buy 
another company by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Tchuruk declined to identify the company, but said it would fill  
another product gap: the ability to link mobile computers to local 
area networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're adding all the pieces they need to add to go forward  
as, A: a company that can move forward on an international basis 
and, B: a better rounded company,'' said Jeffrey L. Pittsburg of 
Goldis-Pittsburg Investment Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Xylan's U.S. clients include IBM, 3M Co., Texas A&AMP;M University  
and the Getty Center museum in Los Angeles. Alcatel has operations 
in 130 countries, but is eager to deepen its penetration of the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is about to move to a structure that completely  
integrates voice and data we believe the U.S. will be the leader in 
this and we are determined to play a part,'' Houssin said in a 
teleconference with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is  
subject to clearance by antitrust regulators. Alcatel hopes to 
complete the purchase by April. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Kim, Xylan's president and chief executive, said in a  
telephone interview today that the deal will allow Xylan to compete 
more effectively against larger competitors such as Cisco, Lucent 
and Nortel Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's investors are favoring the large companies,'' he said.  
``They see us as still small.''

<HEADLINE>  Cepeda Leads Four Into Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Orlando Cepeda broke down and cried.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some times, when things come easy for you,'' he said, savoring  
his election to baseball's Hall of Fame, ``you tend to take them 
for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Baby Bull's selection Tuesday by Veterans Committee was  
especially emotional because it was anything but an easy journey 
from the ghettos of Puerto Rico to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Overshadowed much of his career by a trio of teammates -- Willie  
Mays, Willie McCovey and Juan Marichal -- also destined for 
enshrinement, Cepeda overcame the stigma of a drug conviction that 
cast suspicion about his character. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to explain the feeling ... I've been ready for this  
for 17 years,'' Cepeda said at San Francisco's 3Com Park, called 
Candlestick when he was the Giants first baseman. ``When they told 
me I was selected, I lost my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former umpire Nestor Chylak, turn-of-the-century manager Frank  
Selee and Negro Leagues pitcher Smokey Joe Williams also were 
selected by the 12-member Veterans panel that included Marichal, 
Ted Williams and Stan Musial. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the former players, managers and executives receiving  
support, but not the necessary nine votes for election, were Bill 
Mazeroski, Dom DiMaggio, Joe Gordon, Bowie Kuhn, Dick Williams and 
Whitey Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, was a .297 career hitter with 379 homers and 1,365  
RBIs. Now a community relations representative for the Giants, his 
team had a present for him -- they announced the retirement of his 
No. 30 jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played ball for 17 years,'' Cepeda said. ``I've been through  
good things, bad things, but I was very blessed to be born with the 
talent to play baseball, to leave the ghettos of Puerto Rico and 
come to San Francisco, the city I love so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal, who played with Cepeda on some of the great Giants  
teams in the 1960s, said it was special for him to be part of the 
push to get his friend over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election five  
years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last year 
in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Orlando is a good human being,'' Marichal said. ``I felt so  
bad when he missed by seven votes ... because I know what this 
means to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family and friends gathered at Cepeda's California home to await  
the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like New Year's Eve on Broadway,'' committee  
chairman Joe Brown said. ``The room apparently erupted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda was the NL's rookie of the year in 1958 with San  
Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. The first baseman hit over .300 nine times and played in 
nine All-Star games. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested at an airport in 1975 on charges of trying to  
pick up 160 pounds of marijuana. He was sentenced to five years and 
served 10 months, punishment widely believed to have worked against 
him in previous bids for the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that probably did prevent him from being voted in by  
the writers,'' said Allen Lewis, a retired sportswriter and 
committee member. ``Sure, he made a mistake and served time. But 
since he got out, he's spent most of his time helping people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One-time National League president Bill White, another former  
teammate on the Veterans Committee, concurred that Cepeda has lived 
an exemplary life since the brush with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good man. He's worked extremely hard for the Giants in  
the community. He lectures kids on what to do and what not to do,'' 
White said. ``I'm glad for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda's father, Pedro, was called ``The Bull'' and also the  
``Babe Ruth of Puerto Rico.'' Cepeda joins Roberto Clemente as the 
only Hall of Famers born in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, the eighth umpire elected to the Hall, worked in the  
American League from 1954-78 and called five World Series and six 
All-Star games. He died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee managed from 1890 to 1905 in the National League with  
Boston and Chicago, and had a winning percentage of .598. He died 
in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee, who won 1,284 games in 16 seasons, became the 15th  
manager elected to the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, also nicknamed ``Cyclone,'' pitched from 1910-32 with  
several teams, including the Homestead Grays and New York Lincoln 
Giants. He was credited with a winning percentage of .624. He died 
in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was the 16th player elected for his accomplishments in  
the Negro Leagues. A towering right-hander with a reputation for a 
lively fastball and impeccable control, he compiled a record of 
22-7 with 12 shutouts against white teams from 1912-32. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a great fastball and he was mean, too. He'd move you  
off the plate,'' said committee member Buck O'Neil, a former Negro 
Leagues star who saw the 6-foot-4, 200-pound Williams pitch but 
never faced him as a batter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans panel was down to 12 from its usual 15 because of  
the retirement of longtime executive Buzzie Bavasi and the health 
of writer Leonard Koppett and Hall of Fame shortstop Pee Wee Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vets could elect one person from each of four categories:  
former major leaguers, Negro Leaguers, 19th century players and 
personnel, plus a composite of managers, umpires, executives and 
Negro leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the final year of a five-year plan to add a  
supplemental vote for two of the categories -- Negro Leaguers and 
19th century players and personnel.

<HEADLINE>  Cepeda Leads Four Into Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Orlando Cepeda broke down and cried.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some times, when things come easy for you,'' he said, savoring  
his election to baseball's Hall of Fame, ``you tend to take them 
for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Baby Bull's selection Tuesday by Veterans Committee was  
especially emotional because it was anything but an easy journey 
from the ghettos of Puerto Rico to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Overshadowed much of his career by a trio of teammates -- Willie  
Mays, Willie McCovey and Juan Marichal -- also destined for 
enshrinement, Cepeda overcame the stigma of a drug conviction that 
cast suspicion about his character. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to explain the feeling ... I've been ready for this  
for 17 years,'' Cepeda said at San Francisco's 3Com Park, called 
Candlestick when he was the Giants first baseman. ``When they told 
me I was selected, I lost my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former umpire Nestor Chylak, turn-of-the-century manager Frank  
Selee and Negro Leagues pitcher Smokey Joe Williams also were 
selected by the 12-member Veterans panel that included Marichal, 
Ted Williams and Stan Musial. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the former players, managers and executives receiving  
support, but not the necessary nine votes for election, were Bill 
Mazeroski, Dom DiMaggio, Joe Gordon, Bowie Kuhn, Dick Williams and 
Whitey Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, was a .297 career hitter with 379 homers and 1,365  
RBIs. Now a community relations representative for the Giants, his 
team had a present for him -- they announced the retirement of his 
No. 30 jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played ball for 17 years,'' Cepeda said. ``I've been through  
good things, bad things, but I was very blessed to be born with the 
talent to play baseball, to leave the ghettos of Puerto Rico and 
come to San Francisco, the city I love so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal, who played with Cepeda on some of the great Giants  
teams in the 1960s, said it was special for him to be part of the 
push to get his friend over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election five  
years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last year 
in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Orlando is a good human being,'' Marichal said. ``I felt so  
bad when he missed by seven votes ... because I know what this 
means to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family and friends gathered at Cepeda's California home to await  
the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like New Year's Eve on Broadway,'' committee  
chairman Joe Brown said. ``The room apparently erupted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda was the NL's rookie of the year in 1958 with San  
Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. The first baseman hit over .300 nine times and played in 
nine All-Star games. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested at an airport in 1975 on charges of trying to  
pick up 160 pounds of marijuana. He was sentenced to five years and 
served 10 months, punishment widely believed to have worked against 
him in previous bids for the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that probably did prevent him from being voted in by  
the writers,'' said Allen Lewis, a retired sportswriter and 
committee member. ``Sure, he made a mistake and served time. But 
since he got out, he's spent most of his time helping people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One-time National League president Bill White, another former  
teammate on the Veterans Committee, concurred that Cepeda has lived 
an exemplary life since the brush with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good man. He's worked extremely hard for the Giants in  
the community. He lectures kids on what to do and what not to do,'' 
White said. ``I'm glad for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda's father, Pedro, was called ``The Bull'' and also the  
``Babe Ruth of Puerto Rico.'' Cepeda joins Roberto Clemente as the 
only Hall of Famers born in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, the eighth umpire elected to the Hall, worked in the  
American League from 1954-78 and called five World Series and six 
All-Star games. He died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee managed from 1890 to 1905 in the National League with  
Boston and Chicago, and had a winning percentage of .598. He died 
in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee, who won 1,284 games in 16 seasons, became the 15th  
manager elected to the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, also nicknamed ``Cyclone,'' pitched from 1910-32 with  
several teams, including the Homestead Grays and New York Lincoln 
Giants. He was credited with a winning percentage of .624. He died

<HEADLINE> Treasury Auction Rate Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The interest rate on 52-week Treasury bills  
rose in Tuesday's auction to the highest level in nearly seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The discount rate was 4.665 percent, up from 4.370 percent at  
the last auction on Feb. 2. It was the highest rate since 52-week 
bills sold for 5.000 percent on Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills will carry an equivalent coupon interest rate of 4.918  
percent with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,528.30. 
Sales totaled $10 billion out of bids of $30.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Treasury Department sold 12-day cash management  
bills at a discount rate of 4.79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The discount rate understates the actual return to investors --  
4.89 percent with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,984.00. A total of 
$19 billion in bills were sold out of bids totaling $46.9 billion.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Says US Planning Mass Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Texas congressman accused the Clinton  
administration of planning to grant amnesty to thousands of illegal 
immigrants without congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stop before you break the law,'' Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas,  
said Tuesday. ``Do not throw out 30 years of legal precedent for 
political gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith expressed objections to a plan that would grant illegal  
immigrants from Central America eligibility for amnesty under a 
blanket ``presumption of hardship,'' instead of requiring each 
immigrant to prove hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Congress passed a law granting amnesty to some  
Nicaraguans and Cubans who had been in the United States since Dec. 
1, 1995, and allowing them to apply for status as legal permanent 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, Guatemalans and Salvadorans who had been in the  
country for seven years would be considered for a suspension of 
deportation under less-stringent rules that existed before 1996 
immigration legislation. It was to be on a case-by-case basis 
requiring them to prove ``extreme hardship'' if they were returned 
to their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the proposal for a blanket presumption of hardship  
goes against the intent of the 1997 law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew full well how to give amnesty,'' Smith said. ``We gave  
it to certain Nicaraguans and Cubans who were our allies in the 
Cold War against communism. If we wanted to give it to other 
groups, we would have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service has not yet made a  
final decision on presumption of hardship, agency spokeswoman Maria 
Cardona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrant advocacy groups have lobbied in support of a rule  
presuming hardship, and a Clinton administration official said 
members of Congress also have submitted written comments that 
mostly favor the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	A Feb. 23 letter signed by seven senators, including Senate  
Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Sen. Connie Mack, 
R-Fla., told Attorney General Janet Reno that the presumption of 
hardship would ``foster administrative efficiency and be 
fundamentally fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, it would avoid imposing any further hardship on  
applicants, who waged a long legal battle over the issue. ``The 
experiences shared by this group as a class support a determination 
of extreme hardship,'' the letter to Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even before Hurricane Mitch, these countries were considered  
among the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. When Hurricane Mitch 
struck the region in November 1998, the little progress these 
countries had made in rebuilding their economies, infrastructures 
and communities after the end of the civil wars was substantially 
reversed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith said a blanket presumption would give as many as  
240,000-plus illegal aliens a benefit that Congress declined to 
give them in 1997. He and 28 other House members signed a letter to 
President Clinton asking him to reject the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House is shamelessly bowing to special interests and  
thumbing its nose at Congress, the American people and every legal 
alien who played by the rules and waited his or her turn to come to 
America,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, when someone received an unexpected benefit,  
amnesty in this case, they feel indebted to those who provided the 
benefit. The White House is looking at long-term political 
support.''

<HEADLINE> Fleury Sidelined Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado right wing Theo Fleury, acquired two days  
ago to bolster the Avalanche's scoring, suffered a sprained knee in 
his first game with the team and will be sidelined indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury sprained his right knee in the third period of Monday  
night's game against the Edmonton Oilers, Avalanche officials said 
Tuesday. The high-scoring winger's goal sparked a three-goal rally 
in the final 13 minutes of the game, but the Oilers held on for a 
4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche media director Jean Martineau said he could not  
predict how many games Fleury might miss, but the injury is not 
believed to be serious. The Avalanche play Florida on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``His history is that he is a very quick healer,'' Martineau  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury and winger Chris Dingman were sent to Colorado for  
forward Rene Corbet, defenseman Wade Belak, the right to select a 
player not on Colorado's roster and a draft pick next year. Fleury 
will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, 30, had spent his entire 11-year NHL career with the  
Flames, winning a Stanley Cup with the team as a rookie in 1989. He 
became the career scoring leader for the Flames on Friday, with 364 
goals and 466 assists for 830 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix said Sunday that  
Fleury's acquisition would give Colorado a good chance to win the 
Stanley Cup this season. The Avalanche won the cup three years ago.

<HEADLINE> IRS To Rewrite Audit Warning Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxpayers being audited have been getting  
letters from the IRS warning that their neighbors, banks and 
employers might be contacted during the examination. 
</P>
<P>
	But after getting complaints from tax accountants, lawyers and  
members of Congress, IRS Comissioner Charles Rossotti acknowledged 
Wednesday that the letter could unduly alarm people and said it 
would be rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a mistake, and we're going to fix it,'' Rossotti said.  
``This third-party notice does not represent the first-rate service 
we must give taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, first used on Jan. 18, was included in changes made  
by the 1998 Internal Revenue Service reform law passed by Congress. 
Third-party contacts usually are a last resort in an audit. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision for a new letter to taxpayers subjected to audits  
was included to reduce personal embarrassment caused by such 
sensitive contacts, to give taxpayers notice about who is contacted 
and to describe their other rights. 
</P>
<P>
	But the letter only states that IRS may need to contact third  
parties. It says: ``Third-party contacts may include, but are not 
limited to, neighbors, employers, employees and banks. We may use 
these contacts to help us determine your correct tax liability, 
identify your assets or locate your current address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wording provoked criticism from tax accountants and lawyers  
as well as key members of Congress. They said it raised privacy 
concerns and didn't clearly explain when IRS typically contacts 
third parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that the IRS has decided to dust off its old,  
subversive tactics with this daunting notice,'' said Sen. 
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., who complained last week in writing to 
Rossotti. ``I can't begin to imagine the alarm I would feel if I 
went to my mailbox one day and received this type of letter from 
the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said IRS will consult with professional tax  
practitioners to write a new, improved version that will highlight 
taxpayer rights and stress that the agency's main goal is to finish 
the audit without contacting any outside parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I promise that when we rewrite the notice, and we will, we  
will get it right,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS did not say when the new letter would be ready, but  
Rossotti said people who get the old one shouldn't be worried that 
the agency would contact more outside parties than it had in the 
past.

<HEADLINE> Linux Holds 1st U.S. Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The man whose computer software is  
quietly challenging Microsoft Corp.'s industry-dominating Windows 
operating system doesn't have any interest in being like the 
software giant's chairman Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill who?'' Linus Torvalds said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	At times bashful, at times brash, Torvalds enjoyed his first  
major coming-out party Tuesday in San Jose as thousands of software 
developers, analysts and computer users came to LinuxWorld. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first major conference and exposition for the  
operating system, which was developed by Torvalds in the early 
1990s when he was a student in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Windows, the system makes all the applications on a  
computer run. But unlike Windows, Linux can be downloaded for free 
off the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Torvalds has also posted the software blueprint, or source  
codes, used to write Linux. This has spawned a grassroots community 
of developers who work together to improve the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Their culture was evident at the offbeat trade show, where body  
piercings and long bushy beards were as prevalent as suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still an underground phenomena, but this is probably the  
last time we'll see this spirit and culture,'' said Dave Laduke of 
Linuxcare, a San Francisco-based company that helps support Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	After eight years of obscure and highly technical development,  
Linux has gained mainstream acceptance during the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
	In conjunction with the LinuxWorld conference, companies like  
Intel Co., IBM Corp., Compaq Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. 
announced plans to work with Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech, Torvalds told Linux developers that they are no  
longer working on a small system. ``We're up there with the big 
boys and the big boys are getting nervous,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, research firm International Data Corp. reported that  
Linux comprised about 17 percent of the software shipped for 
running business machines last year, up from 7 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a few years there are going to be people who say Linux has  
lost its roots, gone commercial, sold out,'' said Chaim Krause, a 
computer programmer who uses the software. ``But basically right 
now we're giving the stuff away and that's got to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torvalds, who now lives in Santa Clara, Calif., poked fun at  
himself and his supporters, but seemed to enjoy all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't get caught up with the hype,'' he warned. ``We want to  
take over the world, but we don't have to do it tomorrow. It's OK 
by next week.''

<HEADLINE> $1B Hotel-Casino Opens in Las Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The public got its first look at the $1 billion  
Mandalay Bay hotel-casino Tuesday while Wall Street waited to see 
the numbers before judging the latest in a string of megaresorts in 
this gambling capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 4,000 VIPs roamed through the flashy resort early in the  
evening, with Gov. Kenny Guinn calling it a ``beautiful facility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It adds one more very classy entertainment center on the  
Strip,'' Guinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two dozen celebrities attending the opening, including  
Drew Barrymore, Quincy Jones, Chuck Norris, David Cassidy, Fran 
Drescher, John Landis, George Lucas, Penny Marshall and Quentin 
Tarantino. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Leone, vice president of marketing for the resort, said the  
turnout exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to bringing something new and unique and  
unusual to Las Vegas,'' Leone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,700-room hotel opened to the general public late Tuesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandalay Bay is the first of four new resorts scheduled to open  
here in 1999, generating a feast of new attractions for visitors 
and concerns of overbuilding for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Schaeffer, president and chief financial officer of parent  
Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., said Monday the 3,700-room resort 
would be ``a world of escape where entertainment has the edge over 
reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new resort will give Circus Circus 27,000 hotel rooms,  
Schaeffer said. They range from the budget-priced, family-oriented 
Circus Circus hotel casino to an affiliation with the posh Four 
Seasons Hotel chain at Mandalay Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Also opening this year will be The Venetian on April 14, the  
Resort at Summerlin later in the spring and Paris-Las Vegas in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Ader, gambling analyst for Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., Inc. noted  
in a recent industry survey that Las Vegas posted a 4.9 percent 
increase in visitors in October, 1.7 percent in November and 6.7 
percent in December, the largest monthly increase three years. 
Overall, 30.6 million people visited Las Vegas in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Casino companies are hoping the new resorts, combined with a  
myriad of new attractions developed here in recent years, will be 
enough to keep pushing the tourism numbers upward. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mandalay Bay resort has a 12,600-gallon aquarium in the  
lobby and amenities such as a beach where waves 6 feet high are 
produced and surfing competition is planned. Its 1,700-seat 
Mandalay Bay Theatre plans to open with the musical ``Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actors James Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and John Goodman were  
scheduled to perform at the Mandalay Bay's House of Blues as The 
Blues Brothers, with Bob Dylan performing later in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Four Seasons has a separate two-story structure that  
includes its own lobby, restaurants, pool and health club, plus 
three private elevators that whisk guests to the hotel's 424 guest 
rooms on the 35th through 39th floors of Mandalay Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooms at the Four Seasons will run $200 to $600 a night, with

average $110 a night, Schaeffer said.

<HEADLINE> Leading Indicators Rise Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising stock prices and manufacturers' orders in  
January pushed up a key measure of future economic activity for a 
third month in a row, signaling that the U.S. economy will continue 
growing through at least mid-year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private research group, reported today  
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.5 percent to 
106.9 in January from a revised level of 106.4 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly better than the 0.4 percent increase  
economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the leading index posting three consecutive sharp  
increases, the U.S. economy does not seem to be ready to settle 
down much from the fast pace of growth it experienced in 1998,'' 
said Michael Boldin, senior economist with the Conference Board. 
``Over the past six months, the index has increased 1.2 percent, 
which is far above its historical average, and the prospects for 
growth in income and employment are very bright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of economic strength, the Commerce Department  
reported new home sales slipped for the second straight month in 
January but nonetheless remained exceptionally robust. Americans 
bought new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 918,000, 
down 5 percent from 966,000 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 10 leading indicators that make up the Conference  
Board's index rose in January. Leading the way were increases in 
prices of 500 common stocks and manufacturers' orders of 
non-defense capital goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole area of decline was in the average factory work week.  
However, the National Association of Purchasing Management, which 
tracks the health of the nation's factories, reported Monday that 
manufacturing strengthened in February, so the one laggard in the 
January indicators might see an improvement in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indicators index is designed to forecast economic  
activity six to nine months in advance. It operates from a base of 
100, set in 1992. First calculated in the late 1960s, it is 
periodically fine-tuned and figures from past years are revised.

<HEADLINE> Shepard Murder Trial Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in  
the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard 
will begin with jury selection March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening arguments in Russell Henderson's trial have been  
scheduled for April 6, according to Judge Jeffrey Donnell. 
Henderson's trial was originally set for March 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jeffrey Donnell delayed the start of the trial because of  
a scheduling conflict involving one of the attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard died following a brutal beating near Laramie in October  
that police said was motivated in part because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, are charged with murder  
and face the death penalty if convicted. McKinney's trial is set 
for Aug. 9.

	U.S. Acknowledges Iraq Operation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House spokesman David Leavy acknowledged  
today that U.S agents gathered intelligence on Iraq while operating 
under the guise of U.N. arms control inspectors. But he refused to 
comment directly on allegations, reported today in The Washington 
Post, that the U.N. Special Commission was kept in the dark. 
Clinton administration officials have, all along, acknowledged 
gaining valuable information about Iraq as a byproduct of its 
cooperation with UNSCOM in rooting out Saddam Hussein's forbidden 
weapons programs. But Leavy disputed claims that U.S. agents 
directly used UNSCOM to penetrate Iraq's security forces and 
undermine the Iraqi regime.

	Justice Vowed in Uganda Killings  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today vowed to make every  
effort to bring to justice those responsible for the murder of two 
American tourists in Uganda. More than two dozen hostages were 
seized yesterday at a game park in southwestern Uganda by an armed 
band of 100 to 150 Rwandan Hutus. A total of eight people were 
killed. Disputing accounts by Ugandan officials that the victims 
were killed during a rescue operation by Ugandan security officers, 
a State Department spokesman said the dead were killed as they were 
being marched by their captors.

	Senate Studies Y2K Problem  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate dedicated today to the Year 2000  
computer problem, looking at threats ranging from small-business 
bankruptcies to Russian missile malfunctions. Senators emphasized 
that, for most Americans, disruptions in vital services will be 
minimal. Seeking to allay fears of widespread social and economic 
chaos, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said people should have 
canned goods and water on hand Dec. 31 as a normal procedure, but 
there is no need to stockpile food.

	Buchanan To Run for President  
</P>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, whose campaigns hobbled  
Republican front-runners in 1992 and 1996, launched a third White 
House bid today. He promised to stand against unfettered imports, 
freewheeling immigration, abortion, euthanasia, expanded judicial 
powers, and a shrinking American sovereignty. Buchanan is taking a 
leave of absence from CNN's ``Crossfire'' to run.

	Bush Moves Towards White House Bid  
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush announced today that he  
is forming a GOP presidential exploratory committee, moving another 
step closer to a White House bid in 2000. Bush said the first job 
of the committee will be to raise money while he remains in Texas 
until the state Legislature's session ends on Memorial Day.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration withdrew its  
support for the independent counsel law today. ``The act was 
supposed to increase trust in our government; unfortunately, it has 
diminished it,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told a House 
subcommittee. Congress should let the law expire on June 30, he 
said. It was the first time the Clinton administration had gone on 
record against the statute.

companies hope the tool will be adapted by developers of software 
that would allow users to get Web information over the phone, 
reducing the need to use home computers. The voice-recognition

	Test May Cut Colon Cancer Deaths  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A simple screening test for blood in the bowel  
can reduce by up to one-third the death rate from colon cancer, the 
second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, a study 
says. The finding, to be published tomorrow in the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute, is prompting a national campaign to 
encourage people over age 50 to take the test, because they account 
for most of the 56,000 U.S. colon cancer deaths each year.

<HEADLINE> Study: Magazines Hurt Girls' Images </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Even a magazine editor admits that skinny models  
featured on covers can make teen girls dissatisfied about their 
body image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young girls reading magazines certainly compare their bodies  
to the models that they see in there and come away with sometimes 
unhappy feelings with the way they look,'' Glamour executive editor 
Stephanie Dolgoff said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said women's magazines are being unfairly singled out by  
a new study that criticizes publications for feeding an unhealthy 
body image to young girls -- as if teens can't ``discern between 
what's fantasy and what's reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, published in the March issue of the  
journal Pediatrics, more than two-thirds of girls in grades five 
through 12 said magazine photos influenced their notion of the 
ultimate figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-seven percent said they wanted to lose weight because of  
those pictures. Only 29 percent of the 548 girls interviewed were 
actually considered overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even among the girls who don't read the magazines, very  
frequently, they, too, felt influenced,'' said Alison Field, an 
epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the 
study's lead author. ``It really does permeate society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The girls filled out questionnaires during mandatory gym classes  
in an unidentified working-class suburb north of Boston. The study 
was conducted in 1991, just as thin, ``waiflike'' models were 
coming back into vogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Each girl was asked to provide her age, weight and height and  
was asked whether she regularly read magazines such as Seventeen, 
Glamour or the now-defunct Sassy. The girls answered questions 
about dieting habits and how they viewed their bodies -- satisfied 
or dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-six percent of the girls said they wanted to lose weight.  
Researchers said they suspected the number would have been higher 
if the study focused exclusively on older teens. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the respondents were in elementary school.  
Even at that age, half reported reading fashion magazines at least 
two to five times a month. 
</P>
<P>
	High-frequency magazine readers of any age were three times more  
likely to exercise and lose weight than infrequent readers, and 
three times more likely to have unrealistic body expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors at Seventeen, which targets teen-age girls, and Glamour,  
which targets women ages 18 to 35, said the results weren't 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	``The magazines reflect what's going on in the runways because  
they're fashion magazines and the models on the runways are 
stick-thin,'' said Patrice Adcroft, editor in chief at Seventeen. 
</P>
<P>
	This month's issue of Seventeen includes -- for the first time --  
a plus-size model in a fashion spread. The young woman, who wears a 
size 14, is paired with very slender models in an article on prom 
dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Field's study used national weight standards from the 1970s  
to determine what qualified as overweight. For example, a 5-foot-4 
16-year-old girl would be considered overweight if she weighed more 
than 145 pounds. The healthy weight range for a girl that age would 
be between 105 and 140 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	For a 13-year-old 5-foot girl, the overweight benchmark was 120  
pounds or higher. The median healthy weight for that age and height 
is 90 to 95 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	On a positive note, the study found that girls who read fashion  
magazines were more likely to exercise rather than diet to lose 
weight -- a signal that the publications are teaching girls about 
the importance of good health, Ms. Field said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly have a problem with overweight'' in America, she  
said. ``But the answer is not to make everyone overly concerned 
with their weight.''

<HEADLINE>  MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tom Seaver and Yogi Berra finally returned to spring training  
for the New York teams they starred on. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, the Hall of Fame catcher who had boycotted the New York  
Yankees since George Steinbrenner fired him 14 years ago, attended 
an intrasquad game in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tremendous. It's a great feeling,'' said Steinbrenner,  
who wants Berra at the regular-season home opener against Detroit 
on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner apologized two months ago for firing Berra after a  
slow start in April 1985. Berra has not been back to the ballpark 
for a Yankees game since. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called, he wanted to apologize and he said the right thing.  
If he didn't, I wouldn't be here,'' Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't commit to the home opener, but made clear he's  
likely to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what happens,'' Berra said, adding, ``Let's keep it  
a secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, the Hall of Fame right-hander who has spent the last 11  
years away from the team, arrived at camp in Port St. Lucie, Fla., 
in his new role as special instructor for the team's pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just look at him and are kind of overwhelmed,'' said Jason  
Isringhausen, one of Seaver's first pupils. ``I will listen to 
anything he says to me. It is a total respect thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, who also will broadcast the team's games this season,  
said he is anxious to help out wherever he can, especially with 
Hideo Nomo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing about Nomo that is on my checklist is to see  
what he is like at his release point,'' Seaver said. ``All the 
other stuff can be superfluous, but the more the movement, the more 
the release point becomes inconsistent and fatigue can set in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like watching Arnold Palmer swing a golf club. You  
say a guy can't swing that way, but when he gets to the contact 
point, he's in the right spot. It might be the same way with 
Nomo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa also arrived at spring training Monday, three days  
after most of his teammates made it to Cubs' camp in Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel happy,'' he said. ``Everybody is here waiting for  
me. I love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire won the home run race 70-66, but Sosa helped the  
Chicago Cubs reach the playoffs by hitting .308 with 158 RBIs. Sosa 
spent a whirlwind offseason traveling the world, picking up awards, 
working for Dominican Republic hurricane relief and making public 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in Japan, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, New York, Los Angeles,  
Arizona, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Washington, D.C., where he helped 
light the national Christmas tree and attended the State of the 
Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, McGwire went on vacation to Australia and made  
almost no personal appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied because 66 is a lot of home runs and lot of  
people wanted to shake my hand,'' Sosa said. ``I've been meeting a 
lot of people I would have never dreamed about. The nicer you are 
to people, the more they want to be around you. I think I have 
earned that respect from everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other camp news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Boston Red Sox said they may be interested in signing ace  
pitcher Pedro Martinez's brother Ramon, who is recovering from 
shoulder surgery. ``He was pretty positive about maybe signing 
here,'' said Pedro, who spoke Saturday to Ramon. Boston GM Dan 
Duquette went to Santo Domingo two weeks ago to watch Ramon throw 
in his comeback from the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- McGwire won't make his spring debut until Saturday, when the  
Cardinals play in Jupiter, Fla., against Montreal. McGwire won't 
make the 90-minute bus trip to Vero Beach for St. Louis' spring 
opener against Los Angeles on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Giants left fielder Barry Bonds was back at work after missing  
most of workouts Sunday because of spasms in his lower back. Bonds 
took turns in the batting cage, hitting line drives into the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Clearwater, Fla., negotiations broke down between Bobby  
Abreu's agent and the Philadelphia Phillies, who don't expect to 
get their starting right fielder signed to a multiyear contract 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Todd Helton, the runner-up in last year's NL rookie of the  
year voting, will sign a four-year, $12 million contract with the 
Colorado Rockies on Tuesday. Sources said Helton will make $750,000 
in 1999, $1.3 million in 2000, $4.95 million in 2001 and $5 million 
in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Once Jose Rijo's baseball academy in the Dominican Republic is  
complete, he intends to try to resurrect his baseball career one 
more time. Despite nearly four years of elbow operations and 
waylaid comeback attempts, Rijo isn't ready to retire. He said 
Monday that he hopes to sign another minor league contract with the 
Cincinnati Reds in a few weeks, once he's done supervising 
construction on the academy.

<HEADLINE> HUD Advises on Mortgage Broker Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban  
Development has issued a statement indicating what it believes 
mortgage brokers should charge in an attempt to save Americans 
millions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD said Monday that mortgage brokers must provide real goods or  
services and the fees they receive from lenders and borrowers must 
be ``reasonably related'' to the value of the goods or services. It 
also advises consumers that higher interest rates alone don't 
justify higher payments to mortgage brokers and urges the brokers 
to improve their disclosures to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mortgage brokers have a right to be reasonably compensated for  
the services they provide,'' HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in a 
statement. ``They don't have a right to collect illegal kickbacks 
and referral fees from lenders, and we will continue enforcing the 
law against these abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``American families shouldn't be overcharged for mortgage  
services and should have the clear, easily understood information 
they need to shop around for the best deal when they select a 
mortgage broker,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy statement doesn't carry the force of law, and HUD  
said it believed new legislation was needed to resolve legal 
uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
	Kickbacks, referral fees and other unearned fees are prohibited  
by federal law. Fees to mortgage brokers from lenders and borrowers

<HEADLINE> Tax on Indian Reservation Work OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- States can impose taxes on companies hired by  
the federal government to perform work such as road-building on 
Indian reservations, the Supreme Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous ruling allows Arizona to collect taxes on road  
construction on reservations throughout the state by Blaze 
Construction Co., an Indian-owned business based in Oregon and 
incorporated under the laws of the Blackfeet Tribe of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absent a constitutional immunity or congressional exemption,  
federal law does not shield Blaze from Arizona's transaction 
privilege tax,'' Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court. 
``Whether to exempt Blaze from Arizona's transaction privilege tax 
is not our decision to make; that decision rests, instead, with the 
state of Arizona and with Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said that even though Blaze is owned by the Blackfeet  
Tribe, it is the same as a non-Indian company in this case because 
it was not performing work on its own reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The company signed contracts with the federal government in the  
early 1990s to perform road projects on six reservations in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona was not involved in planning the projects and issued no  
permits. But the state Department of Revenue assessed delinquent 
transaction privilege taxes against Blaze, based on the company's 
proceeds from building on-reservation roads for the federal Bureau 
of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Tax Court upheld the taxes, but the Arizona Court of  
Appeals ruled that federal law pre-empted state taxation of Blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court reversed that ruling, relying on its  
own 1982 ruling in an unrelated case that let states tax private 
companies that perform work for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the goal of efficient tax administration would be  
served by a clear rule ``for taxation of federal contracts, 
regardless of whether the contracted-for activity takes place on 
Indian reservations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Arizona Department of Revenue vs. Blaze Construction  
Co., 97-1536.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Anti-Carjacking Law Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court preserved the broad sweep of  
a federal anti-carjacking law Tuesday, rejecting a legal challenge 
that would have limited it to cases in which robbers intend to hurt 
their victims no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, by a 7-2 vote, ruled that the law also covers crimes  
committed with the ``conditional intent'' of harming victims who 
refuse to comply with the robbers' demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision upheld the federal carjacking conviction of a New  
York man who insists he never intended to seriously hurt people 
whose cars he stole at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	As amended by Congress in 1994, the law makes it a crime to take  
a motor vehicle by force ``with the intent to cause death or 
serious bodily harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francois Holloway, sentenced to 50 years in prison for his part  
in a carjacking ring that sold parts of stolen vehicles dismantled 
in a Queens ``chop shop,'' challenged his conviction by arguing he 
never harbored such an intent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court, ``The intent  
requirement ... is satisfied when the government proves that at the 
moment the defendant demanded or took control over the driver's 
automobile the defendant possessed the intent to seriously harm or 
kill the driver if necessary to steal the car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Holloway, on at least three occasions in the  
fall of 1994, confronted motorists with a gun and demanded that 
they surrender their car keys. 
</P>
<P>
	An accomplice testified that their plan was to steal cars  
without harming the drivers but said he would have used his weapon 
if any of the victims had given him a ``hard time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal judge who presided over Holloway's trial told jurors  
they could find the required intent if they thought Holloway would 
have seriously hurt victims who did not comply with his demands. 
The conviction was upheld by a federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said such a commonsense interpretation of the law is  
what Congress intended, but Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence 
Thomas disagreed. In separate dissenting opinions, each said the 
law's wording makes it clear Congress meant to zero in on crimes 
where the intent was certain, not conditional. 
</P>
<P>
	In an extraordinarily rare personal reference, Scalia wrote, ``I  
have a friend whose father was killed, and whose mother was nearly 
killed, in just such an incident -- after the car had already been 
handed over. It is not at all implausible that Congress should 
direct its attention to this particularly savage sort of carjacking 
-- where killing the driver is part of the intended crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters Tuesday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said in a Pennsylvania case that federal prison inmates are not  
entitled to be resentenced every time a judge fails to tell them of 
their rights to appeal but only when that error results in real 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled in an Arizona case that states can impose taxes on  
federal contractors for work they do on Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Heard arguments in a California case in which the justices are  
to decide by late June whether gifts given to federal officials can 
be considered illegal gratuities without proof they were intended 
to influence any particular action. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is an agricultural cooperative's invalidated conviction  
for giving gifts to former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who was 
acquitted of taking gifts.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Soccer Captain Fesses Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Argentina's soccer captain has fessed up:  
The play that turned an English star into a goat at last summer's 
World Cup was really a great piece of acting. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone was quoted Tuesday as saying  
he pulled a fast one on the referee during his nation's 
second-round game against England, resulting in an ejection for 
David Beckham. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I was clever by letting myself fall ... and the  
referee fell into the trap ... showing the red card,'' the Italian 
sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport quoted Simeone as saying. ``You 
can say that my falling turned a yellow card into a red card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckham, who plays for Manchester United and will face Simeone  
and Internazionale of Milan in a European Champions Cup 
quarterfinal on Wednesday night, was prone on the field followed a 
tackle during the first half of last June's game at Saint-Etienne, 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckham, who was face down, flicked his right foot back and  
connected with the Argentine captain, who tumbled to the ground in 
front of the referee. 
</P>
<P>
	The official ejected Beckham, and England played a man short for  
the rest of the game, losing on penalty kicks following a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckham, a $13 million a year player who is engaged to Victoria  
Adams -- known as Posh Spice -- was derided as a hothead who cost 
England the game. ``10 Heroic Lions, One Stupid Boy,'' read one 
newspaper headline. 
</P>
<P>
	``In reality it was not a violent blow,'' Simeone said. ``It was  
just a kick with no force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckham, who was jeered when he returned to action for  
Manchester United by fans who blamed him for England's World Cup 
exit, on Tuesday said he was prepared to shake Simeone's hand and 
put the incident in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Beckham said he spoke to his son -- before Simeone's  
admission was published -- and the England midfielder had said he 
would shake the Argentine's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``David is his own man. He knows exactly what went on and still,  
to this day, cannot believe the referee pulled out a red card,'' 
Beckham's father said. 
</P>
<P>
	``David hasn't forgotten it but he has put it behind him. It is  
all history now. The best way for David to get back at him would be 
to knock him out of the European Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Simeone might not be willing to accept Beckham's  
offered hand before Wednesday's match -- reportedly telling the 
Italian press that he doesn't shake hands with his opponents on 
principle. But he supports the plight of his rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not Beckham's fault if England lost to Argentina on  
penalties,'' Simeone said. ``With or without Beckham, it was 
England which missed the chance to knock us out. We were more 
clever and had more luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simeone said the English media was to blame for Beckham's  
problems after the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The English popular press is powerful ... and sometimes some  
enjoy demolishing you ... they can influence the fans. Some wanted 
to hurt Beckham and they did it.''

<HEADLINE> Jets, Testaverde Reach $19.5M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vinny Testaverde sensed he'd finally found the  
right place. Oddly, he had to come home to discover it. 
</P>
<P>
	Long Island native Testaverde signed with the New York Jets as a  
free agent before last season. Then he led them to their best 
season in three decades and within a step of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the 12-year veteran quarterback was rewarded with a  
three-year contract worth nearly $19.5 million to remain with his 
hometown team. The deal also includes a $6.2 million signing bonus 
-- making nearly $9 million guaranteed -- and the Jets hold a 
four-year option beyond the original three seasons. If exercised, 
Testaverde would earn $42.4 million for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want the talks to be a distraction for me or the  
team,'' said Testaverde, who led the AFC in passing in 1998 and 
went 13-2. ``I knew things would work out as soon as I signed there 
last year. It was a gut feeling I had. I think my decision has 
worked out for me to perform the best I can. 
</P>
<P>
	``After these talks today, I can refocus and get ready for the  
upcoming season. I'd like nothing more than to finish my career at 
home. When I first signed there, it was not on the top of my list 
wanting to come back home, to the Jets. It was playing for coach 
(Bill) Parcells and knowing his background and the way he coaches. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Then coming home and being around my family, and as we went  
along, the family part moved up the ladder quite a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the deal was postponed after Testaverde's  
father, Al, died of a heart attack Feb. 14. Al Testaverde's heart 
condition prohibited him from watching his son's games live. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few weeks have been a roller coaster,'' Testaverde  
said. ``One thing I am still thankful for is my father got to enjoy 
a great season after my being away from my family my first 11 years 
in the NFL. I had the opportunity to come home last year and see 
him at training camp each day, knowing he couldn't watch the games 
on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I was able to see him on a regular basis and talk with him  
on the contract negotiations. I'm very happy I got to share that 
time with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he hopes to share more success with a team that, until  
Parcells took over in 1997, was one of the league's perennial 
losers. Testaverde was used to losing, having been drafted No. 1 
overall in 1987 by Tampa Bay, which has had even less success than 
the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1986 Heisman Trophy winner who grew up in Elmont, N.Y.,  
not far from where the Jets train, turned around his career in '98. 
Signed ostensibly to be a backup to Glenn Foley, he took over when 
Foley got hurt, then was ineffective, and took the Jets to their 
first division title since the team joined the NFL in 1970. 
Testaverde completed 259 of 421 passes for 3,256 yards and a 
team-record 29 touchdowns. The Jets advanced to the AFC title game, 
losing to Denver 23-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he technically was a free agent for two weeks,  
Testaverde never considered leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart was set on playing in New York. We've developed a  
relationship that developed into a marriage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no bigger stage than New York City. And to come in and  
perform well there was great for me, knowing it was in front of my 
family and friends. The team had not been to the playoffs in quite 
awhile and they made me feel right at home and part of the team 
right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After the success we had as a team and individually,'' he  
said, ``in my heart I just wanted to get this deal done with the 
Jets. This year was the best of my career. I think there were 
reasons for that and the biggest reason was Bill Parcells. I wanted 
to remain with him so I can continue to have that success.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Told To Police Members, Bidders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An ethics report that criticizes the  
International Olympic Committee could help the panel rebuild in the 
wake of its worst corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's chief investigator said Monday that he generally  
favored many of the recommendations by the U.S. Olympic Committee 
commission, including outside elections, term limits for members 
and strict rules on travel, expenses and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice president Dick Pound argued with the report's  
characterization of the IOC as a ``culture of improper gift 
giving'' and stressed that he had not seen the report, issued as he 
was flying back from Switzerland earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the IOC was committed to radical change in the wake  
of the million-dollar Salt Lake bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to reinvent ourselves for the new millennium,''  
Pound said from his Montreal office. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee blamed the scandal on leaders who turned a  
blind eye to corruption that was ``flourishing'' even as the games 
grew into a billion-dollar empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, headed by former Senate Majority Leader George  
Mitchell, said the IOC was an inbred, unethical group that needed 
to change into a modern, open business. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the conduct ``tolerated by the IOC is potentially  
illegal and inevitably corruptive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC should no sooner tolerate improper gifts by candidate  
cities to its members than it would tolerate such gifts by athletes 
to judges,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he would watch the IOC's special assembly March  
17-18 to see if the committee is committed to reform. The Senate 
Commerce Committee, meanwhile, has scheduled hearings on the 
Olympic scandal next month and will consider stripping the IOC's 
tax exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Mitchell panel's recommendations, such as financial  
audits and open books, have been suggested by others, including 
Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report contained unusually harsh language for the  
international sports hierarchy. It said the IOC helped create 
``this mess'' that shifted the focus of picking Olympic cities from 
sports to ever-bigger presents for committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We called this `gift-creep,''' Mitchell said at a news  
conference. ``Gradually, what started with small, legitimate items 
evolved into scholarships and then direct payments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the whole system should be reformed, and that  
there was no need for Juan Antonio Samaranch to resign as IOC 
president if no fundamental changes in operations were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``If President Samaranch and the entire leadership of the IOC  
retires tomorrow and there were no other changes, the problems of 
the IOC would continue, '' Mitchell said. ``If they continue in 
office, then everyone ... has a right to expect they will institute 
structural change promptly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell report was the third on the scandal, in which  
members of Salt Lake's bid committee offered $1.2 million in cash, 
scholarships and other gifts to IOC members and their relatives in 
exchange for awarding the 2002 Winter Games to the Utah city. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike earlier findings by the IOC and the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee, it delivered no blockbuster revelations, focusing 
instead on what needed to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said Olympic leaders at every level are responsible  
for the scandal and said reforms were needed from top to bottom to 
avoid a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission blasted the IOC.  
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake's misconduct, Mitchell said, was ``part of a broader  
culture of improper gift-giving in which candidate cities provided 
things of value to IOC members in an effort to buy their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This culture was made possible by the closed nature of the IOC  
and by the absence of ethical and transparent financial controls of 
its operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Benz, a commission member and former champion figure  
skater, said the Mitchell panel was especially disturbed by ``the 
prevalence of a culture in which it was acceptable to request 
things of value while making a decision involving the people from 
whom you were requesting things of value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It became apparent that the objectionable conduct was  
inextricably intertwined with the system,'' Benz said in an 
interview. ``That system led bid cities to gift-giving that made 
the strengths of their sports system secondary to caring for the 
preferences of individual IOC members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had no formal comment on the report. The U.S. Olympic  
Committee, which uses Mitchell's panel as an ethics watchdog, is 
scheduled to release its response at a news conference on Wednesday 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's investigation has led to nine IOC members resigning or  
being expelled, at least 13 more are expected to learn their fate 
this week. The Canadian said his commission was finalizing 
recommendations and would send them to the IOC leadership soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member commission was trying to reach a consensus on  
all of the cases and was now dealing with an additional six IOC 
members linked to the scandal by the Utah ethics report, Pound 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell report suggested a series of changes, from severe  
limits on bid-city gifts and expenses to opening the IOC's books 
and having the bulk of its members elected to limited terms by 
others in the sports community. The IOC traditionally picks its 
members to virtual life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also called on the IOC to require that any country  
bidding for the games sign the international treaty against 
bribery. And it urged the White House to bring the IOC under 
coverage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits 
bribing of foreign government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell commission, working mostly from public records and  
news reports, did not examine Olympic bids other than Salt Lake's, 
and Mitchell pointedly refused to comment on possible improprieties 
in successful Summer Games bids by Atlanta for 1996 and Sydney for 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the IOC should have paid more attention to a 1991  
report from Toronto's losing bid for the 1996 Games, which detailed 
abuses of the gift and travel rules by a string of unidentified 
committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``In strikingly prophetic language, they warned of the  
consequences of such improper behavior,'' the report said. ``The 
Toronto prophesy has come true. As a result, credibility of the 
Olympic movement has been gravely damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benz said the Toronto report ``provided notice to the IOC. ...  
It showed the IOC had knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said some of the recommendations in the Toronto report  
were adopted by the IOC, including coordination of travel to bid 
cities. But he conceded that the committee could have been more 
alert to signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're paying for that,'' he said. ``We're going to get the  
genie back in the bottle.''

<HEADLINE> Over 900 Women Sue Merrill Lynch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Taking the latest stand against bias on Wall  
Street, more than 900 current and former female employees at 
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. have filed discrimination complaints as part of 
a class-action settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of claimants joining the suit settled last June is  
three to four times what had been expected, plaintiffs' lawyers 
said on the eve of today's deadline to file a claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is closely watched, coming on the heels of an infamous  
discrimination case settled last year involving Smith Barney. The 
settlement is also helping change the way discrimination cases are 
handled on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, nearly all cases were handled through industry  
arbitration -- a system criticized as biased in favor of companies. 
Under the settlement, Merrill Lynch became the first Wall Street 
firm to end mandatory arbitration for civil rights claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's accountability and liability,'' said Linda  
Friedman, a partner in the Chicago law firm Stowell &AMP; Friedman, 
which is handling the Merrill Lynch case. ``Our hope is that this 
will change the balance of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firm also represented the plaintiffs in the Smith Barney  
suit, which grew out of allegations of sexual hijinks and pranks in 
a so-called ``boom room'' at the brokerage's Garden City, N.Y. 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	To some observers, the cases uncover common problems for women  
on Wall Street. ``It's one of the last bastions of discriminatory 
treatment and unequal standards in the country,'' said Laurel 
Bellows, former head of the American Bar Association's Commission 
on Women. ``The rest of corporate America seems to have figured out 
that they benefit from qualified, intelligent women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Merrill Lynch case, originally filed on behalf of eight  
plaintiffs, anyone complaining of discrimination will have their 
claim handled by a court-supervised mediator. If necessary, the 
complaint will go to binding arbitration. Financial consultants who 
worked at Merrill Lynch from January 1994 through June 1998 are 
eligible for redress. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no maximum or minimum amount of money available to the  
plaintiffs, but the first plaintiff, Marybeth Cremin, said Monday 
that given the high earning power of the women, millions of dollars 
could be involved. In additional to possible future awards, the 
eight original plaintiffs will share a $600,000 payment for being 
the first to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Most complaints in the case involve economic discrimination --  
the funneling of tips, clients and business to male brokers, the 
plaintiffs' lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Women were often paid lower salaries than less-qualified men,  
then told, '' 'Well, you have a husband,' or 'Men have a family to 
support,' '' said Mary Stowell, who is also representing the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a systemic problem,'' said Cremin, who worked at  
Merrill Lynch for 13 years. ``The accounts and assets were for a 
large part going to male brokers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch spokesman Bill Halldin said the company had ``not  
found any evidence of systemic discrimination'' against any 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take all complaints from employees very seriously because  
we have no tolerance for discrimination of any kind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that the company did away with mandatory arbitration  
because ``there was a perception of unfairness in arbitration and 
we're committed to making our workplace an excellent one and we 
thought this was an important step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights and employee groups have been pressuring the  
industry to do away with mandatory arbitration for years, and in 
the last year, regulatory organizations began joining Merrill Lynch 
in moving away from the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Jan. 1, the National Association of Security Dealers  
ended its requirement for arbitration in discrimination cases. 
Individual securities firms can still impose the mandate on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's rights advocates applaud the legal developments, which  
threaten firms with public exposure and payouts if they allow 
discrimination.

	``Litigation is frequently the first wave of change,'' observed  
Sheila Wellington, head of Catalyst, a group that works to advance 
women in business and is currently studying women on Wall Street. 
``We will be watching, and others will too.''

<HEADLINE> Cepeda Leads Four Into Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- It was the spring of 1953, and a young  
teen-ager named Orlando Cepeda made quite an impression among elite 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill White and Willie McCovey, future Hall of Famers, took note.  
So did Leon Wagner and Willie Kirkland, two more prospects who 
would go on to have productive major league careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all with the Giants,'' recalled White, former NL  
president and a member of the Veterans Committee that elected 
Cepeda to the Hall of Fame on Tuesday. ``We knew then that Orlando 
was something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Cepeda would take over as the Giants' first baseman  
-- in a lineup with Willie Mays, Juan Marichal and McCovey -- after 
White was traded to St. Louis. Later, he'd wind up with the 
Cardinals, replacing White in the lineup again. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I see Orlando, he always kids me and says, `I've run you  
out of a lot of positions,'' White said. ``And, he's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, who hit 379 home runs in a 17-year career, joined Negro  
Leagues pitcher Smokey Joe Williams, turn-of-the-century manager 
Frank Selee and former umpire Nestor Chylak as selections by the 
12-man Veterans panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the former players, managers and executives receiving  
support, but not the necessary nine votes for election, were Bill 
Mazeroski, Dom DiMaggio, Joe Gordon, Bowie Kuhn, Dick Williams and 
Whitey Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal, a member of the Veterans panel, called Cepeda with the  
good news that they would be teammates in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a rookie on the Veterans Committee, I'm glad he got in on  
my first year,'' Marichal said. ``He was the type of player who had 
no fear, the type of player you wanted playing behind you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda batted .297 with 1,365 RBIs, and played in nine All-Star  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried ... along with my wife (Miriam),'' said Cepeda, whose  
chances for induction widely were believed to have been hindered 
until now because of a 1975 marijuana smuggling conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to explain the feeling ... I've been ready for this  
for 17 years,'' Cepeda said at San Francisco's 3Com Park, called 
Candlestick when he played there. ``When they told me I was 
selected, I lost my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies will be held July 25 at Cooperstown, N.Y.  
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were elected in January by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, now works as a community relations representative  
with the Giants. The team also had a present for him -- it announced 
the retirement of his No. 30 jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election five  
years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last year 
in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakdown of voting was not released. However, 75 percent -- or  
nine votes -- were required for election. 
</P>
<P>
	While his brush with the law once cast suspicion about his  
character, White and other supporters said Cepeda has led an 
exemplary life since serving 10 months in prison for the drug 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good man. He's worked extremely hard for the Giants in  
the community. He lectures kids on what to do and what not to do. 
I'm glad for him,'' White said. ``When we called him, he said it 
was the happiest day of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to playing for the Giants and Cardinals, Cepeda had  
stints with the Atlanta Braves, Boston Red Sox and Kansas City 
Royals. Called the Baby Bull, he was the NL's rookie of the year in 
1958 with San Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 
1967 with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, long-time AL umpire crew chief, had a 25-year major  
league career that included working six All-Star games, three 
league championship series and five World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the 16th player elected for his accomplishments in the  
Negro Leagues, pitched from 1910-32 with several teams, including 
the Homestead Grays and New York Lincoln Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander was credited with a winning percentage of .624  
and also made his mark as a tourist attraction of sorts, facing top 
major league pitchers in exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a 20-year period, Williams compiled a record of 22-7 with  
12 shutouts against white teams featuring such big league pitchers 
as Chief Bender, Rube Marquard, Pete Alexander, Walter Johnson and 
Grover Cleveland Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee, who had a winning percentage of .598, managed in the NL  
with Boston and Chicago from 1890 to 1905 in the National League 
with Boston and Chicago. He died in 1909.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Robinson Is Offered a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Atlanta Falcons safety Eugene Robinson, charged  
with prostitution solicitation the night before the Super Bowl, was 
offered a diversion program on Tuesday that, if completed, would 
clear the Pro Bowl player's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson did not appear before Judge Teretha Lundy Thomas in  
Miami-Dade County Court for his arraignment. Robinson's attorney, 
Jeffery Allen, huddled briefly with prosecutor Marc Weinstein to 
strike the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretrial diversion programs are often offered to first-time  
offenders of misdemeanors and require no plea. Robinson would be 
ineligible if Thomas discovers he has been convicted or charged 
with a crime in Florida or another state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say this is the standard resolution for solicitation  
cases,'' said Don Ungurait, spokesman for the Miami-Dade County 
State Attorney's Office. ``We hope that Mr. Robinson will do what 
he needs to do on pretrial diversion, and he and this office can 
move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Robinson has to have an HIV test and  
complete a course on AIDS. He will be able to complete the program 
in his home state of Washington where he lives in Woodinville with 
his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Robinson completes the program, charges will be dropped  
after another court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of solicitation, Robinson could have faced a  
maximum penalty of about 60 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 35, was arrested Jan. 30 for allegedly soliciting an  
undercover police officer for oral sex. He was among about 25 
people caught in a police sting on Biscayne Boulevard, a major 
street in downtown Miami frequented by prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons lost to the Denver Broncos 34-19 the next day in the  
Super Bowl with Robinson burned on the game's pivotal touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The athlete, who also played in two Super Bowls with Green Bay  
and leads active NFL players with 53 interceptions, is known as 
``The Prophet'' for his deep religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrest came about 12 hours after a Christian athletes group  
selected him the winner of an award for high moral character. He 
later returned the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Allen were not returned Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Law Would Force Clear Card Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- You've seen the enticingly low ``teaser''  
rates on envelopes offering new credit card accounts. But how long 
do the rates last, and what higher rates will replace them? 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation proposed Tuesday by Democratic lawmakers would  
require credit card companies to spell out that information more 
clearly and conspicuously. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also would have to clearly disclose any conditions  
under which the introductory ``teaser'' rate may be revoked, such 
as failure to make monthly payments on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card companies ``are taking advantage of current law to  
hook new customers with misleading promotions and to encourage 
customers to carry increasing debt burdens,'' said Rep. John 
LaFalce of New York, the House Banking Committee's senior Democrat, 
who is the bill's chief sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living in an age of 'buyer beware' in terms of credit  
cards,'' LaFalce said in a statement. ``Card issuers have increased 
the number and amount of fees, shortened payment periods, and 
contrived hidden penalties that can readily double or triple 
interest charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 House lawmakers, all Democrats, had endorsed the  
legislation, which also would put restrictions on new credit card 
accounts going to people under age 21. In addition, the bill would 
ban card issuers from canceling accounts of or imposing new fees on 
customers who pay off their monthly balances in full. 
</P>
<P>
	With personal bankruptcies continuing to soar, lawmakers of both  
parties last week began pushing legislation backed by credit card 
companies that would make it harder for people to erase their debts 
in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	LaFalce's bill could eventually be attached to the bankruptcy  
overhaul legislation, as happened last year, when the House passed 
such legislation. The Senate adjourned last year without voting on 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of a sweeping rewrite of the bankruptcy laws,  
including consumer groups, insist that the credit card networks, 
and the banks that control them, share the blame for mounting debt 
by aggressively mailing millions of solicitations to entice 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong economy, the number of Americans filing  
personal bankruptcies last year reached a record 1.4 million, up 
more than 300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Big credit card networks, notably Visa and MasterCard, and  
retail-business groups have said their losses from forgiven debts 
in bankruptcy have forced them to raise interest rates for 
consumers who handle credit responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McGarry, a spokesman for Visa USA Inc., said the  
information the card issuer provides to consumers concerning fees, 
interest rates and other terms already is adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., principal sponsor of the legislation  
to overhaul the bankruptcy laws, wasn't immediately available for 
comment on the Democrats' credit card proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	The LaFalce bill also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require card issuers to spell out in billing statements how  
long it would take customers to pay off their debt, and the total 
cost including interest, with only minimum monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minimum payments are the nicotine'' of the credit card  
industry, said Mary Rouleau, legislative director of the Consumer 
Federation of America. ``They should carry proper warnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that credit card solicitations on the Internet include  
``clear and conspicuous'' disclosures of terms and costs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Prohibit card issuers from mailing unsolicited cards with  
multiple purposes, such as telephone calling cards and debit cards, 
that also can be used to obtain credit. Federal law prohibits 
unsolicited mailings of usable credit cards, and the bill's 
sponsors maintain that such multi-purpose cards are sometimes used 
to get around the restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require card issuers to clearly disclose any fees and interest  
rates related to use of so-called ``convenience'' checks they 
provide to customers for payment to third parties.
