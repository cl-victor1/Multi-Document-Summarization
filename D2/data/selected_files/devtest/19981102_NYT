BARHAM SPARKS USC WIN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Courtney Barham scored USC's third goal, she
thought she was sealing a victory. Barham did score the deciding
goal, but it was on a shot 36 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Barham's header at the corner of the net in the 89th minute gave
the USC women's soccer team a 5-4 win over UCLA on Sunday in front
of a record home crowd of 1,057 at the L.A. Coliseum. The Bruins
rallied from a 3-0 deficit to tie it 4-4 in the 87th minute but
ended up with their second loss ever to USC (11-6-1, 5-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``When I scored the third goal, I thought it was a
nail-in-the-coffin type of goal,'' said Barham, a senior who capped
her final regular-season home game with her 14th point of the
season. ``I was never thinking it'd be wiped out completely. That
second goal, I was ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 win moves the Women of Troy into a tie with the
Bruins (15-3-1, 5-2), who entered the contest a half game behind
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local rivalry is one thing,'' Barham said, ``but the last
few years in the Pac-10, it's come down to who's won between UCLA
and USC. This year was even more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins won the Pac-10 title and advanced to the NCAA
quarterfinals last year. The Women of Troy have never reached the
playoffs. Both teams close out the regular season with games at
Arizona and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Arizona teams) don't have a chance as far as Pac-10
is concerned, but they're going to go in there trying to take us
down,'' Barham said. ``It's definitely not over yet''.
</P>
<P>
   That same ``it's-not-over-till-it's over'' philosophy was
applied by USC against UCLA, which is ranked No. 11 by Soccer
America.
</P>
<P>
   The unranked Women of Troy dominated the first half, starting in
the fourth minute with Kim Clark's first of two goals. USC outshot
the Bruins 13-4 for a 2-0 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the girls at halftime, if we could just get the third
goal, that should do it,'' said USC coach Jim Millinder, who earned
his 50th career win.
</P>
<P>
   Barham made it 3-0 in the 53rd minute. Five minutes later,
Karissa Hampton's outside shot sailed into the upper left corner of
the goal to give UCLA its first score. Tracey Milburn and Venus
James combined to bring UCLA within one at the 61st minute.
Following a USC goal by Isabelle Harvey, the Bruins' Staci Duncan
broke through the defense to dribble downfield and pass off to
Vanessa Clark, who scored the tying goal two minutes prior to
Barham's deciding goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the worst feeling to lose to USC,'' said James,
whose two goals moved the sophomore into a tie for the team lead at
nine. ``It's good for us to learn from, though. This is what it's
going to take to make it in the playoffs. We have to play 90
minutes, not just 45.''

PHILADELPHIA _ If there were ever a situation that cried out for
Jason Garrett, this is it. Not because he's a Princeton boy and
it's a tough problem that requires Ivy League brainpower. Not
because he's got a stronger arm or a better grasp of the Cowboys'
offense than Troy Aikman. Not for any reason that has something to
do with X's and O's or football strategy drawn up on a chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   Simply because Jason Garrett is not Troy Aikman. In other words,
survival.
</P>
<P>
   If the so-far-pretending 4-3 Cowboys are going to come out of
the bye week and make a very real run at becoming a legitimate
playoff threat through the second half of the NFL season, they will
most certainly need the talents of Aikman to carry them.
</P>
<P>
   There will be times over the coming weeks when Aikman will have
to make the thread-the-needle pass to Michael Irvin on third down.
Times when he will have to scramble away from pressuring defensive
linemen and make a bail-out pass to Billy Davis or Eric Bjornson.
Times when the Cowboys will have to rely on the strength of his
leadership and the sheer force of his will to come from behind late
in a game at home or on the road.
</P>
<P>
   There will be times when Aikman's veteran savvy alone will have
to pull the Cowboys through and keep this bounce-back season on
track to keep right on playing into January.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the time, and this is most definitely not the
place. Not in the heat of Monday Night Football against the Eagles.
Even the 1-6 Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly two months since Aikman left the field at
Denver's Mile High Stadium with a broken collarbone in a 42-23 loss
to the Broncos, and it is only natural that the determined
quarterback with three Super Bowl rings in his collection would
want to get back in the lineup to start to make things happen
again. And under normal circumstances, that is exactly what you
would want him to do.
</P>
<P>
   Just not here. Not under these conditions.
</P>
<P>
   To most every other opponent in the NFL, Veterans Stadium is a
rest stop along the long road that is the 16-game regular-season
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   To the Cowboys, this is the seventh level of hell. Eagles fans
don't just get up for the Cowboys. They get down and dirty and loud
and violent.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place that on the Monday night after Halloween will be
jam-packed with banshee-screaming, glassy-eyed, chain-rattling,
bloodthirsty, howling-at-the-moon werewolves. And none of them will
be in costume. They are merely run-of-the-mill Eagles fans to whom
an encounter with the hated Cowboys means life and death. Or
something more important.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of atmosphere that can get inside the helmets of
even a lowly bunch of Eagles and turn them into flesh-eating,
bone-crunching monsters.
</P>
<P>
   This is different than any other rivalry the Cowboys have within
the NFC East. Arizona is always happy not to get run off the field
by Dallas. The Giants have a natural dislike for the Cowboys, but
the New York-Dallas thing is more like a business war between
corporate giants. Even the series with the Redskins is filled with
more of a college-type rivalry, and beneath the intensity, there is
a mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   In Philly-Dallas, there is hatred, pure and unadulterated.
</P>
<P>
   The only time Eagles fans would not pour beer on Deion Sanders
is if he were on fire. They would rather lose to Saddam Hussein
than Dallas. They don't want to just beat the Cowboys, but also
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the concrete-hard turf at the Vet just might be the
worst place in the world for Aikman to make his comeback. A win
here tonight over the Cowboys on ABC would make the Eagles' season.
But to drive Aikman hard to the ground and fracture him again would
finish the Cowboys and keep the Eagles warm well into winter. A
year ago, they gave him a concussion in a 13-12 win over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett has gone 3-2 as the interim QB and done a decent enough
job to merit one more start. He shouldn't have to perform many
heroics, either. Not with the Cowboys having reinstalled the punch
in their running game. They currently rank sixth in the league in
rushing and are on pace to gain more than 2,000 yards on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   This is a task that Garrett can handle. Turn and give the ball
to Emmitt Smith. Make the short, safe passes to Irvin. Maybe get a
couple of big returns from Deion and try to get out of town with an
ugly win. More important, get out of town with Aikman still in one
piece for the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It's one more job that Garrett can handle _ sacrificial lamb.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
GREEN BAY, Wis. _ If the Green Bay Packers continue to survive on
Brett Favre's wing and Reggie White's prayer, they have a chance to
reach a third consecutive Super Bowl.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inspired by Minnesota's first loss of the season Sunday, the
Packers pounced on San Francisco as if they were playing the NFC
Championship Game, but they turned a 16-point advantage into a
three-point deficit before Favre and White responded to a 911
desperation call.
</P>
<P>
   Favre threw his third touchdown pass and White registered the
last of his three sacks to help the Packers defeat the 49ers 36-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started fast, hit a sinking spell but bounced back from
some bad situations,'' Packers coach Mike Holmgren said. ``How did
I feel when we fell behind? Let me put it like this: Anger was
pushing the other emotions out of my body. Sure, I was ticked off,
but I was able to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (6-2) pulled within one game of the Vikings in the NFC
Central. San Francisco (6-2) fell into a first-place tie with
Atlanta in the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was going to be a big game for our
organization,'' 49ers coach Steve Mariucci said. ``It was a tough
loss, and naturally I'm disappointed. It's not easy to lose, but we
don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Packers extended their winning streak over the 49ers to five
games. San Francisco quarterback Steve Young dropped to 0-8 as a
starter against the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Young was 24-of-39 for only 186 yards. He threw an interception,
lost a fumble and was sacked a career-high nine times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a surge of energy that allowed us to get off the ball
well,'' said White, who has 11 sacks in 1998 and became the first
player in league history to reach double figures 12 times in his
career. ``God gave me the strength to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us was keeping Steve in the pocket. We stayed in
our lanes and made sure the guys in the middle got a push. We did a
good job of getting after him, especially in the fourth quarter
when we really got revved up.''
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time in five games, Favre threw three
interceptions and had no one to blame but himself. There were no
tipped passes at the line, no ricochets off receivers' hands and no
wrong routes. Just terrible decisions by the best quarterback in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through this before with Brett,'' Holmgren said.
``It's not good, and he knows it. But we have to take more chances,
because the running game isn't what it should be. He just needs to
eliminate the bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Brett and I have been through this before. We're
either going to the mountaintop together or into the Dumpster
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Packers, Favre recovered in time to help
them outscore San Francisco 17-0 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Favre connected on 15 of 28 passes for 279 yards and three
touchdowns to go with his three interceptions. Antonio Freeman
caught seven passes for a career-high 193 yards, including
touchdowns of 80 and 62 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the ball in my hands, it was like a Doberman was
chasing me,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Jervey, who went to the Pro Bowl last season as a
special-teams player, began this season as the Packers'
third-string running back behind Dorsey Levens, who is injured, and
Raymont Harris, who has been ineffective. Against the 49ers, Jervey
had the best game of his career, gaining 95 yards on 17 carries and
looking like Paul Hornung on an 11-yard sweep for Green Bay's last
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Three Green Bay touchdowns _ Freeman's catches and Jervey's run
_ came on the first play of a possession. That's three touchdowns
in a total of 27 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who are 1-2 against teams with winning records,
couldn't have gotten off to a worse start. On the first play,
Freeman got away from cornerback Marquez Pope and eluded free
safety Merton Hanks for an 80-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On the 49ers' first series, Young was sacked by safety LeRoy
Butler and White. Then, Randy Kirk snapped the ball over punter
Reggie Roby's head and out of the end zone for a safety that made
it 9-0. Safety Pat Terrell intercepted Young moments later, and the
Packers capitalized when receiver Robert Brooks caught a 30-yard
touchdown pass to make it 16-0.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers proved they are resilient if nothing else. They scored
their first touchdown on Young's 12-yard pass to Jerry Rice. It was
the 80th time Young and Rice collaborated on a touchdown pass,
breaking the record they shared with Miami's Dan Marino and Mark
Clayton. Wade Richey's extra-point attempt was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   After Ryan Longwell kicked a 26-yard field goal for Green Bay,
Young scored on a one-yard run to pull San Francisco within 19-13
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Favre's second interception set up the
49ers at Green Bay's 35. Garrison Hearst carried twice, the second
for a 30-yard touchdown. Holder Ty Detmer couldn't get the ball
down for the extra point, leaving the score 19-19.
</P>
<P>
   On Green Bay's next series, strong safety Tim McDonald
intercepted Favre at the Packers' 49. The 49ers had first-and-goal
at the eight but had to settle for Richey's 20-yard field goal and
a 22-19 advantage that lasted into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers' explosion began innocently enough. Longwell tied
the score with a 45-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay's defense was at its best in the fourth quarter. It
dominated the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the Packers' second series in the quarter,
Freeman beat Pope off the line again and zoomed by Hanks for a
62-yard touchdown that took nine seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Young was helpless on the 49ers' next possession. Before end
Keith McKenzie drilled him for a sack, Young lost the ball, and
defensive tackle Santana Dotson recovered at the San Francisco 11.
On the next play, Jervey took off around the right side and scored
his 11-yard touchdown with 9:30 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers had three more series, but Green Bay's defense was too
good. The drives ended with two punts and a failed fourth-down
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of losing to the Packers,'' Rice said. ``We have to
bring it (the losing streak) to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other time they could have a chance this season is in
the playoffs.

McCORD DOES HIMSELF PROUD 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's back to the broadcast booth for Gary McCord
but not before proving, again, that he can hold his own on the
Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime CBS golf commentator and recent golf author wrote a
nifty 66 on his scorecard Sunday, capping a weekend of
progressively better rounds in a 5-under-par, 73-69-66_208 showing
at the Pacific Bell Senior Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun, much more fun,'' McCord said of the chance to play
rather than observe inside the ropes _ an opportunity he turned
into a seventh-place finish and $33,550.
</P>
<P>
   The former UC Riverside All-American, who got into the event at
Wilshire Country Club on a sponsor's exemption, has earned $112,173
in six senior events since turning 50 in May and has been a top-10
finisher his last two times out.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's winnings _ McCord's largest tour paycheck of the year _
sends him into December's senior- tour school in the top half of
the '98 earnings list despite limited appearances.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's taking this more seriously than his few appearances
in PGA Tour events in recent years but doesn't expect to be more
than a part-time senior-tour player whether he earns full exemption
(top eight at Q school) or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new go at 50,'' said McCord, who has shot in the 60s
in each of his last five tournaments with a senior-tour best of 65
at the Boone Valley Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My swing is a lot different than it was when I played on the
regular tour, I've got a lot more money than when I played on the
regular tour, so everything's kind of loosened up for me to play
and try to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be able to play a whole lot next year,'' he
added. ``Eight to 10 events regardless of whether I get No. 1 in
qualifying school or whatever. I've got a lot of stuff going on and
I've just got a couple of weeks to fit the Senior Tour in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love it, it's a ball. I like to play _ I know that now.
You've got to manage yourself, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   McCord admits it's also nice to have a fall-back position, just
in case his qualifying-school fate leaves him short of full-time
status on the no-cut, guaranteed-pay Senior Tour:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a couple of backup jobs, which makes it nice.''
</P>
<P>
   __ One up, one down: Tournament champion Joe Inman's dramatic
showing this week _ improving from No. 42 to No. 28 on the 1998
Senior Tour money list _ not only earned him full-time playing
status next year but also knocked Bob Dickson from the top 31 and
out of this week's Senior Tour Championship at Myrtle Beach.
</P>
<P>
   __ Palmer update: Arnold Palmer, the 69-year-old VMP (very most
popular) entry, closed 7-over-par 78 to finish next to last at 233
_ seven strokes ahead of tailender Gay Brewer. Palmer, wearing his
trademark pink shirt, struggled with two double-bogeys on the front
nine but birdied the 194-yard 13th.

THOUSANDS GATHER TO PAY TRIBUTE TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF
SHERMAN BLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For a few hours, the bitter fight to replace Los
Angeles County's late sheriff paused as politicians, peace officers
and thousands of mourners gathered at the Hollywood Bowl to
remember Sherman Block.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime sheriff, who died Thursday in the midst of a
pitched re-election campaign, was tough, funny, kind and wily,
speakers said Sunday. A mentor to younger officers and an obsessive
grandfather, Block was a self-effacing man who could tell a fine
story and write a good song.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one hell of a human being and always, to the last, a
fighter for what he believed in,'' said California Gov. Pete
Wilson, speaking before a sea of green and navy uniforms. ``Sherm
did it his way, and we are incredibly better off.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly bizarre battle for Block's job barely strayed
into Sunday's memorial service, held in the concert amphitheater to
accommodate a crowd of 6,000. Most speakers avoided any mention of
the 74-year-old Block's re-election bid, which is soldiering on
even after his death. And none talked about challenger Lee Baca, a
former Sheriff's Department chief whom Block repeatedly slammed as
unqualified to head the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight continued Sunday morning in the Bowl's aisles and
parking lot. Some Block backers urged residents to vote for the
deceased in Tuesday's election, a move that would let the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors appoint an interim sheriff. And
despite earlier reports that he was not invited to Sunday's
memorial service, a somber Baca shook hands with officers in the
crowd before listening to the eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was invited by Undersheriff (Jerry) Harper, and out of
respect for Sheriff Block and our 30-year friendship, I came to pay
my respects to his family and to the sheriff,'' Baca said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Block died of cerebral hemorrhaging several days after surgery
to remove a blood clot from his brain. He had been hospitalized
since Oct. 24, after he fell at home and hit his head. Block had
survived two bouts with cancer and regularly underwent kidney
dialysis. Baca had made Block's health a key issue in opposing his
race for a fifth term as sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   To the public officials and uniformed deputies listening under a
hot fall sun, Block was as much an institution as the immense
organization he led for almost 17 years. The only man to move
through every rank in the department, Block had learned the agency
from the inside out and knew how to move it forward, speakers said.
</P>
<P>
   County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke called him a tough
lawman and skilled administrator who could adapt and change as the
situation demanded. Even when she didn't agree with him, she said,
Block had her respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a belief that he'd find a way to make things
right,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson praised Block for helping hold Greater Los Angeles
together during some of the area's worst natural and man-made
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the (1994) Northridge Earthquake, during the civil
unrest that shook this city to its core, Sherm was this community's
Gibraltar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan marveled at the devotion of
someone who entered policing relatively late in life, after years
of working behind a deli counter. In 1956, Block was so impressed
with the professionalism and courtesy of an officer who gave him a
traffic ticket that he decided to go into law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the traits I admire most in people: grit,
determination, integrity and compassion for others,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Block's flag-draped coffin, others dwelled on
their personal love for the man, for his kindness and humility. His
rabbi, Jerry Cutler, remembered being stunned that the sheriff
wanted to join his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blown away,'' Cutler told the crowd. ``I said, `My God,
you're the Sandy Koufax of law enforcement.' He said, `Rabbi, I
used to work in the delicatessen business. Don't hand me that
baloney.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Block blended right in with the temple congregation,
except that he was the only one to show up for every service on
time, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
   When Block's casket was finally carried from the stage, tears
streaked the faces of some of the hundreds of uniformed officers
standing at attention. A 21-gun salute cracked through the theater
as a wedge of helicopters roared overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been an inspirational leader,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Susan
Cross of Simi Valley, eyes brimming behind her glasses. ``It's hard
to imagine doing without him.''
</P>
<P>
   A private burial was held later Sunday at Hillside Memorial Park
in Culver City.

SHERIFF'S FUNERAL BRINGS TOGETHER POLITICAL POWERHOUSES AS ELECTION
NEARS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The memorial services held for Sheriff Sherman
Block also served as one of the largest political rallies in recent
history.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral Sunday at the Hollywood Bowl brought out thousands
of mourners, some of California's top politicians and numerous
candidates in Tuesday's election, including gubernatorial
candidates Democrat Lt. Gov. Gray Davis and Republican Attorney
General Dan Lungren, and Democrat U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, who is
in a tough fight to keep her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the eulogies steered clear of politics, focusing instead
on Block's career and character. But several of the officials
sounded a call before the service for voters not to desert the man
who devoted 42 years to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department. Among them was Gov. Pete Wilson, who told reporters he
would be voting for Block if he lived in the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherman Block should be remembered for all he has given this
department, this county and this state,'' Wilson said during his
eulogy. ``Most of all, he should be remembered for what he did for
children. ... Believing that prevention was the best medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers described Block as a ``giant,'' as a ``hero,'' as
``an extraordinary man'' _ all phrases that could be used in a
political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said before
the service that he would be voting for Block.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew (his rival Lee) Baca and decided to run again,'' Gates
said. ``Obviously, he knew something, and I'm going to respect
(Block's) wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   If Block's name receives more votes than Baca in Tuesday's
election, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is expected
to select an interim sheriff to serve until new elections for
sheriff can be held.
</P>
<P>
   Baca, a former chief in the Sheriff's Department, attended the
ceremony but refused to discuss politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to pay my respects to a dear friend and his
family,'' Baca said, turning aside requests from television crews
for an interview. ``I have nothing else to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Block's campaign backers are urging supporters to cast their
ballots against Baca, but they tried to downplay politics Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political funeral,'' said Joe Scott, one of Block's
campaign managers. ``But, we don't want to talk about politics
today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the wrong time to be discussing politics,'' agreed Jay
Grodin, a longtime friend and head of the Block re-election
campaign. ``There will be plenty of time for that before Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said they plan to move ahead today with the Block
campaign and challenges to comments Baca made Saturday asking for
support to keep the Board of Supervisors from appointing an interim
sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Sunday that the Block campaign has attracted
international attention since the sheriff's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``One week ago, before he fell, this race was sub-radar,'' Scott
said. ``Since then, it's got national press. There have been
stories in The New York Times, in The Washington Post, on the
`Today' show. There's no way that would have happened otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the television cameras from every local station, as
well as CNN, to cover the funeral, Scott said Block's candidacy was
getting more attention in death than in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable,'' said one official, who asked not to be
identified. ``It's not every day you have an election with a dead
candidate whose people still are running a campaign. It's just
bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Lungren said people had to
choose Baca or allow the Board of Supervisors to select a successor
who would serve until the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said he would like
to look at the possibility of naming an interim sheriff who
promises not to seek election to a full term.

TAX INCREASES TO SAVE LAND ARE ON THE BALLOT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST WINDSOR, N.J. _ New Jersey voters nearly ousted Gov.
Christie Whitman last year partly because they were unhappy about
paying the highest property tax rates in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Election Day, 50 towns and seven counties will vote on
plans to increase property taxes, and the state's voters will
consider a $1 billion statewide borrowing plan _ all to help
preserve rapidly dwindling farmland and woodlands from development.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hardly a peep of opposition, even from the state's
anti-tax groups and staunchest fiscal conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really important,'' said Sam Perilli, state chairman
of United Taxpayers of New Jersey, one of the anti-tax groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the most densely populated state in the nation, and we
are running out of space here,'' Perilli said. ``I believe that the
average New Jersey citizen understands that you got to have green
around you. People are also beginning to realize that development
is a tax liability for towns, not an asset, because you have to
build schools and hire more police officers. And that makes
property taxes go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Perilli said his support for a 2-cent property tax increase to
preserve open space in his hometown of Cedar Grove in Essex County
caused members of an anti-tax group based in Washington to call and
scold him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `What are you doing up there?' '' Perilli recalled.
``I told them to put someone on the phone who knew what they were
talking about, who knew that preserving open space saves taxpayers'
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In five other states _ Georgia, New Mexico, Florida, Oregon and
Arizona _ voters are also considering statewide ballot questions,
either borrowing plans or tax increases, to help set aside open
space. And dozens of counties and towns across the country have
similar questions on the ballot, said Phyllis Myers, president of
State Resource Strategies, a company based in Washington that
tracks state and local open-space ballot measures.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two years, Ms. Myers said, voters from Austin,
Texas, to Monroe County, Pa., have approved more than 100 local
ballot initiatives, a reflection of the increasing concern about
the effect rapid development on traffic, schools and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were grass-roots efforts that are gaining political
support because people are beginning to make the connections about
what is happening around them,'' Ms. Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Suffolk County voters will be asked on Tuesday to
approve a $62 million borrowing plan to help buy land or
development rights. In addition, voters in the five towns on the
eastern end of Long Island will be asked to approve a real estate
transfer tax increase to help protect open space.
</P>
<P>
   State and local officials say voters are also beginning to
recognize that raising taxes or borrowing money to preserve open
space now can help keep down property tax rates in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building a school a year,'' said Carole Carson, mayor
of West Windsor Township, here in Mercer County, which has grown
rapidly in the last two decades. ``If we buy the land, we don't
have to build thousands of new schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade alone, 2,400 new homes have risen here on
2,700 acres of what had been farms and woods, prompting local
residents to approve one of the first property tax increases
dedicated solely to open space preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The tax is now 2 cents on every $100 of assessed property value,
and voters will be asked to increase that to 7 cents. In addition,
Mercer County is seeking approval for a 2-cent increase to be used
to pay for open space purchases across the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous support for it,'' Ms. Carson said. ``This
will allow us to control development and maintain some of the
agricultural business and character.''

 UNDATED: and character. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Georgia, prominent business leaders, as well as
conservationists, are campaigning for a statewide ballot measure
that would increase a real estate transfer tax to create a state
fund to acquire and preserve environmentally fragile or
historically important areas. The tax increase would generate about
$32 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Williams, president of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce, said many business leaders supported the measure because
they recognized that preserving open space would improve the
quality of life, which means it is important for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a requirement for our business success,'' Williams said.
``More and more companies we talk to say that quality of life is
the No. 1 factor they consider when relocating their companies. So
open space, and recreation, is all extraordinarily important to our
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman tapped into growing discontent about the pace of
development when she made preserving open space and managing
suburban sprawl a top priority of her administration's second term.
Her plan to preserve 1 million acres in the coming decade _ half
the remaining open space in the state _ is considered one of the
nation's most ambitious efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide ballot measure has bipartisan support. U.S.
Senator Robert Torricelli, a Democrat, joined Mrs. Whitman this
week in campaigning in Hunterdon County to help draw attention to
the ballot question.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman had first recommended asking voters to approve a
4-cent increase in the state's gasoline tax to pay for the open
space program, but state lawmakers, and Perilli, balked.
Legislative leaders maintained that a gasoline tax increase should
be used for transportation purposes only, but they did agree to the
governor's next recommendation, letting voters decide whether they
wanted to borrow the money. Under the plan, the state would
dedicate $98 million annually from existing state tax revenue to
pay for the $1 billion borrowing over 30 years. The total cost is
estimated to exceed $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1961, New Jersey voters have approved nine bond
referendums that have raised $1.39 billion to help protect more
than 400,000 acres from development. In addition, 53 towns and 13
of the state's 21 counties have floated bonds or dedicated property
tax revenue to set aside open space from development.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman and members of a coalition working to support the
ballot measure say they are optimistic about the ballot question's
fate. But Michael Catania, the executive director of the Nature
Conservancy of New Jersey, said he was somewhat concerned about a
low turnout, and about the effect it might have on the statewide
and local ballot measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all worry that people are just kind of disgusted and don't
want to hear about politics and government, and that could mean low
voter turnout,'' Catania said. ``Quite honestly, that is our
biggest concern. I think it will win, but we have to get people out
to vote.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ B. Thomas Golisano, a wealthy Rochester
businessman, is spending $20 million of his fortune on a
third-party campaign for governor of New York that nobody seems to
think he can win.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he does or not, Golisano's decision to run may turn out
to have been another smart investment. During the campaign, the
stock price of Golisano's payroll processing company, Paychex Inc.,
has jumped, just as it did when he ran for governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Forbes magazine called Golisano, Paychex's founder
and chief executive, one of the 400 wealthiest Americans, with a
net worth of about $800 million. And since Aug. 24, one week after
Golisano's campaign began advertising, Paychex stock has risen 26
percent, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index has stood
nearly unchanged. That has added about $200 million on paper to
Golisano's personal assets, far exceeding the sum he is spending on
his Independence Party candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what correlation there was between his campaign and the
price of Paychex stock, Golisano said: ``None.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 28 consecutive quarters where earnings growth has
been over 36 percent,'' he said last week in a telephone interview,
maintaining that the stock had risen simply because the company was
a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price has climbed steadily since the company went
public in 1983, consistently beating the market. But the margins
are usually not as wide as in the last 10 weeks, when Golisano's
ads have been an unavoidable feature of newspapers and television,
stressing his role as head of Paychex and calling it one of the
best-run companies in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, Paychex stock has far outperformed not just the
broader market, but the two other big payroll processing companies,
Automatic Data Processing Inc., which gained 11 percent, and
Ceridian Corp., which remained almost unchanged. Paychex stock is
traded on Nasdaq; the two others are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing about this is, when he announced to the Wall
Street investment analysts that he was running again, they viewed
it negatively because they thought he would be distracted from his
business,'' said Stephen McClellan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch
Global Securities in San Francisco. ``But New York is a pretty good
market for advertising to investors. It's not like running for
governor in Idaho.''
</P>
<P>
   If Golisano's ads have attracted investors and perhaps even new
customers to Paychex, then they have been a bargain. Television and
radio stations and newspapers charge much less for political
advertising than for commercial ads.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano says he is running because he is frustrated at the way
state government works and disappointed in Gov. George Pataki, and
even aides to his major opponents _ Pataki, a Republican, and Peter
Vallone, the Democratic speaker of the New York City Council _ say
there is no reason not to take him at his word. He may also be
looking for new challenges after 27 years at the helm of Paychex.
</P>
<P>
   When the Independence Party was founded in 1994, it would not
have attracted much attention but for Golisano's entering late in
the campaign as the party's gubernatorial nominee and spending $6.6
million of his fortune. He quickly threatened to tilt the balance
in the close race between Gov. Mario Cuomo and Pataki. The stock
price jumped about 15 percent after he began his 1994 advertising,
but then slightly fell back before Election Day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He took 4.4 percent of the vote, enough to secure the
Independence Party a place on all state ballots for the next four
years, on the fourth line. (Lines are assigned in order of
gubernatorial vote.) This year, polls have shown Golisano
attracting close to 10 percent of the vote, according to poll
respondents.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, he said he did not want to run again, but
Independence Party officials, lacking another strong candidate,
prevailed on him to wage another campaign. They hope to make the
party a power that can tip elections and sway governments, in part
by backing candidates from the major parties or withholding that
support, as the state's Liberal and Conservative Parties have done.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Independence Party nominated three Democrats
seeking statewide office: Rep. Charles Schumer for Senate,
Comptroller H. Carl McCall for re-election, and State Sen.
Catherine Abate for attorney general. Ms. Abate lost the Democratic
primary, and while her name will appear on ballots, she is not
running in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party advocates fiscal conservatism, term
limits and tolerance on social issues like abortion and gay rights.

ROWLAND CAMPAIGN BEGINS AN EARLY VICTORY TOUR

   WATERBURY, Conn. _ Gov. John Rowland strode triumphantly among
Republicans twirling New Year's-style noisemakers at rallies in
three packed halls Sunday, while his challenger, U.S. Rep. Barbara
Kennelly, motored across the state to thank her supporters for
their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the final public splash by the two campaigns, Mrs. Kennelly,
a Democrat, worked to buck up her own team, while Rowland focused
on spreading his luster to other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly had rented a 40-foot bus outfitted with leather
sofas and swivel chairs for Sunday's 11-stop, 14-hour schedule, and
campaign workers had painted a big banner for the side of the bus
that proclaimed her ``Better for Connecticut,'' and showed a donkey
doing a jig.
</P>
<P>
   Then she woke up Sunday morning and found that the front page of
The Hartford Courant carried a poll showing that respondents
favored Rowland over her by 57 percent to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news, which mirrored previous polls, did not seem to dampen
the upbeat mood of the 20 aides and relatives who packed the bus.
They clapped as patriotic marches played on the compact disk
system, and savored the memories of a much happier time as they
watched a videotape from the state Democratic Convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   At a Democratic breakfast in Derby, Mrs. Kennelly's voice broke
as she said: ``We have good times and we have bad times. But we
know who we are. We're good, and we care about our community. And I
thank you for being so nice to me this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, on the other hand, got a few days' jump on the calendar
with what his campaign promoted as ``The John Rowland Victory '98
Tour.'' He was driven from stop to stop in a behemoth motor home.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, Rowland warned of the consequences for other
candidates if his voters were so overconfident they stayed home.
``People say, `I wish you good luck, but you don't need it,' ''
Rowland said. ``You know what I say to that? Give me all the good
luck you have and I'll be glad to spread it around and share it
with others, or save it for another day.''

WITH POISE AND PRECISION, SUTTON WINS PLAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has been a long road back for Hal Sutton, but on
Sunday his journey was both memorable and rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving a pressure-packed four-man battle on the back nine,
and winning with a birdie on the first hole of a sudden-death
playoff with Vijay Singh, Sutton captured the Tour Championship in
dramatic fashion, capping his most rewarding season with a
remarkable victory.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Sutton win the biggest check of his career
$720,000, but he also clinched a spot on the Presidents Cup team,
and reaffirmed that he has returned as a force in golf.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton and Singh both finished at 6 under par for the tournament
(274), one stroke ahead of Jim Furyk and Jesper Parnevik, who tied
for third place.
</P>
<P>
   They were the only four players who finished under par for the
tournament at the East Lake Golf Club, a demanding course that
brought out the best in Sutton, who at 40 years old has seen his
career reach a new zenith.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the PGA Championship in 1983, Sutton's career
slowly spiraled downhill, and in 1992, he plummeted to 185th on the
tour's money list. But through hard work, Sutton slowly put the
pieces of his swing back together, and by this year, the puzzle was
complete.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Sutton's game and poise held up under tremendous
pressure, and on the first hole of sudden death, he hit a brilliant
4-wood tee shot from 245 yards away that landed 6 feet from the
cup, setting up a birdie putt for victory. When it was over, an
emotional Sutton reflected on both the highs and the lows of his
career. The lows were difficult. But the hard times made Sunday
even more special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from feeling embarrassed to hit balls on the range to
sitting here talking about winning this tournament,'' said Sutton,
who also won the Westin Texas Open in September and finished fifth
on the 1998 money list, earning more than $1.83 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long, hard battle,'' Sutton said. ``This is the
only way I know how to put this: When I stand on the tee and I look
down the fairway, I see the fairway. I don't see the rough. When I
was at rock bottom, all I could see was the rough. So yes, I think
I'm back. Now, I just need to sustain.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval was the other big winner Sunday at the
regular-season tour finale, clinching the 1998 money title
($2,591,031) and the Vardon Trophy for the year's lowest-scoring
average (69.13).
</P>
<P>
   Either Duval or Mark O'Meara, who finished tied for 13th on
Sunday, will win the player-of-the-year award voted on by the
players, but no matter how that voting turns out, Duval is pleased
with his year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in the second round, I was last, 30th in the
field, and to buckle down and play like I know I can play makes me
feel really good,'' said Duval, who shot a 68 on Sunday to finish
tied for eighth. ``And winning the Vardon Trophy equates to playing
the best golf each week.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sutton played the best golf for four days of the Tour
Championship, shooting an even-par 70 and finding a way to win
after starting the day 1 stroke behind Singh, who led most of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the other contenders fell by the wayside. Furyk, who
shot a 71 on Sunday, came to the 18th hole trailing Singh by 1
stroke. But Furyk made a costly bogey at the par-3 No. 18, when his
tee shot landed in the rough, followed by a chip that came up 15
feet short of the hole. Furyk missed his putt for par, and finished
at 5 under par.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, who shot a 68, reached the 18th needing a birdie, hit
his tee shot into the bunker, and settled for an up-and-down par.
</P>
<P>
   That left Singh and Sutton standing on the 18th tee, with Singh
holding a 1-stroke lead. Sutton hit his tee shot into the front
right bunker, but Singh got a bad break on his 3-iron tee shot,
when it landed on the green and rolled about 20 yards _ just into
the back rough. ``I thought it was pretty unlucky,'' said Singh,
who shot a 71 on Sunday.

<P>
   ``Vijay hit a beautiful shot,'' Sutton said. ``Until I got to
the green, I didn't realize he was over the green. As I'm walking
up, I said: `Vijay's over the green. We're in the ball game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton followed by hitting a tremendous bunker shot that stopped
3 feet from the cup. Then Singh was faced with his difficult
downhill chip, about 15 feet from the hole, with little green to
work with. Singh hit a decent shot, but it trickled down the severe
slope, and as the crowd groaned, rolled 35 feet past the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Singh 2-putted for bogey and Sutton made his 3-footer to force
sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton teed off first and hit the shot of the tournament, a
4-wood that hit the green and settled within 6 feet of the cup.
Singh's 3-wood was about 35 feet short, and after Singh missed his
putt for birdie, Sutton calmly made the putt for victory, pumping
his fist as the crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   DAVID DUVAL, TIGER WOODS, JIM FURYK, JUSTIN LEONARD, PHIL
MICKELSON, DAVIS LOVE III, MARK O'MEARA, HAL SUTTON, SCOTT HOCH and
MARK CALCAVECCHIA clinched spots on the U.S. Presidents Cup team by
finishing in the top 10 in the standing. Sutton knocked out FRED
COUPLES.

MAN REFUSES TO TALK TO POLICE ABOUT MISSING STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill., Wis.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man who went out with a pregnant Baruch College
student on the afternoon she vanished 10 days ago has hired a
lawyer and refused to talk to police about her disappearance or her
family's assertions that he fathered her unborn child and, against
her wishes, wanted it aborted, investigators said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not talking, he's not cooperating,'' a law enforcement
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said of the man,
who has not been accused of any crime, is not listed as a suspect
and has not been publicly identified by the police or the family of
the missing woman, 28-year-old Kristine Kupka.
</P>
<P>
   Her family has said that the man, a former Baruch College
lecturer who last spring began a relationship with Ms. Kupka, then
a student in one of his classes, accompanied Ms. Kupka on Oct. 24
when she last left the Brooklyn house she shares with several
roommates. Since the relationship began, the man has married
another woman, Ms. Kupka's family said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kupka, a senior honor student and part-time waitress who is
five months pregnant, did not return home that day, missed her
midterm examinations last week. She also has not appeared at a
Chelsea restaurant where she has worked for three years or
contacted friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as concern deepened, relatives and friends came to
New York from Atlanta, Chicago and Madison, Wis., where Ms. Kupka
grew up, to press the search with posters, publicity and a $2,000
reward for information.
</P>
<P>
   While the police say they have no evidence of a crime, Ms.
Kupka's relatives call her a responsible woman who wanted her baby,
expected to earn a degree in philosophy in January and would not
have gone away without telling loved ones. They have voiced concern
for her and raised questions about the man who, they say, fathered
her unborn child and was with her when she left her home on the day
she vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why isn't he cooperating with the police?'' Kathy Kupka-Moore,
a sister of the missing woman, said Sunday. ``If you're
forthcoming, you have nothing to hide.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Kupka-Moore said the relationship between her sister and the
man began last spring when he was an adjunct lecturer at Baruch, an
East Side Manhattan unit of the City University of New York, and
she was a student in a science class. He is now a lecturer at the
David B. Kriser Dental Center at New York University, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kupka became pregnant by him in early June, her sister said,
and about a month later, without telling Ms. Kupka, the man married
another woman. When he returned from his honeymoon _ ``he told her
it was a business trip,'' Ms. Kupka-Moore said _ she informed him
of the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when he told her he was married,'' Ms. Kupka-Moore
said. ``She was hurt and shocked. She couldn't believe he would be
so deceitful.'' A conflict rose immediately over what to do about
the pregnancy, she said. ``He wanted her to get rid of the baby,''
she said. ``He said it would ruin his life.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, Ms. Kupka rejected his plea that she have an
abortion. She did not ask for money or aid, but ``she wanted him to
sign a paper saying he would give up custody rights,'' Ms.
Kupka-Moore said. ``If he wanted to have supervised visits, she
would allow that.'' But he refused to sign any papers, and they saw
no more of one another until recently, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started coming around in the last couple of weeks,'' Ms.
Kupka-Moore said. ``It was suspicious. After all the lies and
dishonesty. She was confused. She didn't trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Kupka agreed to see him on Oct. 24, and they left her
house about 1 p.m. It was a sunny, warm Saturday, and Ms. Kupka _
tall, visibly pregnant, with short red hair and blue eyes _ wore a
lightweight black shirt and a black skirt and boots. Her sister
said she had no jacket or luggage and little money.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, she had not returned. A laundry worker and a
health-food store clerk in her neighborhood just south of Prospect
Park reported seeing her alone about 7 p.m., but the sightings were
not confirmed, Ms. Kupka-Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just disappeared,'' the sister said. ``You don't just
disappear.''

INMAN TAKES SENIOR CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gil Morgan, the two-time defending champion,
showed up wearing gilded colors for the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   But co-leader Joe Inman walked away with the gold, sprinting
past Morgan and strong-finishing Lee Trevino and Brian Barnes to
win Sunday's Pacific Bell Senior Classic at Wilshire Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in Hollywood,'' said Inman (66-68-68_202), who finished a
stroke ahead of Trevino and two up on Morgan and Barnes to earn a
full exemption for next year's Senior PGA Tour and a berth in this
week's Senior Tour Championship _ both on his last chance.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, a heart-on-his-sleeve type who cried in victory and
said he wanted only to try his hardest, vaulted from 42nd on the
Senior Tour money list to 28th while joining the 31-man field in
the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself not to back off, to be a man,'' said Inman, who
earned $165,000 to raise his first-year total to $566,402. ``I
wanted to walk off the course and be proud of my conduct and proud
of my effort.''
</P>
<P>
   He did so generally with three days of clutch putting _
especially on numerous difficult par saves _ and specifically with
three consecutive birdies on the back nine on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That trio of birdies, coming on putts of 12-, 10- and 10-feet on
holes 14, 15 and 16, finally overtook the sizzling Trevino, who
started the day four shots behind Inman and Morgan, passed them
before starting the back nine and was on pace to break Hale Irwin's
tournament-record round of 7-under 64.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino reached 7-under for the day with a birdie on 16, only to
bogey 17 while Inman was recording his third straight birdie on 16
and taking a lead he would not lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bogey at 17 was crucial,'' said Trevino, who finished with
a 65 that equaled the best round of the tournament. ``I putted
better today _ made a lot of good putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven of them dropped for birdies, and Trevino almost made a
tournament-winning pitch for an eighth birdie on No. 16, when his
shot from behind a greenside bunker hit an inch from the cup _ only
to roll another 25 feet uphill to set up the decisive bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Inman, who finished with four birdies, kept the suspense going
even after his backside-birdie run, first by driving into the the
rough on No. 17, then hammering a putt too hard on No. 18 to leave
himself a 4-footer for the win.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped the rough with a brilliant iron shot to mid-green but
wound up in an anxious mood again after overpowering a birdie bid
from the 18th fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe made it interesting on No. 18,'' Trevino said. ``I was
pulling for him to make that 4-footer.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevino had missed one much closer on No. 18, two-putting from
less than a foot.
</P>
<P>
   He made up for that with brilliant play Sunday, pulling Barnes
along with him and nearly into a Tour Championship berth. The big
Briton, who finished 32nd in tour earnings (31 play this week)
totaled five birdies and no bogeys and got within a stroke of the
lead before Inman's late surge.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes took the near-miss in stride, having already earned
playing privileges for next year through May by virtue of his win
in the Senior Canadian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had enough golf this year,'' he said, ``and I knew unless
I played like a bloody idiot I was going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan wound up far from fine in terms of his tournament win
streak and his streak of sub-70 rounds at Wilshire, where he had
shot eight straight. He finished 70, offsetting three birdies with
two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Green (69-206) finished fifth, Bobby Stroble sixth
(69-207) and four tied for seventh at 208, including broadcaster
and tour rookie Gary McCord.
</P>
<P>
   Inman wound up overwhelmed but hardly at a loss for words on the
day he won his largest check as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung in there,'' he said. ``I got tired of saying `Great
shot, Doc' (to Dr. Gil Morgan), got my rhythm back on No. 13 and
then started making the putts.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of people, including many overseas, who
could not follow the New York City Marathon on Sunday on television
or radio were able to read personal messages from their friends,
relatives and loved ones sent from the course with a bit of digital
derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Road Runners Club and a Web shopping site,
stuff.com, joined forces to set up check-in sites for runners both
at the start in Staten Island and at Mile 18 on First Avenue at
96th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Runners could either fill out a brief message form on paper
beforehand and hand it to volunteers on the course, or simply slow
down and shout a message, which volunteers then relayed by cellular
phone to staffers at the Road Runners offices. There, the runners'
bib numbers were used to identify them, and their words of wonder
and woe were ``Webcast'' almost immediately on the official
marathon site, www.nycmarathon.org.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of runners took advantage of the system. Among the more
unusual messages was one from Karen Berkenfeld of New York City to
Manhattan Quilters Guild. The message: ``Going strong. Can someone
help me get this `stitch out'?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the one from Jude Bourque of Baton Rouge, La., to
the Gang: ``Ahhhhhhh!! I need therapy!''
</P>
<P>
   Many more, however, were more upbeat, like the one from Tad
Witkowicz to ``the guys in West Boylston, Mass.'': ``Doing great,
body holding out good, thousands of people and fantastic feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Web site kept up a play-by-play account as the
race progressed and posted the finishers and times almost
immediately. By 5:30 p.m., the names, bib numbers and times of more
than 30,000 finishers were listed on line.
</P>
<P>
   Injury Report
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of physicians, firefighters and emergency medical
technicians on hand for medical problems at the New York City
Marathon had a relatively calm day both on the course and afterward
in the medical tents in Central Park. As of 7 p.m., the New York
City Fire Department, which coordinated the on-site medical effort,
reported that 104 runners were treated and released for minor
sprains, cramps and dehydration problems. Twelve cases were
serious, ranging from a fractured femur to chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   Fine Day for a Run
</P>
<P>
   Runners were not the only marathon participants happy about
Sunday's good weather. Volunteers at the finish line in Central
Park basked in the cool, partly sunny autumnal weather, which was a
welcome contrast to last year, when they were drenched in a
rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beach day,'' exclaimed Philip Lerner of New Hyde Park,
N.Y., a volunteer for the last eight years, as the race began.
``Pass the Coppertone!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Follow-Ups
</P>
<P>
   Catching up with runners profiled in New York Times articles in
the week before the race:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jimmy Behr of Staten Island, running for the 8,628th
consecutive day, finished his 24th straight New York City Marathon
in 3:29:30. His goal had been to run 3:30 or better to qualify for
next year's Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kirk Johnson, who described the emotions surrounding what
would be his first marathon in an article that appeared in the
Times on Sunday, finished in 4:27. ``I think maybe I started too
fast and fell into a hole for five or six miles, and it took me to
the end to crawl out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes on the Prize
</P>
<P>
   Meghan Howell said she was taught never to look over her
shoulder in a race. Had she done so in Sunday's pre-marathon high
school competition, she would have seen no one.
</P>
<P>
   Howell, a senior at Suffern High School in Rockland County,
N.Y., led from the start to win for the second straight year,
clocking 12 minutes 27 seconds on the 2.2-mile course through
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Romaniuk captured the boys' race in 10:49.9 to complete a
sweep for Suffern. He held off the fast-closing Marc Crosswell of
Elmont (N.Y.) High School by 1.3 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt confident a mile in,'' said Romaniuk, a 10th grader.
``There was no one around me.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell burst from the pack right away and beat the second-place
finisher, Karina Acevedo of Middletown (N.Y.) High School, by 20.9
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to run away from the sound of others'
feet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Marathon Meets Halloween
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of the New York City Marathon and Halloween
produced some suitably bizarre scenes Saturday night outside Tavern
on the Green at Central Park West and 67th Street. While long
queues of runners, most in warm-up outfits, waited on line for
admission to the traditional Ronzoni pasta party inside a huge tent
on the restaurant's grounds, hordes of children and a significant
number of adults dressed as werewolves, goblins and Frankensteins
strolled on their trick-or-treat rounds. The two groups eyed each
other with undisguised interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, why are those people wearing shorts?'' one diminutive
witch asked her vampire companion, pointing to a cluster of
marathoners in jackets bearing the name of a French athletic club.
(The temperature Saturday at 6 p.m. was in the high 40s.)
</P>
<P>
   Inside the tent, over a period of five hours, about 15,000
runners, many of them from outside the United States, carbo-loaded
on what Ronzoni dubbed jack o'lantern lasagne (the ingredients
included canned pumpkin), masquerade mostaccioli salad and
twist-or-treat pasta marinara. They were greeted at one point by
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Yankee pitcher Whitey Ford.
</P>
<P>
   A few marathoners arrived in costume, including a couple dressed
as dice in girdles of black and white Styrofoam squares, and a man
wearing a Little Red Riding Hood scarf and cape accompanied by a
woman in a wolf's mask.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Lazarowitz of Jersey City, N.J., a well-traveled
marathoner, came dressed as Minnie Mouse, complete with whiskers
and mouse ears. Among her reasons: She had run her first marathon
at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Most runners, however, were costumed as, well, marathoners, even
though most of the foreign visitors understood that it was, in
fact, Halloween. ``I couldn't pack my costume because my baggage
allowance didn't allow it,'' said Grant Andrea, an Australian now
living in London.
</P>
<P>
   Yasuhiro Natori, a biochemist from Japan, said he had learned
about Halloween during the two years he had lived in Boston, but
could not bring a costume on this trip because he combined it with
attending a scientific meeting in Philadelphia, ``so I had to pack
a suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mas of Lima, Peru, a veteran of two marathons in his home
country but participating in his first New York City Marathon, was
well aware of the holiday, but disdained wearing a costume. ``In
Peru,'' he said, ``that's for children.''

VASSER FINDS THE FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ As teammates and friends over the past three
seasons, CART drivers Jimmy Vasser and Alex Zanardi say they have
shared expertise and exchanged ideas to make themselves and their
team better.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi said one of his suggestions to Vasser has been to kindle
a sense of extra determination, ``a kind of fire in the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   That fire was crackling Sunday in a final-lap shootout at the
California Speedway as Vasser blazed by Greg Moore and held off
Zanardi to win the Marlboro 500 and its season-best $1 million
prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fantastic way to finish the season,'' said Vasser,
who was able to move up to second in season points to Zanardi
thanks to the win. ``The million dollars is great, but the goal for
me coming in here was to finish second in the championship. Alex
has had the championship won for some time and it's been a goal of
our team for me to finish second.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore wound up second in the race and Zanardi third. Bobby
Rahal, making the final start of his career, finished 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser's goal was just a two-mile dash away when Sunday's race
restarted with one lap left after an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Race leader Paul Tracy had spun off the track a few laps before,
leaving Greg Moore in first, Vasser second and Zanardi third when
the green starter's flag fell on lap 250. And instantly Vasser went
high and Zanardi went low to try to pass Moore on the front
straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   They were both by him in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just came out of nowhere,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was able to get one place back before the checkered flag,
beating out Zanardi for second. But Vasser was out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser was in hot pursuit of the victory from the outset Sunday,
charging from his starting post on the outside of pole-winner Scott
Pruett to take the lead on the opening lap.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an event kept close by the speed-reducing Handford Wing
device, he stayed at or near the leaders _ which at various times
included himself, Moore, Michael Andretti, Tracy and Mauricio
Gugelmin _ successfully staying out of trouble and waiting for an
expected end-of-race free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   And as Vasser hung tough, leading 63 of the 250 laps and always
staying close, his competition slowly exited the field.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett, who won the pole with a best time of 233.748 mph, was
near the leaders through the early going. But on the 139th lap, his
car lost traction in turn 4 and hit the outside wall. Pruett was
unhurt but his race was over.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser's chief rival for second place in season points, Dario
Franchitti, had left the race in the 113th lap, his car spewing
smoke and flame as he slowed to a stop along the backstretch apron.
Franchitti, running second in the race at the time, led Vasser by
12 points (160-148) coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, who led 44 laps Sunday, went out on lap 211, as the
racing became more intense. While running second to Vasser,
Andretti's car got too low in turn 4, lost traction and spun hard
into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get as much out of the track as possible and I
pushed it a bit too hard,'' said Andretti, who was not injured.
``It's too bad because we were really strong today.''
</P>
<P>
   With 10 laps to go, Vasser was running third and preparing to
make a late move on the leaders, Tracy and Moore.
</P>
<P>
   But a yellow flag brought out after an accident involving Bryan
Herta and Max Papis was in force for laps 241 through 245. And as
the cars restarted on lap 246, Tracy suddenly lost control,
spinning into an infield wall, leaving Moore first, Vasser second
and Zanardi third as another yellow flag came out and the race
appeared headed for a yellow-flag finish that would have made Moore
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was speechless,'' Vasser said of Tracy's misfortune. ``But I
was hoping they would get it cleaned up quickly so I would have a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   They did.
</P>
<P>
   And with one lap left, Vasser and Zanardi pounced.
</P>
<P>
   All weekend, drivers have said that air currents caused by use
of the Hanford Device gives cars running in packs an advantage over
cars running alone. Out in front by himself, Moore was ripe for the
picking, Vasser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these races, you don't want to be the lead car on the final
lap,'' Vasser said. ``He was a sitting duck.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the eighth of Vasser's CART career and his third
this season. And it gave his team, Target Chip Ganassi Racing, its
second straight one-two finish in the standings. Zanardi and Vasser
also finished first and second last year.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser, the 1996 CART champion, said he has enjoyed his
three-year association with Zanardi and will miss him next year
when Zanardi moves to Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot from Mr. Zanardi,'' he said. ``He's been a
great teammate and a great friend. It's great to be up (on the
winner's platform) with him.''

HOLLYWOOD GEARS UP FOR END-OF-YEAR PUSH TO CAP RECORD-BREAKING
YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood's three-year hot streak shows no signs
of cooling as the movie industry scrambles to get ready for its
critical holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The national box office remains on track to beat last year's
record by an astounding 10 percent to finish at $7 billion. That
would beat the back-to-back gains of 9 percent in 1997 and 8
percent in 1996, and certain hits like ``A Bug's Life'' and
``Stepmom'' will keep moviegoers coming during the last two months
of 1998, observers believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great year,'' declared Paul Dergarabedian,
president of industry tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. ``And I think
we're going to go out with a bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics may claim higher ticket prices and ``Titanic'' caused
the gain, but that's not the case. The average ticket price has
gone from $4.59 to $4.65; the first $158 million for ``Titanic''
came during the last 12 days of 1997. That means this year's
improvement has as much to do with strong performances by dozens of
films as it does with Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   Dergarabedian noted this year's Friday-Sunday box office
receipts have topped their 1997 counterparts for the last 16
consecutive weekends and on 33 of the 43 weekends so far this year.
``The performance really is staggering and the bottom line is that
the product is out there,'' he said. ``You don't have 10 films get
over $100 million without people telling other people to go see
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's optimism received a major boost two weeks ago when
executives for studios and theater chains gathered in Atlantic
City, N.J., for the annual ShowEast convention. Exhibitors came
away raving about the screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll do better during the holiday season this year
than last year,'' said Chan Wood, head film buyer for the Los
Angeles-based Pacific Theaters chain. ``Picture for picture, this
year looks better than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood also noted that, unlike other years, all major genres _
family, romantic comedy, science fiction, action and Academy Award
hopefuls _ have strong representation. ``And I think the scheduling
has been spread out pretty well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The final weeks of the year are crucial to studios and theater
chains. It marks one of the heaviest movie-going periods,
presumably when large groups of family members go to movies
together, and is the launch time for serious Oscar campaigning.
Last year's Thanksgiving-New Year's period generated 17 percent of
annual business, compared to 15.4 percent during the 11-week fall
period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Early betting is that at least a half-dozen holiday-season films
will join the 10 that have topped $100 million domestically this
year. Analysts believe the following will enjoy close to slam-dunk
success:
</P>
<P>
   --Disney's ``A Bug's Life,'' the season's strongest candidate.
The computer-animated comedy is the first from Pixar Animation
since it scored a major hit in 1995 with ``Toy Story.'' Stewart
Halpern, an analyst with ING Barings Furman Selz, believes it will
match ``Toy Story's'' $192 million domestic gross.
</P>
<P>
   --Sony's ``Stepmom,'' with Julia Roberts in the title role. Buzz
has heated up since ShowEast. ``Everyone who saw it was touched,''
Wood said. ``This is a 10-hankie film.''
</P>
<P>
   --Warner Bros.' ``You've Got Mail'' with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
in a romantic comedy set in New York with echoes of their 1993 hit
``Sleepless in Seattle.'' ``It's good, if not better, than
`Sleepless,' '' said Dan Klusman, editor of the Independent
Marketing Edge newsletter. ``It's sort of formulaic but it works
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   --20th Century Fox's World War II drama ``The Thin Red Line,''
which will not go into wide release until next year but has emerged
as a strong Oscar candidate.
</P>
<P>
   --Universal's ``Meet Joe Black,'' with Brad Pitt as the Grim
Reaper. The buzz has been hot for months despite its running time
of nearly three hours. ``It doesn't seem long,'' Klusman said. ``I
thought it was a great story with broad appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   --Universal's comedy-drama ``Patch Adams,'' based on a true
story, with Robin Williams as a medical student with offbeat
approaches to healing. Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel
Source forecasting service, said Williams will likely receive an
Oscar nomination. ``I think this is the feel-good film of the
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   --DreamWorks' ``Prince of Egypt'' is its second shot in the
battle to rival Disney in animation. ``We think it will cross over
into the mainstream,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's distribution chief Wayne Lewellen said the outlook
for the holiday season is better this year than it was at this time
last year, when the town was holding its breath over ``Titanic.''
``I don't think there's a single big picture right now, but we're
hearing very good things about several,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (2nd take to follow)
</P>
<P>
   Except for ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Meet Joe Black,'' the season's
heavy hitters are clustered around Christmastime. That's a
substantial shift from a few years ago, when November was the hot
slot for releases, and it underscores how well the going-late
strategy worked last year for ``Titanic,'' ``Good Will Hunting,''
``Tomorrow Never Dies'' and ``As Good As It Gets.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen other major films also are generating strong buzz
and could do more than $50 million domestically, including
Universal's remake of ``Psycho,'' Fox's ``The Siege,'' Disney's
``Enemy of the State'' and its remake of ``Mighty Joe Young,''
Sony's sequel ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' and
Paramount's ``Rugrats'' and ``Star Trek: Insurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney has allocated the valuable Dec. 25 date for ``Mighty Joe
Young,'' an updated version of the 1949 film about a lovable
15-foot gorilla. It was originally slotted for mid-July, then reset
for Christmas in order to avoid competing with ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Ted Hartley, who first pitched the idea four years ago,
said test screenings have generated solid responses from children
and adults. ``Christmas is exactly the right time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several offbeat films have also generated heat, including
Gramercy's ``Elizabeth,'' Fox Searchlight's ``Waking Ned Devine,''
and PolyGram's ``Very Bad Things,'' a bleak comedy about a bachelor
party gone bad. The latter, starring Cameron Diaz in her first film
since ``There's Something About Mary,'' has received the choice
release date of Nov. 25, a day before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being the counterprogramming to `A Bug's Life,' '' said
producer Cindy Cowan. ``I doubt the entire family will go see this
after Thanksgiving dinner, but we will do well for people anywhere
from 18 to 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowan said screenings at colleges have produced exceptional
response, leading to the studio's decision to release ``Things'' at
1,500 theaters and spend $15 million on promotion. ``We figured
people would love it or be appalled by it and that it would go as a
platform release in the art houses,'' she said. ``It tested way
beyond what we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every film will be a hit, but what's impressive is that so
many have breakout potential. ``It doesn't look like any `Titanic'
this holiday season but there are a lot of films that are going to
do over $100 million and play well into 1999,'' Bucksbaum said.
``Keep in mind that it will take five films to match `Titanic,' so
this is a really solid schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   How has the movie business kept growing at a time of spiraling
costs and brutal competition for entertainment dollars?
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, studios have become a bit more careful.
Although portrayed as havens of wild spending, the Hollywood majors
have managed to cut back slightly on the number of releases and
avoid big-ticket flops. They also have backed away from several
projects with $100 million-plus price tags, such as a fifth
``Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many intangibles, but I think studios are getting
more control over what's a hit,'' Dergarabedian said. ``No amount
of marketing can make up for a bad movie, but good word of mouth is
priceless on movies like `Rush Hour,' `There's Something About
Mary' and `Saving Private Ryan.' It's in the film.''
</P>
<P>
   With the average cost of making and marketing a movie now more
than $75 million, studios are playing it safer, Klusman believes.
``I think overall, you're seeing a higher quality of filmmaking
over the last year with fewer releases but better films,'' he said.
``There weren't many bombs this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, the business is no longer dominated, as it had been
since the late 1980s, by Warner Bros. and Disney. Sony was the big
winner in 1997 and Paramount has been the leader all year, thanks
to ``Titanic,'' ``The Truman Show'' and ``Deep Impact.'' With
``Rugrats'' and ``Star Trek'' still to come, it will soon join Sony
and Disney as the only studios to top $1 billion domestically in a
single year.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, studios are scheduling sensibly, avoiding
head-to-head encounters in the same genre. A key case in point came
in early summer when ``Deep Impact'' and ``Armageddon'' opened two
months apart, rather than two weeks apart.
</P>
<P>
   The only potential jam-up during the holidays is around
Thanksgiving when ``A Bug's Life,'' ``Rugrats'' and ``Babe: A Pig
in the City'' are competing. `` `A Bugs Life' is the one film
assured to be a success because of the `Toy Story' reputation and
`Rugrats' is getting a real positive buzz,'' Bucksbaum said. ``So
the `Babe' sequel may be the third wheel in that bunch although
Thanksgiving is the biggest time of the year for family films.''

FINAL CHECKERED FLAG FALLS ON ZANARDI, RAHAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Oh, how the CART series is going to miss Alex
Zanardi.
</P>
<P>
   It will miss Bobby Rahal who, like Zanardi, made his last tour
start Sunday in the Marlboro 500, to be sure. But Zanardi is really
going to be a hard act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful two-time CART champion, who is headed for Formula
One next season, made that clear with his gutsy third-place finish
at the California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi did not qualify well for Sunday's race, lining up 18th.
</P>
<P>
   And in the early going, his car did not handle well and he soon
found himself more than a lap behind the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was pushing hard at first,'' Zanardi said. ``We made
some little changes that put some speed back into it, but by then
we were a lap down.''
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers might have written off the race at that point. Not
Zanardi.
</P>
<P>
   After getting his mechanical problems worked out, Zanardi _ who
came from more than a lap down to win the Long Beach Grand Prix
this year _ was on the move. By the halfway point, he had moved up
to eighth. By lap 200 _ with 100 miles to go _ he was sixth.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end, he was contending to steal the race. He might
have if not for a slip-up on turn 2 of the final lap as he and
teammate Jimmy Vasser charged past Greg Moore in a final-lap
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``My car got loose a little bit in the turn and I fell a little
back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was able to get back around Zanardi and finish second. But
it didn't bother Zanardi, who has built a reputation for aggressive
driving during his three-year run in CART.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got third place, which is much better than I thought, so
I'm very happy,'' Zanardi said. ``When I saw Jimmy take the lead, I
was very happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal wasn't sure what his emotions were after finishing 11th in
his final race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't exactly know what I'm feeling,'' Rahal said
after struggling to stay with the leaders all afternoon. ``A long
chapter in my life is over. A new chapter is beginning. I don't
know what it will bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal was the object of tributes all weekend as his competitors
made final shows of respect. During practice Sunday, each of the
other teams lined pit row wearing Groucho Marx glasses _ reminders
of Rahal's characteristic moustache and glasses _ as he drove by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to mention any names, but that's the best I've
ever seem some of those people look,'' Rahal said.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal, ever the competitor, said there was one feeling he could
describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the race, I remember being mad because I
couldn't get by (Helio) Castro-Nieves and take 10th,'' he said.
``So I wasn't going to give up today. I was fighting to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   And he noted a bit of irony that nearly resulted from a crash
between Bryan Herta and Max Papis, who will be Team Rahal teammates
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was driving by, I almost got hit by the shrapnel from
their cars,'' Rahal said. ``That would have been great _ all three
of us out together.''

BULLDOG TURNER, 79, A STAR FOR BEARS AND HALL OF FAMER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bulldog Turner, the Chicago Bears Hall of Fame center and
linebacker who played on four National Football League championship
teams in the 1940s, died Friday at home in Gatesville, Texas. He
was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who served as head coach of the New York Titans, the
Jets' forerunners, in 1962, had been suffering from lung cancer,
his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when the Bears of George Halas were known as the
Monsters of the Midway, players were expected to be versatile as
well as rugged. Turner, an All-Pro six times in a 13-year career
with the Bears, fit the mold perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   As the center in a then-novel T formation directed by
quarterback Sid Luckman, he used his 6-foot-2-inch, 232-pound frame
to provide powerful blocking. As a linebacker, he employed his
quickness to pick off passes, snaring a league-leading eight
interceptions in 1942. The only time he carried the football from
scrimmage _ against a combined Steeler-Cardinal team in 1944 when
the Bears' regular running backs had been ejected in a fight _ he
ran 48 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what kind of player he would have been if he ever
got to rest during a game,'' his teammate and the star lineman
George Musso once said.
</P>
<P>
   Voted to the 1940s All-Decade NFL Team by the Pro Football Hall
of Fame, Turner was also something of a coach on the field.
``Bulldog knew what every player should do in his position on any
given play,'' Bears running back Hugh Gallarneau recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Sweetwater, Texas, Clyde Turner called himself
Bulldog to create an aura of fierceness when he tried out for the
football team at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene. He became a
Little All-American there and was the Bears' No. 1 draft pick in
1940. But the Detroit Lions also wanted him and were fined $5,000
by the NFL for tampering when they tried to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's rookie season concluded with the Bears' 73-0 drubbing
of the Washington Redskins in the NFL championship game. In the
third quarter, he intercepted a pass and ran it back for a
touchdown. With the Bears scoring 11 touchdowns and their
place-kickers drilling so many extra points into the stands, the
teams were running out of footballs. Turner recalled that Halas
asked him to snap the ball wildly after one score so they would not
be minus yet another ball. ``I told Halas I wasn't going to make a
bad snap, not in a championship game,'' Turner remembered. He
snapped the football perfectly but the holder, evidently under
orders as well, fumbled it.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1946 title game against the Giants, Turner's block helped
spring Luckman for a 19-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter, a
memorable bootleg play that sent the Bears to a 24-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Upon retiring as a player after the 1952 season, Turner became
an assistant coach under Halas for four years. In 1962, he was
named coach of the Titans, succeeding Sammy Baugh, the former star
quarterback of the Redskins who had preceded him by two years at
Sweetwater High School.
</P>
<P>
   When the Titans' owner, Harry Wismer, ran out of money to pay
his players and they didn't want to suit up for a late-season game
at Denver, Turner promised them they would eventually get their
checks. They voted to play and beat the Broncos, 46-45. The league
assumed the payroll and the team finished at 5-9, losing its final
three games. The next year, the franchise became the Jets under new
ownership, and Turner was replaced by Weeb Ewbank.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1966 and
his No. 66 was retired by the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Pat Turner of Gatesville and
Sandra Shaffer of Big Spring, Tex.; a sister, Ilene Hairston of
Gatesville; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

<P>
   Turner's favorite moment came in the 1947 regular season when he
intercepted a pass by Baugh and zigged and zagged 96 yards for a
touchdown with Baugh draped over him for the final 7 yards.
</P>
<P>
   As Turner recalled it: ``I looked up and said: `Sammy Baugh, I
can outrun you. How did you get back there?' And he said, `Well,
Bulldog, you just cut back one time too many.'''

HURRICANE DEATH TOLL: 1,000 AND RISING IN CENTRAL AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)  (Eds: CORRECTS 2nd graf, capital is Manaugua.)  (jw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Intense and widespread flooding in the wake of Hurricane
Mitch has killed more than 1,000 people in Central America, with
hundreds more still missing, their villages buried under huge
mudslides, relief and government officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In northwestern Nicaragua, more than 360 bodies entombed
overnight by one such avalanche were recovered during the day from
settlements at the foot of the Casita Volcano, near Posoltega,
about 45 miles northwest of Managua, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing rainfall and extensive damage to roads and bridges
hampered relief efforts all over Nicaragua and Honduras, the
countries most severely affected by the powerful late-season storm.
Some residents were evacuated from the area around Posoltega when
rivers began rising late last week, but officials said they
expected the death toll in the area to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some communities were completely destroyed,'' said Leonora
Rivera, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Red Cross. ``The number of
dead will increase considerably once it stops raining and we can
get into isolated areas,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Nicaragua's Minister of Defense, Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro Barrios, said, ``Between 1,000 and 1,500 may have died''
when mudslides on the slopes of the volcano came crashing down on
peasant villages at the bottom. ``We are dealing with a national
tragedy, which all of Nicaragua is mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, areas east of Managua have been inundated by
rampaging flood waters, driving thousands from their homes. Lake
Managua and Lake Nicaragua, normally separated by a narrow strip of
land, have risen so much and so rapidly that they have merged,
leaving the town of Tipitapa and sections of the Pan-American
Highway under several feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just this country, but all of Central America is cut
off,'' President Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua said in a televised
address in which he urged vulnerable people to seek shelter on high
ground. His Honduran counterpart, Carlos Flores, found himself
trapped in San Pedro Sula, an industrial city of 500,000 people,
cut off from the capital by flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both countries said they were having difficulties
obtaining reliable death counts from affected zones. Normal
communications have been severed, and many residents have fled to
other areas on their own, leading Juan Navarro, a spokesman for
Aleman, to caution that ``there is a lot of anarchy'' in the
estimates being reported in local press accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot yet specify with certainty the magnitude of the
disaster and the number of dead,'' Aleman said before declaring
three days of national mourning Sunday night in remembrance of what
he would only estimate as ``hundreds'' of fatalities. ``But I
believe that since the earthquake of 1972, we have not suffered so
much loss of human life as the misfortune experienced in recent
days.'' The quake destroyed much of Managua and killed as many as
5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   With sustained winds of up to 180 mph at its peak, Mitch was by
far the strongest storm of the 1998 hurricane season. But the bulk
of the damage has occurred as it diminished in recent days from a
rare Category 5 storm, the most severe on the Saffir-Simpson scale,
to a tropical depression stalled over the Gulf of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, a strong front over the Gulf of Mexico
prevented the storm from pushing northward, thereby sparing Cancun
and the Yucatan Peninsula, which had been directly in the storm's
original path. As a result, heavy rains have fallen ceaselessly for
nearly a week not just in Honduras and Nicaragua, but throughout
Guatemala and El Salvador, both of which have also declared states
of national emergency, and in Belize.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of Central America, rainfall exceeding two feet
was recorded in a single 24-hour period. With rivers already
overflowing in several nations, the National Hurricane Center here
on Sunday was predicting up to 10 more inches of rain for the
northern half of Central America, which was sure to worsen the
crisis. A spokesman said Sunday night that the situation was too
chaotic to estimate rainfall for Monday, adding that the center
expected the rains to ease considerably overnight.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras and home to nearly a million
people, the raging waters of the Choluteca River swept away entire
neighborhoods over the weekend, as well as cars, trucks, trees,
power lines and livestock. More than 130 people were reported to
have drowned, and as residents fled or sought safety on roofs,
police reported that looters were raiding stores and homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capital has been leveled,'' Mayor Cesar Castellanos said.
``Blocks and blocks of middle-class and poor neighborhoods, shops _
they have all been completely demolished.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Later Sunday, Castellanos and three other people were reported
to have been killed when their helicopter crashed during a flight
to inspect damage and repair efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In Guatemala, a light plane, said by local officials in the
province of Quetzaltenango to be the property of an American
missionary group, also crashed in heavy rain, and a dozen
passengers were reported killed.
</P>
<P>
   The lightly populated Bay Islands, a favorite haunt of divers
about 30 miles off the northern coast of Honduras, appear to have
been especially hard hit. Over the weekend, a television crew flew
over the islands of Guanuja and Roatan, isolated from the mainland
for nearly a week, and filmed scenes of devastation: houses, hotels
and palm trees flattened and boats strewn about like toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of nature are hammering us in every inch of
national territory,'' said the commander of the Honduran Armed
Forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Rodolfo Pacheco, chief of the Honduran Air Force, said:
``This is a catastrophe beyond measure. It's incredible. The entire
nation is in danger.''

PATRIOTS BACK ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ A wise old football sage once said that in
confusion there is profit.
</P>
<P>
   With three receivers out because of injuries, and a fourth,
Shawn Jefferson, sidelined for a bit in Sunday's game after
suffering a rib injury, the Patriots seemed doomed. But New England
discovered the talents of second-round pick Tony Simmons, whose
63-yard touchdown reception in the fourth quarter propelled the
Patriots to a 21-16 win over the Colts before 58,056 at the RCA
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   They also rediscovered the talents of their All-Pro tight end,
Ben Coates, who caught 10 passes for 109 yards. And the defense,
led by Lawyer Milloy's two late interceptions of Peyton Manning
passes, helped preserve what was a tougher victory than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The win, which was not unexpected against the 1-7 Colts,
improved the Patriots to 5-3 (their same record as last year at
this time) and ended a two-game losing streak. They also improved
to 2-2 in the AFC East and were snuggled in a four-way tie with
Buffalo, Miami, and the Jets for the division lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be a difficult game and it was,'' said
Patriots coach Pete Carroll. ``Ben stepped up big for us and Tony
Simmons did a terrific job. We hung in there. We needed to win it
and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots secured control with the 63-yard bomb from Drew
Bledsoe to Simmons, the rookie from Wisconsin, with 14:16 remaining
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had taken over on downs at their 37, and after a
long drive late in the third quarter resulted in an interception,
offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese decided to go for it, knowing
that Simmons had been beating cornerback Jeff Burris all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to fight Burris off and catch the ball,'' said Simmons,
who matched Coates's total of 109 receiving yards but on only four
receptions. ``It was a difficult play, but those are plays you have
to make. The ball was right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe (22 of 35 for 306 yards, with 2 TDs and the one
interception), who had problems on the long ball last week vs.
Miami, led Simmons perfectly down the right sideline with a tight
spiral. Simmons indeed fought off Burris, who was called for
interference on the play, but created enough separation to make the
catch at the 15. He took it in to give the Patriots a 21-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing we couldn't close it out, but that's an
emerging team,'' Bledsoe said. ``They're going to cause a lot of
teams problems down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts almost caused them for the Patriots, driving 88 yards
on 13 plays to make it 21-16 with 3:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   The drive featured elusive running by Marshall Faulk, who had a
big 20-yard catch, and shoddy tackling by Ted Johnson, who allowed
Marcus Pollard to get out of his grasp for a 15-yard touchdown
catch.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts went for the 2-point conversion, and Faulk was stuffed
by the middle of the Patriots' line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at the film, we'll see we had a chance to ice the
final 4 1/2 minutes of the game, but coming off a two-game losing
streak, right now I'm not going to be too critical,'' said
offensive tackle Bruce Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Manning threw two costly interceptions late, when it appeared he
had a chance to lead the Colts back. Nine of his 16 picks have come
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   With the Patriots leading, 14-10, the Colts took the second-half
kickoff and were forced to punt. Bledsoe then put together an
efficient drive that started at the Patriots' 9 and went to the
Colts' 11. But Bledsoe, who had thrown six passes to Coates during
the march, tried to drill one into Henry Ellard at the 5.
Cornerback Robert Blackmon stepped in front of Ellard and made the
interception, the first by Bledsoe against the Colts in six games.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Bledsoe directed a nine-play, 80-yard
scoring drive that consumed about five minutes. Coates, who had 53
catches vs. the Colts entering the game, became the focus for
Bledsoe, hauling in a 27-yard pass to the Indy 30. Another huge
happening was a 21-yard interference call on Burris vs. Jefferson
on third and 11 at the Colts' 31. From there, Robert Edwards raced
nicely around the right corner on an 8-yard run to the 2. The drive
was completed when Bledsoe flared a pass to Coates in the far
corner of the end zone, giving the Patriots a 7-0 lead with 6:39
remaining in the first.
</P>
<P>
   According to Patriots tight end coach Carl Smith, the Colts were
in zone coverage against Coates in the first half, man-to-man in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they covered me like they did,'' said Coates,
who ate up free safety Jason Belser. ``Sometimes they had two,
sometimes they had one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts didn't waste any time tying it. The coverage was
terrible, and poor tackling by Chris Canty sprung Jerome Pathon for
an 18-yard gain to the Patriots' 34. Marvin Harrison and Faulk were
wide open for catches of 10 and 11 yards, but not as alone as
Lamont Warren was on a 4-yard pass from Manning that tied the
score.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as the Patriots had trouble finding the end zone
against Miami the week before, they quickly found it again to
recapture the lead, 14-7, with 10:54 remaining in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This time the drive went 81 yards and it featured the passing
game again. Starting at his 19, Bledsoe went over the middle to
Simmons for 24 yards, and later found him on a slant for 12 yards
to the Indy 12. Bledsoe also got the veteran Ellard, who was signed
last week, in on the act, hitting him on a 15-yard pass over the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots again were aided by an interference call on Burris,
who held Simmons in the back of the end zone on a pass from the
Indy 12. With the ball placed at the 1, Edwards scored on his third
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots gave the Colts the ball back with 46 seconds left
in the half, enough time for them to set up Mike Vanderjagt's
49-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tackling was our downfall today,'' said Carroll. ``They had a
lot of small passes and large runs after the catch.''
</P>
<P>
   But while deficiencies were aplenty, the good things won out.
And now the Patriots are back to familiar territory, with the same
record they had last year at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the steppingstone game,'' said Jefferson. ``We
needed this one to move on from here.''

MISTAKE COSTS TRACY $987,500 &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ A million-dollar prize might have taken some
of the sting out of Paul Tracy's suspension from next year's
season-opening CART race in Miami. And Tracy was poised to earn
that big payday Sunday at the California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   But leading the $1 million Marlboro 500 with four laps to go,
Tracy tried to get a little too much speed a little too fast on a
restart and wound up spinning his car into an infield fence. And
while Jimmy Vasser fought off Greg Moore and teammate Alex Zanardi
to win the race and the big bucks, Tracy had to settle for 14th
place and $12,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my standpoint, I dropped the ball,'' Tracy said. ``I just
tried to do the restart the way I'd done the previous one and get a
good jump, and it just drove around on me. It was my mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The points: Vasser's victory and Dario Franchitti's exit with
engine trouble enabled Vasser to move past Franchitti into second
place in the season-points race, won by Zanardi. Adrian Fernandez
was fourth and Moore fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia product Bryan Herta finished eighth. Glendale's Richie
Hearn was 16th.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tough day: Herta seemed to have the speed to run with the
leaders, but because of an unscheduled pit stop, he was forced to
run a lap down most of the day. He finished 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a flat tire running through (wreck debris),'' Herta
said. ``And it cost us a lap. I think we had a car to race with the
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Herta went out of the race with 10 laps left when he collided
with future Team Rahal teammate Max Papis on the front
straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not sure what happened,'' Herta said. ``I think Max
was on the outside of me and we touched. If that's what happened,
then I guess it was my fault and I feel bad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Running in front: Hearn ran up front several times Sunday,
leading seven laps.
</P>
<P>
   A spin coming out of the pits late in the race didn't do any
damage to Hearn's car but cost him some places. He wound up eighth.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mr. Tenacity: When he crashed in qualifying Saturday and was
forced to begin Sunday's race at the back of the field, Adrian
Fernandez said it was no big deal. He had, after all, 500 miles to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Catch up he did.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez finished the race in fourth place and spent the latter
half of the race running with the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept working on the car, trying to find the right
balance,'' Fernandez said. ``Finally, toward the end of the race,
it was handling pretty good. I had to tell myself to slow down and
be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Etc.: Sunday's race was not a sellout, with the crowd
estimated at 105,000. Track officials guessed that about 160,000
attended the three-day event. . . . CART has reached an agreement
with Neil Russell Productions to make an hourlong action-adventure
television series set on the CART tour. Fall 1999 is the target
date to air the syndicated program. . . . The Lola chassis, which
fell into disrepute in recent seasons, will be run by up to four
teams in 1999, company owner Martin Birrane said Sunday. Only one
team used the Lola this year. . . . NFL great Walter Payton and his
partner Dale Coyne announced a long-term sponsorship deal has been
reached with Mexico's Herdez food company. Payton-Coyne driver
Michel Joudain of Mexico finished 12th in Sunday's race.

ELLARD WASTES NO TIME GETTING UP TO SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The postcareer athlete _ Lawrence Taylor excepted
_ soon learns that he must draw the curtain on the old life if he
is to be any kind of success in his new one.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ellard had that curtain 90 percent drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just in the process of making the transition,'' he says.
``I had put in 15 years. I had no regrets. It was nice. It was time
to move on. If it (playing one more season) wasn't meant to be, it
wasn't meant to be. I was just getting into that mode.''
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about less than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the week this gentle man was in Orange,
Calif., coaching a 14-man high school team called Southern
California Christian. Sunday he was on the RCA Dome turf catching
three of Drew Bledsoe's passes, good for 52 yards. He was in a
winning locker room. He was once again a professional football
player. For the time being, the real world can wait.
</P>
<P>
   Catches of 15, 18, and 19 yards in an NFL game constitute a
reasonably good afternoon's work for any wide receiver. Catches of
15, 18, and 19 yards constitute a phenomenally successful
afternoon's work for someone who had practiced a mere three times
with his new team, and who was playing in his first football game
of any kind since last December. But that's why offensive
coordinator Ernie Zampese recommended the Patriots investigate
Ellard, wasn't it? Ernie Z had worked with this man in Los Angeles
and knew that if any unemployed wide receiver in the universe could
be counted on to step in and perform professionally in this
particular circumstance, it was 37-year-old Henry Ellard, a
veritable Yoda of wideouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ellard is still taking it all in. One day he is on the practice
field with his outgunned football squad when his wife, Lillian, is
having him paged. His agent, Frank Bauer, is looking for him.
Something about the Patriots needing a man to catch some passes. A
few days later he is suited up, wearing No. 17, catching real, live
passes from Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Life does have its funny little twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just about ready to tell my agent that I was through,
that it was time to move onto something else,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   And just think if you're Bledsoe. One day you're fretting about
not having Terry Glenn, Vincent Brisby, and Troy Brown. And then
they come up with a new guy who can make it look as if the two of
you had spent the entire summer throwing footballs to each other on
the beach, kinda like Rockne and Dorais.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact that he can come in and play in a game after a
couple of practices is amazing,'' says Bledsoe. ``It didn't take
long to feel comfortable with him. One play in particular shows
what being a veteran can mean. His first catch was a comeback
route. You couldn't ask for a better route. I can tell you right
now I would be comfortable doing that with him against anybody in
the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Another simple fact is that only a veteran could walk in and
function in the Zampese offense, which features timing routes.
``Obviously, I'm not there yet,'' Ellard says. ``This is an offense
where you run to a spot and you turn around and the ball is there.
It will take awhile to get it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the cerebral aspect of all this for a minute.
Consider that Ellard hadn't been playing football at all. When the
Redskins elected to do without his services following the 1997
season, that was it. The man went home. There were no look-sees
anywhere. If the phone were to ring, he would be happy to answer
it. But he wasn't going to beg, not after 15 years of admirable NFL
service. And the phone wasn't ringing, not until the New England
Patriots got _ there is only one way to put it _ desperate.
</P>
<P>
   The only frame of reference for both his body and his mind had
come a long time ago _ 12 years, to be exact. ``I held out in LA in
'86,'' he explains. ``It lasted through September and into early
October. That was the longest I had gone without playing
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitions? Who needs exhibitions? Two-a-days? Who needs
two-a-days? Did Henry Ellard just prove some kind of a point, or is
he a Jerry Rice-like freak of nature, as some maintain?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, what he did Sunday to help his new team was quietly
spectacular, and very much appreciated. ``What he and (rookie) Tony
Simmons are doing is helping us buy time until we get those other
guys back,'' observes offensive lineman Bruce Armstrong. ``This was
a must game for us. Of course, nobody wants to say that before the
fact. But we had to have this game. Now we have more control of our
own destiny. We've got both Buffalo games ahead of us, and next
time we'll have Miami at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellard isn't heading to the Pro Bowl. Right now all he's asking
for is to make it to the end of the season. He knows that as well
as he did Sunday, he can do better. He did, after all, drop one or
two, and he was outwrestled for a ball that turned out to be a
Robert Blackmon interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rusty, no doubt,'' he acknowledged. ``My hands were OK,
but they'll get better. The big thing will be to get my old rhythm,
but it was fun being out there, competing again.''
</P>
<P>
   He was an immediate resource for a young'un such as Simmons, but
it doesn't stop there. ``(Strength coach) Johnny Parker gave us
some advice,'' reports eight-year vet Shawn Jefferson, occasionally
thought of as something of a sage himself, but a mere pup when
compared to Ellard. ``He said all the wide receivers should watch
Henry Ellard, and if he sneezes, we should all say, `Achoo!'''
</P>
<P>
   Achoo, gesundheit, whatever. Watching Henry Ellard catch the
ball Sunday meant one obvious thing: first down, New England.

FLUTIE LEADS BILLS BACK AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ The night before, Thurman Thomas spoke to
the team, its younger players in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game you have waited to play your whole lives,'' he
told his Buffalo Bills teammates. ``It is a privilege to play in a
game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the veteran of the four-time Super Bowl Bills, was right
on the money.
</P>
<P>
   In a classic shootout Sunday between two storied quarterbacks,
the Bills came from behind on the wings of some more Doug Flutie
magic to beat Dan Marino and the first-place Miami Dolphins, 30-24,
at a deafening Rich Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 79,011 was so loud that it bothered both teams,
something that usually doesn't happen in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But it had been a few years since the once-proud Bills had
played in a home game that created such excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie vs. Marino. It doesn't get much better than that, and
neither disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie prevailed, with three touchdown passes to one for Marino.
Both players were the main men in a game that figured to be
low-scoring but suddenly erupted into a fast-break frenzy that
would have made Rick Pitino proud.
</P>
<P>
   In the second week of the season, the Dolphins had squeaked past
Buffalo, 13-7, in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   What was the difference between this game and the first one,
Miami's tough middle linebacker, Zach Thomas, was asked.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was simple. ``Him,'' said Thomas, referring to
Flutie. ``He made all the plays. In the end, he just wore us
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 14 at the half. Flutie threw touchdown
passes of 1 and 16 yards to tight end Jay Riemersma. Marino
connected on a 12-yard scoring pass to Orande Gadsden and set up a
1-yard scoring run by Karim Abdul-Jabbar with a 27-yard pass to
Gadsden.
</P>
<P>
   Miami seemed to put the game away early in the third period,
running off 10 straight points to go up, 24-14. Considering that
the Dolphins' No. 1-rated defense hadn't give up a touchdown in
nine periods entering the game, it looked to be over.
</P>
<P>
   But Flutie did what Flutie does. He made plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to make plays. He gets the job done,'' said a
battered and dejected Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets the crowd going,'' said Bills all-world defensive end
Bruce Smith. ``See the crowd today? They're going crazy. He makes
that happen. And then he is so creative. When he starts to
improvise, things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by those 10 points with 14 minutes to play, Flutie
said, ``We needed a spark. We had to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Four plays later, he did, firing a 48-yard rifle shot down the
left sideline to Eric Moulds between defenders for a touchdown,
cutting the Miami lead to 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had a one-on-one situation with Moulds,'' said
Flutie. ``And he beat his man quick, so I got the ball out there to
him. I didn't see the safety come across until the last minute. But
the ball got there before him. It looked close (to an
interception), but our bench said it wasn't that close.''
</P>
<P>
   The second Buffalo break came within two minutes. Marino had
solid pass protection most of the day, but Bills nose tackle Ted
Washington broke loose up the middle, hit Marino, and forced a
fumble. The ball was recovered by the Bills at the Miami 13. The
Bills got it to the 1, but opted for the tying field goal on fourth
down.
</P>
<P>
   Tie game. Less than 10 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough place to play, with all of the noise,'' said
Marino. ``When they came back on us like that, they knew we had to
pass. And that made it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino couldn't get it done. Advantage Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd bothered us, too,'' said Flutie. ``The noise was so
loud our offensive line had a hard time hearing the count.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie overcame what he had to. He passed to Andre Reed for 12
yards and Sam Gash for 14, setting up a go-ahead 36-yard field goal
by Steve Christie with 1:58 left. With 1:23 to play, and fourth
down at their 12, the Dolphins went for it and failed. Miami's
offense, which had been cooking for three periods, had minus-1 yard
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Flutie and Buffalo gained 138 of their 313 net yards
in the final period. They tacked on a 25-yard field goal with 23
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flutie was the difference,'' said Miami's Zach Thomas. ``He is
just so smart. If we made a mistake, he took advantage of it. He
knew where to go with the football. If there was a weakness in what
we were doing on a certain play, he found it. I didn't think anyone
could move the ball on us the way they did at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug is special,'' said Gash, the former Patriot turned Bill.
``All the guys believe in him and realize how lucky we are to have
two good quarterbacks. He just goes up and makes plays. In the
huddle, he is in control. Nothing seems to bother him. All the guys
know that if we give him the chance, he will make the plays.''

KAGWE BEATS CHEBET TO WIRE 
</HEADLINE>
 MARATHON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph Chebet, one of the growing stable of Kenyan
distance runners on the international stage, has been at the center
of two enthralling races this year on the East Coast. He battled
Moses Tanui to the finish in the 102d Boston Marathon and raced
defender John Kagwe to the wire in Sunday's New York City Marathon
in Central Park. On each occasion, Chebet was beaten by a scant
three seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the second straight year he was runner-up to Kagwe
in this race, but the margin was quite a bit larger a year ago.
Boston was all but decided when countryman Tanui turned it on with
200 meters to go, but Sunday's race saw Chebet seize the lead in
the final stretch before Kagwe had to shift gears with 100 meters
remaining to win in 2 hours 8 minutes 45 seconds. Kagwe (2:08:48)
and Tanzanian Zebedayo Bayo (2:08:51) made it a breathtaking final
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Franca Fiacconi became the first Italian to win the women's race
when she turned it on with 6 miles to go to win in a personal best
and Italian record of 2:25:17, beating Adriana Fernandez (2:26:33)
of Mexico and Tegla Loroupe (2:30:26) of Kenya, who set a world
record of 2:20:47 in Rotterdam in April. Joan Benoit Samuelson of
Freeport, Maine, who made an 11th-hour decision to run, was the
second American woman to finish (in 2:41:06), enabling her to
qualify for the US Olympic trials at the age of 41.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second-closest men's finish since the race's
inception in 1970, when it was run entirely within Central Park
before becoming an international race run through the city's five
boroughs. German Silva (fourth, 2:10:24) regrouped after making a
wrong turn in 1994 and ran down countryman Benjamin Paredes to win
by two seconds, and Alberto Salazar was the last American to win as
he edged Rodolfo Gomez by four seconds in 1982 in what is now the
third-closest finish.
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe did much of the work as the lead men's pack passed the
halfway mark in 1:04:19. He then made a decision to drop back. ``I
was giving up my energy for them,'' he said. ``I was doing the work
for them, so I got behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they reached Fifth Avenue, just before turning into Central
Park for the first time with a little more than 2 miles to go,
Kagwe, Chebet, and Bayo pulled away, with Silva the last to go.
``They broke away,'' he said. ``They moved together. They held
together.'' They ran virtually three abreast out of the park and
westbound before reentering the park and heading to the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   Bayo, who was a presence from the starting line until the final
kilometer, fell back a few strides when Chebet made his surge to
take the lead. Kagwe responded and became the first to defend since
Silva in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bayo) wasn't aware of where the finish line was,'' Kagwe said
through an interpreter. Bayo, who is just 22, refused to give up
and just lacked the finishing kick to make up his lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed in my training,'' said Kagwe. ``I've done a lot of
speed (work) and I knew I was strong. So when (Chebet) passed me, I
didn't get disturbed because I knew I could catch up with him. I
knew I could not let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was another heartbreaking loss for Chebet. ``I was trying
to win,'' he said. ``I was trying to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiacconi, who had run a marathon three weeks before she finished
second in this race a year ago to Switzerland's Franziska
Rochat-Moser, had it pretty much locked up as she passed through 22
miles and opened it up to the finish in the race's second-fastest
time to Lisa Ondiecki's 2:24:40 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see a clock,'' Fiacconi said through an interpreter.
``I didn't control the pace. I knew at 30 kilometers it was my
race.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson, who phoned husband Scott Saturday night about 10:30
to let him know she was going to run, finished second among US
women to recent Tufts 10K winner Libby Hickman, who finished sixth
overall in 2:33:06. Samuelson, who won the inaugural women's
Olympic marathon in Los Angeles in 1984, now will try to make the
US team for the Sydney Games of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had planned to run Twin Cities in early October, but soccer
rules in our family,'' said the mother of two. ``By default I ended
up here in New York.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A controversy broke out involving top wheelchair
athletes at the New York City Marathon Sunday when all but the
first two of the wheelchair racers, who started 10 minutes in front
of everyone else, were stopped by police at the 15-mile mark for up
to 35 minutes to allow the lead packs of men and women _ and the 30
trucks, motorcycles and police vehicles accompanying them _ to
cross the Queensboro Bridge first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slap in the face, an insult,'' said Tom Gorman of
Littlestown, Pa., one of the wheelchair racers. ``The last thing I
want to do is complain, but we were so far ahead of the runners
there was no need to stop us.'' Gorman, 42, was competing in his
third New York marathon ``and probably my last.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Steinfeld, president of the New York Road Runners Club,
said the halt was a safety measure because this year there is no
longer an outer roadway on the bridge for the wheelchairs and
others to use. In the past, he said, both the outer roadway and the
lower roadway were used.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Road Runners statement noted that New York City
Marathon's policy was to stop wheelchairs ``to let elite runners
through, because this race does not have an official wheelchair
division.'' But Steinfeld emphasized that vehicles, not people,
were the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The runners can run single-file,'' he said, but the news media
and police vehicles take up a lot of room.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Traum, president of the Achilles Track Club, the
international organization devoted to marathoners with
disabilities, said he was aware of the plan to halt the
wheelchairs. But apparently word never reached the racers.
</P>
<P>
   Traum, who is a board member of both clubs, said he thought the
Achilles and Road Runners clubs needed to talk about the matter.
``Elite wheelchair racers running with runners on foot is
dangerous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On sharp turns such as the one at the Manhattan end of the
Queensboro Bridge, wheelchairs could conceivably knock down elite
runners. On the other hand, elite wheelchair racers have criticized
the Road Runners Club in the past for treating them as second-class
entrants. Traum acknowledged that the two clubs have had a
contentious relationship.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the 1995 marathon, high winds blew away plywood that had
been laid on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to make the bridge
surface smoother for the wheelchairs, forcing the race organizers
to bus the wheelchair racers to the Brooklyn side of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 wheelchair athletes entered Sunday's event. Because
the fastest wheelchair racers can barrel downhill on the course at
speeds of up to 60 miles per hour, some usually finish the race
with times better than the official winner of the foot race.
Gorman, for example, said that after subtracting his 35-minute,
police-enforced wait, his finishing time was 2 hours 2 minutes.
John Kagwe, the men's winner, finished the race in 2:08:45.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Jackson of Washington, D.C., another wheelchair racer
forced to halt as he approached the Queensboro Bridge, said the
elite foot runners were not yet in sight when the wheelchairs were
ordered to stop. Jackson, 41 years old, who works for the
Department of Justice, called it ``one of the worst cases of
discrimination I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinfeld responded to the wheelchair racers' complaints by
saying, ``Communications is always a problem.''

SKATING WORLD IS JUMPING 
</HEADLINE>
 AMERICA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Elvis Stojko didn't have to do the quad here. Not in
October. Not in his first competition since the Olympics. Not with
a finicky groin. But he did. ``You're eventually going to have to
do it,'' he figured.
</P>
<P>
   A new quadrennium may have just begun, but figure skating
already has upped the ante. The International Skating Union has
said that the men may do a quadruple jump instead of a triple jump
in the short program. But the skaters understand that ``may'' soon
will mean ``must''. It will not be an option, but an obligation.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the competitive ante stayed the same. Nobody did a
triple jump until Dick Button in 1952. It was another 36 years
before Kurt Browning did the first quad. ``Now, everybody is trying
to make quads,'' said Alexei Yagudin, the Russian world champ,
after he'd outskated a brutal field at Skate America on Saturday.
``The next Olympics, the winner will make all triples and two
quads.''
</P>
<P>
   Yagudin, who landed nine triples (one more than allowed) to beat
Michael Weiss, Alexei Urmanov, and Stojko here, didn't try a quad
but he will at the European championships because he knows his top
rivals will.
</P>
<P>
   The ``optional'' quad was one of a bundle of rules changes that
took effect at Skate America, the opener of the Grand Prix season.
Pairs now must perform a throw jump in the short program, which
made for a number of unsightly sprawls here last week. And the free
dance now requires certain lifts, spins, ``twizzle'' turns, and
step sequences with specific markdowns. Just like real figure
skating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very good that we are changing,'' said France's Gwendal
Peizerat, who won the dance with partner Marina Anissina. ``We
could have gone 20 years with no changes and waited for the sport
to die. This will make it more objective in the judgment and more
interesting to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   It also will raise the stakes for the dancers, too many of whom
seem to confuse their event with a Vegas floor show. Thus is
skating evolving, and those who want to make it to Olympus in 2002
are brushing up on their Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young skaters, younger than me, are going to have the quad
this season,'' said Yagudin, who at 18 is the youngest world
titleist in 35 years. ``They will change the level. Everyone will
try one quad in the short program to have two quads in the long
program.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't do the quad, you won't ever be a contender again.
That's the sobering reality for Nagano gold medalist Ilya Kulik and
former world champ Todd Eldredge, who both are sitting out the
Olympic-eligible season in what ISU president Ottavio Cinquanta
calls ``active rest''. If and when they return, they may find the
bar is beyond their leap.
</P>
<P>
   And aging ladies like Elena Butyrskaya and Nicole Bobek, who
looked woefully unprepared here last weekend, may find themselves
gobbled up by middle-schoolers they've never heard of before they
ever get to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, my skating was not at my best,'' conceded the
26-year-old Butyrskaya, who won the women's title despite falling
on her face and her bottom and landing only three clean triples.
</P>
<P>
   There are juniors who routinely nail half a dozen triples now
and fool around with the quad for fun. Three triples these days get
you an understudy's job for Nutcracker on Ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to compete at a high level,'' said Canada's
Kris Wirtz, who won the pairs silver here with Kristy Sargeant,
``you need to have all the goods all the time.''

WIN WELL-RECEIVED FOR PATRIOTS

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; INDIANAPOLIS _ Saturday night Bruce Armstrong and Ben Coates
were holding their weekly NFL Film Festival in a hotel room at the
Omni when they saw the defense of the Indianapolis Colts allow some
unknown tight end to run wide open down the seam for a long
completion. Coates watched this act in disgust, mumbling as his
counterpart ran free on film how defenses don't give him those
opportunities anymore.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Armstrong had a counterpoint that 16 hours later would
make him appear to be the NFL's Nostradamus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reminded Ben he had some of his biggest games against the
Colts,'' Armstrong said a half-hour after Coates had another one of
them Sunday in the Patriots' 21-16 victory at the RCA Dome. ``They
just refuse to cover him. I told him that (Saturday) night, and he
finally said, `Yeah. Maybe they'll leave me open.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which they did, at least in the language of those who know Ben
Coates best.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's single-covered, he's open,'' Patriots quarterback Drew
Bledsoe remarked after throwing 10 of his 22 completions to Coates
for 109 yards and a touchdown. It was Coates's fourth double-digit
reception game and ninth 100-plus-yard game of his career. Nearly
half of those games have come against a stubborn Colts defense that
refuses to accept the simple fact that to challenge the four-time
Pro Bowl tight end with single coverage is to ensure great damage
to yourself before the day is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't double-team me, I'm open,'' Coates said, smiling
between bites of a hot dog. ``I'm like a hungry child. You start
feeding me and I want to keep on eating.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Coates had a 10-course meal of prime horse meat. At
various times he devoured free safety Jason Belser, cornerbacks
Jeff Burris and Monty Montgomery, outside linebackers Andre Royal
and Anthony Jordan, middle linebacker Michael Barber, and strong
safety Robert Blackmon. This continued until Coates and Bledsoe
engaged in a game of pitch-and-catch so embarassingly obvious that
even the Colts finally had to concede that reinforcements would be
necessary to keep New England's massive tight end in check.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Colts finally got around to that, Coates caught
six passes in one third-quarter drive in which he covered a total
of 68 yards worth of RCA Dome real estate before a Bledsoe pass
intended for Henry Ellard was intercepted by Blackmon at the Colts'
5. Thereafter, the Colts got the message, which meant Coates got
additional attention and no more receptions, but by that point he
had made clear once again why he has made those four straight
all-expenses-paid trips to Honolulu the first week of February for
the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best,'' Bledsoe said. ``Until somebody else comes
along or his skills diminish significantly, Ben's the best. I was
surprised when they continued singling him up, because then it's
just like playing catch. I thought they'd do more to try and take
him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some people who want to think Ben has slipped
because his numbers are down (from the years when he caught a
record 96 and then 84 passes at a time when New England's offense
had Coates, Bledsoe, and the punter). That's wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he lost a step? Maybe he has, but he could lose a step or
two and he's still the best. What he does is not just based on his
being faster than his man or bigger than his man. It's based on
knowing how to get open. As his skills diminish, he'll still be
effective because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Coates's skills were on full display as he repeatedly
worked his way free against any player the Colts put on him. Early
in the first quarter, for example, he shook loose in the back of
the end zone to catch a 2-yard scoring pass behind the defense.
</P>
<P>
   That was not something terribly easy to do considering that the
play had started at the 2-yard line but in a span of 10 yards he
had done it, making the score 7-0. New England never trailed
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of catch Coates had failed to make a week
earlier against Miami, a catch that could have beaten the Dolphins.
Coates thought about that one pass that slipped off his fingertips
all week and then did something about it first chance he got this
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all our injuries, somebody had to step up and make some
plays,'' Coates said. ``I took it upon myself to do that. I'm the
oldest veteran receiver we have, so I had to do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what the Colts would do about covering me, but
every time it seemed I was the primary receiver I seemed to be
singled, so Drew threw it to me. I hoped to hell he would. When a
guy is going to you every down, you want the ball. I want it in
these kind of situations. I thrive on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Colts died on that. Because of their stubbornness
and Coates's skills, New England's tight end accounted for more
than a third of Bledsoe's 306 passing yards and provided the safety
net his team seemed to need to win a game that turned out to be far
more of a struggle than it should have been.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game the Patriots had to win just to keep themselves
out of dire straits in the AFC East. They are now bunched up with
Buffalo, Miami, and the Jets in the kind of cluster that resembles
the coverages Coates sees more often, but at least they had
retained reasonable control of their own destiny because one game
with Miami and New York remain, as do two with Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   When those games come, Ben Coates can rest assured of one thing:
He will not again be allowed to run free up the seam of a defense
hardheadedly insisting on covering him one-on-one very often.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get those deep seam routes against Cover-2 zones
very often anymore because the linebackers are playing with more
depth now and defenses are more aware of him in the middle,''
Bledsoe explained. ``If they'd forgotten about what happens if they
aren't, I guess he reminded them today.''

SIMMONS CATCHING ON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Now no one may be left from the Patriots' feared
receiving corps of a month ago, as the last and noblest of them
all, Shawn Jefferson, sat by his locker after Sunday's win over the
Colts and tried to speak without pain. But his ribs were very sore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jefferson's eyes lit up and the words kept coming out as
the veteran spoke of rookie Tony Simmons, who just may have had a
breakthrough game against Indianapolis. Simmons caught four passes
for 109 yards, including a 63-yarder for what turned out to be the
deciding touchdown a minute into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means our receiving corps has taken a big step forward,''
said Jefferson of the depleted crew that has lost Terry Glenn, Troy
Brown, and Vincent Brisby in the last three weeks. ``I kind of knew
that Tony would be all right after that last game in Miami when he
caught that big pass. I went up to Tony before this one and I told
him, `Just concentrate on the ball.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard. Simmons was hyper and excited to be starting,
especially since he was playing only three hours from his home in
Chicago and his brother Lawson had tooled down Interstate 65 from
Chicago City to the RCA Dome. ``Tony was so excited before the
game,'' said Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Simmons was excited, Jefferson went on, ``You could
tell from his demeanor he was going to play well. He wasn't making
any mistakes in practice all week and he was poised during the
game. And then he caught a big touchdown for us when we really
needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the touchdown, the first of Simmons's career. He scooted
past defensive back Jeff Burris, even though it seemed Simmons
wasn't running that fast. ``Oh, I don't know what gear I was in,''
said Simmons. ``Once I'm in front of a guy, I just try to stay in
front of him. I just run to make sure I stay in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Which Simmons did, even though Burris was called for
interference on the play, and the rookie hauled in the pass from
Drew Bledsoe, completing the 63-yard play. ``Tony has the speed and
can run with the best of them,'' said Bledsoe. ``But he also has
strong hands and is an excellent talent.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago in Miami, Simmons had learned that pro football ``is
a very fast game,'' but his first pro appearance also made him
realize ``there's nothing to be scared of. If they hit you, they
hit you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simmons was too fast to be hit on the TD pass, and once he
crossed the goal line he made sure to keep a firm grasp on the
ball. ``I don't spike the ball. I never spike the ball,'' he said.
``I still got this little thing from college _ I just do my little
high-knee action _ and that's it, it's all over. Then I always go
back to the team, because I wouldn't have got them without them
blocking and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons sat by his locker, his eyes still bright enough to light
the entire RCA Dome by themselves. If he was hyper before the game,
he was even more hyper as he recalled every detail of the TD and
four catches for 109 yards, not to mention drawing another
interference call on Burris that set up the Patriots with a
first-and-goal in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe tried a fade to Simmons on a second-and-8 from the
Colts' 24, but ``Burris made a good play on me,'' recalled the
rookie. ``He jumped for the ball and I tried to tap the ball up
higher, back to myself, so I could re-catch it. He was trying to
catch it, and I was trying to make sure he didn't catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   If it seemed that Simmons might have been able to catch that
fade for a TD, it made no difference as Bledsoe came back to
Simmons on the next play, hitting the rookie for a 12-yard gain on
a slant pass. ``That made me feel good,'' said Simmons, ``that Drew
had confidence in me to come right back to me. He knows that I can
make plays. I know I can make plays.'' Then came the play Burris
was penalized on.
</P>
<P>
   Speed and size are his assets, said Simmons, ``because I know I
can catch the ball. I wouldn't have made it to the NFL if I
couldn't catch the ball. I'm 6-1 and 205 pounds and most receivers
are under 6 feet, but I know I can catch the ball. What I'm most
concerned about is my route-running, because I know I can catch the
ball. And now that we have Henry Ellard, I can pick his brain about
running routes.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie also credited Patriots defensive back Ty Law for a
chunk of his development as a receiver. He and Law face each other
in practice, ``and Ty has taught me a lot,'' said Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Tony, we battle every day,'' said Law. ``I try to help
him as much as I can. If he wants to give me credit (for his
development), fine, but if not, I just want him to keep on doing
what he's doing.''

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The countdown is T-minus 126 minutes, 12
seconds and counting for the Kings' offense _ which wants to blast
off, but has been in a season-long holding pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were shut out for the third time in four games on
Sunday evening when the Phoenix Coyotes defeated them 3-0 before
l2,073 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lacking confidence,'' said winger Craig Johnson, one of
several Kings to have good chances turned aside by Phoenix goalie
Nikolai Khabibulin. ``We have to get some ugly goals. With ugly
goals comes confidence and with confidence comes more goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings outshot Phoenix 31-28 for the game and 13-4 in the
final period. Rob Blake had nine shots and Luc Robitaille had six,
but none went in and Los Angeles fell to 4-5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille said the team, which has scored three or more goals
only three times this season, is not discouraged but is
disappointed in its performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've maybe played two or three really good games since the
beginning of the year,'' said Robitaille. ``We have to show
desperation like we showed in the third period tonight. That's the
only way to win in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles beat New Jersey 4-0 last Wednesday in the final game
of a five-game road trip, but Blake admitted that game might have
been misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a couple of breaks in New Jersey,'' he said. ``We
played well in Carolina, but we haven't been too offensive-minded
this year. You can't be afraid to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Kings were busy missing the net or firing shots into
Khabibulin's midsection, the Coyotes made just enough plays to
improve to 5-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   They got a goal from Jyrki Lumme early in the first, one from
former King Rick Tocchet early in the second and another from
Jeremy Roenick early in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times we looked a little tentative,'' said Kings coach
Larry Robinson. ``But you have to remember that's a damn good club
over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Kings managed their first shot on goal _ 5 1/2
minutes into the the first period _ the Coyotes had already taken a
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had knocked the puck off Keith Tkachuk's stick, but
failed to clear. Lumme got a shot from the left circle that Kings
goalie Manny Legace stopped, but the Phoenix defenseman skated
behind the net and fired home the rebound from a steep angle 3:49
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Legace, who came into the game with a 1.19 goals-against average
and a brilliant save percentage of .965, played another solid game.
He was beaten over the right shoulder on Tocchet's shot at 1:29 of
the second, and Roenick scored on a rebound at 2:07 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy I feel disappointed for is Manny Legace,'' said
Johnson of the rookie goalie, who has only one win despite allowing
only nine goals in seven games since groin injuries sidelined Jamie
Storr and Stephane Fiset . ``He has played unbelievable and I feel
like we've let him down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' power play was shutout once again, going 0-of-6
despite generating more pressure than they have in recent games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We crowded the net, went for rebounds, we were hitting skates,
sticks, but the puck went the wrong way,'' said Robitaille of a Los
Angeles power play that has generated just four goals all season.

CLAY, PATRIOT MATES MOLDING DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ On one pass in the first half, when Patriots
cornerback Ty Law gave Colts receiver Marvin Harrison a 7-yard
cushion and he caught an easy pass from Peyton Manning, one Patriot
did not take it quietly. He was in Law's face, giving Law a piece
of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Another time in that first quarter, when Indianapolis running
back Lamont Warren escaped Patriots linebackers, especially Ted
Johnson, and caught a 4-yard TD pass, one Patriot most definitely
did not take it quietly. He was in the face of the linebackers,
giving them a piece of his mind both on the field and later on the
sideline for a blown coverage.
</P>
<P>
   That Patriot was Willie Clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little hot,'' Clay acknowledged. ``That's because we
weren't playing the way we're capable of playing. That bothered me.
It always bothers you. That's just the way it was early. We just
weren't playing the way we're capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if New England's other safety, Lawyer Milloy,
intercepted two of Manning's passes, not to mention led the team
with 10 tackles, Clay was the soul of a defense that was hard and
soft, stingy and giving, tough and porous, all in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy would not talk to the media after Sunday's win over the
Colts (``Go talk to the other guys''), even though he did talk to
the media after a poor, for him, performance last week in Miami.
Milloy played much better Sunday and made the two crucial
interceptions late in the fourth quarter when the Colts were
threatening to steal a game the Patriots should have ended some 10
minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up doing a pretty good job,'' said Clay, ``even
though at the end they started pricking us a little. But it was a
win, and we needed a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, though, Manning looked twice _ or maybe 10 times _ as
good as the frightened rookie quarterback who had been so lost when
the Patriots beat the Colts in Foxborough in September. Manning had
presence in that first half, he had poise, and he also had some
cooperation from a far-from-robust Patriot defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clay, though, was determined not to let the New England defense
soft-shoe into oblivion in that first half. He got into Law's face
when Harrison had wide separation and an easy catch, said Clay,
``because you got to try and get into people's heads. I was trying
to make like a coach on the field a little bit, maybe trying to do
what a coach would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, on Warren's TD catch, Clay was upset ``at the coverage
underneath by the 'backers; that's because we made those guys
(Manning and Warren) look even better than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the defense once again did what it usually
does against Marshall Faulk _ hold him to few yards on the ground.
Faulk picked up 22 yards on 11 carries, and the Colts could gain
only 32 yards on 14 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, though, did catch nine passes for 119 yards, slipping out
of the backfield as the defense had trouble tackling. On more than
a few plays, for instance, Indianapolis receivers would catch short
passes that should have gone for gains of only 4 or 5 yards, but
the receivers would stop on a dime, the defenders would go flying
past, and the 5-yard gain would turn into a 15-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tackling was our downfall,'' said coach Pete Carroll. ``They
had a lot of small passes and large runs after the catch. Credit a
lot of that to single coverage, but we did miss some tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Patriots have completed their usual and dismal
Death March through October, a win to open November ``was big, very
big for us,'' said Clay. ``We needed this; now we have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, the defense is looking to recapture that
chemistry and attitude that propelled it to such a stout
performance last November and December. It has been lacking so far
_ the attitude that nobody can score on it _ but there is one
Patriot who will be sure to speak his mind when he sees any slack:
Willie Clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to stop other teams in this league,'' said Clay.
``But we got a good defense here. People sometimes talk about our
defense, but we have a really good defense. We got a lot of younger
guys playing, and those guys are doing a lot of good things, but
it's tough to come out and stop other teams completely. (Sunday) we
made plays when we had to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Clay, ``That's what won the game. That's what we got
to do all the time.''

BODGER OUT WITH BROKEN HAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings' injury woes continued
Sunday when veteran defenseman Doug Bodger suffered a fractured
left hand before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to know how it happened,'' Kings coach Larry
Robinson said. ``He stepped on a puck in warmups and fell
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodger played two shifts in the first period, but missed the
rest of the game and is expected to be out 4-6 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are already missing goalies Stephane Fiset (left groin
strain) and Jamie Storr (right groin strain), center Jozef Stumpel
(hip flexor, abdominal strain) and Ian Laperriere (partial torn ACL
in his left knee).
</P>
<P>
   __ No surgery required: Laperriere, who is getting close to
returning, said he decided against season-ending surgery because
``I have no pain and I feel strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for his reckless style of play, Laperriere said he won't
change upon his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I play I won't think about that (getting hurt again), he
said. ``If I do I'll get hurt for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might as well give it a try, if I hurt my knee again, see
you next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel said he is getting better and hopes to start skating
later this week. But the Kings' leading scorer last year said he's
probably ``a couple weeks away (from playing).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Playing time: After being scratched in eight of the season's
first 10 games, defenseman Gary Galley was in the lineup Sunday and
played nearly 22 minutes since the Kings had only five defensemen
after Bodger was forced to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Galley replaced Philippe Boucher, who was scratched for the
first time this season. Sandy Moger was the Kings' other healthy
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   __ Where have they gone?: Glenn Murray, Vladimir Tsyplakov and
Craig Johnson all continue to struggle after having career seasons
a year ago. The three players, who combined for 64 goals and 150
points in 1997-98, have combined for four goals and five points
this season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Steve Duchesne has just one goal in 11 games after
finishing fourth in scoring among NHL defensemen (56 points) last
season with the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   __ Still going: The Kings' penalty killing continues to sparkle.
Los Angeles, ranked No. 1 in the NHL, killed off four more
penalties to extend its streak to 43. The team has given up only
one power play goal this season.

 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Boston College's football season has been reduced to one
objective: Win November. After a 3-0 start in September, the Eagles
went 0-for-October for the second year in a row and now have three
games in which to redeem themselves, beginning with Saturday's home
finale against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   But, following BC's fifth consecutive loss of the season, 35-17
against the 25th-ranked Miami Hurricanes at the Orange Bowl
Saturday night, no one in the BC locker room seemed too eager to
face the Fighting Irish.
</P>
<P>
   Would the game serve as a rallying point for the Eagles?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really tough to say,'' said quarterback Scott Mutryn, who
will be among 14 seniors who will take their final Alumni Stadium
bow Saturday. ``We were so focused on Miami that you don't think
ahead. Right now, this game's over and we've got to treat it like
that and we've got to be able to come back and watch the film and
get ready for Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to start righting this ship,'' Mutryn added.
``Right now, it's just really kind of swaying in the wind, and we
just need a stabilizing force to get it calmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles found no safe harbor in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which their badly listing vessel went under in the
face of the Hurricanes' first-quarter gale of 21 unanswered points
no doubt resembled any of the greater maritime disasters. Miami
junior running back Edgerrin James opened the floodgates for the
'Canes when he scored on runs of 2 and 1 yards to give Miami an
early 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Miami quarterback Scott Covington, who completed 17 of 27 passes
for 224 yards by finding seven receivers, made it 21-0 on a 10-yard
pass to Daryl Jones with 1:56 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we came out flat in the first quarter,'' said freshman
linebacker Andy Romanowsky, who made his first career start in
place of injured sixth-year man Brian Maye (pulled right groin).
``If we got off to a better start, it might've been a different
ballgame, but it definitely stunned us.''
</P>
<P>
   James, who rushed for a career-high and conference-record 271
yards in Miami's 45-44 victory in double overtime last year at BC,
proved the real stunner when he carried 31 times for a season-high
182 yards. James overshadowed BC senior running back Mike Cloud,
who was limited to a season-low 75 yards on 20 carries, well below
the league-leading average (164.6 yards) he brought into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they kept the ball away from us,'' BC coach Tom O'Brien
said. ``So if you don't have the ball, it's tough to get the ball
to Mike Cloud. When you're behind, 21-0, it's tough to run the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two games, it's been either feast or famine for BC's
offense. In last week's stinging 32-31 loss against Navy, the
Eagles rolled up 610 yards of total offense. Saturday night, BC
managed just 12 plays for 42 yards during Miami's first-quarter
flurry.
</P>
<P>
   All of which prompted the question: Is it time to change
helmsmen?
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was intent on staying the course with Mutryn, who
was sacked four times and completed 11 of 17 attempts for 106 yards
and a 20-yard TD to Anthony DiCosmo, O'Brien said, ``Absolutely.
There's going to be no changes. You guys always want to change
quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as O'Brien is concerned, Mutryn is not the problem. ``We
didn't get control of the line of scrimmage and they had control of
the line of scrimmage,'' said the coach. ``And if you can't control
the line of scrimmage, then it's tough to run the ball, and that's
what we do best. Mutryn was running for his life half the night
back there.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a game like this,'' he added, ``we have to hold onto
the ball like Miami did, we have to get our defense off the field,
and we have to score points.''
</P>
<P>
   If BC is unable to accomplish those objectives, then November
will be anything but smooth sailing.

NEBRASKA STREAK TORN ASUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ It was quite a run. Two and a half national
championships. Three unbeaten seasons, a field goal from a fourth
unbeaten year and national title. Three losses in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But now that is all over for the Nebraska Cornhuskers.
Saturday's 20-16 loss to Texas took care of that. Now the Huskers
must play the role of spoiler. Losing twice in a season before
Thanksgiving will change the role of a team with high ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Nebraska lose Saturday, it lost at home, ending a
47-game winning streak in Lincoln that dated back to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to have a streak come to an end and be a part of
it coming to an end,'' said first-year coach  &UR; Frank Solich &LR; . ``It's
been a great streak, and we don't have any choice but to come back
and get rolling again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dynasties are hard to build these days in college football. But
the Huskers were unquestionably the team of the '90s, with all due
respect to Florida State. Even with two losses this season _ and
the possibility of more to come _ Nebraska has lost only 13 games
in the past nine years. You do the math and figure out how dominant
the Huskers have been, a fact that was underscored again Sunday
when they dropped out of the Associated Press Top 10 for the first
time since 1992 (they slipped to No. 14).
</P>
<P>
   And give credit to the Nebraska fans. When it was apparent that
Texas had ended the streak, the fans in Lincoln gave the Longhorns
and running back  &UR; Ricky Williams  &LR; an ovation as they walked off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   With 150 yards Saturday, Williams is the clear front-runner in
the Heisman Trophy race.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When is a win a loss? When you are UCLA and you go all out to
beat a mediocre Stanford team. For that come-from-behind triumph,
the Bruins, who had been ranked No. 1 in the first Bowl
Championship Series rankings released last week, took a big hit in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins dropped from No. 2 to No. 3 in the writers' poll, and
from No. 2 to No. 4 in the coaches' poll. What that all means when
the latest BCS rankings are released Monday is that UCLA probably
will drop to third, which means they would not make the Fiesta Bowl
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The only people happy with that will be the Rose Bowl people,
who now can dream of unbeaten UCLA vs. once-beaten Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nice to see Michigan's offense is back in gear. Minus-23 yards
against Minnesota in a 15-10 win in which a safety is a big play?
What is that all about? With games coming against once-beaten Penn
State, unbeaten Wisconsin, and unbeaten Ohio State, this still
could be a fall of discontent for the Wolverines ... Oregon State
was hoping to end its streak of 27 consecutive non-winning seasons.
But after Saturday's 20-19 loss to California, it doesn't look like
it's going to happen. With a 4-5 record, the Beavers have two games
left, with UCLA and Oregon ... If UCLA does fall out of the Fiesta
Bowl and into the Rose, Arizona could feel the pain more than
anyone. The Wildcats very well could go 10-1 and would have a
chance at a Rose Bowl berth (they're the only Pac-10 team never to
have played in the game). But if UCLA goes to the Rose, Arizona
would get squeezed into a game like the Holiday Bowl ... Just a
guess, but Florida State might be playing the best of any team in
the country right now. The Seminoles have gotten over their early
offensive slump, and quarterback  &UR; Chris Weinke &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has not
thrown an interception since he tossed six in a September loss to
North Carolina State, has been superb. But as is generally the case
with the Seminoles, who seem to stumble once a season, they are
going to need some help to get to the Fiesta Bowl ... Air Force is
the only team in Division 1-A to score at least 30 points in every
game it has played this season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's how crazy the BCS rankings are. Since strength of
schedule, the records of your opponents, and the record of your
opponents' opponents are calculated, Kansas State was hurt by
Nebraska's loss to Texas. How so? Well, the Huskers' loss was their
second of the season, and as an opponent of Kansas State (in two
weeks), every loss hurts. So even if the Wildcats beat the Huskers
for the first time in 30 years, the win will not mean as much since
Nebraska would add another loss ... Despite the signs of progress
made by Boston College in two years under  &UR; Tom O'Brien &LR; , &UR;  &LR; going
0-for-October for two straight seasons is not the way to rebuild
the program. Cheer up, Eagle fans. Northeastern is on the schedule
next Oct. 2 ... Ohio State quarterback  &UR; Joe Germaine  &LR; continues to
make a belated run at the Heisman. Germaine completed 31 of 45
passes for 351 yards and three TDs in Ohio State's rout of Indiana
Saturday. It was Germaine's fourth consecutive 300-yard passing day
... Georgia beat itself as much as Florida beat the Bulldogs.
Georgia was inside the Florida 30 four times in the final three
quarters and came away with no points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas may be 7-0, but the Hogs are doing it the hard way.
They've had to come from behind in three of their four Southeastern
Conference games this season. The Hogs have been impressive in the
second half, outscoring their opponents, 137-33 ... Oregon could be
in trouble. The Ducks were crushed by Arizona and are down to their
fourth-string running back because of injuries ... They're cheering
at Division 2 Cheyney State. Cheyney ended a 52-game winless streak
and a 39-game losing streak by crushing Mansfield, 40-13 ... Kansas
had a total of 44 yards in 45 plays in its 54-6 loss to Kansas
State, the lowest in school history ... You've got to love Virginia
quarterback  &UR; Aaron Brooks's  &LR; comments after the Cavaliers crushed
Wake Forest, 38-17. ``We just played Virginia football and they
played Wake Forest football,'' said Brooks. ``And that's saying
whatever it's saying.''

MATADORS STAY LOYAL TO COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They are confused and emotionally drained, but
members of Cal State Northridge's women's basketball team remain
loyal and supportive of embattled coach Michael Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message juniors Viveca Lof and Jamilah Jones
delivered prior to practice Sunday evening, as they spoke publicly
for the first time since Abraham was arrested last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did tell us that it's not true, and I believe him,'' Jones
said. ``He said some of the things he's done in the past caught up,
but never in his past has he sold drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a death in the family. Like we lost an intricate
part of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham was arrested Tuesday after practice and indicted for
possession and conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine, FBI
officials said. Abraham is on paid administrative leave from the
school, pending resolution of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know him as a good person. He's always been good to us,''
Lof said. ``We've always been welcomed to his house and he's always
been there for us, so we don't have a reason not to believe him.
Or, at least, I don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just coaching, it's personal. It's happened to a
friend of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Lof said team members have visited Abraham and his
family at his Northridge home.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham hasn't returned phone calls since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wonder, but we just see the coach Mike that we know,'' Lof
said. ``I think we're finally to the stage of where we accept it
and can move on. It kind of sunk in because it was unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the day after Abraham's arrest was announced, the
women's team was picked to finish second in the preseason Big Sky
polls. Much of that had to do with Abraham, who's upgraded CSUN's
talent markedly during his first three years at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Before the arrest he said he expected the Matadors ``to be one
of the top three teams in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my third year and he's instilled a lot in us,'' Jones
said. ``He wants us to become a fighter, wants us to overcome
adversity. He doesn't want this incident to hinder us.''
</P>
<P>
   Associate athletic director Judy Brame has taken over the
head-coaching duties in Abraham's absence. At first, that move
bothered many of the players, who wanted assistants Karon Howell,
Frozena Jerro and Tara Harrington to run the team, Jones said. But
that's changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, when you first hear it, you just want to
work with what you have,'' Jones said. ``You don't want anybody
else to come in. We felt that we should have a say in it, but when
we found out how Judy really was on the court, it's been fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably all thought she was going to come in and try to
take over and run things, but that's not how she's doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to be seen is what happens to the players, particularly
those from overseas. Lof is from Sweden, Lynda Amari is French,
Daphne Verrept is from Belgium and Neda Milic hails from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   While the other players have family in the states, Jones said
most of the players came to CSUN because of Abraham's dynamic
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Athletic director) Paul Bubb said he asks every athlete when
they come in, `If something happened with your program, would you
still like it that you're at Northridge?' '' Jones said. ``But
that's not most of our cases. Most of us have come here because of
coach Mike, or because of the players that were here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really tough on Neda.''
</P>
<P>
   The players will get to focus on something else when they play
an exhibition game Sunday. The regular season begins Nov. 14
against Oakland University.

   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles
Schumer, remain virtually tied in the race for U.S. Senate,
according to the latest polls, while Gov. George Pataki maintains a
substantial lead over his Democratic challenger, Peter Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby International has been conducting a tracking poll for The
New York Post and Fox 5 News since Oct. 22. The tracking poll uses
new samples each day and reports the results based on a combination
of the most recent days.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the Post/Fox 5 poll has shown Schumer ahead by
as much as six points, and D'Amato has led by one point. But
neither candidate's margin has ever been statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results, released Sunday, are based on interviews
conducted Thursday and Friday with about 1,196 likely voters. They
show both the senator and Schumer each with 41 percent. Thirteen
percent of the voters have not yet made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   A Daily News/New York 1 News poll was conducted in the
conventional manner _ using one sample for the length of the survey
_ over much of the same period as the Post/Fox 5 tracking poll. It
found Schumer leading by four points among likely voters, with 46
percent, to 42 percent for D'Amato, a difference that also was
within that poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4
percentage points. Eleven percent remained undecided in that poll,
conducted Oct. 25-30 by Blum and Weprin Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls from other organizations also found no
statistically significant differences between D'Amato and Schumer.
They included polls by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion and
Quinnipiac College, both of which found Schumer ahead by four
points and showed 8 percent undecided. The Marist poll was
conducted Oct. 26 and 27 with 351 likely voters, and Quinnipiac
College polled 547 likely voters from Oct. 20-25.
</P>
<P>
   Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research conducted a poll Oct. 26-28
with 808 likely voters that found Schumer leading by three points.
Schumer was seven points ahead of D'Amato, also statistically
insignificant, with 11 percent undecided in the latest
Manhattanville College Poll, conducted Oct. 23-26 with 497 likely
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted Oct.
21-25, Schumer and D'Amato both had 44 percent of 639 likely
voters, with 10 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The various polls showed Pataki ahead of Vallone by 26 to 37
points. Independent Party candidate B. Thomas Golisano had 10
percent and Liberal Party nominee Betsy McCaughey Ross trailed with
less than 5 percent in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Comptroller H. Carl McCall leads Republican Bruce
Blakeman by more than 30 points, but on average, more than 20
percent are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The race for attorney general is much closer. In the
Manhattanville College poll, Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco had
36 percent of likely voters and Democratic challenger Eliot
Spitzer, 31 percent, a difference within the poll's margin of
error. Vacco's lead was small, but statistically significant, in
the other polls.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Differences in polls can be attributed to many things, including
wording and order of the questions. The timing of the surveys can
also cause variations. The Daily News/New York 1 News poll began
interviewing on the final day of the Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   The polls all report results among likely voters, a term that
organizations define differently.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling error could also account for differences in the margins
of some of the polls. For example, the margins of sampling error
for these polls range between plus or minus three points and six
points. The margin of sampling error for the Post/Fox 5 poll is
three points, meaning that D'Amato's 41 percent support could be as
high as 44 percent or as low as 38 percent. Therefore, based on
that poll, D'Amato could be ahead by as much as six points, or
behind by as much as six points.

RAIDERS CAPITALIZE ON SEAHAWK TURNOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Warren Moon returned to the Seahawks' starting lineup
Sunday night. The rest of the offense continued to be AWOL.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks let a must-win game against the Oakland Raiders
slip through fumbling fingers 31-18 in a nationally televised and
sold-out game at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Moon, playing for the first time in three weeks because of two
cracked ribs, completed 29 of 39 passes for a season-best 275 yards
_ including a club-record 17 straight completions at one point. But
once again, the offense did not produce enough points to allow the
Seahawks to win a game they could not afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' Moon said. ``You want to dominate at
home. We're not doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-to-swallow loss, their fourth in the past five games,
left the Seahawks at 4-4. The Raiders improved to 6-2 and are one
of eight teams in the AFC with a better record than the struggling
Seahawks entering the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty talented, but we're not beating teams with a
winning record,'' linebacker Chad Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fact. The Seahawks four victories have come against teams
that are a combined 9-22. Their four losses have come to teams that
are 23-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams know how to win,'' Brown said. ``We know how to
lose to winning teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks lost this one because they turned the ball over
five times. One of Moon's rare incompletions was intercepted and
returned 74 yards for a TD by Raiders safety Albert Lewis. There
also were four lost fumbles _ three in the final 17 minutes to set
up a field goal and a TD by the Raiders after the Seahawks had cut
the lead to 21-18.
</P>
<P>
   The killer came with 11:32 left game when Raiders linebacker
Mike Morton knocked the ball from Ronnie Harris, who was returning
his first punt of the season. Kenny Shedd recovered at the Seattle
1-yard line to set up Oakland's final TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing about catching punts is catching the punt.
It's something I've always been pretty good at,'' said Harris, who
had a fumbled punt and a fumbled kickoff returned for TDs last
season. ``Letting your teammates down is probably the hardest part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the score set up by Harris' fumble came with an odd
twist in a game that was filled with strange plays. Raiders rookie
fullback Jon Ritchie fumbled on his second-down carry, but guard
Darryl Ashmore recovered the ball and scored to push the Raiders
lead to 31-18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the running back get hit and the ball came out,'' said
Ashmore, who was starting for the injured Derrick Graham. ``It was
lying on about the half-yard line. Then it was lying on Derek
Brown's lap. I picked it up and fell into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding injury to insult, the Seahawks played most of the game
with left guard Pete Kendall at center. The switch was necessary
after starter Kevin Glover aggravated a pinched nerve in his back
on the game's first series.
</P>
<P>
   Glover was originally hurt last week in practice. Kendall
replaced Glover because backup center Chris Gray was inactive after
receiving a concussion in last week's win at San Diego, and because
rookie Jason McEndoo's only series ended when he made an errant
shotgun snap that Moon fumbled. McEndoo was signed off the practice
squad Friday because of the loss of Gray and the uncertainty over
Glover's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously that hurt us,'' coach Dennis Erickson said of the
revolving door that the center position became. ``But that's just
an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Raiders quarterback Donald Hollas, making his third start in
place of the injured Jeff George, needed no excuse. He completed 12
of 22 passes for 237 yards and threw TD passes to Tim Brown and
Ricky Dudley. Hollas was especially effective on third downs,
completing 5 of 7 for 121 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The layoff seemed to rejuvenate Moon, who completed each of his
16 passes in the first half to break the club record of 15 in a row
set by Jim Zorn in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Moon hit his first two passes _ a 15-yarder to Mike Pritchard
and a 25-yarder to tight end Christian Fauria _ before the
game-opening drive stalled and the Seahawks settled for a 38-yard
field goal from Todd Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Moon's hot hand, the Seahawks could muster just two TDs
_ his 1-yard pass to tight end Carlester Crumpler and a 1-yard run
by Ricky Watters on fourth-and-goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' No. 1-ranked defense held Watters to 54 yards on 18
carries and the longest of Joey Galloway's five catches was an
8-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers, however, were the real problem _ a bigger one than
anything the Raiders presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we lose a game it's the turnovers that are the
problem,'' Fauria said. ``It causes problems. It was tight for a
while even with all the turnovers. But you get three or four and
that kills you.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnovers also wasted another good effort by Seattle's
defense. Despite playing without linebacker Darrin Smith, their
second-leading tackler who was sidelined with a sprained ankle, the
Seahawks held the Raiders' Napoleon Kaufman to 56 yards on 22
carries _ a 2.5-yard average, 2 yards under his season average.
</P>
<P>
   Things will get no easier for the Seahawks. They host the Kansas
City Chiefs this week, a team that has beaten them eight straight
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously bad,'' linebacker Dean Wells said. ``We know we
need 10 wins to get to the playoffs, so any time you lose at home
to an AFC opponent, it is tough to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you're gagging on your own turnovers.

HAWKS TAKE A HIKE WITH POOR SNAPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The trouble was not in the throwing of strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawk quarterback Warren Moon Sunday night was a regular Roger
Clemens with the high heat, completing his first 17 passes and
generally leaving the well-regarded defense of the Oakland Raiders
dragging lumber back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was getting the ball back to the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The most elemental function in football, the center snap, became
an adventure that was at times no less formidable than Mount
Everest.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of thing just doesn't happen to playoff-quality teams.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, we give you the Seahawks, 4-4 at midseason, 1-3 in the AFC
West, and circling the drain.
</P>
<P>
   They need to win six of their remaining eight games to make the
playoffs and save the jobs of the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Not with this line.
</P>
<P>
   Not with this scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Not with these mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   There are no must-wins yet, of course, but after scuffing,
31-18, an opportunity at home on national TV against the worst 5-2
team in NFL history, led by one-time kitty-furniture maker Donald
Hollas, here was coach Dennis Erickson's assessment of Sunday's
Kingdome game against Kansas City:
</P>
<P>
   ``Double do-or-die.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear exactly what that means, but it sounds important.
</P>
<P>
   Probably important enough to figure out this bad business
between the legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make excuses, but particularly on game day, it
makes it harder,'' said Erickson of the offensive-line shuffle that
created two drive-killing muffed exchanges in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The blown snaps were only part of the five turnovers that
created the Seahawks' ghastliest loss of the season. But when the
game plan calls for more pitches than the Mariner bullpen,
interceptions are inevitable. Mistakes elsewhere can't be indulged.
</P>
<P>
   When veteran starting center Kevin Glover went down with a
pinched nerve in his back early in the first quarter, the Seahawks
on the sidelines could have been knocked over by a skinny forearm
from Raider owner Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The potential swoon was due to the fact that there was no
adequate backup. Regular second-stringer Chris  &UR; rr &LR; Gray was out
with a concussion from last week. The Seahawks were left with Jason
McEndoo, a rookie seventh-round draft pick from Washington State
who was signed off the practice squad only Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, that was the first time I'd played center since
high school,'' McEndoo said. ``On Friday, I had a lot of snaps,
watched film and took some notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those notes undoubtedly intimidated the heck out of Raider
defensive tackles Russell Maryland and Darrell Russell.
</P>
<P>
   After seven plays, including a shotgun snap that escaped Moon
and killed a drive, the Seahawks opted to move over Pete Kendall
from left guard.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was ... well, let him tell you:
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I snapped was with two hands as a 9-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that wealth of experience, Kendall acquitted himself
reasonably well for the rest of the game, though he, too, messed up
a snap that meant two of the Seahawks' first four possessions were
befouled by the offensive game's starting point.
</P>
<P>
   That is a coaching blunder, pure and simple. To be caught with
so little experience at so vital a position is an oversight that
causes regimes to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Said Moon: ``I'd never worked with either of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   So the rest of Moon's spectacular deeds for the night were
rendered almost moot. When Kendall's guard spot was filled by
seldom-used Andrew Greene, the Seahawks were a calliope short of a
full circus.
</P>
<P>
   Just mediocre when everyone was healthy, the now-makeshift line
was borderline helpless to sustain a game-long attack against the
No. 1-rated defense in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   To rely almost exclusively on the cunning of a
soon-to-be-42-year-old quarterback who had hardly practiced in a
month was not just inviting disaster, it was giving disaster a full
meal, plus an after-dinner brandy and cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither team ran the ball well, the Raiders didn't need
the rushing as much because Seahawk turnovers frequently gave the
visitors a short field. The Seahawks' dependency on passing
eventually caught up to them in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a good effort by any means,'' Erickson said. ``We
need to all check and see where we are at this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would play a lot better than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, that's pretty much how a sold-out Kingdome crowd felt,
too, not to mention football pundits around the country. But of
course, it's not up to the crowd and pundits to prepare the team.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a solid defense and greatly improved special teams, the
Seahawks have squandered the season's first half, and face a second
half with no discernible plan on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the best talent in the league and if you can't do
squat with it, you lose,'' said Mark Collins, a Super Bowl veteran
with the New York Giants and former all-pro safety. ``I just think
we all need to look in the mirror, coaches included, and get this
thing done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 6-2 mark, the Raiders are no more than an average
team, especially when led by a guy whose best days were spent
making scratching posts.
</P>
<P>
   If he has an inventory backlog of litter boxes, he would be wise
to leave a business card with the Seahawks.

IN DEFEAT, SEAHAWKS FIND PASSING GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Raiders came to town Sunday night hungry and ready
to take advantage of every Seahawk injury, every miscue and
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 31-18 Seahawk defeat that will make everyone
question the direction of this .500 ballclub. Now, the Hawks will
be hard-pressed to meet expectations, let alone make an appearance
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But in between the fumbles, in between the botched play of the
offensive line that lost veteran center Kevin Glover on the first
series and could never establish a running game, the Seahawks'
offense seemed more than ready to reclaim its identity.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in between the five turnovers that crushed any hope for
victory, you watched what Warren Moon and the passing game was
doing and you said, ``Yes, that's more like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the key to the Seahawks' running game, Ricky Watters,
caught nine passes for 68 yards _ 12 more than the 54 Watters
gained on 18 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks came out passing. The game's first two plays asked
Moon to find the open man, which the veteran quarterback did, and
the Hawks were off and throwing.
</P>
<P>
   It was like the Seahawks' offense was finally ready to assert
its strength. For the first time this season, it looked like it had
a purpose, and Moon looked like the Moon of 1997, when he led the
NFL's top passing offense.
</P>
<P>
   Play No. 1 for the Hawks? Moon cranked back his Hall-of-Fame arm
and delivered a 15-yard strike to Mike Pritchard _ the same Mike
Pritchard who, like most of the offense this season, had emerged
from close games looking dazed and confused.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Sunday night, Pritchard and his fellow receivers let it
fly.
</P>
<P>
   Play No. 2 for the Hawks? Moon connected with tight end
Christian Fauria on a 25-yard completion _ letting the Raiders know
that every single eligible receiver was going to get the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``That entire opening drive was scripted,'' said Pritchard. ``We
were going to score on that drive.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first two pass completions, Moon handed off to
Watters. But then it was right back to the pass, as Joey Galloway
caught an 8-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first half, Moon was rolling. He was
15-for-15, tying Jim Zorn's franchise record for consecutive
completions. No. 15 was a beauty. It came on third-and-7, with the
Hawks at the Oakland 13.
</P>
<P>
   Moon swung a pass out to Watters, who reached down to make an
incredible catch, then trundled ahead six yards for a first down at
the Raiders' 7.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as Moon's 15th straight completion was, No. 16 was
even better. The pass that gave Moon the Seahawks' record was to
tight end Carlester Crumpler, and the big man was in the end zone.
Touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Moon said he had no idea how many completions he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought my rhythm was good _ as good as last season. We
got to open it up a little, and I'm the kind of quarterback who
needs to get into that kind of rhythm,'' said Moon, who ended up
completing 29 of 39 pass attempts for a season-high 275 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Moon's pass attempt to Fauria was tipped,
and the ball floated into the hands of safety Albert Lewis, who
returned the ball 74 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After the play, coach Dennis Erickson was on the sidelines,
clapping his hands to encourage his offense, as if to say that the
play was a fluke. Even though it gave the Raiders a 21-10 lead, the
Hawks were sticking to their plan.
</P>
<P>
   The next time out, Moon led a 52-yard scoring drive on 10 plays,
connecting on all five pass attempts and then topping the drive off
with a pass to Pritchard for a two-point conversion that closed the
gap to 21-18.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the fourth quarter, the Raiders went up 24-18
but the Hawks were still looking capable of pulling off the
comeback. That's when Ronnie Harris fumbled a punt return at the
Seahawks' 5, the Raiders recovering at the 1. Two plays later, the
Raiders were in for a touchdown and the game was out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question (down 24-18) that we could have moved
the ball. After that (fumble and Raider TD) we had to throw on
every down,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   More than any of their previous losses in this rapidly
disappearing season, this defeat was a shame.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because there is no question that Moon, Pritchard and the
rest want the remainder of the season to continue in this newly
established passing fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suits our personality,'' Pritchard said. ``We're
playmakers. We're not the kind of two-tight-end, smash-mouth
offense. We're a team that can make the short passes, make the
medium passes and then go for the big play. We can control the game
with our passing, especially our short passing, and then take our
shots long. That's just as effective as using the running back.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be. It should have been, except for the five turnovers
that will make it tough to remember that Moon and his passing crew
were back to feeling good again.

BIG-PLAY DEFENSE KEEPS OAKLAND ON WINNING TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At this point last year, the Oakland Raiders had only
one more win left in them and several more deflating defeats,
including one against New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Shaw, then the Saints' defensive backs coach, was present
for that debacle. The Raiders were 2-6 before that game en route to
a 4-12 finish, but they were playing at home against a team that's
usually a pushover. Instead, the Saints won, 13-10, with turnovers
playing an important role.
</P>
<P>
   That Saints unit didn't get much attention, but it ranked sixth
in the NFL in pass defense in '97 and earned Shaw a promotion to
defensive coordinator in '98 _ with the Raiders. Now, under Shaw
and new head coach Jon Gruden, the Raiders have the best defense in
football.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks got to that defense a bit Sunday. In fact, Hawks
quarterback Warren Moon set a team record with 17 consecutive
completions. But the Raiders made the big plays, forcing five
turnovers to the Seahawks' one. That, more than anything, gave
Oakland the 31-18 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing, getting here after a 4-12 season, is that they
needed an attitude change,'' Shaw said. ``You're going to have good
X's and O's, everybody has that. But when you're 4-12, guys have to
want to change, to play hard and go for the ball. X's and O's don't
play. People play, and that's why they needed an attitude change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders showed that new attitude immediately, when safety
Anthony Newman ripped the helmet off receiver Mike Pritchard. The
play had gone for 15 yards, but the message seemed clear: these
were not going to be your '97 Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's defense had allowed an average of 12 points in the
Raiders' past four games, all of which resulted in wins for 6-2
Oakland. Entering Sunday night's game, the Raiders had allowed only
249.6 yards per game, the best figure in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's doing their job, and it's like one group, one
heartbeat,'' said rookie cornerback Charles Woodson, who was busy
winning the Heisman Trophy for Michigan while the Raiders struggled
last year. ``Everybody's getting to the ball, hitting, making
plays. It's a lot of fun when you know you're No. 1 and people are
coming at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Added defensive tackle Darrell Russell: ``To know everyone has
the same mind-set as you, it doesn't get any better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders are looking like the Raiders again, and Russell
talked afterward about how much he enjoys playing for ``the team
you love to hate.'' One way this team is like its bad-boy
predecessors is in penalties: the Raiders entered Sunday's play
with 100 more penalty yards than their opponents, and penalties
twice hurt them Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, however, the talent of the Raiders' defense made up
for the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first half, as Seahawk receiver Christian Fauria
rolled around on the NFL logo at the 30-yard line after a 16-yard
reception, Raiders safety Albert Lewis came roaring in from the
blind side with a hit.
</P>
<P>
   That earned an unnecessary roughness call, turning it into a
31-yard play for the Hawks and bringing a mock cheer from Fauria,
who raised his arms while sprawled on his back. Five plays later,
the Seahawks had a touchdown and a 10-7 lead. The next quarter,
though, Lewis returned an interception 74 yards for a touchdown of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the third, Marquis Walker's facemask penalty turned a
third-and-7 into a third-and-2 for the Hawks. But Russell then
sacked Warren Moon, causing a fumble that the Raiders recovered.
That play turned into an Oakland field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Walker would atone for his penalty by picking up Joey Galloway's
fumble in the fourth quarter. But that play belonged on Woodson's
highlight reel. The Seahawks completed only one pass to Woodson's
side all day, and attempted only one other pass his way before the
final drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy that doesn't feel pressure,'' Lewis said. ``He
believes in the skills he has, and rightfully so.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Woodson doesn't feel pressure because he's part of a unit
that specializes in taking pressure off. With starting quarterback
Jeff George out with a groin injury, the Raiders are forced to be
somewhat more conservative offensively. They can pull it off,
George said, because of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you don't turn the ball over, if you have a defense
like we have, you're going to always have a chance to win,'' George
said. ``That's stressed: don't turn the ball over, and we'll take
our chances with our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a winning formula last night.

SNARLING BEGINS FOR UW, OREGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The fur and the feathers were not yet flying Sunday
night in Eugene and Seattle. Perhaps the Saturday losses incurred
by Oregon and Washington in their pursuit of upper-level bowl games
dulled the rancor.
</P>
<P>
   If form holds, however, there will be enough barbs thrown soon
to wire a fence from here to the state line in advance of
Saturday's ABC-televised UW-UO game at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a rivalry,'' said Oregon coach Mike Bellotti,
``where maybe it wasn't for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's always been a rivalry, it just hasn't been one so
punctuated recently by Duck victories. Oregon has won three of the
past four and the Huskies will go to Eugene Saturday as a bigger
underdog _ 6{ points on Sunday night's early line _ than they have
been since they were a 10-point 'dog to the Ducks in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can catch them sleeping,'' said UW linebacker Marques
Hairston. ``They have to put their pads on and we have to put our
pads on, and whoever plays best wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1928-31 _ when Enoch Bagshaw and James Phelan were
coaching the Huskies _ have the Ducks won four games from the
Huskies in a five-year period. The perception has developed that
Oregon has taken the game more seriously than Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all perception, somebody else's thing,'' Jim Lambright,
the UW coach, said before Sunday night's short practice. ``It's
definitely not coming from our field.''
</P>
<P>
   Lending to the notion have been some crackling comments from
Duck players in recent years. Former wide receiver Pat Johnson _
whose touchdown catch beat Washington last year _ talked about
learning to hate the Huskies, and ex-running back Saladin
McCullough accused Lambright of ``bragging,'' apparently a
reference to Lambright's 1995 comments detailing why Washington
should be picked for the Cotton Bowl ahead of the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two days after Oregon's 31-28 victory, Lambright
said, ``I have a hard time with hatred in a rival game. I will
never get into it, and I know it's being coached. So right away,
you probably give up a lever as far as getting your team ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellotti, asked Sunday night if he and Lambright had discussed
the issue since last year, said, ``No, I didn't talk to him about
it. He says a lot of things I don't go back and talk to him about.
We take this rivalry very seriously, but I don't teach hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright said Sunday night, ``You try to teach a classy
approach to the game and that same way of playing it. But at the
same time, you also have to let your players know about the emotion
that's going to be there. You play a fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright said cornerback Jermaine Smith might return this week,
a boon for a Husky secondary that has been burned for 748 yards
passing by freshman quarterbacks in the past two games. While
Washington hopes to have back fullback Pat Conniff, Oregon running
back Herman Ho-Ching, who missed the 38-3 loss at Arizona and five
games before it with a knee injury, could play pending workouts
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   A key interference call against UW rover Nigel Burton, which
would have stopped a fourth-quarter USC drive with the Trojans
ahead, 14-10, ``was as questionable as I thought at the time,''
Lambright said. The play negated an interception and USC scored to
continue toward a 33-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Washington offensive coordinator Scott Linehan left Sunday for
Eastern Washington to be with his seriously ill father. Offensive
line coach Steve Morton will direct the offense until Linehan
returns.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 1, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeated Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ELECTIONS-REVIEW _ Rep. John Linder of Georgia, chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, perhaps said it best,
and certainly most succinctly, when he was asked last week which
issue was dominating the elections on Tuesday. ``Nothing,'' he
said. Yet the prevailing sense of a fat and happy _ and
uninterested _ electorate clashes weirdly with the dire, often
despairing, warnings from candidates that have marked this campaign
season. With undiminished fervor, politicians have been loudly
proclaiming one calamity after another, offering themselves as
salvation from, take your pick: the health care crisis; the
education crisis; the Social Security crisis; the moral crisis; the
crisis in the environment; the crisis in international markets. By
Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   NASA-REVIEW _ Last week National Aeronautics and Space
Administration officials turned out in force at Cape Canaveral,
Fla., for another lesson in space-agency showmanship as NASA
skillfully orchestrated both a high-stakes drama and a world-class
nostalgia trip by sending 77-year-old John Glenn back into orbit.
For Glenn's flight aboard the space shuttle Discovery, NASA
succeeded in drawing to Florida an estimated 250,000 people and the
largest contingent of journalists ever to cover a space launching.
By William J. Broad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-REVIEW _ Since Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from
Washington with a signed peace agreement, he has been the subject
of rabid protest and threats from the far right, particularly the
radicals of the Jewish settler movement. In demonstrations, on the
radio and at a funeral for a terrorism victim, the language used to
attack the prime minister has had a creepy echo for most Israelis.
The words are the same that were used against Yitzhak Rabin after
he brought home the Oslo interim peace accord in 1993. By Deborah
Sontag. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-REVIEW _ ``Divide and conquer'' is an ancient tactic that
Saddam Hussein refined into an art form as a dictator in Iraq. Now,
it seems, it has done him good service in aggravating the United
States and its one-time allies as they struggle to keep him in the
corner where they put him after the Persian Gulf war. These days,
it seems, there are only divisions in the complicated apparatus
designed to prevent him from acquiring new weapons of mass
destruction or the economic power with which to develop them.
Members of the transatlantic and Arab coalition that once fought
him often seem at odds with each other _ so much so that they have
failed to come up with a sucessful response to his latest efforts
to wriggle out of arms-control inspections. By Youssef M. Ibrahim. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA-ENERGY-REVIEW _ Americans are consuming about as much
energy as they did 25 years ago. They are living in bigger homes
crammed with more appliances and driving larger, more powerful cars
and more light trucks. They using energy as if it were limitless _
consuming far more per person than Asians or Europeans. Only
Canadians, with more heavy industry and more chilblains, consume
more. By Allen R. Myerson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK-GUNFIGHT-REVIEW _ Why did history and Hollywood choose to
make the gunfight at the O.K. Corral immortal? A partial answer is
that Americans have always looked to the West _ to the Alamo, to
Custer's Last Stand, to the O.K. Corral _ for defining moments in
the national character. Another is that, in time, post-Marx
historians saw the Earps and the Cowboys as representatives of
opposing cultural and political forces. By Allen Barra. &QL;

   HOLLYWOOD-AGE-REVIEW _ There's no place quite like Hollywood for
its obsession with youth _ but anguish about getting older is
hardly limited to well-known actors and actresses surgically
carving up their faces to look younger. Writers over 50, especially
on television, are virtually shut out of many top shows because
they are considered too old and too out of touch by network
executives and producers who are in their 20s and 30s. By Bernard
Weinraub. &QL;

<P>
   MARATHONS-REVIEW _ The 32,000 runners in Sunday's New York City
Marathon will be cheered by 2 million spectators, serenaded by 40
bands, hydrated at 24 water stations and tinctured at two dozen
medical stations. But, alas, there will be no oyster tent at Mile
25. While New York's is one of the world's great marathons, it is
not one of the most exotic. For those who crave the slithery slide
of mollusks instead of the chewy energy of Power Bars for that
final surge across the finish, the Marathon des Chateaux du Medoc
in France's Bordeaux wine country is the place to go. By Jere
Longman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-WOMEN-REVIEW _ Women often complain that working women
have a tougher time in Japan than in any other industrialized
country. While there has been some improvement in recent years, the
Japanese government is now trying to confront the issue by
releasing new guidelines in an effort to bar sexual harassment. By
Sheryl Wudunn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMAR-REVIEW _ For grammarians, lexicographers and linguists,
it's the Thing That Will Not Die. Just when they think it's buried
once and for all, the corpse rises again to haunt a new generation.
The creature walking among us, if you haven't already guessed, is
the old ``rule'' of grammar that says we shouldn't split an
infinitive. It's been pronounced dead every few years for more than
a century, but it just won't be laid to rest. In the hearts of true
believers, it's still a sin to ever put an adverb (like ``ever'')
between the word ``to'' and the infinitive form of a verb. The
latest post-mortem comes from Oxford University Press, which
publishes the granddaddy of dictionaries, the Oxford English
Dictionary, as well as baby dictionaries of every size and
description. By Patricia T. O'connor.
</P>
<P>
   TV-SPORTS-LINGO-REVIEW _ Drawing on popular culture, inside
jokes and hip-hop lingo, ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' has helped create
a rich, arcane new sports vernacular _ from Dan Patrick's ``He's en
fuego'' to Rich Eisen's ``He busts out the whuppin' stick!'' to
Rece Davis' ``No soup for you!'' What do the catch phrases mean?
Where did they come from? Here is a sampling from what could be a
modern sports lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   GLENN-DOLLS-REVIEW-NYT _ They may be the first septuagenarian
action figures ever. As John Glenn prepared to be catapulted into
space aboard the Discovery shuttle last week, miniature John Glenns
began landing on toy-store shelves. By Pam Belluck.

<P>
   &UR; One Man's America: A Journalist's Search for the Heart of His
Country &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Henry Grunwald. Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   The former editor in chief of Time Inc. tells of how he arrived
here in 1940 as a 17-year-old Viennese refugee and worked his way
into the house that Henry Luce built, which gave him a terrific
vantage point on his adopted country. This memoir ``percolates with
anecdote, insight and charm,'' Robert W. Merry wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Complete Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bernard Malamud. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $16.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these 55 tales focus on Jews of amazing variety,
laboring or wandering under the weight of conscience. Whether grim
dramas of workaday existence or ruminations on the meaning of love,
the best stories meld the allegorical and the everyday and brim
with ethical concerns, from the burdens of capitalism to the
enormity of the Holocaust. ``There must be many readers who will be
grateful to 'The Complete Stories' for prompting a return to
Malamud,'' Walter Goodman wrote in these pages in 1997. ```Is
morality a necessary part of fiction?' one of his characters asks.
The answer, in Malamud's revelatory work, remains a resounding
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Adirondacks: A History of America's First Wilderness &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Schneider. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   In recounting more than 300 years in the life of what is now the
6-million-acre Adirondack Park, the author argues that wilderness
is not only a human invention but a New York invention. This is ``a
thoroughly readable and entertaining tour'' of the preserve and the
Indians, trappers, redcoats, magnates and others who have passed
through, James Gorman said here last year.  &UR; Heart and Blood: Living
With Deer in America &LR; , by Richard Nelson (Vintage Departures, $14),
raises difficult questions about our complex relationship to deer
and wildlife in general, and tackles the troubling ethical and
ecological contradictions of hunting in the modern age. Last year
our reviewer, Robert Finch, called this ``a brave and beautifully
rendered work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Mooring of Starting Out: The First Five Books of Poetry &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By John Ashbery. Ecco Press, $18.
</P>
<P>
   In his first five collections of poems (1956-72), the celebrated
author reveals his twin obsessions with self-evasion and
self-renewal, and his enthusiasm for complex poetic schemes and
other forms of lyricism. ``The elusiveness and mysterious promise
of his lines remind us that we always have a future and a condition
of meaningfulness to start out toward,'' Nicholas Jenkins wrote
here earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Book of Famous Iowans &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Douglas Bauer. Owl/Holt, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged man tries to make sense of his mother's scandalous
affair when he was a boy in a small Iowa town, a betrayal that
continues to haunt him as an adult. Last year in the Book Review,
Douglas Unger called this a ``moving and lyrical'' novel that
``gracefully works its way back and forth in time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Almost No Memory: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lydia Davis. Ecco Press, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the characters in these inventive tales, the past is
disturbing, while the present is strange and vivid. Last year our
reviewer, Liam Callanan, said the author writes ``in compressed
prose that is frequently poetic and, without question, memorable.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Last Wish &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Betty Rollin. Public Affairs, $12.
</P>
<P>
   In this revised account of the author's personal encounter with
the assisted suicide issue, she describes what happened when her
terminally ill mother asked that she help her commit suicide in
1983. ``Rollin's loving portrait of her mother's life ... is as
compelling as the account of her death,'' Susan Jacoby said here in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Memoirs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Sir Georg Solti. A Cappella, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   The renowned conductor, who died last year at the age of 84,
looks back on an astonishing career driven by an irresistible
addiction to making music. The result is a ``zestful book by a man
whose motto was `Never Give Up' and whose appetite for work and
life comes across as genuinely inspiring,'' Paul Driver wrote here
in 1997.  &UR; Bernstein: A Biography &LR; , by Joan Peyser (Billboard,
$19.95), which was originally published three years before Leonard
Bernstein's death in 1990, has been revised and updated. In 1987
our reviewer, Leon Botstein, found the profile to be gossipy and
repetitious, but said ``Peyser has managed to convey the magnitude
and range of Mr. Bernstein's talent and achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vaporetto 13 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Robert Girardi. Delta, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   An American banker in Venice becomes obsessed with a mysterious
young woman with a cool touch who will meet him only at night. Last
year our reviewer, Malachy Duffy, said this ``artful novel ...
invites us to put aside our rational skepticism and enter a world
where the past is still hauntingly present.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Matters of Chance &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jeannette Haien. Harper Perennial, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of this large novel is Morgan Shurtliff, a
wealthy Midwesterner whose character is tested during World War II
and after, when he returns to a changing country. ``Haien
charmingly takes us through more than three decades of one family's
pleasures and sorrows,'' Ruth Coughlin wrote here in 1997.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Oct. 24,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

   They may be the first septuagenarian action figures ever. As
John Glenn prepared to be catapulted into space aboard the
Discovery shuttle last week, miniature John Glenns began landing on
toy-store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Courtesy of Mattel Inc. and its Hot Wheels label, children can
now play with three tiny versions of the spacegoing senator. There
is John Glenn in the red space suit he is wearing on the Discovery,
John Glenn in the silver space suit he wore when he became the
first American to orbit the Earth in 1962 and, for those youngsters
who get excited by filibustering and fund-raising, John Glenn the
senator, dressed in a navy blue suit and red tie.
</P>
<P>
   Each John Glenn is about 1} inches tall. There is also a 2-inch
model of the Friendship 7 space capsule circa 1962 and a 3-inch
model of the Discovery. The mini-Senator Glenn, however, does not
have his own transportation; maybe Mattel can make a tiny
chauffeur-driven Lincoln Town Car to fill out the set.
</P>
<P>
   The entire ``Action Pack John Glenn, Great American Hero''
collection retails for $4.99. Mattel spokeswoman Sara Rosales said
the company was inspired by the success of its Mars Pathfinder
model last year.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn _ and NASA _ gave permission for the action figures. ``I
think he was very supportive of it,'' Ms. Rosales said. ``He's not
getting any royalties out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosales is hoping that even some members of the over-11 set
may be enticed to buy the Glenn dolls. ``Hot Wheels are basically
for kids,'' she said, ``but I think that because this is real, and
it is a historical event, there will be a little bit of a
crossover.''

SPLIT INFINITIVES: IT'S JUST FINE TO BOLDLY GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 Patricia T. O'Conner is the author of ``Woe Is I,'' a book about
grammar.  
 (bl)  
 By PATRICIA T. O'CONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For grammarians, lexicographers and linguists, it's the Thing
That Will Not Die. Just when they think it's buried once and for
all, the corpse rises again to haunt a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   The creature walking among us, if you haven't already guessed,
is the old ``rule'' of grammar that says we shouldn't split an
infinitive. It's been pronounced dead every few years for more than
a century, but it just won't be laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the hearts of true believers, it's still a sin to ever put an
adverb (like ``ever'') between the word ``to'' and the infinitive
form of a verb.
</P>
<P>
   The latest post-mortem comes from Oxford University Press, which
publishes the granddaddy of dictionaries, the Oxford English
Dictionary, as well as baby dictionaries of every size and
description.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Oxford's new dictionaries _ one just published here
and one published in Britain in August _ include usage notes about
the split infinitive that essentially reiterate what their
predecessors have said: Rule? What rule? (Or words to that effect.)
</P>
<P>
   The wording in the new books, the Oxford American Desk
Dictionary and the New Oxford Dictionary of English, is only
slightly stronger than in previous versions, but the message is the
same: If it sounds good to split, go ahead and do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford editors didn't expect the new usage notes to excite a
lot of comment. But then, they didn't count on the power of a sales
pitch. ``Infinitives  &UR; should &LR;  be split,'' trumpeted a news release
introducing the British dictionary. The hyperbolic headline not
only overemphasized the issue but also overstated the case.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, what was old news in the world of lexicography _
the demise of the split-infinitive taboo _ apparently came as a
surprise to the English-speaking world at large. The response from
the British press and dozens of American newspapers, as well as
countless Internet users, was a collective ``Good golly!'' The
opinions quoted in the articles ranged from disgust (``I do not
dine with people who split infinitives'') to delight (``I think
it's terrific'').
</P>
<P>
   Frank Abate, editor in chief of Oxford's dictionary programs in
the United States, has spent much of his time lately answering
calls from reporters about the American book. ``You'd think we were
splitting the atom or something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what's all the fuss about? Not much, it turns out.
Grammarians have argued until they were blue in the face that you
can't really split an infinitive, since ``to'' isn't part of the
infinitive. Sometimes it's not present at all. In a sentence like
``I helped him to break the code,'' the ``to'' could easily be
dropped. And in sentences like ``I let him break the code'' and ``I
saw him break the code,'' the infinitive (break) must go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Technicalities aside, what we call a split infinitive has been
around a lot longer than its detractors. Writers used it with
impunity from the 1300s until well into the 19th century. All that
changed in 1864, when the dean of Canterbury, Henry Alford,
published a widely popular grammar book called ``A Plea for the
Queen's English.'' Alford, a classics scholar who sought to
civilize the English of Shakespeare and Milton by imposing on it
the rules of Latin grammar, couldn't bear to see an adverb slip
between ``to'' and an infinitive. (Latin infinitives, you see, have
no such prepositional markers.)
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1868, grammarians were challenging Alford's edict,
arguing that one can't graft Latin sentence structure onto English,
a language that's essentially Germanic. But the damage had been
done. The ban on splitting infinitives was firmly planted in the
popular imagination. So were other leftover Latinisms, including
the prohibition against ending a sentence with a preposition.
</P>
<P>
   Early in this century, such heavyweights as the linguist Otto
Jespersen, the British lexicographer Henry Fowler and the American
grammarian and philologist George Curme argued that splitting is
not only acceptable but often preferable. Most 20th-century
dictionaries and style guides agree that clarity is what counts.
There's a difference, for instance, between ``He learned to quickly
read'' and ``He learned quickly to read.'' And when ``quickly''
comes at the end, it could refer to either the learning or the
reading.
</P>
<P>
   What won't come quickly, one suspects, is an end to the
splitting headache. George Bernard Shaw, a perennial sufferer, once
complained to The Times of London about an overzealous editor with
a wooden ear: ``There is a pedant on your staff who spends far too
much of his time searching for split infinitives. Every good
literary craftsman uses a split infinitive if he thinks the sense
demands it. I call for this man's instant dismissal; it matters not
whether he decides to quickly go or to go quickly or quickly to go.
Go he must, and at once.''

MARATHONS THAT OFFER EXOTIC GAIN FOR THE PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (duplication notice: also sent with `s' code)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The 32,000 runners in Sunday's New York City Marathon will be
cheered by 2 million spectators, serenaded by 40 bands, hydrated at
24 water stations and tinctured at two dozen medical stations. But,
alas, there will be no oyster tent at Mile 25.
</P>
<P>
   While New York's is one of the world's great marathons, it is
not one of the most exotic. Even with the breathtaking start on the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the Spandex pulse through the city's
five boroughs, New York remains a standard 26.2-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   For those who crave the slithery slide of mollusks instead of
the chewy energy of Power Bars for that final surge across the
finish, the Marathon des Chateaux du Medoc in France's Bordeaux
wine country is the place to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only run New York and Boston so many times,'' said
Thom Gilligan of Boston, who has run 60 marathons and operates a
tour company specializing in exotic races. ``You need something
else to pique your interest.''
</P>
<P>
   A race that gives an entirely new meaning to the term runner's
high is the Medoc marathon, held north of Bordeaux on the first
Saturday in September. The course winds through 53 vineyards and
features wine stops at every mile. While the average marathon
offers water and Gatorade, Medoc tempts with Lafite-Rothschild,
Pichon-Longueville, Latour and Mouton-Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say anyone was drunk,'' Gilligan said. ``When
you're dehydrated, that stuff goes right into your system. But in
1996, there were two women who stopped 13 times to take a sip, just
to say they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mile 25, for those who just can't force down another one of
the thousands of orange slices offered, runners are invited to stop
at a tent that serves oysters.
</P>
<P>
   ``An oyster is the last thing I'd want to eat at 25 miles,''
Gilligan said. ``But this year, a lot of people stopped and talked
about how good they were.''
</P>
<P>
   If the field of 7,500 does not run under the influence of
alcohol, it definitely runs under the influence of French
inscrutability. About 75 percent of the runners competed in
costumes this year, Gilligan said, many of the men in drag. Then
there were the runners from Brittany disguised as Dalmatians,
pushing a replica of Cruella de Vil's car and barking at everyone
along the course. Other runners dressed as grape pickers, wine
bottles and corks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get crazy running 26 miles and trying to look good in a
costume,'' Gilligan said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer the terrain more chilled than the wine, The
Last Marathon is held in Antarctica in February, which is summer in
the Southern Hemisphere. The event is called The Last Marathon,
since Antarctica is the last place in the world anyone would think
of running one.
</P>
<P>
   For $4,000 to $5,000, runners fly to Tierra del Fuego and take a
44-hour boat ride to King George Island off the Antarctic
Peninsula, where the race course takes them up a glacier, over
streams, rock fields and crevasses in temperatures that range from
20 to 35 degrees. The spectators include seals, penguins and
divebombing skuas.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every two steps up the glacier, there was one step back,''
said Lynda Churchfield of Lake Charles, La., who ran the very first
Last Marathon in 1995. ``You never know if your foot will go
through the ice. One lady ran into mud, lost her shoe and couldn't
continue. But seeing the penguins and walruses is amazing. It's a
once in a lifetime race.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Churchfield has also run the Marathon des Sables in Morocco,
which is a seven-day, 150-mile race across the Sahara Desert in
temperatures reaching 120 degrees. Runners carry their food in
backpacks, sleep in tents made from burlap sacks and resign
themselves to becoming human blisters. An Italian runner was
reportedly found wandering two weeks later with a nomadic tribe.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, Ms. Churchfield will embark on the Himalayan Trek
and Run, a six-day, 100-mile adventure at altitudes reaching 11,800
feet along India's border with Nepal. Included is a 26.2-mile run
called the Everest Challenge Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what tomorrow will bring,'' said Ms.
Churchfield, who is 48 and seeking to run a marathon in all 50
states by the age of 50. ``Your knees could give out or you could
get hit by a car. You might as well do it while you can. Of course,
I have certain requirements for these races. I want to live
afterwards.''

   (The Week in Review)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Several years ago, George Kirgo, a respected
72-year-old television writer who had worked on such shows as
``Mary Tyler Moore'' and ``Wagon Train,'' proposed a
movie-of-the-week idea to his agent, who took it to a network
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kirgo's too old,'' the executive said immediately, according
to Kirgo.
</P>
<P>
   The agent inquired, ``Does that mean in a couple of years you
won't let me come and see you even though I got you your job?''
</P>
<P>
   The executive replied: ``That's true. Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no place quite like Hollywood for its obsession with
youth _ but anguish about getting older is hardly limited to
well-known actors and actresses surgically carving up their faces
to look younger. Writers over 50, especially on television, are
virtually shut out of many top shows because they are considered
too old and too out of touch by network executives and producers
who are in their 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   A report last week by the Writers Guild of America, the union
that represents writers, found that while women and members of
minority groups have made some gains in Hollywood over the last
decade, the job prospects for older writers have seriously
declined. In fact, past the age of 30, the report said, the rate of
employment for writers decreases. Last season 77 series had no
writers over 50, the study said; prime-time shows like ``Friends,''
``Men Behaving Badly'' and ``Veronica's Closet'' had no writers
over 40. (Shows without any female writers included ``Politically
Incorrect,'' which has 22 writers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know writers who have taken `M.A.S.H' off their resumes
because it makes them too old,'' said Larry Gelbart, the
70-year-old creator of the series. ``There was `Red Channels' in
the '50s,'' he said, referring to the booklet that named alleged
communists in the entertainment industry. ``Now there's gray
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other comparisons with the 1950s. Blacklisted writers
sometimes used fronts, or names of friends, to write scripts.
Nowadays, older writers sometimes bring in their sons or daughters,
and pretend they're partners, to pitch meetings with network
executives. Sometimes an older writer who has an idea for a show
asks a young writer to join him and make the pitch so the network
executive will feel more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel more at ease with the guys and gals they went to
school with,'' said Kirgo. ``They also feel that the older you get
you're less in tune with your wit and sexuality. You can't write
love scenes. It's beyond your ken. It's one of the few businesses
where the more experience you have, the less useful you are.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the prospects for older writers are poor was
underlined by the recent saga of Riley Weston, a 32-year-old who
posed as 19 to get a job as a writer and actress on ``Felicity,'' a
show aimed at teen-agers. Ms. Weston was hired because of her
``unique perspective'' as a teen-ager. In fact, if she had been
truthful, she probably wouldn't have been hired.
</P>
<P>
   Film studio executives and producers are, by most accounts,
biased toward young writers, but the bias in the movie business
seems less harsh than in the television arena. After all, not every
film is made for teen-agers. Many of the best-known screenwriters
are in their 40s, 50s and even 60s. They write scripts on their own
and sell them to studios. Television writers, in contrast, work in
groups on specific shows _ and there aren't many shows for older
people.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of network television audiences and revenue has led
programmers and advertisers to focus on viewers between 18 and 49.
And since so many hit shows are geared to the young, network
executives are insisting that only the young can write for the
young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote for `Sanford and Son,' and I wasn't black, I wrote for
Shari Lewis, and I wasn't a puppet,'' said 66-year-old Saul
Turteltaub. ``You don't have to be the age, sex, race of the thing
you're writing about. You have to be a talented writer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Writers Guild report, by William T. and Denise B. Bielby,
professors of sociology at the University of California at Santa
Barbara, found that about 70 percent of writers under 30 worked in
1997, compared to less than 33 percent of writers over 50. In only
a handful of series were at least a third of the writers over the
age of 50. Surprisingly, some of those series were youth-oriented,
including ``Baywatch Nights,'' ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' and ``The
Magnificent Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are exceptions. ``I began in the 50s _ when older,
more experienced writers got the jobs and younger people had
trouble finding work,'' said Irma Kalish, a television writer and
executive producer on such shows as ``The Facts of Life.'' She
added, ``The pendulum has swung entirely the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Another writer, Hindi Brooks, who wrote for such shows as
``Fame'' and ``Eight Is Enough,'' put it another way. Ms. Brooks
(``I'm above 50'') had grown somewhat successful and had moved from
a small talent agency that represented her to the big William
Morris Agency. But after a while, she couldn't find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agent said he couldn't sell me, and I asked him why,'' she
recalled. ``He said, `Your hair is turning gray.'''

ISRAELIS GET EERIE REMINDER THAT WORDS DO KILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Life in Israel has the jangled energy of a bad
traffic jam, and public debate is led by the guys who lean on their
horns.
</P>
<P>
   The volume is high, the emotions are high and the stakes are
high. Maybe that is why Israeli political discourse is world-class
vitriol _ one part rank ad hominem insult, one part invective-laden
rhetoric. One day, leaders issue witheringly insulting personal
remarks against each other only to join hands in alliance the next.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop comes an interesting and even poignant
sensitivity to the relationship between language that incites and
actual violence. The topic has dominated the public conversation
here for the last week, as Israelis have grappled with the idea
that their democracy exists in a special, fragile context that
might be at odds with their visceral impulse toward the freest of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned from Washington
with a signed peace agreement, he has been the subject of rabid
protest and threats from the far right, particularly the radicals
of the Jewish settler movement. In demonstrations, on the radio and
at a funeral for a terrorism victim, the language used to attack
the prime minister has had a creepy echo for most Israelis. The
words are the same ones that were used against Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin after he brought home the Oslo interim peace accord
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Netanyahu has been called a traitor, a betrayer, a
perpetrator not only of treason but of ``a blunder unlike any in
the history of Zionism.'' Settlers have called for ``revenge.''
They blamed him for ``spilling the blood'' of an Israeli murdered
by a terrorist. And they used loaded references, comparing
Netanyahu's relationship with Yasser Arafat to Neville
Chamberlain's with Hitler, just as they once greeted Rabin by
holding black umbrellas, a la Chamberlain, over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after Rabin's assassination on Nov. 4, 1995, with a
nationwide memorial service scheduled for Sunday, this unnerves
people here because there is a lingering sense that this kind of
language incited his assassin, Yigal Amir _ that it roused him and
led him to believe he was justified in committing a murder on
behalf of the nation. And there is an unresolved guilt that no one
took the threats against Rabin seriously enough, not the
Government, the media or the General Security Services.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, all have decided that it would be more prudent
to risk overreacting this time. The ring of bodyguards surrounding
Netanyahu and his ministers has expanded and tightened.
Commentators noted that the General Security Services will let
Netanyahu visit Arafat in Gaza, but won't let him go near Hebron,
home of an angry Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Even the chief rabbis weighed in, publishing an official
statement on Thursday that prohibits the use of ``insults such as
traitor,'' terming them ``dishonorable to the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   And the attorney general opened several criminal investigations
into threats and slander, dusting off a legal statute that has been
on the books since the days of the British mandate. It allows
prosecutors to bring charges of incitement against those who use
particularly strong language against public officials, but, even in
the wake of the Rabin assassination, they were loath to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis, even as they fear prosecution of speech as a
bridle on their free-tongued society, endorse some kind of rein on
the vehement language of the protesters and on their right to
organize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without hysteria, and without giving up on the bedrock of
democratic government, now is the time to make use of the laws that
allow for the arrest, until their anger subsides, of people who
threaten not only law and order, but also the lives of the leaders
of the state,'' Yosef Lapid, a veteran columnist for the newspaper
Maariv, argued last week. ``The General Security Services and the
police need to take off their kid gloves and strike at the dens of
the inciters, before we are all sorry it was not done soon
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion about words and deeds in Israel resembles one
that takes place in the United States and elsewhere when zealots
turn to violence amid an especially inflamed debate. That happened
in upstate New York last week after a doctor who performed
abortions was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   But in Israel the issue carries a particular double edge. A
commitment to almost raucous discourse is seen as a hallmark of a
society that considers itself the only democracy in the Middle
East. But Israelis have a deep-seated fear, based on experience,
that the connection between hate speech and violent acts is an
intimate one: In a Maariv poll, 81 percent of those surveyed said
they believe there has been incitement against Netanyahu and 60
percent believe it likely that someone will try to assassinate him.
</P>
<P>
   Underpinning this concern is a concomitant belief that the tone
is set from on high, by politicians who routinely call each other
liars, crybabies and cretins. Some have suggested that the ugly
language of the far right is just the end of a continuum that
begins on the marble floor of the Parliament. Justice Minister
Tsahi Hanegbi in fact, called on the Parliament to police its own
oratory, warning that the political debate sounds like that which
spilled out into the streets in the months before Rabin's
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have believed,'' Lapid asked, ``when the whole state
shuddered in the wake of the Rabin murder, that three years later
the public memorial service in his memory would be a security
danger for the public figures attending?''
</P>
<P>
   This carries a final irony, since some Israelis, notably Leah
Rabin, the late prime minister's widow, believe that it was
Netanyahu himself whose charged rhetoric created the climate of
incitement that inspired Amir.

WOMEN'S WORK IN JAPAN: SERVING TEA, SWALLOWING INSULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ They take pictures of her long thighs as she climbs into
limousines. They capture shots of her sitting in revealingly short
skirts, and they dub her the Madonna of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   It is not exactly the most respectful way to treat Seiko Noda,
minister of post and telecommunications and Japan's youngest
Cabinet minister since the end of World War II. But, then, the idea
of sexual harassment is not foremost in the minds of the mostly
male Japanese media, particularly at the weekly magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain that working women have a tougher time in
Japan than in any other industrialized country. While there has
been some improvement in recent years, the Japanese government is
now trying to confront the issue by releasing new guidelines in an
effort to bar sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear gauge for measuring how common sexual
harassment is in Japan compared to other countries, but some
statistics are striking: One in seven women surveyed in government
offices said they had been pressured into a sexual relationship by
men at work, according to a recent official investigation. A more
common complaint, cited by two out of three women, is that they've
been sexually harassed by men touching their bodies at work.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines will go into effect a year from now at government
offices throughout the country, and they have also been drawing the
attention of Japanese companies, which have drawn up new _ though
much less strict _ rules as well. The result is a great deal of
grumbling by men (``If you say this is sexual harassment, then we
might as well not utter a word!'' one woman was told by a male
boss), as well as a feeling by many women that the rules aren't
tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Japan has fewer problems than the United States.
Sexual blackmail, in which bosses dangle a promotion or a new
assignment in exchange for sex, is not as widespread at large
corporations. One reason is that bosses in such companies have no
direct control over promotions, because all major assignments are
determined by a centralized personnel department.
</P>
<P>
   So even if many women find themselves under pressure to sleep
with their bosses, giving in to the pressure is unlikely to advance
their careers much. But whether they give in often affects the
kinds of tasks they are given. In many companies, women are mostly
on an ``office lady'' track, where they have few opportunities to
advance _ a limitation that perhaps reflects traditional,
discriminatory attitudes toward women that underlie the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are Japanese people who still think that women are just
cute and obedient,'' said Minako Nishijima, a senior official at
Nikkeiren, Japan's largest labor union. ``That kind of thinking has
been accepted without resistance throughout history.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is not remotely a litigious society, and few women have
taken their complaints to court. Even if they win, the compensation
awards are tiny compared to those in America. ``In Japanese
society, people like to settle disputes as amicably and
harmoniously as possible,'' said Pauline Reich, a professor at
Waseda University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a fear of lawsuits has led many Japanese companies to
consider buying insurance that could cover them if an employee sues
for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In a society where the word for wife, ``oku-san,'' literally
means ``Mrs. In-the-Back-of-the-House,'' the government's new
sexual harassment policy marks a major new step. Under the new
guidelines, women in government offices can no longer be forced to
serve tea or run personal errands. And men will no longer be able
to ask questions about sexual experience, or show off obscene
posters or magazine photos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, attitudes will be hard to change. It used to be that many
women were under pressure to quit work when they got married. These
days they can work, but pressure to resign comes when they have
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly, even at the age of 30, a woman can be called
`old,' '' said Yoko Nohara. ``And she can be told, `There is no
position for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year-old college graduate who worked as a clerk at a small
distribution company for nearly four years recalled similar
intrusions into her private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those bosses would say, `Why don't you get married?''' she
said. ``If we take a holiday, they ask, `Are you having an arranged
blind date?'''
</P>
<P>
   Many men presumably think they are just being friendly, but
young women often resent such questions as intrusive. Many women
also complain that they are always the ones asked to serve food or
drink.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old employee, who spoke on the condition she not be
identified, said that at company dinners she was asked to fill wine
cups or soy sauce dishes, or to sing with executives if they were
at karaoke clubs. The guidelines, being directed only at government
offices, will not free employees like her from such tasks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the symbols of tradition in corporations, in fact, is the
tea service. At many companies, tea or coffee is served twice a
day, often to the desks of all the employees, with the women having
to remember who takes sugar or milk. There is also extra tea
service if there are guests or conferences. And there is all the
dishwashing.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, government offices may have to bring in
self-service tea time, if women no longer care to serve. Even
though companies won't be required to follow suit, perhaps a
similar practice will spread.
</P>
<P>
   At least one practice will disappear in government offices:
diminutive name-calling. Senior male managers often use terms like
``girl'' or ``lady'' to soften a relationship with an employee; now
that will be considered verbal sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   More sinister coinages will also be banned. Managers sometimes
refer to women by using a degrading term for ``daughter.'' Or when
they call an assistant to their side, they may not use her name,
her title or Miss. Instead, they often simply call out, ``Hey, she!
Come here!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it works both ways, and under the new guidelines,
women will not be able to mock men, challenging their masculinity
by saying things like, ``You lack guts even though you are a man.''

HEAVENLY REWARDS SHILLING THE RIGHT STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The European Space Agency labored in obscurity for many years,
achieving dozens of feats in the heavens that were ignored by most
Europeans. Then, in 1983, Europe's first astronaut soared into
space aboard a shuttle. Suddenly, millions of television viewers
across the continent were glued to their sets, watching a
good-looking European explorer risk life and limb on the high
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the agency's headquarters in Paris were ecstatic.
Eager for more, they quickly got the same religion as their
counterparts in America, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, which long ago had mastered the art of promoting
space-age heroism.
</P>
<P>
   Belatedly, the Europeans discovered that public enthusiasm for
sending people into space, a venture steeped in risk and danger,
drama and the right stuff, was a sure way to win political support
for space exploration and its great costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago nobody would have dreamed of actively pursuing
this kind of program,'' Jacques Collet, the head of long-term
planning for the European Space Agency, said shortly after the
televised coup prompted the agency to plan dozens of astronaut
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the agency's officials turned out in force at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., for another lesson in space-agency showmanship as
NASA skillfully orchestrated both a high-stakes drama and a
world-class nostalgia trip by sending 77-year-old John Glenn back
into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   For Glenn's flight aboard the space shuttle Discovery, NASA
succeeded in drawing to Florida an estimated 250,000 people and one
of the largest contingents of journalists (2,500) ever to cover a
space launching. But even on slow days, the agency has managed to
turn the Kennedy Space Center into a top tourist attraction, with
tour buses and souvenir shops, its attendance somewhere behind that
of Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's public-affairs and educational arms, with hundreds of
employees coast to coast after 40 years of growth, are the envy of
other federal agencies. They give tours, publish magazines, set up
satellite feeds for television networks, develop course material
for teachers, run Internet Web sites, promote high-tech gadgetry
and regularly hustle out astronauts to meet an admiring public.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say NASA's celebrity culture and love of the
entertainment side of exploration are stifling the more challenging
work of sending humans and robotic probes to study distant worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an agency that's living in the past,'' said Alex
Roland, a former NASA historian who heads the history department at
Duke University. ``They're endlessly repeating the Apollo formula _
sending up astronauts, taking pictures and then sending them out on
lecture tours.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the shuttle flights always have a hefty dose of legitimate
science. In this case, it is aging research with Glenn, and dozens
of other experiments.
</P>
<P>
   But science aside, NASA is heavy with television crews and
telegenic space voyagers, and it knows exactly how to go about
building a political constituency to support its hefty budget,
which at $13.7 billion this year is down from old heights.
</P>
<P>
   So do a growing number of space agencies around the world that
are happy to follow the leader and grab onto NASA's lavish
coattails; the shuttles alone have cost American taxpayers some $70
billion so far.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at Cape Canaveral, scores of Spanish journalists and
television crews, as well as the crown prince of Spain and other
dignitaries, joined in the frenzy to witness the launching not only
of Glenn but also of Spain's first astronaut, Pedro Duque, 35, an
engineer from Madrid who, according to his NASA biography, enjoys
swimming and cycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat to see everybody jump on the excitement bandwagon,''
said Joel Wells, a spokesman at the Kennedy Space Center, referring
to the journalists, ``and hopefully they'll stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising the adrenalin levels of Americans can be difficult these
days because the public has become so blase, especially since the
astronauts do the same old thing _ circle the Earth. Still, as the
Glenn extravaganza suggests, the space agency has some innovations
likely to jack up the thrills and chills _ if not satisfy critics.
</P>
<P>
   As NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin put it delicately in
announcing the senator's flight: The agency is working hard these
days not only to benefit but ``inspire people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the razzmatazz can backfire. A dozen years ago, the
agency wanted to inspire people by enlisting the first private
citizen, Christa McAuliffe, a high school teacher. Among the 2,500
guests NASA invited to the launching of the Challenger space
shuttle were 112 teacher finalists from the competition, two from
each state and territory, who were to fan out afterward to spread
the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   After tragedy struck, killing all seven astronauts aboard the
Challenger, Glenn joined the experts saying the risks of space
flight should bar civilians and celebrities until the shuttle had
proven itself more reliable. ``This is not a Greyhound bus going
from Washington to Columbus,'' he told reporters. ``This is a
research vehicle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Today, convinced that the shuttles are safer, NASA is revamping
its star system. When the agency announced the Glenn flight in
January, it also disclosed that Barbara Morgan, an elementary
school teacher who trained as a backup for the Challenger flight,
would get a new chance. Her astronaut class is to graduate in the
year 2000, after which she will be assigned to a flight and no
doubt broadcast lessons to schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that the biggest show on the horizon is the
International Space Station, an outpost bigger than a football
field that teams of astronauts are to build, service and repair.
The first supply flight for the station's construction is set for
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The endeavor will be extremely dangerous for those sent into
orbit, given the station's size, complexity and all the space
walks. The outpost's size alone makes it a huge target for
asteroids and space debris.
</P>
<P>
   But given the thrill factor, and NASA's diplomatic salesmanship,
the space station is already an international hit. Its 16
participants are Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Britain and the United States. Most of the countries
expect their astronauts to join in a nearly endless series of
broadcasts and dramas from space that could start as early as next
year as the first modules are assembled in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics fear that the $50 billion project will cripple more
worthy missions, including robotic ones. Others fault it as far too
timid, arguing that manned missions should push for Mars and
beyond, perhaps to the Jovian moon Europa, which shows signs of
harboring the solar system's deepest ocean and perhaps alien life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Murray, a scientist at the California Institute of
Technology and president of the Planetary Society, a private group
in Pasadena that backs space exploration, disagreed. He said the
station, by uniting former enemies and galvanizing worldwide
interest, is a potent political and technical first step toward the
exploration and colonization of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's public-relations campaign, he added, should be no
distraction from the serious scientific and technical aims of the
shuttle and station programs, nor from legitimate yearnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drama of humans going away is terribly appealing,'' Murray
said. ``That's why there's all this interest in Glenn. He's going
out in space. You can't overestimate the significance of that.''

 By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was during the oil embargo era of the 1970s that
Patricia Nelson Limerick, who is now a leading historian of the
American West, announced to her students at Yale that Americans'
outlook and behavior had gone through a momentous change. No more
vistas of limitless resources. No more endlessly rising
consumption. The Era of Scarcity had begun.
</P>
<P>
   To save fuel and emphasize her belief, Ms. Limerick got around
by bicycle, train and bus.
</P>
<P>
   But 25 years later, Americans are consuming about as much energy
as ever. By next year, the Energy Department predicts consumption
per person will come to within 2 percent of the 1973 peak.
Americans are living in bigger homes crammed with more appliances
and driving larger, more powerful cars and more light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Limerick is still riding buses. But she admits she got the
broader pattern wrong. ``I was quite a sucker,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Far from illustrating a transformation in American character,
the nation's heavy and rising use of its most basic fuels
illustrates consistencies. The distinctions between America and
most other advanced nations endure.
</P>
<P>
   As the 19th-century American historian Frederick Jackson Turner
famously said, the frontier set America apart from its European
forebears. For Americans, there was always more land, food and
fortune out there for the grabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Census Bureau declared the frontier closed more than
a century ago, in many ways it remains open. Americans have gone
back to using energy as if it were limitless _ consuming far more
per person than Asians or Europeans. Only Canadians, with more
heavy industry and more chilblains, consume more. Low energy prices
are regarded as a part of the Bill of Rights. Politicians who try
to tax or otherwise raise the cost of fuel anywhere near the levels
in Europe are summarily rebuked.
</P>
<P>
   The wide open frontier still lives in the naming and advertising
of pickups and sports utility vehicles. Americans venture forth in
their Blazers, Explorers and Durangos. In commercials these trucks
rumble over endless stretches of Western highway.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionist historians like Ms. Limerick point out that Western
settlement also included official repression of Indians and other
minorities, the ravaging of the environment and a culture of
violence. Revisionist Western states and cities that once welcomed
mining and development are now trying to clean up pollution from
those mines and control urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   America's pattern of settlement, more dispersed than in most
other advanced nations, locks in the need for cheap, abundant
energy. But underneath the roar of factory machinery, home
construction and expressway traffic is the clang of a moral clash.
</P>
<P>
   Half the nation's oil is imported. Scientists caution that
emissions from rising energy use aggravate global warming. But ever
since proto-environmentalists warned of timber depletion in the
1870s, Americans have learned to doubt the need for conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Within the country, energy use varies greatly. New Yorkers and
Hawaiians are practically foreigners, merely sipping fuel while
Alaskans and Texans guzzle it. The average Alaskan uses more than
five times as much energy as the New Yorker, who uses the least;
the Texan burns more than two and a half times as much.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of heavy industry accounts for the greatest
differences. Louisiana and Texas, besides having plenty of oil
wells, are home to the chemical and refining businesses. Alaska and
Wyoming produce great quantities of oil, coal and natural gas,
especially in proportion to their populations.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, smokestacks and drilling rigs are few but subway
and taxi riders many. New Yorkers are also more apt than other
Americans to live jammed into apartments whose energy demands are
far lower than for houses. And with common walls, says Arthur
Rypinski, an Energy Department economist, ``You get to share your
neighbor's heating and cooling.'' As for Hawaii, it counts more on
tourism and pineapples than on petrochemical plants, and has far
lower heating bills than Wyoming or Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s embargo era, Texans, who considered their state
an honorary member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, were never shy about letting Northerners know who had
the most fuel. Bumper stickers on their Lincoln Continentals and
long-bed pickups said, ``Let the Yankees Freeze in the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices so low, perhaps Texans should mount a gracious
campaign assuring New Yorkers they are welcome to every drop Texas
has.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the conflict between the energy-hungry life style
and energy-saving impulses extends to the White House. At his
conference on global warming in October 1997, President Clinton
confessed his doubts about how much the nation could alter its
ways. Or even how much he could change his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm plagued by the example of the light bulb I have in my
living room of the White House that I read under at night,''
Clinton said, ``and I ask myself, `Why isn't every light bulb in
the White House like this?''' The lighting in question was a
readily available, compact fluorescent bulb whose longer life and
energy efficiency pay for its initial high cost several times over.
``Why are we not all doing this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a battle many Americans agree is worth fighting but
don't want to fight themselves, the Clinton administration has
proposed hiring hungry foreign mercenaries. Through trading in
emissions rights, the White House plans to pay developing countries
to achieve about three-fourths of America's reductions required
under last year's Kyoto accord.
</P>
<P>
   Europe and Japan have howled that this plan violates that
accord, at least in spirit. They must be cranky from having to
drive such tiny cars.

SADDAM FINDS DIVIDING IS ONE THING, CONQUERING IS SOMETHING ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(EDS: Please see IRAQ-U.N., a daily story in the ``i'' news file.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ ``Divide and conquer'' is an ancient tactic
that Saddam Hussein refined into an art form as a dictator in Iraq.
Now, it seems, it has done him good service in aggravating the
United States and its one-time allies as they struggle to keep him
in the corner where they put him after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it seems, there are mostly divisions in the
complicated apparatus designed to prevent him from acquiring new
weapons of mass destruction or the economic power with which to
develop them.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the transatlantic and Arab coalition that once fought
him often seem at odds with each other _ so much so that they have
not yet been able to force him down from his latest efforts to
wriggle out of arms-control inspections. The Security Council,
which enforces economic sanctions against Iraq, has been tied into
knots as a result. And the bureaucrats charged with administering
sanctions have begun to bicker among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this means that Saddam has freed himself either of
the sanctions imposed on him after the war, or of limits on his
ability to produce weapons. However clever he has been in
exploiting divisions among the forces arrayed against him, he still
has not converted his tactical maneuvers into a lasting turnabout
in his fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States, his principal adversary, shows no sign of
relenting in its refusal to re-admit him to the company of
civilized rulers.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, two schools of thought seem to have
emerged from the West's tepid response to Saddam's latest
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   One holds that Saddam stands on the brink of a major breakout
into new power, with the sanctions regime moribund and the
arms-limitation regime collapsing. The other holds that even
without effective arms inspection, Saddam will be little threat
because he is still under the West's stern watch and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the real prospect may be for something quite different:
Continued slow and disconcerting Iraqi gains in the face of Western
disunity, followed by tactical maneuvering by the United States
aimed at frustrating Iraq all the same. And, in the process, a lot
of confusion about who is really winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the situation now. Since August, Saddam has halted all
new arms inspections by the United Nations Special Commission. U.S.
officials, who have not responded with military threats, fear he
may freeze monitoring, and he has hinted his next step may be to
throw arms inspectors out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet response this time stands in contrast to what happened
in February, when Saddam suspended inspections of his presidential
palaces and was forced to back down by U.S. military threats. But
that very experience that helps explain why the response is so
muted now. The lesson drawn here seems to have been not so much
what was gained by resisting Saddam so boldly, but what it cost,
both in bargaining power (he got a doubling of the quota of oil he
could export in exchange for food) and in unity.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Saddam extracted the direct involvement of U.N.
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan as a new layer of officialdom
with whom to deal, between him and the arms-control officials. And
the United States and Britain were deeply impressed by how little
their arguments for using force had moved the other three permanent
members of the Security Council, Russia, France and China, let
alone the Arab countries and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there were divisions within the coalition that
fought Saddam in 1990, and Saddam had only to wait for a new chance
to exploit them.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what he did. His next move was made when Washington
was distracted by a sex scandal, Europeans were up in arms at
American use of sanctions against Cuba and Iran, and Arabs were
seething over the stalled progress toward an Israeli-Palestinian
peace.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, U.S. officials turned out to be more
sensitive to keeping the Russians and French on board than to any
effort to contain Saddam, even if that meant watering down the
effort itself.
</P>
<P>
   So while this allowed Saddam to challenge the arms inspectors,
there is also cause for some frustration among Saddam's
representatives here; the West was not split as it was last time,
and Iraq is no closer to an end of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, new frictions have begun to show.
</P>
<P>
   At the arms-control agency, the forceful Australian diplomat who
has been its leader, Richard Butler, now finds himself not so much
an accuser as the accused. One of the agency's chief inspectors, a
former U.S. marine named Scott Ritter, has quit, saying Butler and
company have gone soft on Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, France and China, on the other hand, continue to say
Butler's agency has been too hard on the Iraqis. In the absence of
an ability to corner the Iraqis with intrusive surprise
inspections, the agency has taken to telegraphing its punches for
publicity effect.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, another U.N. agency charged with distributing food in
Iraq also imploded in controversy. Denis Halliday, who managed the
U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq, resigned in anger, calling the
sanctions regime a cruel farce that was destroying the Iraqi people
while leaving the leadership intact.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, this pitted a U.N. humanitarian-aid official against
the organization's arms-control officials, for whom maintaining
sanctions is the key to keeping pressure on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, some Middle East experts say the initiative
clearly has passed to the Iraqis. ``They are setting the agenda,''
said Judith Kipper of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. ``They cause armies to move or withdraw,
they sell oil, they have allies in the Security Council and in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   What comes next? A senior Iraqi official gave this answer: Iraq
will further erode the sanctions and create more confrontations.
``We can choose where,'' the official said. ``We know the United
States wants to keep the sanctions forever, but how much is it
willing to pay for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more than the Iraqis think. ``I would say Iraq has changed
the ground rules of the game,'' said an ambassador from an Arab
country that was in the 1991 coalition. ``But is there light at the
end of the tunnel? Not as long as Saddam is there, because the
United States has built him into public enemy No. 1 and the
Americans too cannot climb down.'' &QL;

AT THE OK CORRAL, THEY MYTHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
Allen Barra is the author of ``Inventing Wyatt Earp,'' Carroll &AMP;
Graf, 1998. 
(bl) 
 By ALLEN BARRA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred sixteen years ago last Monday, at about 2:47 in the
afternoon, Virgil, Wyatt and Morgan Earp, accompanied by a young,
tubercular dentist-gambler from Georgia named John Henry (Doc)
Holliday, turned left off Fremont Street (now Highway 80) in the
sprawling silver-boom camp of Tombstone, Ariz., and into a vacant
lot in back of the OK Corral. Virgil Earp, the town marshal, said,
``Boys, throw up your hands _ I want your guns,'' after which two
quick shots were heard. Thirty seconds later, every man in the
fight was dead or wounded except Wyatt Earp.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfight in back of the OK Corral has become part of
American mythology _ even an enduring international symbol of
American confrontation. In July, The Toronto Star cautioned General
Motors and the United Auto Workers that ``both could learn a lesson
or two from the gunfight at the OK Corral.'' And in August a
Singapore paper warned that ``a trigger-happy America, blazing away
to glory like Wyatt Earp at the OK Corral, inspires no confidence
in its role as global policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, international symbol may not completely capture the
gunfight's hold on the popular imagination: In an episode of ``Star
Trek,'' Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock were forced to fight the Earps
at the OK Corral. Kirk, it seems, must have landed on Planet
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   All of which belies the gunfight itself, which wasn't that big a
deal, after all.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was, the Earp brothers went down to the lot to
arrest Ike and Billy Clanton and Frank and Tom McLaury, four men
affiliated with a group of cow thieves known as ``the Cowboys.''
(The term was new in the early 1880s and suggested a degree of
rascality.)
</P>
<P>
   Trouble had been brewing between the Earps and Cowboys for two
years _ the rustlers had been stealing cattle in Mexico and
murdering with impunity _ but the immediate cause of the fight was
a deal that Wyatt Earp made with Ike Clanton. Some of Ike's friends
killed a stagecoach driver during an attempted holdup; Wyatt, who
wanted to seek the lucrative office of county sheriff, thought
their capture would win him votes. Ike wanted the reward but
panicked when word got out that he had made a deal with Wyatt Earp.
He probably instigated the fight by goading his younger brother and
the McLaurys into confronting the Earps.
</P>
<P>
   That the fight became legendary astonished Wyatt Earp, a buffalo
hunter, gambler, shotgun guard, saloon keeper, boxing referee, faro
dealer and peace officer, who was born 150 years ago and died in
Los Angeles in 1929. The Tombstone gunfight was his first and only
classic, face-to-face shootout. In cowtowns like Dodge City, he was
renowned for his ability to keep the peace without firing a gun;
the men he killed in the lot in Tombstone may have been the first
he ever shot.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death, Wyatt Earp's image has gone through three
phases.
</P>
<P>
   First, in the 1930s, he was evoked as an antidote to big city
gangsters like Al Capone and Dutch Schultz. In the second, from
about the end of World War II through the Eisenhower era, he stood
for America's Cold War resolve, holding the thin blue line in
defense of democratic ideals. By the late 1960s, his name was
linked with predatory white America. In a 1971 film, ``Doc,'' a
Vietnam War allegory with a script by Pete Hamill, Wyatt was a
sadistic bully who made Lyndon Johnson-type speeches over murdered
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The real Wyatt Earp was an adventurer. He and Josephine Sarah
Marcus, a Jewish actress from New York whom Wyatt met in Tombstone,
roamed boomtowns and mining camps from Arizona to Alaska, making
and losing fortunes, finally settling in Los Angeles into genteel
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   They were together for nearly 47 years. Earp was a minor
celebrity in his later years, lionized by the likes of Jack London,
Charlie Chaplin, John Ford, William S. Hart and Tom Mix, on whose
films he did some advisory work.
</P>
<P>
   But Wyatt couldn't escape the memory of the gunfight in
Tombstone. He still hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Why did history and Hollywood choose to make the gunfight at the
OK Corral immortal? A partial answer is that Americans have always
looked to the West _ to the Alamo, to Custer's Last Stand, to the
OK Corral _ for defining moments in the national character.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that, in time, post-Marx historians saw the Earps and
the Cowboys as representatives of opposing cultural and political
forces. The Earps were Republicans who worked for Eastern
capitalists like Wells Fargo _ in the words of one sociologist,
``incorporation gunfighters'' _ while the Cowboys were ``resistance
gunfighters'' of ``Southern Democratic values,'' if values can be
stretched to include cattle and stagecoach theft.
</P>
<P>
   There were also issues of jurisdiction that echo to this day.
Who had the authority _ Town Marshal Virgil Earp (also a deputy
U.S. marshal) or County Sheriff John Behan, a political rival to
the Earps and an ally of the Cowboys? (To add spice to the debate,
Josephine Marcus had left Behan for Wyatt before the gunfight.) The
Earps, as the only federal law in their part of the Arizona
Territory, were regarded by many locals with the same contempt that
right-wing Westerners still hold for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Why Wyatt Earp has been singled out is a more complex question.
The answer may have less to do with the gunfight than with what
followed it. In retaliation for the Tombstone fight, Virgil and
Morgan were ambushed, and Morgan was killed. Wyatt then formed a
posse and hunted down the assassins, bringing back no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   He never apologized for his actions and died without finishing
his autobiography. Ever since, people have been trying to claim him
for their own and put words in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, a former press secretary to Teddy Roosevelt named
Stuart Lake published the hugely successful ``Wyatt Earp: Frontier
Marshal.'' About half of it was fiction and the other half
exaggerated truth, which would prove to be more truth than most
subsequent books on Earp. And the best-selling Earp book of recent
years, ``I Married Wyatt Earp,'' supposedly the memoirs of
Josephine Marcus and currently in print from the University of
Arizona Press, is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax.
(Her real unfinished memoirs remain unpublished.)
</P>
<P>
   But nothing would have struck Wyatt Earp as odder than the way
people have used his name to push an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Pat Buchanan kicked off his 1996 presidential campaign
by posing with guns and gun belt in front of the OK Corral. It's a
good thing for Buchanan that Earp wasn't at his media bash. He
might have hauled him off to court for violating local gun control
laws.

   English Court Blocks Pinochet Extradition
</P>
<P>
   An international effort to hold Gen. Augusto Pinochet
accountable for the more than 3,000 people who died during his
17-year rule in Chile was blocked in London. England's High Court
ruled that he could not be extradited to Spain to face charges of
genocide and torture because he is immune from prosecution as a
former head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The court granted bail to the 82-year-old general, but ordered
him to remain in a London hospital pending an appeal by prosecutors
next week. He had been arrested Oct. 16 after a Spanish judge
investigating human rights abuses in Chile in the 1970s and 1980s
sought his extradition to Madrid.

   Piazza Sets the Bar At $91 Million  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is Mike Piazza worth $91 million? The New York Mets fervently
hope so. They signed the catcher to a seven-year contract that made
him the highest-paid baseball player ever _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not successful here, it's tough,'' the former
Dodger said. ``But when you win here, it's twice as good as
anyplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets then committed $32 million more to sign Al Leiter,
their lefthanded pitching ace, for four years. Leiter grew up in
New Jersey rooting for the Mets, but he began his career as a New
York Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yankees centerfielder Bernie Williams wants a bigger
deal than Piazza's and has entered the free agent market to get it.

   AIDS Virus Resurges When Drugs Are Cut Back
</P>
<P>
   Scientists announced bad news for people infected with the AIDS
virus who had hoped to escape the drug ``cocktail,'' a prescription
of 20 to 30 pills a day that can cost $15,000 a year and that is
causing unusual and dangerous side effects in more and more
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Two new studies, published in The New England Journal of
Medicine, showed that efforts to help patients by reducing the
number of medications in the cocktail backfired, allowing
resurgence of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers said that efforts to simplify the treatment must
continue, because the strict schedule of doses is hard to follow,
and in some people, the drugs cause dangerously high cholesterol
and terribly disfiguring fat deposits in the neck and abdomen.

   Modern No Longer, Four Drawings Are Evicted
</P>
<P>
   When she died in 1948, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller left four
important drawings _ two by van Gogh and two by Seurat _ to the
Museum of Modern Art in New York but with an unusual stipulation.
As one of the founders of the Modern, she believed passionately
that the museum should be devoted exclusively to art of the new. So
after 50 years the drawings were to go to rival institutions with
collections from many eras.
</P>
<P>
   Time was up this month, and two drawings by van Gogh, ``Hospital
Corridor at St.-Remy'' and ``Street at Stes.-Maries'' went to the
Metropolitan Museum. The two Seurats, ``Lady With a Parasol'' and
``Young Girl,'' were delivered to the Art Institute of Chicago.
Both Seurats are studies for the artist's masterpiece ``Sunday
Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,'' which hangs in the
Art Institute.

   Apparent Starr Leaks Cited  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Newly released documents showed that a federal judge has ruled
that prosecutors in the office of Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel investigating President Clinton, apparently leaked grand
jury testimony or other secret information. The ruling by U.S.
District Court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson was based on a review
of 24 news accounts about the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson authorized an investigator, who is looking into
the matter to seize and examine the prosecutors' telephone records
and logs along with their appointment calendars, memos and other
documents to determine if they leaked information to the press.

   U.S. Ex-Sergeant Charged In Bin Laden Conspiracy
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said secret charges have been filed
against a former sergeant in the United States Special Forces who
is suspected of joining a global campaign to attack Americans
mounted by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile.
</P>
<P>
   The former sergeant, Ali A. Mohamed, was charged in September at
a closed court hearing in Manhattan, according to the officials,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The charges are part of an
effort by federal authorities to prove that bin Laden was behind
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in August. Mohamed, 46,
served at the Army's Special Forces base in Fort Bragg, N.C., and
was honorably discharged in 1989.

   Wrapping up more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era

unveiled 3,500 pages of its final report, finding that the
overwhelming blame for human rights abuses lay with the former
white supremacist government.
</P>

   But the report did not let the liberation movement off the hook.
It found that anti-apartheid activists also had to take
responsibility for a range of brutalities from torturing suspected

   Yeltsin Skips Summit, Heads for Sanatorium

   Nearly three weeks ago, Russian President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia got bronchitis in Uzbekistan. He rushed home to rest up for
a summit in Vienna with the head of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of his departure, scheduled for last Wednesday,
Yeltsin called in sick again, now with ``asthenia'' _ Russian for

rest. Then comes a vacation. Ordinary Russians yawned; Yeltsin, 67,
has seemed frail and drained ever since August's fiscal crisis
erupted. Aides said Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will mind the

   The promoters, mostly little-known individuals working from

   In the Land of the Cracked Head
</P>
<P>
   Italian mothers, who run screaming into the ocean to pluck out
children who dare to swim less than an hour after lunch, seem to
lose all their caution once they hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from uncommon in Rome to see a mother speeding her
child to school on a moped, neither of them wearing helmets.
</P>
<P>
   The logic is impeccable. It is illegal to carry children on
mopeds, so manufacturers do not make child-sized helmets. Ergo,
parents drive their children bareheaded. ``In this city,'' Federica
Frontani, 31, explained, ``what else can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Mopeds are a national addiction, a way of beating the snarled
traffic that clogs Rome and most other major cities. Businessmen,
teen-agers and mothers all drive them, and precious few wear
helmets, which seem to clash with the country's highly tuned sense
of style.
</P>
<P>
   The government is hoping to pass a new law soon that would
require all moped drivers _ not just minors under the age of 18 _
to wear helmets. But law-enforcement experts are pessimistic that
Italians will obey it. Other safety rules in Italy are routinely
flouted: Only 10 percent of Italians obey the law and buckle their
seat belts, whereas 92 percent of Germans do.

   Not Happy? Just Wait.
</P>
<P>
   Ha! Those twentysomethings thought the world was their own
private banana split, didn't they _ with their perfect skin,
functioning knees and forests of silky hair. They thought the
over-50 set was just drooling with envy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what: Youth just might not buy you happiness after
all.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by two Fordham University scientists, Dr. Daniel
Mroczek and Christian Kolarz, suggests that as people age, they get
steadily more cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which looked at people aged 25 to 74 and appears in
the November issue of the Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology, found that the rise in good spirits was especially
strong in men.
</P>
<P>
   So is it simply that older people who lived through World War
II, and perhaps the Depression, might treasure peace and
prosperity? That might be part of it. Or maybe the older
generation, resisting the current mania to tell all, keeps some
sadness private.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Laura Carstensen, a Stanford University psychologist,
says it could well be that older people have become good at
regulating their emotions. ``There is an appreciation of life,''
she said, ``that is associated with a sense of well-being and
satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   So the youngsters, as they dance the gloomy night away, will
just have to wait patiently for that glorious day when their hair
falls out too.

   Millions of sports addicts tune into ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' for
their daily fix of highlights, but it's a good bet not all of them
fully understand everything the anchors say.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on popular culture, inside jokes and hip-hop lingo,
``SportsCenter,'' which airs live three times nightly on the
24-hour sports cable network, has helped create a rich, arcane new
sports vernacular _ from Dan Patrick's ``He's en fuego'' to Rich
Eisen's ``He busts out the whuppin' stick!'' to Rece Davis' ``No
soup for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone, Mel Allen's ``How about that?''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of catch phrases has helped make ESPN anchors
stars in their own right. There is even a fan-generated web site,
``The SportsCenter Altar'' (address at the end of this article),
which lists each anchor's trademark lines, with a link to another
site that allows fellow worshippers to download the actual audio.
</P>
<P>
   What do the catch phrases mean? Where did they come from? Here
is a sampling from what could be a modern sports lexicon.

CAN'T WE JUST SKIP NOVEMBER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   November starts out all wrong and then goes downhill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The very first day of the month is a bummer because it's All
Saints Day, which serves no higher purpose than to remind us of our
imperfections. Where is the self-esteem movement when we need it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And all this happens in a misnamed month. The name November
comes from the Latin word for nine, (ital)nove,(end-ital) which
gets applied to the 11th month. Someone can't count too well, and
it's not me. September is the ninth month, but it's already named
for the Latin word for seven, (ital)septem.(end-ital) Which proves
the world is full of goofy stuff that most of us accept without
thinking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, now that I'm already sidetracked here, I may as well
complain a little about the whole concept of months, which is
outdated and in need of a complete overhaul. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Months are based on the length of time the moon takes to revolve
once around the Earth. This is called a synodic month. Remember
that. You might need to know that some day, along with how to find
the square root of a number and the gestation period of an
elephant. Although maybe not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But synodic isn't the only type of month. Oh, no. You've also
got your sidereal month, your tropical month and your draconic (or
nodical) month (you could look them up). And probably you've got
several other kinds of months that the encyclopedia from which I
steal information so I can look smart couldn't bear to describe to
confused devils like me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you add up the time between what scientists (and worse) call
``lunations'' _ that is, the time between, say, successive new
moons _ you end up with a year that, though 12 months long, lasts
only 354 days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's a year that doesn't work out right with your solar-based
year, although if you ask me it's weirdly intriguing that 12 months
calculated by one celestial body would wind up almost equaling 12
months calculated by a wholly different celestial body. I'm sure it
involves some sort of conspiracy, but I've had it up to here with
conspiracies at the moment and have no desire to dig into this one,
no matter who promises to fund the study. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By now I'm so deflected from my original (and quite brilliant)
point about what a doofus month November is that I may not be able
to right this ship. But I'm going to try. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The whole thrust of November is wrong, at least here in the
Northern Hemisphere where I've spent my alleged life. The days get
shorter, the nights longer and the temperatures colder. What's the
sense of any of that? If I were a month and that's the best I could
do, I'd retire _ 401(k) or no 401(k). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   November is also woefully short of major holidays. You've got
Thanksgiving, of course, and I'm all for keeping that, as long as
someone else has to carve the turkey. But name me another good
November holiday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No doubt folks in South Dakota are pretty excited each Nov. 2
about celebrating the anniversary of their state joining the union
in 1889. But it's hard to stir up much interest in that once you
get outside of Yankton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, Nov. 2 is Admission Day for North Dakota, too, but
tell me when you last saw any TV network devote much time to the
annual North Dakota Admission Day parade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is true that there are a few good birthdays to celebrate in
November _ especially Nov. 30, when Mark Twain, Winston Churchill,
Jonathan Swift and Dick Clark all were born. But you counter that
with Nov. 9, the late Spiro T. Agnew's birthday, and it all seems
to come to naught. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So I say we skip November, head right for the December holidays
and try to explain why a month named for the Latin word for 10,
(ital)decem(edd-ital) is 12th. &QL;
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Topsy-turvy world of presidential lawsuits
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has come to this: An old friend from their high school days
is suing President Clinton for slander because he has said he
didn't have sex with her. That's ``didn't,'' as in ``did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers are pleading with the judge either to throw
the suit out like a noisy drunk or at least to revisit the Supreme
Court's ruling that presidents are no better than any other working
stiff and can be sued at will.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, civil suits had to be put off until after the
president left office, which pretty much filtered out the publicity
hounds and political snipers. But last year, the Supreme Court,
establishing that it had lost all contact with reality, and
unanimously at that, held that suits against a president would be
no worse than a small bother.
</P>
<P>
   The small bother of Paula Jones's suit, used to walk the
president into a trap, has now brought Clinton into the impeachment
dock and face to face with the political equivalent of the death
penalty because he was slippin' around on Hillary and told this
little white lie about it. (Oh, all right: this BIG white lie.)
</P>
<P>
   The president's problems are compounded by Kenneth Starr's
successful effort to disarm him in order to attack him the more
freely. Starr won a court ruling that the president can't use White
House counsels in his defense and must hire private lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Starr gets $40 million-plus of your money and mine to go after
Clinton while Clinton has to pauper himself in his defense. Clinton
must by now have run up enough billable hours to capitalize a
fair-sized country. Whenever and however he leaves the White House,
he'll leave worse than broke.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we may ponder the curious claim by Dolly Kyle
Browning that for a president to say he never had sex with her _ at
least for this president to say he never had sex with her _ when
she insists he did amounts to slander. After all, what's Browning?
Chopped liver?
</P>
<P>
   Since folklore now holds that Clinton is one of those guys who
chases every skirt, then, yes, by a goofy syllogism of sorts, it
could be argued that for him to let one pass unpestered amounts to
actionable disdain. What's a poor girl to make of herself and what
will others think of her if she's the only maid left standing at a
bed-a-thon? Oh, the shame of it! And how do you make a career move
out of innocence anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The Browning suit extends the rationale of the Jones suit. Jones
is suing, she says, to clear her name, but Clinton is the only
person in the whole nutty business who has been insisting her name
is unsullied _ that nothing untoward passed between them. It was
the right-wing political buddies of her own later handlers who
dragged Jones's name into play.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones, for vindication, and egged on by her real detractors,
can sue the one man who is insisting she is a good girl, then
Browning has a darned sensible point.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's review and see if we've got all this straight: a
fallen woman is one whose sexual adventures want for willing
corroboration and a cad is a fellow who kisses and tries not to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   Yep. Sounds about right, here in Wonderland.

 &HT;    Building dispute surrounds course Bobby Jones made famous
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week, thousands of golf fans poured into Atlanta
to watch the PGA Tour Championship at the historic East Lake Golf
Club. At the tournament, which wrapped up Sunday, they strolled
along sun-baked zoysia fairways and stood in the dappled shade of
tall oaks dropping golden leaves. It was beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   But East Lake Golf Club is not only one of the finest places in
the world to play and watch golf. It might also be one of the best
locations for contemplating the meaning of money. Wealth and
poverty surround the course; their juxtaposition give the
neighborhood a fascinating history and an inspiring future.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the century, East Lake was the home course of the
legendary Bobby Jones. Three years ago, the course and club
buildings were brought back to their former splendor through the
efforts of local developer and philanthropist Tom Cousins. With the
wealthy again enjoying the course, just 10 minutes east of
downtown, ``East Lake'' is now emblazed on cotton golf shirts
selling for $100.
</P>
<P>
   But for decades, the East Lake name also conjured up images that
had nothing to do with clipped greens and Bermuda roughs. Crime,
violence, drug dealing and despair overshadowed the leafy beauty of
the old neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   When Cousins set out to restore the East Lake Golf Club, he
understood that it would be immoral and shortsighted to try to wall
off the problems surrounding the course. East Lake would get its
good name back only if the whole area became a decent place to
live, work and recreate.
</P>
<P>
   With courage and vision, Cousins created the East Lake Community
Foundation, a charitable group, to spearhead a complex program of
true urban renewal. Working closely with the Atlanta Housing
Authority, the foundation has pushed to replace crime-infested,
failed public housing, called East Lake Meadows, with attractive,
mixed-income housing called the Villages of East Lake. Because the
new housing includes working people who are paying rent, the poorer
residents can see examples of success.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the efforts of AHA and Cousins, longtime homeowners
in the area are seeing property values shoot up. Young people who
thought they'd never get a decent job are making good money as
caddies. Older people are sitting on their front porches again as
the drug dealers move away.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins not only is helping the neighborhood, he is teaching
other affluent people a valuable lesson: Being wealthy is a lot
more fun when you don't have to hide in your house and fear for
your safety. By wisely spreading around a little cash, you can help
create a richer society where urban amenities are safe to use,
property values are secure and future workers have access to good
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a small group that lives in the last of the
decaying East Lake Meadows housing is fighting the effort to
temporarily relocate them. They need to move into other public
housing while their old apartments are razed to make way for new
ones. They filed suit last week to stop the East Lake redevelopment
until AHA meets their demand to build new housing before taking
down the old.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell has promised to try to help settle this
dispute quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Something the last residents of East Lake Meadows need to
realize is that creating wealth is a process of risks and rewards.
They will have to give up the housing they know in the hope that
the new will be better.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins, a millionaire, knows this. He has risked millions of
his own dollars to improve, not only the golf course, but the
community around it. Everyone involved has to do their part, but
they all stand to gain.

 &HT;    Web's the place for the politically astute
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Election Day is here, but there's still time to bone
up on the candidates and the issues on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   All 435 U.S. representatives are up for re-election, and the
outcome of campaigns across the country could impact the makeup of
the House, now Republican-controlled. AllPolitics
(http://www.allpolitics.com or http://www.cnn.com/election/1998),
Time Warner's online political arm, handles election chores with
help from CNN, Time magazine, Congressional Quarterly, The
Associated Press and Reuters. CNN's AllPolitics.com takes an
in-depth look at the election. CNN has devoted more than a thousand
Web pages to election coverage, with analysis of key races. There's
also a wealth of background information and candidate profiles
courtesy of Congressional Quarterly. On election night,
AllPolitics.com will offer up-to-the-minute election returns and
exit polling.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Woelfel, vice president and editor in chief of CNN
Interactive, promises the election night online coverage will be
timely and comprehensive. ``We're drawing upon nearly three years
of covering politics exclusively for the Web. Not only do we have
the best resources, but also we have the most experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Election night is tailor-made for this medium and for AOL,''
said Barry Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services.
``Instead of sitting in front of the television or listening to the
radio for hours waiting for the race you care about to be
mentioned, you can go online, and with a few clicks, you have the
results you want.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL's live coverage begins at 7 p.m. and will continue into the
early morning hours. AOL members will also have a chance to talk
politics live online with guests John Kennedy Jr., Republican
strategist Mary Matalin and ABC News analysts and reporters at
remote locations on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews.com has created a special area of its site called
``Political Nation'' (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .abcnews.com/sections/us
</P>
<P>
   /politicalnation/politicalnation
</P>
<P>
   .html). The site highlights key races around the country. ABC
News has also taken the liberty of handicapping most of the races.
</P>
<P>
   When all the political rhetoric and mumbo-jumbo gets to be a bit
too much, you can always try ``Politically Incorrect'' (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .abc.com/pi/index.html) for a little comic relief. You can check
out host Bill Maher's one-liners, vote on question of the day,
indulge in politically themed games or post your two cents in the
area of the same name. Surprisingly, the postings on the ``PI''
site aren't the usual all-caps Web ranting, but some interesting
comments from political junkies who also appreciate good political
satire.

 &HT;    Magazine provides sneak preview of 'Quake' update
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents don't much care for it, but that hasn't stopped
``Quake'' from being a hit with male children of all ages. Now the
third version of the gory shoot-'em-up is set for release, and the
November issue of PC Gamer has a sneak preview. The preview
includes 13 pages of inside information and screen shots from the
game. This version of ``Quake'' promises to be controversial.
Publisher id Software decided to try something new and focus on
just the DeathMatch part of the game. This version also will
emphasize multiplayer gaming over the Internet, says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Online is going Hollywood. ``You've Got Mail,'' a new film
starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, is about a couple that romance
each other through cyberspace. Learn all about this new movie in
the November issue of Yahoo! Internet Life. The magazine features
an interview with Hanks about the movie. Says Hanks, now hooked on
cyberspace, ``I'd throw my phone away if I could. E-mail is a much
better way of communicating.''
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   PurpleMoon has released the latest title in its series about a
middle school girl and her friends. This one is called ``Rockett's
Adventure Maker'' and once again stars eighth-grader Rockett
Movado. In this title, kids create their own characters and place
them in a story. Kids choose from five body types, 25 faces, eight
skin tones and 30 hairstyles. There are also 32 backgrounds, 60
props and 14 speech and thought bubbles from which kids can create
adventures for their characters. ``Adventure Maker'' retails for
$29.95 and is available for both Windows and PowerPC Macs.

   In this time of financial turmoil, it's more important than ever
to investigate stocks before buying. That's especially true of
initial public offerings, or IPOs, which were among the hottest
sectors of the market until lately. There's no better place to
research an IPO than on the Net. Begin your research at Hoover's
IPO Central, a site dedicated to in-depth research of companies
going public. It holds, for example, thousands of profiles of IPO
companies, both past and present. There's also a primer on how to
judge an IPO. You'll find the site at http://www.ipocentral.com.

 &HT;    New battery packs refillable
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A cellular phone without a battery is like a doughnut
without its hole. Maybe that's overstating things a bit, but
batteries are crucial.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of making batteries that last longer, Duracell
recently rolled out its Ultra line of refillable alkaline battery
packs.
</P>
<P>
   The new packs use AA- and AAA-size batteries. The packs are
billed as having 50 percent more life than standard alkaline
batteries. For cellular phones, that means more than 100 more
minutes of talking time, or up to 50 more two-minute phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The batteries fit more than 60 percent of the phones on the
market, including Motorola's StarTAC and MicroTAC series, the Nokia
918 and 2100 series, the Qualcomm QCP820 series, and the Ericsson
200 and 300 series.
</P>
<P>
   The packs also can be used in digital and flash cameras,
minidisc players and
</P>
<P>
   camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   The packs, which retail for about $20, eliminate the need for a
charger or car adapter. They are on sale in stores where batteries
are usually sold.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the cheesy
</P>
<P>
   If your taste in movies runs similar to your taste in pizza,
there's a new Web site for you: http://www.b-movie.com celebrates
``the art and the industry'' of low-budget, cheesy B-movies.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the site is kicking off its first round of
inductions into its B-Movie Hall of Fame. Honorees were selected
from more than 1,000 nominations submitted by movie fans from
around the world. Participants selected their favorite films and
actors.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated B-movie actors include: The Bowery Boys, Bela Lugosi,
Ronald Reagan, Nancy Davis and John Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated B-Movies include: ``Blood of Jesus,'' ``Death Race
2000,'' ``The Leopard Man'' and ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   Voicing your opinion
</P>
<P>
   If you're the type who likes to voice your opinion on anything
and everything, but your friends and neighbors already have heard
it all, there's a Web site that might be your online haven.
</P>
<P>
   The site, http://www.sundbergf.com, is from SundbergFerar, a
Michigan-based firm that asks people their likes and dislikes about
the products they buy.
</P>
<P>
   This month's question: What do you think of your cordless drill?
</P>
<P>
   The information gathered is used to educate companies about how
their stuff is received. People who post responses have the option
of checking a box that ensures the name and information won't be
given to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get consumers to realize their voice is really
important in the product process,'' said spokesman Mark Powers.
``Without the input, some companies are really missing the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Combination deal
</P>
<P>
   Sony is pushing its minidisc hard this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The MD Bundle 5 combines the minidisc home recorder with a
portable minidisc player and a home minidisc player _ all for $350.
</P>
<P>
   The bundled package is designed to bring first-time users to the
minidisc way of thinking. The package features an MDS-JE320 home
recording deck, an MZ-E40 portable MD player and two 60-minute
MDW-60A recordable minidiscs. The MDS-JE320 home deck offers Wide
Bit Stream technology, which is designed to reproduce soft,
low-level music. A separate jog dial for text entry and track
selection is available for an estimated retail price of $199.
</P>
<P>
   The portable part of the package is a machine that weighs 10.6
ounces, including the headphone and batteries, and can fit in your
pocket. It takes two AA batteries, which provide four hours of
power. The machine also features a 10-second memory to make sure
any bumps or jolts don't interrupt the listening pleasure. The
totable unit's LCD readout lists battery life, track title, track
number and play mode. The minidisc format lets you add, erase, move
and mix tracks at the push of a button. According to Sony, the
minidiscs themselves can be re-recorded more than a million times,
with no loss of sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   Sony gives you three extra recordable minidiscs (a $15 value)
with each purchase of a minidisc player or recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Small-cap investors' site
</P>
<P>
   Next Wave Stocks, an online magazine designed for the investor
interested in small-cap stocks (companies with market
capitalization of less than $500 million), has started a Web site
for small-cap investors.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at http://www.nextwavestocks.com, bills itself as the
only barometer for small-cap technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Small-cap stocks took some of the biggest hits during the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Next Wave 100 composite index dropped 28.4 percent during
that time. The index of small-cap companies is made up of
information technology companies, technology manufacturing and
biotech.

 &HT;    Language tutor CDs lose a lot in translation
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surely all of us, at one time or another, have wondered how it
would be to have our consciousness transplanted into that of
another, to see and understand from the viewpoint of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   My encounters with software conceived and whelped in France lead
me to believe that entering the mind of a Gallic software designer
would be like walking into a carnival funhouse for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   What got me into this train of thought is a product called Tell
Me More from Auralog, which is at once the most creative and the
most useless language tutor I have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Tell Me More is a voice-recognition program that comes in
several languages; I looked at the Spanish version. It comes with
the mandatory headset (microphone and earphones), a couple of
manuals which are of only occasional help, and three CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides almost every approach to language
comprehension you can imagine. The main screen is a scene full of
hotspots (remember Microsoft Bob?) leading you to to these various
approaches. Click on the notebook and you get the exercises. Among
the possible exercises are word associations, word order, filling
in the blanks in sentences, Hangman, a chance to take dictation,
associating words with pictures, and a crossword.
</P>
<P>
   All these are in Spanish. In other words, in filling in the
blanks, you get a sentence in Spanish and a set of words in
Spanish, from which you must choose the proper word to complete the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kinda tough if you don't know Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you go to the glossary and the grammar book. The
glossary is straightfoward and useful; it gives you a translation
of a Spanish word and a pronunciation of it. The grammar book, on
the other hand, is useless. For example, it attempts to demonstrate
the proper use of the word ``esta'' by using it in a series of
sentences _ none of which is translated.
</P>
<P>
   For further frustration, you can click on dialogue, which takes
you to a picture and a set of sentences. Another sentence is spoken
to you. You are supposed to select and utter the proper response.
</P>
<P>
   In some of these sections you can right-click on a word and get
some options such as a translation or pronunciation. The procedure
is, however, slow and cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   What is utterly lacking in Tell Me More is any kind of cohesion
and direction. There is no step-by-step plan for learning, no sense
of ``Do this lesson and it will prepare you for that one.'' You
apparently are expected simply to jump off into the deep end and
sink or swim.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know a good many Spanish words already, you'd
better take a life preserver with you.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear to me _ si, claro _ the French do not think the same
way I do. At least not the folks at 12 avenue Jean Bart, in Voisins
le Bretonneux.
</P>
<P>
   While we are on the subject of voice recognition, I took a look
at IBM's latest version, ViaVoice Executive 98. It terms of its
breadth, it is much improved. But in the critical area _ how well
it recognized my voice _ I can see no significant improvement. Once
again, I must conclude the time of the voice-recognition program
has not yet arrived.

 &HT;    Emission waiver lets drivers off the hook
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I recently attended a public hearing held by the
Georgia Environmental Protection Division. The turnout was small _
a handful of auto industry representatives and state bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   We in the auto repair industry weren't required to be there. We
didn't go because the subject matter was especially spectacular.
The agenda item we had come to hear and object to was the extension
of the $200 waiver limit for vehicles failing the metro area's
emission test _ and continuing to contribute to the deterioration
of Atlanta's air quality.
</P>
<P>
   The waiver limit means cars that fail the state's emission test
can be granted a waiver _ and permission to get new tags for two
years _ if the owner spends at least $200 fixing the car and it
shows some improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the limit _ meaning the owner has to spend more money on
the car before it is granted a waiver _ will be better for everyone
in the long run. Let me explain.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone failing an emissions inspection must attempt to have
their vehicle repaired to comply with specific emissions standards.
After repairs are made, the car must show an improvement in the
emission of certain gases without adversely affecting the other
tailpipe readings. If the customer has spent more than $200 in
emission-related repairs and the vehicle's tailpipe readings meet
the above criteria, the vehicle may qualify for a waiver even
though it actually fails the test.
</P>
<P>
   This waiver enables the owner to register the vehicle, and it
will not need to be retested for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   When the new state testing program started in October 1996, the
$200 limit was put in place for the first two years only. This
arrangement was intended to give the public, time to adjust to the
test and to begin bringing vehicles into compliance. The emissions
standards would get stricter, as would the testing procedure for
older vehicles. They had to.
</P>
<P>
   The old emissions program, with its $50 repair limit, had
virtually no effect on improving Atlanta's air quality. In fact,
according to the Environmental Protection Division statistics, 1998
was one of the worst years for ground level ozone. The metro area
was in compliance with federal standards on 22 days. While the
weather and other variables can increase or decrease the problem,
the one constant factor has been the steady increase in pollution
from cars.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the automotive repair industry realized that the
current system was flawed by the constraints placed upon them. A
primary issue was the public perception that $200 in repairs would
``get them a sticker.''
</P>
<P>
   It was common knowledge that a large percentage of the cars on
the road were in despicable states of repair that $200 would not
begin to fix. The public also discovered this as it bounced back
and forth between retests and repairs with the costs escalating
each time.
</P>
<P>
   However, the $200 figure stuck in their minds, and any repairs
costing more began to fuel tempers. The repair industry has been
eager for the ceiling to be raised so it could get down to the
business of fixing cars without having to haggle over an
unrealistic price limit.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners have invested thousands of dollars in equipment
to meet the needs of the program. While early concerns that there
wouldn't be enough test lanes were quickly dispelled, a new element
has begun to emerge: a shortage of mechanics with the skills to
repair emissions failures.
</P>

industry, is an automotive instructor and an ASE master automobile

 &HT;    Once you add the necessities, G3 is a better buy than iMac
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No question about it. The iMac is one sharp-looking
computer. But is it a good buy? I'd argue not. A better investment
would be any of Apple Computer's G3 desktop models.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before you start flaming me with e-mail charges of
betrayal, let me explain. I consider the iMac a good, if not great,
computer. It works reasonably well, has a brilliantly sharp screen
and, of course, there's that striking bondi translucent body.
</P>
<P>
   But a computer is a lot more than looks. It needs to work out of
the box with existing software and devices like printers. It is
here the iMac falls short. In addition, the iMac really costs more
than its listed price. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there's no internal floppy drive. Apple Computer's
Steve Jobs doesn't think you need or want one. But I doubt few of
you can get by without a floppy drive. How better to save and carry
all those little files you create day in and out?
</P>
<P>
   That means you'll have to buy a floppy, and there's only one
available that works with the iMac. It's called the Imation
SuperDisk and sells for about $150. Adding an Imation drive raises
the price of the iMac to $1,450.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more
</P>
<P>
   That's still a good price _ but wait, you're not done yet. The
iMac's 32 megabytes of internal memory, or RAM, is inadequate to
run most of today's multimedia games, supposedly one of this
computer's strengths. You'll need to at least double the iMac's
RAM, which adds another $100 to $200 to the price.
</P>
<P>
   Don't close your wallet yet, especially if you'd like to print
anything from the iMac. It uses a new standard for connecting
peripheral devices, and your old printer won't work. That means you
either have to buy a new printer, for $270, or a special device
that will connect the iMac to old printers. Those devices range in
price from $40 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the iMac is not as inexpensive as Apple Computer would
have you believe. Its true price runs between $1,700 and $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   For that, you might as well buy a G3 desktop or PowerBook. Both
of them cost about the same and come with everything you need right
out of the box.

 &HT;    It's time to start over with a lean, mean Net browser
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not too many years ago, a good friend gave me one of
those fancy Swiss Army knives. It was a marvel (probably still is,
but it's lost in the clutter now, or perhaps has escaped back to
Switzerland).
</P>
<P>
   It contained a magnifying glass, two different kinds of
screwdrivers, a small saw, three or four knife blades, a fingernail
clipper, scissors, a hole punch and even a toothpick. All of them
worked, after a fashion, and none of them worked very well. If you
really needed a screwdriver or scissors, it was nothing like having
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I download a new version of Netscape Communicator or
Microsoft Internet Explorer _ the two most popular programs for
browsing the World Wide Web _ I think of that knife. The
competition has gotten so heated between the two Web browsers that
each tries hard to outdo the other by loading in new features.
There are so many I truly can't remember what all of them do. And
since I don't use them, I never get reminded.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I can zip through the menus of Netscape Communicator and
find a way to design a Web page from scratch, or read postings in
the newsgroups, or send e-mail, join a chat group on the Net or
fire up AOL's Instant Messager to locate a friend online and send a
message. It's the same with Internet Explorer. Each time one
browser adds a new feature, the other duplicates that feature and
adds two additional ones.
</P>
<P>
   But all I want to do is browse the Web. That, after all, is why
I have the Web browser in the first place. When I want to send
e-mail, I use a program made to do that (in my case, Eudora Pro)
much better than a Web browser. When I want to browse the
newsgroups, I fire up NewsXpress. Dedicated programs truly do a
better job than a Swiss Army knife program.
</P>
<P>
   At first, all this feature-packing seems harmless. After all, in
the screwy world of Internet commerce, both Microsoft and Netscape
give these products away. You can download either program
(Netscape: http://home.netscape.com or Explorer:
http://www.microsoft.com) directly from the Internet without paying
a cent.
</P>
<P>
   But when you do, you'll find out one of the many reasons I wish
these companies would get out of the Swiss Army knife business and
back into the honorable business of creating a way to browse the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm spoiled by the high-speed T1 data line I use at work
when connecting to the Internet. It's like driving on the Autobahn
on a day when the traffic is light. But when I get home and use my
56k bps analog modem and the telephone lines, downloads crawl. And
both Internet Explorer and Netscape are huge. To give you a notion,
the full version of Netscape Communicator is more than 14
megabytes. That's bigger than the first hard drive I owned, back in
the dark ages.
</P>
<P>
   Since you fight both relatively slow download speeds and heavy
traffic at these sites, the download often gets painfully slow,
with speeds dipping well below the rated speed of most modems. I've
literally seen downloads that took hours.
</P>
<P>
   And if your Internet connection is at all shaky, you could have
the painful experience of waiting an hour or so for the download to
finish and _ at the last minute _ losing the connection. You have
to start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I wish Microsoft and Netscape would do. Start all
over again and build a browser that is lean and mean.

 &HT;    Web's the place for the politically astute
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Election Day is here, but there's still time to bone
up on the candidates and the issues on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   All 435 U.S. representatives are up for re-election, and the
outcome of campaigns across the country could impact the makeup of
the House, now Republican-controlled. AllPolitics
(http://www.allpolitics.com or http://www.cnn.com/election/1998),
Time Warner's online political arm, handles election chores with
help from CNN, Time magazine, Congressional Quarterly, The
Associated Press and Reuters. CNN's AllPolitics.com takes an
in-depth look at the election. CNN has devoted more than a thousand
Web pages to election coverage, with analysis of key races. There's
also a wealth of background information and candidate profiles
courtesy of Congressional Quarterly. On election night,
AllPolitics.com will offer up-to-the-minute election returns and
exit polling.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Woelfel, vice president and editor in chief of CNN
Interactive, promises the election night online coverage will be
timely and comprehensive. ``We're drawing upon nearly three years
of covering politics exclusively for the Web. Not only do we have
the best resources, but also we have the most experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Election night is tailor-made for this medium and for AOL,''
said Barry Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services.
``Instead of sitting in front of the television or listening to the
radio for hours waiting for the race you care about to be
mentioned, you can go online, and with a few clicks, you have the
results you want.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL's live coverage begins at 7 p.m. and will continue into the
early morning hours. AOL members will also have a chance to talk
politics live online with guests John Kennedy Jr., Republican
strategist Mary Matalin and ABC News analysts and reporters at
remote locations on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews.com has created a special area of its site called
``Political Nation'' (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .abcnews.com/sections/us
</P>
<P>
   /politicalnation/politicalnation
</P>
<P>
   .html). The site highlights key races around the country. ABC
News has also taken the liberty of handicapping most of the races.
</P>
<P>
   When all the political rhetoric and mumbo-jumbo gets to be a bit
too much, you can always try ``Politically Incorrect'' (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .abc.com/pi/index.html) for a little comic relief. You can check
out host Bill Maher's one-liners, vote on question of the day,
indulge in politically themed games or post your two cents in the
area of the same name. Surprisingly, the postings on the ``PI''
site aren't the usual all-caps Web ranting, but some interesting
comments from political junkies who also appreciate good political
satire.

 &HT;    Magazine provides sneak preview of 'Quake' update
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents don't much care for it, but that hasn't stopped
``Quake'' from being a hit with male children of all ages. Now the
third version of the gory shoot-'em-up is set for release, and the
November issue of PC Gamer has a sneak preview. The preview
includes 13 pages of inside information and screen shots from the
game. This version of ``Quake'' promises to be controversial.
Publisher id Software decided to try something new and focus on
just the DeathMatch part of the game. This version also will
emphasize multiplayer gaming over the Internet, says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Online is going Hollywood. ``You've Got Mail,'' a new film
starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, is about a couple that romance
each other through cyberspace. Learn all about this new movie in
the November issue of Yahoo! Internet Life. The magazine features
an interview with Hanks about the movie. Says Hanks, now hooked on
cyberspace, ``I'd throw my phone away if I could. E-mail is a much
better way of communicating.''
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   PurpleMoon has released the latest title in its series about a
middle school girl and her friends. This one is called ``Rockett's
Adventure Maker'' and once again stars eighth-grader Rockett
Movado. In this title, kids create their own characters and place
them in a story. Kids choose from five body types, 25 faces, eight
skin tones and 30 hairstyles. There are also 32 backgrounds, 60
props and 14 speech and thought bubbles from which kids can create
adventures for their characters. ``Adventure Maker'' retails for
$29.95 and is available for both Windows and PowerPC Macs.

</P>
<P>
   In this time of financial turmoil, it's more important than ever
to investigate stocks before buying. That's especially true of
initial public offerings, or IPOs, which were among the hottest
sectors of the market until lately. There's no better place to
research an IPO than on the Net. Begin your research at Hoover's
IPO Central, a site dedicated to in-depth research of companies
going public. It holds, for example, thousands of profiles of IPO
companies, both past and present. There's also a primer on how to
judge an IPO. You'll find the site at http://www.ipocentral.com.

 &HT;    New battery packs refillable
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A cellular phone without a battery is like a doughnut
without its hole. Maybe that's overstating things a bit, but
batteries are crucial.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of making batteries that last longer, Duracell
recently rolled out its Ultra line of refillable alkaline battery
packs.
</P>
<P>
   The new packs use AA- and AAA-size batteries. The packs are
billed as having 50 percent more life than standard alkaline
batteries. For cellular phones, that means more than 100 more
minutes of talking time, or up to 50 more two-minute phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The batteries fit more than 60 percent of the phones on the
market, including Motorola's StarTAC and MicroTAC series, the Nokia
918 and 2100 series, the Qualcomm QCP820 series, and the Ericsson
200 and 300 series.
</P>
<P>
   The packs also can be used in digital and flash cameras,
minidisc players and
</P>
<P>
   camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   The packs, which retail for about $20, eliminate the need for a
charger or car adapter. They are on sale in stores where batteries
are usually sold.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the cheesy
</P>
<P>
   If your taste in movies runs similar to your taste in pizza,
there's a new Web site for you: http://www.b-movie.com celebrates
``the art and the industry'' of low-budget, cheesy B-movies.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the site is kicking off its first round of
inductions into its B-Movie Hall of Fame. Honorees were selected
from more than 1,000 nominations submitted by movie fans from
around the world. Participants selected their favorite films and
actors.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated B-movie actors include: The Bowery Boys, Bela Lugosi,
Ronald Reagan, Nancy Davis and John Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated B-Movies include: ``Blood of Jesus,'' ``Death Race
2000,'' ``The Leopard Man'' and ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   Voicing your opinion
</P>
<P>
   If you're the type who likes to voice your opinion on anything
and everything, but your friends and neighbors already have heard
it all, there's a Web site that might be your online haven.
</P>
<P>
   The site, http://www.sundbergf.com, is from SundbergFerar, a
Michigan-based firm that asks people their likes and dislikes about
the products they buy.
</P>
<P>
   This month's question: What do you think of your cordless drill?
</P>
<P>
   The information gathered is used to educate companies about how
their stuff is received. People who post responses have the option
of checking a box that ensures the name and information won't be
given to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get consumers to realize their voice is really
important in the product process,'' said spokesman Mark Powers.
``Without the input, some companies are really missing the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Combination deal
</P>
<P>
   Sony is pushing its minidisc hard this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The MD Bundle 5 combines the minidisc home recorder with a
portable minidisc player and a home minidisc player _ all for $350.
</P>
<P>
   The bundled package is designed to bring first-time users to the
minidisc way of thinking. The package features an MDS-JE320 home
recording deck, an MZ-E40 portable MD player and two 60-minute
MDW-60A recordable minidiscs. The MDS-JE320 home deck offers Wide
Bit Stream technology, which is designed to reproduce soft,
low-level music. A separate jog dial for text entry and track
selection is available for an estimated retail price of $199.
</P>
<P>
   The portable part of the package is a machine that weighs 10.6
ounces, including the headphone and batteries, and can fit in your
pocket. It takes two AA batteries, which provide four hours of
power. The machine also features a 10-second memory to make sure
any bumps or jolts don't interrupt the listening pleasure. The
totable unit's LCD readout lists battery life, track title, track
number and play mode. The minidisc format lets you add, erase, move
and mix tracks at the push of a button. According to Sony, the
minidiscs themselves can be re-recorded more than a million times,
with no loss of sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   Sony gives you three extra recordable minidiscs (a $15 value)
with each purchase of a minidisc player or recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Small-cap investors' site
</P>
<P>
   Next Wave Stocks, an online magazine designed for the investor
interested in small-cap stocks (companies with market
capitalization of less than $500 million), has started a Web site
for small-cap investors.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at http://www.nextwavestocks.com, bills itself as the
only barometer for small-cap technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Small-cap stocks took some of the biggest hits during the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Next Wave 100 composite index dropped 28.4 percent during
that time. The index of small-cap companies is made up of
information technology companies, technology manufacturing and
biotech.

 &HT;    It's time to start over with a lean, mean Net browser
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not too many years ago, a good friend gave me one of
those fancy Swiss Army knives. It was a marvel (probably still is,
but it's lost in the clutter now, or perhaps has escaped back to
Switzerland).
</P>
<P>
   It contained a magnifying glass, two different kinds of
screwdrivers, a small saw, three or four knife blades, a fingernail

 &HT;    Language tutor CDs lose a lot in translation
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surely all of us, at one time or another, have wondered how it
would be to have our consciousness transplanted into that of
another, to see and understand from the viewpoint of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   My encounters with software conceived and whelped in France lead
me to believe that entering the mind of a Gallic software designer
would be like walking into a carnival funhouse for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   What got me into this train of thought is a product called Tell
Me More from Auralog, which is at once the most creative and the
most useless language tutor I have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Tell Me More is a voice-recognition program that comes in
several languages; I looked at the Spanish version. It comes with
the mandatory headset (microphone and earphones), a couple of
manuals which are of only occasional help, and three CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides almost every approach to language
comprehension you can imagine. The main screen is a scene full of
hotspots (remember Microsoft Bob?) leading you to to these various
approaches. Click on the notebook and you get the exercises. Among
the possible exercises are word associations, word order, filling
in the blanks in sentences, Hangman, a chance to take dictation,
associating words with pictures, and a crossword.
</P>
<P>
   All these are in Spanish. In other words, in filling in the
blanks, you get a sentence in Spanish and a set of words in
Spanish, from which you must choose the proper word to complete the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kinda tough if you don't know Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you go to the glossary and the grammar book. The
glossary is straightfoward and useful; it gives you a translation
of a Spanish word and a pronunciation of it. The grammar book, on
the other hand, is useless. For example, it attempts to demonstrate
the proper use of the word ``esta'' by using it in a series of
sentences _ none of which is translated.
</P>
<P>
   For further frustration, you can click on dialogue, which takes
you to a picture and a set of sentences. Another sentence is spoken
to you. You are supposed to select and utter the proper response.
</P>
<P>
   In some of these sections you can right-click on a word and get
some options such as a translation or pronunciation. The procedure
is, however, slow and cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   What is utterly lacking in Tell Me More is any kind of cohesion
and direction. There is no step-by-step plan for learning, no sense
of ``Do this lesson and it will prepare you for that one.'' You
apparently are expected simply to jump off into the deep end and
sink or swim.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know a good many Spanish words already, you'd
better take a life preserver with you.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear to me _ si, claro _ the French do not think the same
way I do. At least not the folks at 12 avenue Jean Bart, in Voisins
le Bretonneux.
</P>
<P>
   While we are on the subject of voice recognition, I took a look
at IBM's latest version, ViaVoice Executive 98. It terms of its
breadth, it is much improved. But in the critical area _ how well
it recognized my voice _ I can see no significant improvement. Once
again, I must conclude the time of the voice-recognition program
has not yet arrived.

 &HT;    Emission waiver lets drivers off the hook
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I recently attended a public hearing held by the
Georgia Environmental Protection Division. The turnout was small _
a handful of auto industry representatives and state bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   We in the auto repair industry weren't required to be there. We
didn't go because the subject matter was especially spectacular.
The agenda item we had come to hear and object to was the extension
of the $200 waiver limit for vehicles failing the metro area's
emission test _ and continuing to contribute to the deterioration
of Atlanta's air quality.
</P>
<P>
   The waiver limit means cars that fail the state's emission test
can be granted a waiver _ and permission to get new tags for two
years _ if the owner spends at least $200 fixing the car and it
shows some improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the limit _ meaning the owner has to spend more money on
the car before it is granted a waiver _ will be better for everyone
in the long run. Let me explain.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone failing an emissions inspection must attempt to have
their vehicle repaired to comply with specific emissions standards.
After repairs are made, the car must show an improvement in the
emission of certain gases without adversely affecting the other
tailpipe readings. If the customer has spent more than $200 in
emission-related repairs and the vehicle's tailpipe readings meet
the above criteria, the vehicle may qualify for a waiver even
though it actually fails the test.
</P>
<P>
   This waiver enables the owner to register the vehicle, and it
will not need to be retested for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   When the new state testing program started in October 1996, the
$200 limit was put in place for the first two years only. This
arrangement was intended to give the public, time to adjust to the
test and to begin bringing vehicles into compliance. The emissions
standards would get stricter, as would the testing procedure for
older vehicles. They had to.
</P>
<P>
   The old emissions program, with its $50 repair limit, had
virtually no effect on improving Atlanta's air quality. In fact,
according to the Environmental Protection Division statistics, 1998
was one of the worst years for ground level ozone. The metro area
was in compliance with federal standards on 22 days. While the
weather and other variables can increase or decrease the problem,
the one constant factor has been the steady increase in pollution
from cars.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the automotive repair industry realized that the
current system was flawed by the constraints placed upon them. A
primary issue was the public perception that $200 in repairs would
``get them a sticker.''
</P>
<P>
   It was common knowledge that a large percentage of the cars on
the road were in despicable states of repair that $200 would not
begin to fix. The public also discovered this as it bounced back
and forth between retests and repairs with the costs escalating
each time.
</P>
<P>
   However, the $200 figure stuck in their minds, and any repairs
costing more began to fuel tempers. The repair industry has been
eager for the ceiling to be raised so it could get down to the
business of fixing cars without having to haggle over an
unrealistic price limit.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners have invested thousands of dollars in equipment
to meet the needs of the program. While early concerns that there
wouldn't be enough test lanes were quickly dispelled, a new element
has begun to emerge: a shortage of mechanics with the skills to
repair emissions failures.

 &HT;    Leather jackets can be preserved
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a leather letter jacket with patches and pins I want
to display. I don't want it hanging in a closet or stuffed in a
box. Where can I find tips on preserving this precious memory? _ E.
Dever
</P>
<P>
   A: A framer can build a shadow box and mount it _ literally sew
the jacket to the backing. Or you can purchase a Plexiglas case
from Lin Terry at (732) 370-5252 and hang the jacket inside the
case. That is the advice of Stars, the high-end memorabilia giant
of Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Stars recently handled a Jan. 1, 1784, document signed by George
Washington, which sold for a cool $25,000. On a more pedestrian
level, Stars has a ``Saving Private Ryan'' poster signed by Steven
Spielberg, et al. _ a mere $795. Q: Assuming it ever gets cold
enough to use the fireplace, how can I be sure any wood I order is
free of oak wilt? Any vendor you call will swear up and down their
wood is ``clean.'' _ Georgia Reed
</P>
<P>
   A: You can't be sure. Burning wood with oak wilt does not spread
the disease. However, transporting and storing infected firewood
could contaminate other trees. To be safe, never buy red oak
firewood. Purchase mesquite, pecan or elm.
</P>
<P>
   Barring that, only well-seasoned wood should be purchased. This
wood is light-weight. The ends are split; bark may be loose.
</P>
<P>
   The advice of Texas Forest Service's Jim Rooni is to burn all
wood by the middle of February and cover all unseasoned wood with
clear plastic, tucked under the pile. If you cut wood suspected of
having oak wilt, allow the logs to dry in the sun for an entire
summer before moving them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need your help! I am seeing two guys _ 23 and 17 years of
age. I am only 15. I really like the 23-year-old, but my mom
disapproves of him. I was friends with him for more than a year,
but I am scared. He wants to take our friendship a step forward.
The 17-year-old is the one I like to hang around with, but we had
an intimate relationship when we knew each other for only a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The older guy asked me to choose between the two of them. What
should I do? _ K.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: You asked me, I think, because you suspect the answer will be
similar to your mom's. I won't disappoint. The 23-year-old guy is
too old for you. I can barely sanction seeing the 17-year-old.
Trust your mom. She loves you.
</P>
<P>
   Licensed marriage and family therapist Annie Drake says, ``The
only people who can slow down a teen-ager's world are parents.'' If
confused, she advises, ``Say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Age differences are particularly acute now. Fifteen is young _
you are not driving or voting and cannot join the Army. When you
are 45 and the older man is 53, no problem. But those eight years
represent light years in maturity during the teen years.
</P>
<P>
   Drake also noted two ways for parents to say ``no'': ``No, I
love you too much to let you do that,'' and, ``No, not now.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks like for you it is ``No, not now.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: My mother is in a nursing home. My father and I have a
general durable power of attorney. My mother's Medicaid application
for nursing home payment was denied and now is going through an
appeals process. In the meantime the bill must be paid or she will
be discharged for nonpayment (decision made by a DHS hearing
officer).
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home administrator demands payment from me and has
threatened to file a lien against my home and my father's for any
unpaid bill. Do I have a legal obligation to pay my mother's bill
with my resources?
</P>
<P>
   Also, can a nursing home discharge a patient to the home of a
family member who is not the spouse or legal guardian?
</P>
<P>
   _N.S.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Federal law prohibits a Medicaid-certified nursing home
from requiring a third party to guarantee payment as a condition of
admission,'' says attorney H. Clyde Farrell. If you signed a
contract agreeing to be responsible for your mother's bills, it may
be invalid (the moral obligation is another question).
</P>
<P>
   Your home is your homestead, and you need not worry about the
nursing home or anyone else putting a lien on it. Your father's
obligations to your mother's bills do not include his home. After
the death of your parents, the estate may need the proceeds of the
sale of the house to settle bills, which may include nursing home
bills.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney experienced in the growing field of elder law,
Christine Larson adds that the discharge of a patient can only be
to a spouse or legal guardian. When the well-being of a person age
60 or more is in jeopardy, contact Adult Protective Services at
(800) 252-5400.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Reel Women is a nonprofit organization formed to promote the
education and networking of women filmmakers. We need a computer
and reasonable office space to facilitate film production and
administration. The computer should be a 200 Pentium at least,
Windows 95, with 32 mgs of RAM, a sound card and a video card. We
are also looking for a 15-inch (or larger) monitor, a CD-ROM drive
and a laser printer. _ Susan Kirr
</P>
<P>
   A: Readers, think of this as an opportunity to get into the
movie business. Call Kirr at 512-263-7586 if you can help.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get my white pants dyed khaki? _ P.M.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: Grab the familiar RIT dye and hit the washing machine. Or you
can tea-dye the pants (send me a stamped, self-addressed envelope
for the recipe).
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig at P.O. Box 670, Austin 78767; (512)
445-3697; e-mail jgreig(AT)statesman.com or fax (512) 445-3968.
Because of the number of inquiries, Jane cannot respond to every
request.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Who says the American voters are not fools?
 &HT;    For release Nov. 4, 1998
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere along each just-concluded campaign, candidates _
usually one on the receiving end of a hard, low hit by his or her
opponent _ will notify the electorate through the media that the
American people are not fools and will see through the opposition's
bluster.
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that almost all of us can see through the
word-twisting and planted innuendoes of today's American politics,
but I'm not quite certain of the claim about us not being a nation
of fools.
</P>
<P>
   This concern is based upon what I am seeing and reading about us
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The people who appear on the Jerry Springer show, both
participants and audience, are an example. Who are they and why do
they act in the manner they do? Are they the ones who elected
people to Congress, to City Hall, or to the bench? And what about
those millions who watch that low-level stupidity; what does it say
about them?
</P>
<P>
   So successful has been the Springer show that copycats have
bloomed all over the morning and late afternoon TV tube.
</P>
<P>
   Who are those people who dress up in bizarre getups at televised
football games, seeking mainly to appear coast-to-coast? ``Did you
see when the camera panned to the end zone? The guy in the gorilla
mask, with `Jets' written in green across his belly? That was me!''
</P>
<P>
   How nice.
</P>
<P>
   Who are those people who go to professional wrestling matches,
screaming vulgarities at the beefy actors in the ring? Or pay the
cost of closed-circuit telecasts of those events? Why are they
imitating our Hollywood perception of mobs in the Roman Coliseum?
And who is that 45-year-old lady who, at a safe distance, is
taunting the 250-pound wrestler?
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note that with every documented charge
against Bill Clinton by Ken Starr, Clinton's popularity rises in
the polls, and Starr's sags. I'm not one interested in continuing
this Clinton inquisition, but I'm also not one to think more of him
today than I did yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   How many spend their days and nights glued to music videos, and
never read a book, a magazine, a newspaper; never watch a public
service telecast?
</P>
<P>
   If this is not a nation of fools, then who are those people and
how many of them are there?
</P>
<P>
   From one end of the country to the other, political candidates
have drummed into our heads awful things about the other guy.
Professional advisers tell the candidates that if you throw enough
of that into the air, some of it is going to stick. The
professionals do that based on experience, the experience that
while not all Americans are fools, a good number of us are. Perhaps
a greater number than we would like to think.
</P>
<P>
   It clearly would be unconstitutional to require citizens to take
a Rorschach test before being eligible to vote, but I certainly
would like to know who among us believes that wrestling is
unrehearsed or that the warring women on Jerry Springer's stage,
those booing and cheering in the audience and those at home _ their
eyes glued to the spectacle _ are considered part of that broad
generic observation that says that the voters of America are not
fools.
</P>
<P>
   We are not talking about the stoic portrait of a Middle American
caste, pitchfork in hand, solemn wife at his side. They exist out
there, but are shrinking at the same rate as their farms. We're not
talking about the old Silent Majority, either; they evolved into
the Christian Right. They are identifiable and with goals.
</P>
<P>
   But those others, those many who read tabloid newspapers, follow
movie stars' lives far more closely than the actions of their
elected representatives, watch morning TV mayhem and actually
believe the horribly distorted claims made in political races _
they're the ones who worry me.
</P>
<P>
   How many of them are out there? Are they the deciding force in
the course of this nation? Heaven help us if they are.

 &HT;    Once you add the necessities, G3 is a better buy than iMac
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No question about it. The iMac is one sharp-looking
computer. But is it a good buy? I'd argue not. A better investment
would be any of Apple Computer's G3 desktop models.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before you start flaming me with e-mail charges of
betrayal, let me explain. I consider the iMac a good, if not great,
computer. It works reasonably well, has a brilliantly sharp screen
and, of course, there's that striking bondi translucent body.
</P>
<P>
   But a computer is a lot more than looks. It needs to work out of
the box with existing software and devices like printers. It is
here the iMac falls short. In addition, the iMac really costs more
than its listed price. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there's no internal floppy drive. Apple Computer's
Steve Jobs doesn't think you need or want one. But I doubt few of
you can get by without a floppy drive. How better to save and carry
all those little files you create day in and out?
</P>
<P>
   That means you'll have to buy a floppy, and there's only one
available that works with the iMac. It's called the Imation
SuperDisk and sells for about $150. Adding an Imation drive raises
the price of the iMac to $1,450.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more
</P>
<P>
   That's still a good price _ but wait, you're not done yet. The
iMac's 32 megabytes of internal memory, or RAM, is inadequate to
run most of today's multimedia games, supposedly one of this
computer's strengths. You'll need to at least double the iMac's
RAM, which adds another $100 to $200 to the price.
</P>
<P>
   Don't close your wallet yet, especially if you'd like to print
anything from the iMac. It uses a new standard for connecting
peripheral devices, and your old printer won't work. That means you
either have to buy a new printer, for $270, or a special device
that will connect the iMac to old printers. Those devices range in
price from $40 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the iMac is not as inexpensive as Apple Computer would
have you believe. Its true price runs between $1,700 and $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   For that, you might as well buy a G3 desktop or PowerBook. Both
of them cost about the same and come with everything you need right
out of the box.

 &HT;    What a difference 30 years makes
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Pop songs are like time machines. Take the
Supremes' hit Love Child, which topped the charts 30 years ago.
It's one of those pop songs that, to put it kindly, remind you that
1968 was a very, very long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a woman born to an unmarried mother and determined
not to let the same thing happen to a child of her own:
</P>
<P>
   No child of mine'll be bearing/ The name of shame I've been
wearing...
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for Janice Benson, a lead teacher Dunbar High School's
day care center, to imagine Love Child becoming a hit today. The
kids she works with just couldn't identify. The lyrics seem quaint
as a lace doily:
</P>
<P>
   This love we're contemplating
</P>
<P>
   Is worth the pain of waiting
</P>
<P>
   We'll only end up hating
</P>
<P>
   This child we may be creating
</P>
<P>
   Love child, never meant to be
</P>
<P>
   Love child, scorned by
</P>
<P>
   society
</P>
<P>
   Love child, always second best
</P>
<P>
   Love child, different from the rest
</P>
<P>
   Teen pregnancy doesn't carry the stigma that it did when Benson,
51, was a teen-ager. Yes, maybe that's one of the reasons there are
more teen pregnancies today. But would it be better for teen-agers
_ and their children _ if we returned to the days of the stigma?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it would be great if kids felt peer pressure not to have
sex. But do we want teen mothers to drop out of school? Do we want
their babies to feel ``never quite as good''?
</P>
<P>
   Benson was 15 and unmarried when she became pregnant. Her high
school kicked her out. She was forced to leave her baby daughter
home with her mother while attending high school 43 miles away and
living with her grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had made a mistake,'' Benson says, ``but I felt I
could still do what I wanted with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother told her, ``Janice, this isn't the end of your life.
You can do it; you're gonna do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And she did. She graduated from Sinclair Community College and
has been a child care provider for 30 years. She has raised six
good kids.
</P>
<P>
   Benson made it in spite of the disgrace she was made to feel.
Now she's working in an environment where teen mothers are treated
much more compassionately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through it, so I understand where these teen moms are
coming from,'' Benson says. ``And my heart just goes out to these
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar's nursery started as a laboratory in the school's
vocational education program in the early '70s, serving children in
the community. It is still a classroom and laboratory, ``only now
we take care of our students' children,'' says director Mary
Molnar.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 25 inmates and toddlers are in the nursery, and their
mothers can see them between classes and at lunch. Student mothers
arrive by bus at 7 a.m., bogged down with babies, pumpkin seats,
book bags and diaper bags. The babies aren't admitted into the
nursery after 7:30 a.m.; they can only stay while their parents are
in school.
</P>
<P>
   Molnar, 52, remembers how pregancies were handled when she was
in high school: Girls came down with some vague ``illness,'' were
sent to live with an aunt, and came home, miraculously recovered _
and without the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the nursery were not here, there would still be
pregnancies, but there would be more dropouts,'' Molnar says.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar principal Leon Love concurs: ``We're being more realistic
than when I was in school. We're enabling them to continue their
education so they become productive citizens instead of being on
welfare rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Typhanie Wagner, a 17-year-old senior, said the availability of
day care didn't have anything to do with her getting pregnant; that
was an accident. But finding child care for 5-month-old Donte had
everything to do with her decision to stay in school. Being
responsible for Donte has made her more serious about her studies.
``I've got to make a life for me and him,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she discourages her friends from following her path.
``It's a burden,'' she tells them. ``You don't get to be a
teen-ager. You have to make sure your baby has everything first.''
</P>
<P>
   Brianna Ware, 17, a vocational student, says that working in the
nursery has provided an example of what not to do. ``It's helping
me to know I don't want to have kids right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner doesn't mind setting that kind of example. Just don't
take it out on her son. He's nobody's ``love child,'' nobody's
``second best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These babies didn't do anything,'' she says, ``it was the male
and the female. ``
</P>
<P>
   Yes, 1968 was a very, very long time ago. Look around, and
you'll see lots of changes, good and bad, in the messages we send
about teen-agers and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar's day care center is one of the good ones.

 &HT;    Jaguar strives for feel of elegance with new S-Type
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the words of the president of Jaguar Cars North America, Mike
Dale, there are two reasons people purchase automobiles. The first
is for basic transportation; the second is a perception that a
certain vehicle adds something to the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Noting there are a number of vehicles that provide fine basic
transportation, he explained that it was Jaguar's purpose to add
much more, but specifically to add elegance to the lifestyle of
Jaguar drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Building on this concept, Jaguar introduced at this month's
Birmingham, England, motor show the new S-Type. Inspired but not
limited by the popular Mark II S-Type models of the 1960s, the
all-new S-Type captures the traditional proportion and stance of a
sporty, European sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type's elliptical vertical-bar grille is perhaps its
strongest visual link to its Jaguar lineage. This grille has been a
symbol of the marque since the introduction of the XK120 sports
cars. The tradition of elegant Jaguar interiors also continues with
the new S-Type.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type also has a host of more sporty and technical features
than typically found in current Jags. Beginning with the power
plants, the S-Type will be available with a 240-horsepower V-6 or a
281-hp V-8.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar intends to compete with cars from BMW and Mercedes-Benz
by focusing technology toward customer convenience. An industry
first will be voice-activated controls for a telephone and audio
and climate controls.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type will offer a dynamic stability control system, an
integrated navigation system and a satellite-based emergency
messaging system. A rear-bumper-mounted sensor system alerts the
driver to rear obstacles. Rain-sensitive wipers automatically
adjust blade frequency. Dual-zone climate controls and an in-dash
six-disc CD changer highlight creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type will be built in Jaguar's new Castle Bromwich
manufacturing plant, part of Ford Motor Co.'s investment. Outgoing
Ford Chief Executive Officer Alex Trotman once said that it was not
the elephant's (Ford) intention to stand on the toes of the cat
(Jaguar), but rather to protect it so as to enable it to run.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 model year S-Type is expected to arrive in showrooms in
the spring.

 &HT;    Resolution for warm manatee habitat being sought
 &HT;    By Sally D. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ A plan to create solar-heated underwater
showers for the Moore's Creek manatees is making waves between
manatee-lovers and environmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The gentle sea cows have visited the creek each winter for
years, basking in the warm water discharged from a nearby Fort
Pierce Utilities Authority power plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the plant, operating less often under a new agreement to
pool power with other utilities, is generating less warm water.
</P>
<P>
   So Liberta Scotto, director of the Manatee Observation and
Education Center, built in 1996 at the mouth of the creek, proposed
the showers as a two-year experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterfront Council offered $5,000 toward the $45,000
project, and, along with St. Lucie County Conservation Alliance,
backed Scotto's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine it as like the showers in gym class,'' the Waterfront
Council's John Parry said. ``There would be a long pipe underwater
with 12 to 20 nozzles blowing warm water. Each manatee would have
its own warm water shower.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental agencies have had mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Environmental Protection's water facilities
administrator OK'd the plan as long as chlorine isn't used to clean
the underwater plumbing and water temperatures are monitored.
</P>
<P>
   David W. Arnold, head of the DEP's bureau of protected species
in Tallahassee, is opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want folks to think we're cold-hearted about the
plight of the manatees,'' Arnold said. ``I wish we could do
research at a number of different power plants for a number of
years so we could feel comfortable in making the best choice _ get
rid of all warm water discharges, maintain them, or let nature take
its course.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Turner, with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, thought the
plan had merits but considers it ``premature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've formed a group to look at the warm-water issue in a
broad way. It could be good, it could be bad. We recommended she
defer it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotto said she'd redesign the experiment if the agencies would
tell her what's wrong with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like the idea of heating the water,'' said
Waterfront Council member Jeanne Hearn. ``But we aren't doing any
more by heating it than the utility did by shutting it off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was trying to do was get the study up and running, to
see the impact of solar-heated water on our visiting manatees,''
Scotto said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the agencies have the authority to enforcing a ban on
the showers is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to decide if it was actually harming the animals,''
Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Manatee Center stands to lose human visitors if
the manatees look for warmer water elsewhere. The center, which
draws 50,000 manatee-watchers during the winter season, will
continue as an environmental education center. But the manatees are
its major attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer manatees showed up last winter when less warm water flowed
into Moore's Creek, Scotto said. But the water everywhere was
warmer last year because of El Nino, so the manatees may have felt
less need to visit Moore's Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Valade, wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service in Jacksonville, said studies of manatee travel patterns,
using radio tag tracking identifying manatees by their scars where
large groups are gathered, indicate they're individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some go to the same site every year, knowing they can feed and
keep warm there. Others move to three or four warm water sites
throughout the winter. Some stay at one site two or three years and
then move on,'' Valade said.
</P>
<P>
   So predicting what will happen at Moore's Creek, with or without
the showers, is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Elie Boudreaux, director of the Fort Pierce Utilities Authority,
doubts the showers would make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of heat they would provide is minuscule,''
Boudreaux said.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't convinced the manatees have a problem. Runoff from the
land keeps Moore's Creek slightly warmer than surrounding waters
anyway, Boudreaux said.
</P>
<P>
   And the utility operates the plant based on its own needs and
those of a Vero Beach plant. During cold weather in this area, the
plant definitely would be operating. It also could operate, for
example, if a cold snap hits Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   In north Florida, some power plants agree to provide warm water
for manatees even if they aren't generating.
</P>
<P>
   Scotto's discouraged about the prospects for her experiment.
``Everyone's sitting on the fence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to concentrate on other projects _ the center's new
butterfly garden, aquariums, 3-dimensional mural. And its gift shop
with 600 manatee items.

<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Marcus Camby has confined himself to the
grounds of a rambling estate he has rented near the Knicks'
practice facility. Barely visible from the road, a stone-and-iron
gate mark the passage to the walled-off world Camby seldom leaves
at night.
</P>
<P>
   It is better this way. If there is anything Camby has learned in
his turbulent two years in the National Basketball Association, it
is this: It's harder for trouble to find you if it does not know
where you are.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is only a two-hour drive from his old neighborhood,
a decayed pocket of Hartford, Conn., known as the North End, Camby
has allowed few people to know where he lives now.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one person from his past whom he still embraces as
tight as a blanket in the cold: Tamia Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is a former hustler who sold drugs, mixed in a seamy
nightclub scene and pulled countless scams in order to endure the
streets of the North End.
</P>
<P>
   And during a sordid saga that played out at the University of
Massachusetts, Murray played a prominent role in an agent scandal
that left the school stripped of its 1996 Final Four appearance and
left Camby's name disgraced. Murray was on the take as agents,
including Wesley Spears and John Lounsbury, plied Camby and his
friends with cash, gifts, rental cars and prostitutes at UMass.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Murray has been considered a dangerous side effect to
Camby's life. But this is Camby's best friend. How do you ask a
player to detach himself from the past? How can he commit a ghetto
sin and turn his back on a confidant who helped him survive a
neighborhood?
</P>
<P>
   ``People say cut loose from the past, but they really don't
know,'' Camby said, standing inside a gray mansion decorated with
black-and-white photos of Muhammad Ali and Martin Luther King in
the living room. ``I listen to what they are saying and stuff, but
I don't pay attention to them. It's how I feel inside. Tamia is guy
who will always be in my corner, and I'll always be in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anyone says about him. People might say he's
in my life because he can get this or that or because I'm this or
that, but I don't see it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees Murray as one of the only people he can trust. And so
Murray is never far away. Without an outside income, Murray drives
Camby's cars, lives at the estate and has many of his expenses paid
for by the Knicks' 24-year-old forward.
</P>
<P>
   Although teams are prohibited from discussing players during the
NBA's ongoing lockout, there are those within the Knicks'
organization who have privately wondered if the friends from
Camby's past, like Murray, could lead the team's newest player into
some precarious situations.
</P>
<P>
   This issue is not isolated to the Knicks. The league is
concerned about the growing number of its athletes, especially the
younger players, who now have entourages. In the league's rookie
orientation session, players are cautioned about associating with
unsavory crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Camby understands these concerns but believes he and Murray have
it all worked out. In the past, particularly when caught up in the
dizzying feel of the money that washed over Camby and Murray at
UMass, Camby failed to consider the repercussions of his actions _
and those of his friends _ away from the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have so many people coming at you that you have to really
sit down and think, `OK, what am I about to do here?''' Camby said.
``That's the one thing I didn't do. I did things spontaneously, and
I was going with the flow. Now, everything I do, I analyze it.
Should I do it? Should I not? Is this a bad situation or not? Most
of the time the answer is easy: I don't leave my house. I figure if
I don't leave my house, I can't get into any trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine Camby falling into trouble. He is an
affable, well-spoken and respectful person. But he realizes that
few see this side of him. He out to prove that he can be not only a
young asset for the aging Knicks, but also a decent and responsible
person who has set up the CambyLand Foundation, which focuses on
the educational needs of children.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, his detractors will roll their eyes at this
image reclamation project. Camby is still booed when he plays
against the Celtics at the Fleet Center in Boston, where the fans
believe he betrayed UMass by accepting money from agents,
infractions punished by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Although Camby repaid UMass the $151,000 it lost in Final Four
tournament money, he rankled some by saying he felt no guilt over
his actions. He has been portrayed as a greedy kid without a moral
compass.
</P>
<P>
   But those close to Camby paint a different picture. They see a
kid who always tried hard to avoid trouble, to the extent that he
turned his back on the men who used to gamble on his high school
games at Hartford Public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember these guys who used to go to the games and bet
other guys that Marcus would get 30 points by halftime,'' Camby's
cousin, Reggie Jackson, said.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the real trouble began when agents started using cash
to get cozy with Camby's friends, like Boris Wray and especially
Murray. While no one, including Camby, is making an excuse for his
gross missteps at UMass, there is an explanation for how Camby, who
grew up under the eye of a strict and loving mother, ended up with
his name smeared in a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it all comes back to me,'' Murray said recently as
he sat in the driver's seat of Camby's Range Rover parked on the
main drag of the North End. ``If I had never started taking cash
from certain individuals, none of the bad stuff that went down
would have ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants the blame. Bring it on. As Murray explained himself,
his rock-hard exterior, complete with two scars from the bullets he
took at ages 11 and 14, began to melt. Unexpectedly, his eyes
welled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I felt like I let him down,'' Murray said. ``Of
course I felt bad. You care about someone, you're not wanting to
hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've got agents who have millions. And they are coming
at individuals who have nothing. Marcus didn't know where the money
was coming from. If I want to give someone in this neighborhood
$10, they don't ask where it comes from. They take whatever they
can get. If you can get cash, anyone would take it. Thing is, no
one outside this jungle understands that mentality.''

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 2. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday's elections dominate. USA Today leads with its latest
poll indicating that many races are too close to call. The New York
Times goes with a nationwide look at candidates' last-minute
attempts to motivate voters, in a campaign that at this late date,
the Times says, still lacks a national theme. The Los Angeles Times
goes with the last frantic hours of California's gubernatorial and
Senate candidates. The Washington Post gives much of its front to
election coverage as well, but leads with Hamas' threat to do
battle with Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   USAT reports that according to its plus-or-minus 5 percent poll
of 1,105 likely voters, 49 percent said they preferred the Democrat
in their local congressional race and 45 percent preferred the
Republican. Today's Papers is thrilled to note that the paper runs
the preceding information about margin of error and sample size in
the first few paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT lead also comments that polling shows many races to be
very close. Besides the very tight congressional races, the paper
says at least five Senate races (New York, North Carolina,
Kentucky, Nevada and Wisconsin) and 10 gubernatorial contests
(Maryland, Nevada, Hawaii, Georgia, South Carolina, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Iowa, Ohio and Rhode Island) could easily come out
either way.
</P>
<P>
   The Times passes along some of the more incendiary last-minute
phone, radio and leaflet election messages such close races give
rise to. Such as this from a Missouri Democratic Party radio appeal
targeted at blacks: ``When you don't vote, you let another church
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state where media-based campaigns are the standard, even
the LAT seems stunned that California's two senatorial and two
gubernatorial candidates threw millions into last-minute ads. The
paper says the Democratic candidate for governor, Gray Davis, spent
$1 million just for TV time on Sunday and Monday. The other major
effort seems to be going into attending church--all but one of the
four major candidates ``publicly sought divine intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, having tried to show the Israelis he's serious
about upholding his end of the just-concluded peace accords by
arresting scores of Hamas members, is now, reports the WP, being
threatened in a Hamas leaflet with violent retaliation. The NYT
pass at the story, running inside, includes this not-quite-Miranda
warning from Arafat's chief of police, ``If anyone from the Qassam
Brigades (of Hamas) gets near a police officer, shoot him in the
legs!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Times adds in a separate story (an Agence
France-Presse dispatch) that, not to be out-thugged, the head of
the Syrian- and Iranian-backed terrorist organization, Hezbollah,
speaking at a rally in Beirut, told a large crowd that getting rid
of the peace deal requires killing not just Israeli soldiers and
settlers, but also Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   USAT and the LAT front Clinton administration warnings to Iraq
that it could face a U.S. or allied military strike if it doesn't
reconsider its weekend decision to shut down the UN's weapons
inspection effort. The NYT runs the story inside.
</P>
<P>
   USAT's front section cover story is a close look at the growing
problem of Web sites that sell prescription medications to
loggers-on. The paper says that medical boards in every state view
the sites as illegal or at least not meeting accepted standards of
medical care. The story reports one countermeasure the Federal
Trade Commission has put into play: the establishment of a ``teaser
sting site'' (one of a dozen relating to various spurious health
claims and get-rich-quick schemes) that promotes fake impotence and
sex aids but leads to nothing more than a warning that such
e-commerce is dubious. Unlike a USAT story earlier this year on sex
sites, Monday's story contains no Web addresses. A policy change?
</P>
<P>
   The WP's Al Kamen reports that in the sheriff's race in Storey
County, Nev., a much-prized voting bloc is working women. And he
means working women. The county contains two legal brothels staffed
by a total of 195 licensed prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Nicholas Lemann's NYT Magazine cover story
articulating how the national conversation has been utterly taken
over by the concerns of the comfortable, the Wall Street Journal
offers a front-page story on a previously unappreciated grave
national crisis: the difficulties involved in shopping for
furniture. The story's hard-luck cases include: people with a
$50,000 car and Armani suits but shabby furniture, a woman who was
able to drive home her 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee the day she saw it,
but twice has had to wait 12 weeks for furniture ordered at Pottery
Barn, and a management consultant who despite having hired a
decorator and ordering $70,000 worth of furniture including a
hand-carved entertainment center, has still only received one of
the pieces. There is no indication in the story that some people
can't afford furniture and don't have houses to put it in.

 PURCHASE: that mentality.''

<P>
   Murray and Camby grew up in the North End's unsightly Bellevue
Square project, which has since been renamed and renovated.
Although crime has decreased 41 percent in the last four years,
according to police department records, the North End is a place
where residents say kids still hit the ground when a car backfires
in fear of a drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 10 months of this year, there have been 10
homicides. In 1994, a year after Camby graduated from Hartford
Public, there were 17 murders, 48 sexual assaults, 488 robberies,
605 aggravated assaults and 799 burglaries in the North End, an
area noted as the worst crime zone in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the violence that has long scarred this neighborhood,
there were two kids who were as tight as matches in a matchbook.
Camby and Murray spent their days shooting hoops and unloading
their energy with a game of tag through the hallways of the
projects at night. As close as they were, they grew up very
differently. Murray was the same age as Camby, but while he was on
the streets trying to make a dime, Camby was performing in an
elementary school play.
</P>
<P>
   Same neighborhood, different worlds. Recently, Marcus' mother,
Janice Camby, was sitting in the living room of a two-story brick
home in a suburb of Hartford, with the smell of bacon floating in
from a gourmet kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bellevue Square is a long way from here,'' she said, looking
around the house her son bought for her after he signed a
three-year, $8.4 million deal with the Toronto Raptors two years
ago. ``When we were looking for a place, Marcus liked this house.
He liked the high ceilings.''
</P>
<P>
   Any house would have been fine with her. This is not a woman wed
to luxury, not when she still keeps a jar of pennies as a
centerpiece in the living room ``because you never know when that
rainy day is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   She is wary by nature. She had to be in order to raise three
children safely in the projects. So Janice made sure her son was
bused to a school in the suburbs until he was in high school,
wanting to send him as far away from the gangs as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so bad that my mom wouldn't even let me go to the
courts,'' Camby said. ``I had to cut out the bottom of a milk crate
and hang it up beside the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The routine was simple: Camby walked in from school, called his
mother, then sat with Ruby, his grandmother, in the apartment and
watched the soap opera ``Guiding Light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was addicted to it,'' Camby said. Around 6 p.m., when his
mother came home, he was allowed outside until the street lights
came on.
</P>
<P>
   Although his father was rarely part of his childhood, Camby had
structure and the necessities. Working as a family advocate for
Hartford's Community Renewal Team, for which she often tracked down
welfare checks for families, Janice Camby could afford the two
gallons of milk Camby consumed every three days. She earned enough
to keep a tidy apartment filled with the staples for a growing boy,
like shoes, clothes and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   It is a childhood that sounds almost normal until Murray
interjects some reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, Marcus didn't have it better,'' Murray said.
``Everyone around here has mice and rats and roaches. The rats are
as big as your foot. You turn over in your bed, and there's a rat
in there with you. You pour cereal and roaches fall out. You're
lucky if you have cereal. Most kids get grits because their moms
are raising them alone and there's no money.''
</P>
<P>
   And no hope. Murray played basketball and was athletic but was
not marked with a gold star like Camby.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 6-11 and the tallest kid in New England, you've
got potential,'' Jackson, Camby's cousin, said. ``People were
always steering him in the right direction, like, `Yo, man, don't
get lost here, because you can make it.' He had a lot of people to
push him.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray was one of them, one of his protectors. If there was a
fight in a club, Murray made sure Camby was out of harm's way. If a
gang-related shooting was known to be in the works, Murray told
Camby to stay home. Murray watched out for Camby, but who was
watching out for him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, I was a hustler my whole life,'' Murray said. ``I
never really worked. I was more in the jungle than Marcus was. He
was in it but near the gates. I was in the heart of it, doing
whatever I had to in order to survive. I didn't have any money. So
when individuals came up to me with money _ and all I know is the
street _ I'd take it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mingling With Agents _ Paying the Price For Easy Money &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Murray was the perfect target for agents who want to woo future
clients by getting close to a best friend or family members. With
Camby projected to be a top draft pick out of UMass, his
million-dollar future had agents counting money in their heads.
There were a lot of unidentified agents, with names much bigger
than Spears' and Lounsbury's, who were trying to pave a trail to
Camby through Murray.
</P>
<P>
   During Camby's junior year, Murray, who made the hour drive to
UMass from Hartford to attend each home game, began making the
easiest money of his scrabbled life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were situations when I'd go to games at UMass and
certain individuals would ask me to walk to the bathroom, and
they'd hand me cash,'' said Murray, referring to agents. ``Marcus
didn't know at first. You've never had anything in your life, and
guys are in front of you wanting to fulfill your every wish. What
do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Murray played along. He became Camby's middleman, particularly
with Spears. Often, Spears handed Murray the cash and gifts.
Sometimes Camby saw the money, sometimes Murray just kept it.
Although he may have been oblivious at first, Camby soon discovered
how lucrative the agent fawning could be.
</P>
<P>
   Then the party was crashed. Once Camby decided to sign with
ProServ, which negotiated his $8.4 million rookie deal with the
Raptors, the agents who had courted him felt jilted and the alleged
stories of extortion were revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the allegations, Murray could have left Camby on his
own. Instead, he stuck by him, and the two friends came to an
epiphany. Things had to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't hustled anyone since that situation with the
agents,'' Murray said. ``I stopped doing anything that would draw
negative attention to Marcus. I used to hustle from 10 a.m. to 1
a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray used to cut deals on the very street where the Range
Rover is parked on this fall day. It is early afternoon, but across
the street, there is a man buying liquor cases out of the back of a
van. About 50 yards away, a car parks next to another. A window
rolls down and a package is exchanged for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ghetto; there's nothing you can't sell to make
money,'' Murray said. ``Me, I was a hustler. Everyone knew that's
how I got my money.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sits in Camby's car, living off Camby's riches, a cynic
would wonder if Murray was hustling Camby right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do that to Marcus,'' Murray said. ``I mean, you
have to understand. I have a heart, too. I have a conscience. There
are things I have done that are wrong, real wrong. But I'd never do
anything to Marcus.''

 PURCHASE: to Marcus.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As close as he is to Camby, he realizes that if there is a
target on his back, his best friend could go down with him. That is
why he purged himself from his past two years ago. But two years
ago, on a visit back to the neighborhood, Murray didn't know that
simply standing on the corner of Vine Street in the North End could
cause trouble for Camby, as well. That was proved in an incident
that is remembered by people on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   One night, a car crawled past Murray as he chatted with a woman
on the sidewalk. A few minutes later, the three men who had been in
the car stood before Murray with chrome pipes in one hand and
revolvers in the other. The woman fled.
</P>
<P>
   This was not about some old scam Murray had pulled in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people knew that me and Marcus were tight,'' Murray
said. ``They put two and two together and knew that if they got me,
they'd get some free cash. They knew that Marcus wouldn't go to the
police. Around here, what goes on in the streets has to stay on the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he knew if he bent to their demands to get in their
car, no one would ever see him again. He said that despite being
slapped with a gun and hit with a pipe, he kept his footing and
darted away as one man shot at him. With this memory dancing in his
head, Murray lets out a nervous laugh. ``I was Houdini that day,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Camby's cousin Jackson said, ``You never know what Marcus
would have gone through if Tamia hadn't gotten away.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray added: ``You know what you learn? Because of how tight I
am to Marcus, I can't even stand on a street corner. If something
happens to me, it happens to Marcus.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Wall of Protection _ Workouts, Movies And Biding Time &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Together, Camby and Murray have mourned friends who have been
murdered and have escaped close calls when it looked as if their
own numbers were up. Together, they hang out in a mansion now,
isolated from trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The circle around Camby has drastically closed in the last two
years. It includes Murray, but not Wray. As one friend put it,
``Boris is doing things that probably aren't best for Marcus.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray has a room at the house where leather couches sprawl in
front of television sets the size of department store windows.
Movies and video games, that is how the two entertain themselves.
Otherwise, Camby bides his time during the lockout by working out.
</P>
<P>
   He has added 20 pounds of muscle to his 6-11 frame, requiring
his tailor to resize his suits. Right now, he is the young forward
in wait after a June trade by the Knicks that sent Charles Oakley
to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm jumping out of my skin,'' Camby said. ``I can't wait to
get out there and play in the Garden and show people what I'm
really all about.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a fresh start for Camby. His injury-prone days in
Toronto _ where he had to play while news of his misdeeds at UMass
were exposed _ are in the past. And so, Camby promises, are the
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamia knows that I can't do things that I might want to do
because I'm in the limelight,'' Camby said. ``The friends I do have
know it's like, `Hey, you can't do certain things because you're my
friends.'''
</P>
<P>
   This fact was clear three days after the NCAA handed down
penalties to UMass in June 1997. That is when Camby was spotted
weaving on a road in South Windsor, Conn., not far from the luxury
home he bought for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, police pulled him over, smelled marijuana
in the car, found two burned ``roaches'' and arrested him. To avoid
a marijuana possession charge, Camby agreed to perform community
service.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Camby say the marijuana was not his, but a
friend's. If so, Camby's associations had hurt his name once again.
And this was after the agent scandal, after Camby was thought to
have learned from his past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Camby will be watched carefully now. One false step in
New York _ where heroes are showered in ticker tape and the fallen
are ridiculed in headlines _ and Camby's future earnings could be
jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   ``My past is behind me,'' Camby said. ``There aren't going to be
any other distractions. I know that and the couple of friends I
still have, they know that, too. Tamia and I have learned from the
past.''

 Color slides and black and white photos of Cate Blanchett in
``Elizabeth.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    She's the buzz of Hollywood: suddenly a front-runner for a best
actress Oscar for her stunning portrayal as England's Queen
Elizabeth I. It's a role that every actress in Britain would have
killed for.
 &HT;    But Australia's rising star Cate Blanchett has only one thing on
her mind: Getting home to Sydney with her husband of just over a
year Andrew Upton so they can spend Christmas with their families.
 &HT;    ``I have a very small family but Andrew's is enormous,'' she
said, ``so I'm hoping for a chaotic, loud, happy family
Christmas.''
 &HT;    The 28-year-old actress has already earned rave reviews for
portraying the troubled and naive English monarch in the film which
costars fellow Aussie Geoffrey Rush, Richard Attenborough, John
Gielgud, Joseph Fiennes (brother of English actor Ralph Fiennes)
and Christopher Eccleston.
 &HT;    Since finishing Elizabeth she has worked nonstop. She is just
finishing up ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' opposite Matt Damon and
Gwyneth Paltrow in Italy for ``English Patient'' director Anthony
Minghella, as well as ``Pushing Tin,'' a black comedy about air
traffic controllers with John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton. Both
films are due out in l999.
 &HT;    There follows a movie version of Oscar Wilde's play ``An Ideal
Husband'' and next March (Oscar time in Hollywood) she's returning
to Britain to appear on the London stage in David Hare's ``Plenty''
_ which was made into a movie in l985 with Meryl Streep and Sam
Neill, with direction by Australian Fred Schepisi.
 &HT;    Looking pale but beautiful after such a hectic work schedule and
sipping iced water in a Los Angeles hotel suite, Blanchett is
buoyed by all the talk of Oscar nominations. However she admits
that getting the role of Elizabeth was something of a coup.
 &HT;    Word was that she was going to be passed over because she was
not well known internationally, despite great reviews for l997's
``Oscar and Lucinda'' opposite Ralph Fiennes. Producers were
looking for someone more famous in Britain to star in a role about
a British monarch and so she had to do a screen test for Indian
director Shekhar Kapur.
 &HT;    The movie is a spectacular costume drama set in London in the
middle of the 16th century. Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII
and Anne Boleyn, is imprisoned at 16 by her half-sister Mary, but
swept onto the throne and crowned Queen of England at 23. To
survive she must sort out the machiavellian agendas on the
battlefield, in the church and in her court. Her enemies, most of
them powerful men, would appear to have the advantage, but
Elizabeth deploys whatever means necessary to keep her crown.
 &HT;    ``The main thing about getting the part was that the director
had confidence in me,'' she recalls. ``He had seen me in a trailer
of 'Oscar and Lucinda' and thought I was right for the part.
 &HT;    ``I must admit though, I was flabbergasted to get 'Oscar and
Lucinda.' And then 'Elizabeth.' I asked myself how did I find the
courage to do it. But I plunge into something and when it's done
sit back and say, my God.''
 &HT;    Blanchett grew up in Melbourne and says in her early years she
didn't yearn to be an actress. She was just 10 when her Texan
father Bob, a flamboyant advertising man, died suddenly, leaving
her mother June, a teacher, to bring up her and two siblings.
 &HT;    ``I was so fortunate that my mother was remarkable and held
things together for us. She introduced me to acting when I was 12
when she took me to see a production of 'They Shoot Horses Don't
They?' I was smitten by it.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless she started out studying economics and fine arts.
``I failed miserably at the economics and so I became sort of the
black sheep of the family,'' she laughs.
 &HT;    Unlike many Aussie actors, Blanchett didn't get her start on
Aussie soaps but learned her trade at the National Institute of
Dramatic Art in Sydney where she won plaudits on the boards in
``The Tempest,'' ``Hamlet,'' ``The Seagull'' and David Mamet's
``Oleanna.'' Her first film splash was as Susan McCarthy in Bruce
Beresford's ``Paradise Road.''
 &HT;    Just as her international movie career was taking off in June
l997 she married boyfriend Upton in a ceremony in the Blue
Mountains in New South Wales. Their home is in a Sydney beach
suburb, in a non-movie-star house which they've seen very little
of.
 &HT;    ``When I made 'Elizabeth' I saw very little daylight and had
virtually no social life,'' she says. ``I wore elaborate costumes
and very tight corsets. I had my eyebrows bleached, my eyelashes
bleached, my hairline shaved, half my hair dyed white _ so I didn't
get out much looking like that.''
 &HT;    She says her husband understands the demands her career makes on
her _ professionally and personally. ``I am very fortunate to have
a partner who is incredibly supportive of me.''
 &HT;    However she does admit she is a little torn between the demands
of a burgeoning career which could take her to the very top and her
desire to enjoy a normal life with her husband out of the
limelight.
 &HT;    For instance there's the question of a family _ to start one or
not. ``I think children are one of the few miracles left,'' she
says carefully.

  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about

lives.)

<P>
   QUESTION: Here I am at age 28 with a boyfriend who says I
shouldn't get mad at him when he hollers because he grew up in a
family where everybody screamed at each other. He says his family
is more dysfunctional than mine. _ Hollywood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Jeez! Dueling dysfunctions? I don't think you want to
go there and I definitely don't. Everybody's family _ and I do mean
everybody's _ is dysfunctional. I'm not sure where this national
obsession with blame began, but it's past time to put the
family-as-doomed-destiny thing to rest. We choose how we behave. If
you're unhappy about your boyfriend's behavior, talk with him about
it. Don't let him duck the issue by invoking the Ghost of Family
Past. The dysfunctional family blues are a variation of ``Woe is
me.'' Let's all repeat together: ``I'm in charge of my own life.
I'm responsible. I can function.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I feel guilty all the time. I don't spend enough time
with my kids. My wife complains that I'm cold and indifferent. My
mother, recently widowed, needs me. I'm in the really competitive
field of sales, so my free time is limited, but I try to get in a
couple of workouts each week because my dad had a bad ticker. I
can't please anyone, and when I find some time for myself, I feel
even worse. What should I do? _ Wheeling, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: First, take a deep breath here and relax. Guilt is
feeling good about feeling bad, and it's a colossal waste of time.
You've got a lot on your plate. Feeling tired and under the gun all
the time doesn't help anyone. Adding a huge dollop of guilt will
only sap more time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Sort through your priorities and get better at scheduling. If
you block out specific time to spend with your kids and schedule
private time for you and your wife to keep the spark alive, your
loved ones won't feel they have to beg for your attention. Make
sure you budget some time for yourself _ even if that means going
grocery shopping after work without the kids.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm afraid to let anyone get close to me because I've
been hurt too often. I know the right person will be patient. But
at 44, I've sure kissed a lot of frogs while looking for that
handsome, understanding prince. I'm really a good person. Why am I
still alone? _ Fort Pierce, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Everyone over 16 feels at some point that someone's
done 'em wrong and they're probably right. But this is the time to
take some emotional risks, not wallow in self-pity. I'm not
suggesting you march down to the harbor and pick up the first
sailor you meet. I am suggesting that it's time to get out of your
own way.
</P>
<P>
   Try the ``life is a daring risk or it's nothing at all''
blueprint for a month or two. Come out of your shell a bit. This
may mean taking tango lessons or flirting at the bus stop or
knocking that chip off your shoulder. You're making all those
inattentive men the bad guys. If you're a bristly ball of anger,
everyone will stay away.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been living together for a
year, and I want to get married. I work for him because he's trying
to get his business off the ground. We're living in his house,
which I'm helping to fix up. I love him, but I'm upset because but
every time I bring up the ``m'' word, he changes the subject. _
Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: You write ``welcome'' on your forehead and then you're
surprised when he steps on your face. Your boyfriend isn't
exploiting you. YOU are exploiting you.
</P>
<P>
   If you want your boyfriend to marry you, set a deadline and tell
him about it. If he refuses, move out and get on with your life. No
tears or cajolery. And don't even think about ``accidentally''
getting pregnant. If he wants to spend the rest of his life with
you, give him the opportunity to sort it out. If not, volunteer
with Habitat for Humanity to fix up someone else's home.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My parents divorced 16 years ago when I was 3. I
always thought Dad abandoned us. I've recently gotten in touch with
him and he says Mom and her parents said they'd sic the law on him
if he didn't clear out. I don't know who's telling the truth and
who's lying. _ Salem, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: A long time ago somebody said there are three sides to
every story: my side, your side and the truth. I think this person
was overly optimistic. Most of us can figure out several
``sensible'' versions to support our perspective.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to worry if one of your folks is lying. They
could both be telling the truth -- THEIR version of the truth. If
you look for your own version and leave them to do the same, you
can save a whole lot of wear and tear on your head, heart and
internal organs.

TIS THE SEASON TO HYPE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa., Texas)   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a slick calling card, a glossy photo with Ohio State's
colors of crimson and silver nicely pulling out Joe Germaine's
laser-locked brown eyes from behind his face mask. Heck, actors get
auditions for television pilots with far less glamorous head shots.
The copy on the 8-by-11 Heisman flier is concise. It pulls at
blue-collar heart strings.
</P>
<P>
   It covers the dramatic arc of how the Buckeye quarterback was
ignored coming out of high school, banished to a junior college,
became a part-time starter and finally was handed the reins of the
nation's consensus No. 1 team as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't being considered for the Heisman Trophy. He is
now,'' it concludes with all the subtlety of a fast-food
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   It will be out in the mail to Heisman voters Monday morning. But
is it too late? John Cappelletti, Penn State's Heisman winner in
1973, recently argued that November is the proper time to begin
identifying the best college player in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Cappelletti tell it, he was only an East Coast grinder
until the seventh game of the season and voters started to take
note of a pretty good Nittany Lions team winning in Happy Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's crazy,'' Cappelletti said earlier this season at a
reunion of that undefeated team. ``You got guys being put on the
list and taken off in the span of a weekend as soon as the season
starts. One bad performance, you're out. A big game you're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's guilty of the Dow Jonesing of college players. The
school's athletic departments _ Georgia's Champ Bailey and Oregon's
Akili Smith _ had brief Heisman run ups Syracuse's Donovan McNabb
remains the Big Blue of Heisman prospects: a solid performer but
not sexy enough to bet the ranch on.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-coaches and players on the sports networks also tout
their choices on a 24-hour cycle. Yes, this newspaper has added and
dropped names from its Sunday ``Heisman Watch'' graphic as the
season has progressed. This year's Heisman race, however, has
bubbled along at a low boil. None of the candidates so far have
captured anyone's passions in the way Peyton Manning and Charles
Woodson did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mercifully, the new Bowl Championship Series rankings
have provided new material for grousing and graphics. They are
intended to match the two best teams in a title game by factoring
in computer data and strength of schedule. Last week, the uproar
was about UCLA being ranked No. 1 ahead of Ohio State _ despite the
Buckeyes' position atop the news media and coaches polls.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments, predictably, were short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   By waxing Indiana, 38-7, Ohio State (8-0) remained No. 1 in the
voting polls and recaptured the top spot in the New York Times
Computer Ranking. The Bruins (7-0), however, fell across the board
because of a narrow, 28-24, comeback victory over lowly Stanford
(1-7), The Times' No. 91 ranked team. UCLA fell to No. 4 in The
Times poll, No. 3 in the news media poll and No. 4 in the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   So when the BCS ranking is released Monday look for Ohio State
and Tennessee to be ranked No. 1 and No. 2, followed by Kansas
State and UCLA. And alas, the shouting will commence until another
shuffle next week.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Texas' Ricky Williams has a new challenger for
the trophy he certainly deserves. Germaine's Heisman candidacy
officially kicked off in the fourth quarter of the Indiana game
when his coach, John Cooper, elected to leave him in deep into the
fourth quarter so he could surpass 300 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   In Cooper's tenure at Ohio State, the only other time he helped
a player look good on the stat sheet was in 1995 when Eddie George
was in Heisman contention. George won it that year, deservedly so.
And Germaine got his 351 yards, which set school records for most
consecutive 300 yard games (four), the most in a season (five) and
most in a career (six).
</P>
<P>
   Germaine is a strong runner-up, as is UCLA's Cade McNown. Both
are guiding undefeated teams. McNown has received more attention _
though Germaine has better numbers: 2,214 yards and 17 touchdowns
to McNown's 1,861 yards and 13 touchdowns. Germaine is savvy enough
to know that, however moving his late-blooming tale is, it has cost
him in the all-important hype department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure splitting time last year didn't help,'' Germaine said
of the dual-quarterback arrangement he shared with Stanley Jackson.
``But it's something that in November, I'm in position to win the
award that goes to the best college player.''
</P>
<P>
   Germaine has passed, led and won his way into that position. No
one should fault the Ohio State sports information department for
not moving sooner, either. Restraint and an embarrassment of riches
prompted its deliberate approach.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning of the season, Ohio State believed linebacker
Andy Katzenmoyer or wide receiver David Boston might emerge as
contenders. Katzenmoyer made the already difficult road for a
defensive player impossible when he had to sweat out classes in
golf, music and AIDS Awareness in summer school to be academically
eligible. Boston is a worthy candidate for the Biletnikoff Award
given to the nation's top receiver, but he is far from the best
player in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is amazing that anyone believes Williams' claim on the
Heisman is suspect. He needs only 294 yards to break Tony Dorsett's
Division I-A career yardage record after a dazzling 150-yard
performance against Nebraska in Texas' 20-16 upset Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He had been handicapped by the perception that the Longhorns
weren't winners. Well, they're 6-2, ranked No. 9 by the Times
computer, finally entered the Top 25 in the news media and coaches
polls, and can play in the Big 12 championship game if they beat
Oklahoma State, Texas Tech and Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's defensive coordinator, Charlie McBride, unequivocally
cast his vote for Williams and characterized his performance
against the Cornhuskers as one of ``a man against boys.'' The more
impressive endorsement came from hundreds of Nebraska fans who
waited after the game to give Williams a standing ovation as he
left the field. This, after Nebraska's nation-leading 47-game
home-winning streak had been snapped.
</P>
<P>
   No softies, some Big Red faithful have been known to hurl more
invective than applause at opponents from that same vantage point.
Still, they cheered excellence. Williams was moved. ``It's the most
fun I've ever had playing a game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska fans know something about the game. Their team has
won three of the last four national championships. They cast their
votes. No glossy head shots for them _ simply an appreciation of
the hard-hitting, helmet-to-helmet kind.

BY UNANIMOUS DECISION, HAMED WAS MEDIOCRE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ It did not take long for Prince Naseem
Hamed to recover from the boos that rained down on him from the
crowd of 8,138 at the Atlantic City Convention Center on Saturday
night. Only an hour after his unspectacular 12-round unanimous
decision over Wayne McCullough, Hamed was threatening to knock out
Angel Manfredy, the junior-lightweight dynamo who will fight Floyd
Mayweather Jr. on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do what you have to do and then you'll get beat like the rest
of them,'' Hamed shouted at Manfredy, who was at the post-fight
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   After Hamed's performance in retaining his World Boxing
Organization featherweight title, it sounded more like bluster than
his normal rhetoric. Hamed was running and backpedaling on his
bicycle so much that he completed two phases of a triathlon during
the 12-round bout. If there had been a moat around the ring, he
would have completed the event.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, who remained upright the whole fight despite Hamed's
prediction of a third-round knockout, said: ``I just did what I
could. Naseem hit me with his best shots in the first three rounds
and then he decided to run away like an amateur for the rest of the
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamed replied that he adopted the same strategy as Muhammad Ali
and Sugar Ray Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, it was an unsatisfactory performance in the
eyes of the Atlantic City crowd, which was swelled by Irish
supporters of McCullough, a Belfast-born boxing silver medalist for
Ireland in the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   American crowds are accustomed to seeing fighters like Arturo
Gatti, the lightweight who slings leather from the opening bell to
the end. They have come to accept the juking style of Pernell
Whitaker, but Whitaker doesn't run on with talk about flattening
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain level of expectation for a fighter like
Hamed,'' said Seth Abraham, president of sports for HBO-Time
Warner, which televised the fight. ``It was the same with Muhammad
Ali. When he doesn't meet those expectations, people are
disappointed. But they have to realize, in this game you're not
going to pitch a shutout every time you step into the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamed scored big with the judges. The most rounds McCullough won
on any card was four. According to the punch statistics compiled by
Compubox, the two fighters threw almost the same number of punches
_ 742 for Hamed and 740 for McCullough. But Hamed connected on
twice as many (340 to 170) and on more power punches (55 percent to
34 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how he landed two punches to one,''
McCullough said. ``I was flicking the jab and something was
landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamed's lackluster performance was set in motion last week when
he couldn't get to the United States because his promoter failed to
secure a work visa. He sat in London until Tuesday morning, while
HBO scrambled to get him the visa. Hamed was in town for just four
days before he climbed into the ring. The turnaround was just too
short for him to be crisp.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged as much afterward, but said he didn't want to
use his late arrival as an excuse. Once he realized he wasn't going
to knock out McCullough, Hamed shifted his efforts to securing a
victory and not getting hurt. It was a wily move, but it probably
cost him some American fans.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed said his next United States fight will be in Las Vegas,
though his next bout will be in London, possibly the first weekend
in March. There is no shortage of opponents for Hamed, as witnessed
by Manfredy's presence. The candidates include Marco Antonio
Barrera, who scored a third-round technical knockout over Richie
Wenton to win the WBO junior-featherweight title on the undercard.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough is sure of one thing. He won't be the next opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggressive fighters should get more points than I got,'' he
said. ``That's why I deserve a rematch. But I probably won't get
one.''

kindly, remind you that 1968 was a very, very long time ago. It's
about a woman born to an unmarried mother and determined not to let
the same thing happen to a child of her own. It's hard for Janice
Benson to imagine ``Love Child'' becoming a hit today. The kids she
works with just couldn't identify. The lyrics seem quaint as a lace
doily. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

 &HT;    Analyst says 'hold' Saf T Lok because of SEC probe
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's rare when a gathering in the White
House Rose Garden makes investors dizzy for a small-cap stock.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Saf T Lok, a small gun-lock manufacturer based in West
Palm Beach, had fallen to a dismal 37 cents a share in late
September of last year. The company had lost $733,790 in the first
nine months of the year on disappointing sales, according to
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and was facing
delisting by the Nasdaq Stock Market. Then President Clinton
stepped into the Rose Garden on Thursday, Oct. 9, 1997, with eight
major gun manufacturers. He extracted their pledge to put locks on
every gun sold, launching Saf T Lok's second life.
</P>
<P>
   In two days, Saf T Lok's share price soared 11-fold. In four
days, it cut a financing deal that assured its place on Nasdaq and
gave it capital for the future.
</P>
<P>
   It was the company's highest point. Before and since, Saf T Lok,
10 years old next year, has stumbled. In the past two years alone,
it has dumped two chief executives. It's also fighting two
shareholder lawsuits that allege it hyped its stock and has
depended on offshore investments to keep it afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Saf T Lok officials have not returned repeated phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The company's problems worsened in July when the SEC launched an
informal investigation into the company's accounting practices and
a shareholder filed suit, claiming he and other shareholders were
misled by the company. A second shareholder's suit was filed in
August. The suits are pending, and attorneys have asked to combine
them into a single suit, said Neil Zola, an attorney for
shareholder Joseph Yud. The SEC's inquiry is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Saf T Lok Chief Executive Frank Brooks defended his company in
September at its annual meeting of shareholders. Saf T Lok has nine
patents to its credit after nine years in operation, and finally is
ready to start marketing its locks, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a shareholder, too. I'd like to get these out to the
market just like you,'' Brooks told shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's stock has fallen to just over $1 a share from
more than $5, and for a reason, said analyst Cheryl Bostater of
Chatfield Dean &AMP; Co., a stockbrokerage in Greenwood Village, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Bostater has recommended that investors ``hold'' Saf T Lok
because of the SEC's informal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always a major distraction, at the very least, and I'm
not sure what's going to come from it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Saf T Lok touts its locks as superior to other gun safety
devices, such as trigger locks and lock boxes, because the latter
need keys. The Saf T Lok, incorporated into a handgun's grip, works
by depressing three small plungers, each keyed to a number in a
combination. A gun can be unlocked the dark.
</P>
<P>
   A locked gun can't be fired, but when it is needed _ say, when
there's a burglar in the house _ it can be released quickly for
use, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The company doesn't conceal its giant-size obstacle to posting a
profit. The retail price of the gun lock is $90. Adding that to the
average gun cost, and the typical gun owner ``has to be seriously
motivated about gun safety ... to add 30 percent onto the price of
the gun'' to use a Saf T Lok, the company said in SEC documents.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Miller, chairman of the Coalition of New Jersey
Sportsmen, issued a warning letter to his group's members about Saf
T Lok in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company says they're the only lock that can be used on a
loaded gun. That goes against one of the prime safety premises:
You'd never put a trigger lock on a loaded gun. It's a good way to
shoot yourself (accidentally),'' Miller said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Saf T Lok, started in 1989, was a private company looking for
capital until Feb. 13, 1996, when it bought publicly traded RGB
Computer &AMP; Video of Riviera Beach in a stock deal. RGB had been
losing money, selling video-editing systems tied to the antiquated
Commodore computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, the new company found itself in controversy. The
Wall Street Journal reported that government agencies and companies
that supposedly had endorsed the company's locks _ the Secret
Service among them _ denied they had done so. The company blamed it
on casual statements made to its public relations firm, which in
turn repeated the ``endorsements'' in promotional pamphlets. The
stock fell by $2.25 a share to $5.63.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two months, RGB soon was on the rise again. An
investment newsletter _ one that doesn't demand or accept
reimbursement for stock recommendations _ touted the new gun lock.
The stock then hit a high of $19 in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company soon changed its name to Saf T Lok, and executives
demonstrated the lock at the company's first meeting for
shareholders after the RGB deal. Shareholders were giddy about the
rise in the stock price, even though the company had sold only 500
locks.
</P>
<P>
   But Saf T Lok couldn't stay away from trouble. In November 1996,
Brooks hired and fired a new chief executive, Lisa Broderick, or
she quit on her own, depending on whom you believe, bringing on
more controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The company said in a news release that Broderick left after
only eight days because of ``differences with the company,'' but
Brooks told Bloomberg News he fired her because she didn't come up
with $7 million she promised to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw her out the door,'' he said. He later backpedaled,
saying she left on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick sent a scathing resignation letter to Brooks two days
before the announcement of her leaving. In the letter, which was
submitted in Broderick's suit against Saf T Lok, she complained
that five of the company's 12 employees were family members and ``3
to 4 additional employees were apparently incompetent.'' She also
described Saf T Lok as ``a technically bankrupt, deeply troubled
company.'' Broderick's attorney would not comment when contacted.
</P>
<P>
   The suit by Broderick and her husband was filed in Martin County
Circuit Court, claiming libel, slander and loss of consortium. The
suit is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, Broderick had suggested seeking investors in
Italy, using the SEC's Regulation S, Brooks said, according to the
lawsuit. He was opposed to it, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next year, that's what Brooks did. Regulation S stock
usually is sold offshore at a discount, and the deals require less
disclosure to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Garden factor
</P>
<P>
   From April to November last year, the company sold almost 1.7
million shares of stock in four so-called Reg S sales to offshore
investors, bringing in more than $3 million, SEC documents show.
</P>
<P>
   The final sale last November followed Clinton's Rose Garden
meeting. It required Saf T Lok to hire as business consultant New
York-based A.B. &AMP; Associates and Las Vegas-based Marketing Direct
Concepts as its public relations firm, and that they be paid from
the proceeds, SEC documents show.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing firm went right to work in mid-January of this
year, issuing six news releases about Saf T Lok in 16 working days.
The releases covered the company's new chief executive, John
Gardner, testifying before the New York City Council on the need
for gun safety legislation, about an order for $560,000 in gun
locks from a new national distributor, United Safety Action, and
about patents the company had earned for its locks.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based United Safety Action is run by Arthur Braun of
Monsey, N.Y. In February of this year, Saf T Lok announced Braun
had agreed to buy $20 million in gun locks over two years, and
would join Saf T Lok in a $5 million advertising campaign,
according to a company news release.
</P>
<P>
   About nine months later, Braun says he is just finishing work on
the advertising campaign and an agency is negotiating with national
magazines to place the ads. He expected the ads to start running
``in the next couple of months.'' He was unsure how much they would
cost.
</P>
<P>
   But back in February, before the company made the Braun
announcement, it was blind-sided by two news releases from a New
York-based stock trading company, Quantum Group Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   A trader at Quantum, Steve Ehlers, said in a release that it was
his opinion that Saf T Lok was ``being hyped up to unrealistic
levels that are unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers was critical of the company's deal with offshore
investors because it funneled $2 million in ``incentives'' to
consultants. He questioned the sale of 665,000 shares of Saf T Lok
stock by executives. Some investors see the sale of stock by
executives as a sign of impending trouble for a company.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Quantum statement, Saf T Lok stock nearly had doubled
in value in the short time after the company's new marketing firm
had begun firing off news releases. After each release, its stock
would creep upward. Then came Quantum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quantum believes this is a pump-and-dump scheme,'' Quantum's
release said. ``The company's aggressive focus on the price of the
stock is very alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``pump-and-dump scheme'' is when a company seeks to inflate
the price of its stock so insiders can then sell their shares at a
higher profit.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum acknowledged that it was a short seller of the stock,
however, betting that it would drop in value.
</P>
<P>
   Insider trading
</P>
<P>
   There was heavy insider selling at Saf T Lok, records show.
After Clinton's announcement, the company's stock price jumped
nearly 600 percent, and a rash of insider selling began.
</P>
<P>
   Before the president's statement on Oct. 9 last year, the last
time an insider sold stock was July 30, records show. But on the
day of the announcement, Brooks sold 69,000 shares for a total
$204,240. By the end of the month, Brooks had shed 179,000 shares
for a total $697,700. Gardner sold 200,000 shares for a total
$515,300. Brooks' son, Jeffrey, a vice president, had unloaded
48,000 shares taking in $152,160, Chief Engineer Eugene Horanoff
had sold 47,000 shares for $163,665, and Director William Schmidt
had sold 34,300 shares for $156,505. Brooks and his son, and
Schmidt, still own shares in the company as of Aug. 10 this year.
</P>
<P>
   1.5 million shares sold
</P>
<P>
   Following the sales, Saf T Lok stock began dropping _ until Oct.
22, when the company announced that former U.S. Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D.-Ariz. and former U.S. Rep. James Stanton, D-Ohio, had
signed on as directors. The announcement boosted the stock price
for two days before it began to falter again. Each holds 255,000
shares of Saf T Lok stock, according to the company's proxy, dated
Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are getting us in places we wouldn't have been able to go
to,'' Brooks said at the annual stockholders meeting. ``They're
earning their keep.''
</P>
<P>
   According to CDA/Investnet, a research firm in Fort Lauderdale,
insiders of Saf T Lok have sold 1.5 million shares since Saf T Lok
bought RGB less than two years ago, with the largest chunk sold by
Brooks, the founder. He sold more than 570,000 shares. He holds
almost 11 percent of the company's stock, according to Saf T Lok's
proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   Saf T Lok is not without support from some analysts. Howard
Stillman, a New York broker, and Craig Woodward of Woodward Trading
in Atlanta have endorsed the company based on increasing awareness
of the need for gun safety. This year, Stillman predicted a $20 to
$40 share price within 12 to 24 months; Woodward gave a target
price of $30 a share in 12 months and $12 to $15 in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has not risen above $5.22 a share in the past year,
and its average was $2.77.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers, the short-seller at Quantum, and Stillman and Woodward
could not be reached for comment. None is certified as an analyst
with the Association for Investment Management and Research, an
industry group that tests prospective analysts and then registers
those who pass those tests. Neither is Bostater, the Chatfield Dean
&AMP; Co. analyst who recommends a ``hold'' on Saf T Lok stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts don't have to be certified, but the designation is
sought by mainstream investment houses. All are securities brokers,
according to the National Association of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Bostater projected a target price of $10 a share in the next 12
to 24 months. She based her projection on the company's recent
orders with two distributors. But that was before Saf T Lok's
announcement in July that it is under an SEC informal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's waiting to see some progress from Saf T Lok before
issuing a new target price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't feel comfortable putting out another target with
management still up in the air, and the SEC is still a concern,''
she said. ``Part of it, too, is seeing a track record of results.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's latest troubles began July 21, when trading of Saf
T Lok on the Nasdaq Stock Market was halted for part of the day on
news that it might restate its first-quarter results. It also said
the SEC had launched the informal inquiry. In an informal
investigation, the SEC requests that the company submit documents
voluntarily. In a formal inquiry, the SEC can subpoena documents.
</P>
<P>
   Saf T Lok's auditors, Goldberg Persches &AMP; Co., had expressed
concern about the value of warrants to buy 2 million shares of
company stock for $5 a share, according to SEC documents. The
warrants were issued in February to United Safety Action as part of
its deal to distribute products for Saf T Lok, according to
documents filed with the SEC. The stock was trading for as much as
$5.21 a share in February. As of Aug. 10, United Safety Action
owned 1 million shares of Saf T Lok, or 7.3 percent of the company,
according to Saf T Lok's proxy.
</P>
<P>
   The company hired an appraiser to help auditors decide how to
value the warrants and ultimately decided that it wouldn't have to
restate its results.
</P>
<P>
   Then the shareholder lawsuits began. Law firms in Fort
Lauderdale and New York filed against the company. It accused the
company of lying to investors in a May 26 news release on a deal
with Semiconductor Laser International Corp. to co-develop ``an
optical laser-driven fingerprint locking mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see we are being set up by this,'' Brooks told
shareholders at this year's annual meeting. ``We feel confident we
didn't break any laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward issued his $30-a-share projection the day after the
laser deal was announced. The company's stock rose $1.25 a share on
17 million shares traded. For comparison, IBM's average trading
volume is less than 4 million shares a day on 972 million shares
outstanding as of the end of the third quarter of 1997. Saf T Lok
had almost 7 million shares outstanding at the end of that same
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Deal too costly
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he later canceled the laser deal because it would
have cost the company $2 million to $3 million in research and
development, and fired Chief Executive Gardner after 14 months on
the job. But the lawsuit accuses Saf T Lok management of knowing
the laser deal would never have resulted in a product breakthrough,
and that Woodward's projection was overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Semiconductor Laser) had no experience with fingerprint
recognition and did not have the capability to actually carry out
the proposed development of the technology,'' the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, Gardner filed his own suit against Saf T Lok
and Brooks, saying he was libeled and fired without cause, and was
not allowed to exchange options for nearly 1 million shares of
stock. Gardner would not comment when reached.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the company got a big break when one of its
distributors, Endzone USA, signed Sports Authority to a gun lock
order valued at $35,000. But Bostater is still unsure what to make
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely good news. But it's impossible to tell how
successful sales are on the retail level at this point,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Saf T Lok's annual meeting of shareholders in September,
Brooks said the company finally is in a position to sell its
products. It has been slowed by lack of cash and bad timing. It had
spent all its money to develop the Saf T Lok when it realized that
half the market had handguns with magazines _ cartridges that hold
bullets and can be installed quickly. Saf T Lok's product was not
developed for such guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped our marketing effort to work on the new lock. We
had to raise more money and develop a new product,'' Brooks said at
the shareholders meeting. ``We were broke and struggling. The only
thing we could do is go for a Reg S (overseas financing plan).''
</P>
<P>
   It raised $2 million, got $1 million up-front from a New
York-based distributor and developed a marketing strategy. ``The
strategy is for them to fill the pipeline for the residential
market and Saf T Lok to go after law enforcement,'' Brooks said at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The company has delivered its first shipments of 25,000 locks to
the distributor and has moved into a larger building in the
Northpoint Corporate Park in West Palm Beach, where it employs 30
to 35 people to assemble the locks.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, his son Jeffrey who is also a director of the company,
and Steve Eccher, Saf T Lok's vice president of marketing, have
been meeting with police departments and sheriff's offices to hawk
their product. One department in Illinois has made it mandatory for
officers to use gun locks when off duty. Last month, the company
gave locks to Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies to try out. But
it takes time for police chiefs and sheriffs to get approval to
spend money on equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The route we're taking in law enforcement is a real long-term
route,'' Brooks said at the shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also told shareholders he believes the company will do
better than the dismal financial showing of last year, when it lost
$5.3 million on $15,926 in sales. If the company can produce sales,
its stock price will rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every company has these things happen,'' Brooks, who owns 1.49
million shares of the company's stock as of Aug. 10, told
shareholders. ``People want to know if we're hyping the stock, if
we're doing something wrong. We're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Saf T Lock stock closed Friday at $1.34 a share.

THE CLINTON FOLLIES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER APPLEBOME    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A gray-wigged Bill Clinton impersonator wobbles and
lurches, bug-eyed and horrified, from one sexual malapropism to
another. He sings ``If I Was a Rich Man,'' from ``Fiddler on the
Roof,'' in a suggestive Yiddish-sounding muddle of imaginary body
parts. Two reporters happen upon Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones,
and they all break into a randy version of ``Chattanooga Choo
Choo'' about seeing something other than a train.
</P>
<P>
   Can this still be funny? Apparently so, if the reaction of
audiences at the Chicago City Limits comedy review ``Subpoenas
Envy'' is any indication.
</P>
<P>
   The question that arises is if everyone is so sick of
Washington's endless sexual soap opera, how come there is always
room for one more good cigar or dry cleaning joke at the expense of
the Big He?
</P>
<P>
   And the answer seems to be, for better or worse, that it's now
the American way.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Nicole Baker says she has the same view of the Clinton
follies as almost everyone else does: She's sick of it. She wants
it to go away. She'd be thrilled if the whole sordid ensemble
quietly slunk off somewhere. She is even a supporter of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But there she was the other night, at the comedy club, at First
Avenue and 61st Street in Manhattan, feeling almost patriotic about
being entertained by presidential anatomy humor, presidential lying
humor and the general run of scandal humor that a veritable
comedy-industrial complex of clubs, late-night comics and Web sites
have been churning out for almost a year now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing has been blown way out of proportion,
but I guess I like the fact that people can be so brazen in saying
whatever they want about Clinton,'' said Ms. Baker, who works as a
theatrical stage manager. ``I think it's great that we're in
America and can say whatever we think. Actually, it would be nice
if he could see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Morris Davidson, a retired New Jersey neurosurgeon
turned New York boulevardier, rolled his eyes at the notion that
the American people were sick of hearing about Clinton's seamy
travails.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love it,'' he said. ``They're not tired of it. They're on
it like wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago City Limits has been mixing topical humor with free-form
improvisation in New York since 1979. On a typical evening, the
four-member troupe veers from a quick-witted blizzard of Clinton
skits to improvisations on Paul McCartney's ``Let It Be'' as
interpreted by Chekhov and Mamet to Dolly the Cloned Sheep's
soulful version of the blues song ``Bad to the Bone.'' (``Baaaaah,
I'm a clone. Baaabaaabaaabaahhhhh, I'm a clone.'')
</P>
<P>
   The cast members of Chicago City Limits say they don't want to
do too much of the Clinton humor, which despite the show's name is
less than 20 percent of the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while I thought, if you do Monica Lewinsky, it's just a
cheap laugh,'' said Denny Siegel, the only woman in the troupe.
``But I realize it's become like an in-joke that people want to
share. They're waiting for it to come up; there's like a gratified
laugh I've come to recognize. You know, someone brings up the pizza
story again, and everyone cracks up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't use it, I don't know if people would walk out
feeling cheated, but there's that sense of recognition,
camaraderie, fellowship, as if we're all sharing something, and
it's fine as long as we don't overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, by now, subsets of Clinton comedy: late-night
one-liners; Clinton impersonators; the panoply of Internet humor,
from Bill Clinton as the Dancing Baby, to The Official Bill Clinton
Is a Marionette Who Is Controlled By Aliens Web Page, to the Bill
Clinton Joke of the Day. (Heard the one about Bill Clinton and
Jerry Falwell on an airplane?)
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is not a scandal that is spawning modern-day
Molieres. And with saturation coverage of impossible-to-top
marathons like the president's bravura performance piece of grand
jury testimony, it is easier to imagine people paying money not to
be reminded of the Clinton-Lewinsky-Tripp saga than paying to be
entertained by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Oh, you must be having a field day with this,'''
said Paul Zuckerman, the show's producer and director. ``But I keep
thinking, `What else do you say about it?' It plays to a
voyeuristic side we all have, but it's been hard. And it's moved so
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe how many pieces we had to discard because
the situation changed. Actually, I liked Watergate better. Nixon
was an easier target and the cast of characters, Haldeman,
Ehrlichman. Now those were creepy guys.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the commingling of politics and entertainment
has come a long way since Watergate. The soaring ratings of the
nonstop cable blabfests about the Clinton saga are probably the
best example. But the persistence of Clinton comedy, even among his
supporters, shows how the scandal has morphed from a political
event to mass entertainment, what George magazine this month calls
``a rather low-budget sexual thriller'' with Hollywood's favored
pairing of an older man and a younger woman and a sprawling cast of
impeccably drawn character actors in supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even those on Clinton's side in the end sounded more
like critics of theater than of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was all very funny,'' said Jerry Cox, who writes
hip-hop music and poetry and supports Clinton. ``But if it was me,
I'd want a skit with Starr. You could have him as this guy who's
searching for something that's not there and then it's like he
takes whatever he can get. He's looking for gold, but finds silver,
so he says, `OK, I'll settle for silver.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is often argued that there is something debased in the whole
process, that Clinton's behavior or the national political meltdown
surrounding it is no joke, and just as it is impossible to imagine
comedy skits based on Dwight D. Eisenhower's anatomy, the society
has come down a few notches on the evolutionary scale since then.
</P>
<P>
   But then who knows? Carl Kissin, who portrays Clinton in the
show, argues that the role of comedy has always been to throw cream
pies at the powerful, and audiences inevitably find some measure of
enjoyment in the foibles of the rich and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Staying current is, of course, the curse of topical comedy. One
of the show's more popular bits has people counting down excitedly,
``Five, four, three, two, one,'' and then exclaiming, ``Who would
have thought the Dow would hit zero!'' It was funnier a month ago
with the Dow in free fall than it is with it at least temporarily
stabilized now.
</P>
<P>
   But, then, while scandals ebb and flow, some comedic verities,
like enjoying the misfortunes of others, are probably eternal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did Mel Brooks say?'' said John O'Donnell, another cast
member. ``Tragedy is if I cut my finger. Comedy is if you fall into
an open manhole and die.''

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The best part of taking 74
eighth_graders to the zoo is bringing all 74 of them back. The boss
is kind of picky about coming out even, I remind myself as I watch
the buses load. Four teachers, eight parent chaperones, four
coolers filled with bottled water, fruit, cookies, and enough ham
and cheese sandwiches to feed the economy section of a 747. I guess
we're ready to go. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Pop songs are like time
machines. Take the Supremes' hit ``Love Child,'' which topped the
charts 30 years ago. It's one of those pop songs that, to put it
kindly, remind you that 1968 was a very, very long time ago. It's
about a woman born to an unmarried mother and determined not to let
the same thing happen to a child of her own. It's hard for Janice
Benson to imagine ``Love Child'' becoming a hit today. The kids she
works with just couldn't identify. The lyrics seem quaint as a lace
doily. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   THE-MECHANIC _ ATLANTA _ I recently attended a public hearing
held by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. The turnout
was small _ a handful of auto industry representatives and state
bureaucrats. We in the auto repair industry weren't required to be
there. We didn't go because the subject matter was especially
spectacular. The agenda item we had come to hear and object to was
the extension of the $200 waiver limit for vehicles failing the
metro Atlanta area's emission test _ and continuing to contribute
to the deterioration of Atlanta's air quality. The waiver limit
means cars that fail the state's emission test can be granted a
waiver _ and permission to get new tags for two years _ if the
owner spends at least $200 fixing the car and it shows some
improvement. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ Every time I download a new version of Netscape
Communicator or Microsoft Internet Explorer _ the two most popular

multi-function of a Swiss Army knife. The competition has gotten so
heated between the two Web browsers that each tries hard to outdo

   MAC-REPORT _ ATLANTA _ No question about it. The iMac is one
sharp-looking computer. But is it a good buy? I'd argue not. A
better investment would be any of Apple Computer's G3 desktop
models. Now, before you start flaming me with e-mail charges of
betrayal, let me explain. I consider the iMac a good, if not great,
computer. It works reasonably well, has a brilliantly sharp screen

 &HT;    MAKING TRACKS ACROSS EUROPE: The gamble of Monte Carlo
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Joe Murray has been traveling around Western
Europe by train. This is one in a series of stories.)
</P>
<P>
   MONTE CARLO TO MILAN _ Everyone knows Monaco's real-life fairy
tale of love and romance, movie queen marries prince.
</P>
<P>
   I know another one. I met her by chance on the train between
Monte Carlo and Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Close your eyes and it's as if you were listening to Greta
Garbo. Such is Kathleen's Swedish accent.
</P>
<P>
   Open your eyes and you won't want to close them again. Such is
Kathleen's beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and willowy, with blondish brown hair, blue eyes and lovely
features, she's the kind of young woman you'd think would be a
fashion model. You'd think right.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen became a model at age 16 in Sweden after being spotted
on the street by a woman whose job it was to be on the lookout for
girls with the right kind of looks.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself was a fairy tale of sorts, how she toured much of
the world _ Europe, America and Asia _ with the fashion runway as
her stage.
</P>
<P>
   But that part of the story is only prologue. Besides, it wasn't
so glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Kathleen said, frowning a beautiful frown. ``In
the evening it was fun, and it was fun when you traveled. But the
work is very stressful, and it is dull.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that she came to Monte Carlo, for a fashion show, and
that's where her husband-to-be saw her for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   After just one week, they became as one. They've been married
for six months. She is 25. He is 32. And it is paradise, such is
life as a newlywed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to hear Kathleen tell it, this is paradise in paradise,
such is life in Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it the Doll City,'' Kathleen said, ``because
everything is so pretty, so clean and so nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is really nice to live in Monaco. You have people from
all over the world here, and all of them living in good harmony
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Really nice, but really expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest apartment costs more than $1,250 a month to rent,
she said. To go out to eat, it is a minimum of $100 per person.
</P>
<P>
   But, yes, it's really nice, especially if your husband's family
has substantial investments in real estate. Imagine the value of
real estate in the doll-like principality of Monaco, only 368 acres
in size.
</P>
<P>
   Nice, too, to know the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie, the daughter of Prince Rainier and the late Princess
Grace, is a friend of Kathleen's husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the one with the new baby,'' Kathleen said. ``She is
very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Without being asked, Kathleen adds:
</P>
<P>
   ``Her sister Caroline is very snobby.''
</P>
<P>
   But never mind that. ``We like the place,'' she said. ``It is
really calm, it is secure to walk around anywhere. You can go out
at midnight with all the gold and diamonds you have, and nothing
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   People are people everywhere. But in Monaco, it seems that the
police are something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing will happen to you in Monaco because we have lots of
police and security cameras everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A police state, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' Kathleen said, shaking her pretty head. ``All the
security, all the police, is because they don't want any bad
persons to come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no bad people here. The tourists who come to Monaco,
they don't have any problems, unless they do something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is very bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they have to leave immediately,'' Kathleen said, sadly.
``And they can never come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think about it, maybe this wasn't a fairy tale after
all. Perhaps it's more on the proportion of an epic poem.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise Lost, as it were.

   &UR; By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Ayers Rock, or ``Uluru'' as it's called in Appalachian, is the
world's largest single stone monolith, rising 1,143 feet above
Australia's seemingly endless desert plain. It is as much a symbol
of the continent as Mt. Fuji is of Japan. It's also as steep a
climb as Masada in Israel, the Grand Canyon in the United States or
the Great Wall in China.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers Rock must exude some primal force that draws tourists from
faraway places, who view the sun rising and setting over it, walk
the six miles around its base and, in some cases, climb to its top.
</P>
<P>
   Among those attracted to this geologic wonder was Dennis
Cavagnaro, a veteran traveler from Oakland, Calif. Like many mature
travelers, he is a little overweight. Despite two hip replacements,
he refused to go quietly into his 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't easy!'' Cavagnaro said. ``The reward of the climb is
the sense of achievement and the spectacular 360-degree view.''
</P>
<P>
   It's best to climb Ayers Rock early in the morning before the
direct, unfiltered sunlight makes it unbearably hot. An early start
also allows the breeze to keep away flies and other biting insects.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers in Cavagnaro's tour group piled out of bed in
pitch-black darkness so that they wouldn't miss the sunrise over
the rock. They had to travel 11 miles from the comfortable resort
at Yulara Village outside Uluru National Park, an Aboriginal
National Park leased to the Commonwealth of Australia. To enter the
park you must show your prepaid entrance ticket ($10) at the ranger
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't the first or last group to reach the western tip of
Uluru's base,'' Cavagnaro said. ``We could see a thin line of hardy
climbers already creeping vertically up the only approved trail.''
</P>
<P>
   The trail's only identifying mark is a low steel chain. Since
there are no other natural features on the rock, the climbers, at a
distance, could easily have passed for ants.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the trail is a sign that explains how the
Aboriginal owners have given permission for people to climb the
rock, but the natives prefer that people don't. A sign also warns
climbers of the dangers: At least 26 climbers have perished on the
rock since 1965 _ 20 from heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the climb requires picking the most efficient
path through 200 yards of huge broken boulders. These have earned
the derisive name ``Chicken Rocks.'' It is here that many initially
intrepid climbers decide it's best to simply explore Uluru's base.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Chicken Rocks,'' there's another 200 yards of bare
surface sandstone which rises at about a 45-degree incline.
Cavagnaro says it's imperative that a climber's footwear have
``grip,'' because that's the only thing that can keep a person from
slipping back down the mountainside _ especially if it's windy.
</P>
<P>
   A steel chain was Cavagnaro's lifesaver. It was supported by
stanchions placed about every five yards. The stanchion is
suspended only two feet off the rock's surface. The low height
isn't a problem since climbers are already bent forward trying to
pull themselves up. The chain also affords some security for
resting and catching your breath.
</P>
<P>
   Rest stops proved to be heartbreaking, Cavagnaro says. He felt
as though he wasn't getting any closer to the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only measure of gain was to look back and see my progress
from the bottom, which looked smaller and smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Depressions in the rock showed signs of occasional rainwater.
Cavagnaro was surprised by Uluru's scarred and striated surface _
it was much rougher than pictures had lead him to believe.
 &UR; 'OVER THE HILL' _ TO THE TOP &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cavagnaro's persistence finally paid off when, over a rolling
``hill,'' he saw the marker monument at the summit. The climb had
taken him an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   A younger climber, Sherry, had run to the top in 45 minutes. And
she paid the price. ``My thighs are screaming at me,'' she later
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry had brought a pair of ballet slippers, donned them and
pirouetted on the peak. The climbers all posed for pictures before
beginning the descent.
</P>
<P>
   Cavagnaro's calves and thigh muscles, which had valiantly
carried him to the top, now were trembling, begging him to find the
slightest excuse to stop. He tried a variety of psychological and
physical tricks to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   Descending with his back to the rock, Cavagnaro enjoyed the
breathtaking, wide-angled vista before him. Letting go of the first
link of chain, he found it a bit frightening to negotiate the last
400 to 500 yards. All the muscles in his body were tight, his hips
were aching and he feared he would fall.
</P>
<P>
   At the base, his troupe of climbers all piled into a van and
headed back to their luxurious digs, Sailes in the Desert Hotel at
the Ayers Rock Resort. Their reward: a cooling plunge in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk just a bit taller these days,'' Cavagnaro now says. ``I
had met my self-imposed challenge. I was validated in my own eyes.
My next goal is to climb the mountain I consider to be one of the
ultimates _ Mt. Sinai, Jebel Sirbal.''
</P>
<P>
   A visa is required to enter Australia. Visitors should consider
staying a few extra days and renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle.
Alice Springs and a stop at the Frontier Camel Farm _ complete with
a camel ride along the Todd River _ make for a remarkable trip.

 &HT;    
 By MIKE ALLEN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Under an eight-foot-tall Gilbert Stuart portrait of George
Washington, an actor dressed in a slave trader's gold vest sinks to
his knees and tells a judge, ``The Negroes had gathered with sabers
around my head, and they just started singing my death chant.''
 &HT;    The trader, Don Pedro Montez, pleads for the return of his
slaves every Tuesday at the Old State House in Hartford, part of a
re-enactment of a trial _ held in that very room _ after the 1839
slave mutiny on the schooner Amistad.
 &HT;    Connecticut's capital is known as the city where the world's
insurance industry blossomed, where Mark Twain wrote most of his
best-known works and where Samuel Colt mass-produced his revolver.
But interest in Hartford's connection to the Amistad grew after the
Stephen Spielberg movie was released last December. Now, new
exhibits, tours and events highlight the area's history as a hotbed
of abolition activity.
 &HT;    The Amistad trial began in Hartford, though it concluded in New
Haven. The slaves returned to the area after they were freed.
Farmington, 10 miles southwest of the city, was known for the
clusters of homes and churches where escaped slaves hid on their
way to Canada. It is one of a number of quaint Hartford suburbs
that treasure their individual histories and identities.
 &HT;    Hartford itself began as a Dutch trading post on the Connecticut
River, then was settled by an English congregation from
Massachusetts. The congregation's minister, the Rev. Thomas Hooker,
is considered the city's founder and is still honored with an
annual parade. The city is now about a two-hour drive from both New
York and Boston, and getting around is a snap: Interstates 84 and
91 cross in downtown.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Old State House, a federal landmark of brick and brownstone
that was the seat of state government from 1796 to 1878 and the
city government from 1878 to 1915, is at 800 Main St., (860)
522-6766.
 &HT;    The State House flies the Union Jack and Betsy Ross flags, among
others, and startles commuters by opening and closing each day with
a cannon blast. It is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m., and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Free. The Amistad trial
is re-enacted in what was the State Senate chamber each Tuesday at
12:15 p.m.
 &HT;    The second floor houses a museum of ``natural and artificial
curiosities,'' patterned after a museum of oddities that was housed
there from 1797 to 1808. It now includes a two-headed calf
(stuffed), a two-headed pig (in a jar) and a ``unicorn horn''
(courtesy of an unfortunate whale).
 &HT;    The Connecticut Historical Society, 1 Elizabeth St., (860)
236-5621, has its own Amistad offering, a five-gallery extravaganza
of light, sound and artifacts telling the story of the voyage and
trial. Upstairs, the historical society has a collection of
Colonial silver, furniture and household goods. Visitors are also
invited to climb into a dugout canoe made with Indian tools and
techniques. Admission: $6, $3 for students. Open Tuesday through
Sunday, noon to 5 p.m.
 &HT;    Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,''
lived in a 12-room ``cottage'' at 73 Forest St. from 1873 until she
died in 1896. The Harriet Beecher Stowe House, (860) 525-9317,
displaying an early use of wall-to-wall carpeting (clashing with
the floral wallpaper), is closed Monday except in the summer and
during December. Admission: $6.50, and $2.75 ages 6 to 16.
 &HT;    Samuel Clemens was cranking up his lecturing and writing when he
and his family built a house next to Stowe's in 1874. The Mark
Twain House, 351 Farmington Ave., (860) 493-6411, which has bricks
painted black and others vermilion, has been referred to as part
steamboat, part medieval fortress and part cuckoo clock; the
curators prefer ``aggressive new modern.''
 &HT;    Clemens often wrote in the billiard room on the third floor,
which featured a ``stepping out deck,'' so unwanted visitors could
be told that Clemens had ``stepped out.'' Tours are 9:30 to 4 p.m.
and 11 to 4 Sunday. Closed Tuesdays after this week, except in
December. Admission: $9, $8 for 60 and older and $5 ages 6 to 12.
 &HT;    One more writer's residence is on a Hartford must-see list. The
Noah Webster House, 227 South Main St., West Hartford, (860)
521-5362, is the birthplace of the dictionary author (the roadside
sign renders his name with diacritical marks). The house has 65
pieces of period furniture and 600 decorative art objects that give
a flavor of life in the late 1700s. Admission is $5. Open 1 to 4
p.m.; closed Wednesday.
 &HT;    The State Capitol, with its shimmering gold-leaf dome, has
one-hour tours from 9:15 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. on weekdays year-round,
and 10:15 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. on Saturday from April through October,
(860) 240-0222.
 &HT;    A panoramic view of the city is free from atop the 520-foot
Travelers Tower, on Main Street next to the Wadsworth, from mid-May
through the third week of October from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.; (860)
277-4208. A bonus is the two falcons that roost on the observation
deck.
 &HT;    Children can get a break from old houses at Dinosaur State Park
in Rocky Hill, eight miles south of the city, (860) 529-8423.
Scientists have found hundreds of tracks there, some of which can
be seen from a 300-foot-long boardwalk.
 &HT;    In the exhibit center, a push-button game challenges visitors to
use fossils to determine whether the beast was herding, running or
just passing through. The park is open daily 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
The exhibit center costs $2, $1 ages 6 to 17 and is closed Monday.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Through Jan. 3, the Wadsworth Atheneum, the nation's oldest
public art museum, is presenting an exhibition exploring the taming
of two frontiers, ``New Worlds from Old: 19th Century Australian
and American Landscapes.'' The museum, at 600 Main St., (860)
278-2670, also has a fashion retrospective, ``Designing Women:
American Style, 1940-1960,'' on display through Feb. 6.
 &HT;    The museum, known for its Hudson River School landscapes and a
collection of Pilgrim Century furniture from the 17th century,
encourages children to explore its collections, by offering
treasure-hunt cards. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Admission: $7, $5 for seniors and students, $3 for ages 6
to 17; free Thursday and before noon Saturday.
 &HT;    A Halloween Graveyard Tour, which includes stops at Colonial and
Victorian burial grounds in Farmington and dinner at a 1789 private
home that once was a tavern, is offered at twilight daily in
October, then on weekends through Nov. 21 by Heritage Trails
Sightseeing Tours, (860) 677-8867. The house has a crawl space
between fireplaces that was a ``hiding hole'' for slaves. The tour,
which costs $32.95, features a lesson in the meaning of gravestone
inscriptions. Bring a flashlight. Reservations are required.
 &HT;    Heritage Trails also offers daily minibus tours of Hartford and
of black history and Amistad sites in Farmington ($15 each).
 &HT;    ``The Phantom of the Opera'' will be performed Dec. 16 through
Jan. 17 (tickets $16.50 to $66.50) at Bushnell Memorial Hall, 166
Capitol Ave., (860) 987-5900. This brick auditorium with gold-leaf
dome and Art Deco interior, where a Presidential debate was held in
1996, sits just down a grassy hill from the State Capitol.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    A portrait of Abraham Lincoln in the front room is a reminder of
the Underground Railroad country that surrounds the Barney House, a
bed-and-breakfast at 11 Mountain Spring Road in Farmington, (860)
674-2796, fax (860) 677-7259. The staff can direct you to houses
nearby where runaway slaves once were secreted.
 &HT;    The peach-colored stucco house, which was given to the
University of Connecticut Foundation by the Barney family, also
serves as a conference center. The seven guest rooms all have
private baths and are decorated with antiques. Doubles are $115.
 &HT;    Another popular choice just outside the city is the Chester
Bulkley House, 184 Main St. in Wethersfield, four miles south of
the city across the river, (860) 563-4236, fax (860) 257-8266.
 &HT;    This five-room brick Greek Revival bed-and-breakfast, built in
1830, is stuffed with porcelain dolls and antique toys. Breakfast
is huge, including seasonal fruit in dishes like baked apples and
pears. Doubles with private bath are $85; two rooms share a bath.
 &HT;    Budget: The West Hartford Inn, 900 Farmington Ave., West
Hartford, (860) 236-3221, fax (860) 236-3445, is between the Mark
Twain House and Farmington. West Hartford, a separate town
adjoining the city, has many of the boutiques, shops and other
amenities that downtown Hartford lacks. The 53 standard hotel rooms
cost $74 for single or double, or $67 with certain discounts.
 &HT;    Luxury: The 1881 Queen Anne-style Goodwin Hotel, Haynes Street
at Asylum Avenue, (860) 246-7500, fax (860) 247-4576, was renovated
early this year. Its 124 rooms are decorated in Colonial style and
all have marble baths. Doubles begin at $189 midweek and $89 on
weekends.
 &HT;    The J. P. Morgan Suite, once an apartment owned by the
financier, includes a grand piano and a whirlpool, and goes for
$677 a night for one bedroom, or $977 for two. The hotel has a
restaurant, lounge and fitness area.
 &HT;    The Simsbury Inn, 14 miles west of Hartford at 397 Hopmeadow
Street, Simsbury, (860) 651-5700, fax (860) 651-8024, has 97 rooms
with French country-style furnishings or mahogany four-poster beds
and armoires. Rooms have refrigerators and hair dryers. Chairs are
arrayed around the lobby fireplace and there are an indoor pool and
a health club. Doubles start at $159; weekend packages start at
$129.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    New England meets the South at The Savannah, (860) 278-2020, a
white-tablecloth restaurant where the sauteed lobster tail is
served over grilled grits. Or try a sweet potato ravioli appetizer
and shrimp scampi with wild mushrooms.
 &HT;    The Savannah, decorated with artifacts from Africa, is on the
first floor of what was once a hotel at 391 Main Street at Capitol
Avenue. Dinner for two with wine, $75. Lunch served Tuesday through
Friday and dinner Monday through Saturday.
 &HT;    Hartford's power crowd hangs out across from the Civic Center at
Max Downtown, 185 Asylum St., (860) 522-2530, amid stained glass
and abstract murals. The menu includes lots of fish and pasta
dishes, and a side order of garlic mashed potatoes means a pound of
spuds that take as much space on their own oval plate as the
accompanying chop. The cigar bar in the back is full even at
lunchtime. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine about $100.
 &HT;    Diners eat under the rustic beams of a former grist mill at the
Mill on the River, 989 Ellington Road, South Windsor, northeast of
the city, (860) 289-7929. A promenade deck has been built around
the former mill pond, which has a 30-foot fountain. Pondside dining
is available when the weather allows. It is known for its fresh
fish, especially the redfish nouvelle, lightly blackened and topped
with shrimp, scallops, spinach and Mornay sauce. Dinner for two
with a moderate wine, $60.
 &HT;    Two blocks from the Mark Twain House is Oasis, 267 Farmington
Ave., (860) 241-8200, a 1949 stainless steel diner where the menu
includes salmon baked in pistachio and walnut crust with gorgonzola
and poppyseed dressing as well as meat loaf and open-face turkey
sandwiches. Dinner for two, with a glass of wine, about $25.
 &HT;    Downstairs is Pancho's, where corrugated-steel walls and
leathertop tables evoke a cantina. The menu offers pollo mole and
other Mexican dishes. Open for dinner only; about $30 a couple,
with drinks.

bed-and-breakfast at 11 Mountain Spring Road in Farmington, (860)
674-2796, fax (860) 677-7259. The staff can direct you to houses
nearby where runaway slaves once were secreted.
 &HT;    The peach-colored stucco house, which was given to the
University of Connecticut Foundation by the Barney family, also
serves as a conference center. The seven guest rooms all have
private baths and are decorated with antiques. Doubles are $115.
 &HT;    Another popular choice just outside the city is the Chester
Bulkley House, 184 Main St. in Wethersfield, four miles south of
the city across the river, (860) 563-4236, fax (860) 257-8266.
 &HT;    This five-room brick Greek Revival bed-and-breakfast, built in
1830, is stuffed with porcelain dolls and antique toys. Breakfast
is huge, including seasonal fruit in dishes like baked apples and
pears. Doubles with private bath are $85; two rooms share a bath.
 &HT;    Budget: The West Hartford Inn, 900 Farmington Ave., West
Hartford, (860) 236-3221, fax (860) 236-3445, is between the Mark
Twain House and Farmington. West Hartford, a separate town
adjoining the city, has many of the boutiques, shops and other
amenities that downtown Hartford lacks. The 53 standard hotel rooms
cost $74 for single or double, or $67 with certain discounts.
 &HT;    Luxury: The 1881 Queen Anne-style Goodwin Hotel, Haynes Street
at Asylum Avenue, (860) 246-7500, fax (860) 247-4576, was renovated
early this year. Its 124 rooms are decorated in Colonial style and
all have marble baths. Doubles begin at $189 midweek and $89 on
weekends.
 &HT;    The J. P. Morgan Suite, once an apartment owned by the
financier, includes a grand piano and a whirlpool, and goes for
$677 a night for one bedroom, or $977 for two. The hotel has a
restaurant, lounge and fitness area.
 &HT;    The Simsbury Inn, 14 miles west of Hartford at 397 Hopmeadow
Street, Simsbury, (860) 651-5700, fax (860) 651-8024, has 97 rooms
with French country-style furnishings or mahogany four-poster beds
and armoires. Rooms have refrigerators and hair dryers. Chairs are
arrayed around the lobby fireplace and there are an indoor pool and
a health club. Doubles start at $159; weekend packages start at
$129.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    New England meets the South at The Savannah, (860) 278-2020, a
white-tablecloth restaurant where the sauteed lobster tail is
served over grilled grits. Or try a sweet potato ravioli appetizer
and shrimp scampi with wild mushrooms.
 &HT;    The Savannah, decorated with artifacts from Africa, is on the
first floor of what was once a hotel at 391 Main Street at Capitol
Avenue. Dinner for two with wine, $75. Lunch served Tuesday through
Friday and dinner Monday through Saturday.
 &HT;    Hartford's power crowd hangs out across from the Civic Center at
Max Downtown, 185 Asylum St., (860) 522-2530, amid stained glass
and abstract murals. The menu includes lots of fish and pasta
dishes, and a side order of garlic mashed potatoes means a pound of
spuds that take as much space on their own oval plate as the
accompanying chop. The cigar bar in the back is full even at
lunchtime. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine about $100.
 &HT;    Diners eat under the rustic beams of a former grist mill at the
Mill on the River, 989 Ellington Road, South Windsor, northeast of
the city, (860) 289-7929. A promenade deck has been built around
the former mill pond, which has a 30-foot fountain. Pondside dining
is available when the weather allows. It is known for its fresh
fish, especially the redfish nouvelle, lightly blackened and topped
with shrimp, scallops, spinach and Mornay sauce. Dinner for two
with a moderate wine, $60.
 &HT;    Two blocks from the Mark Twain House is Oasis, 267 Farmington
Ave., (860) 241-8200, a 1949 stainless steel diner where the menu
includes salmon baked in pistachio and walnut crust with gorgonzola
and poppyseed dressing as well as meat loaf and open-face turkey
sandwiches. Dinner for two, with a glass of wine, about $25.
 &HT;    Downstairs is Pancho's, where corrugated-steel walls and
leathertop tables evoke a cantina. The menu offers pollo mole and
other Mexican dishes. Open for dinner only; about $30 a couple,
with drinks.

THE ANTI-CLINTON TACK: WHAT IS THE GOP THINKING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hang on, folks. The negative, disgusting, sleazier-than-sleazy
election campaign of 1998 is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will end the misery on Tuesday when they go to the polls
and elect whichever candidates seemed most believable _ or least
offensive. Some might even be tempted to toss darts at the ballot
and just hope that fate can make a good decision.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how they go about it, conscientious voters will do
their best to fulfill their responsibility as citizens of the
greatest nation on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Less conscientious voters might use the gut-wrenching nastiness
of the campaign as an excuse to duck responsibility and stay away
from the polls, a course of nonaction that would certainly be
understandable but definitely not commendable.
</P>
<P>
   Voters need to vote. If you think the political process is
horrendous now, wait till you see what happens when right-minded
citizens stop voting.
</P>
<P>
   The experts are predicting one of the lowest turnouts of all
time, sad to say, which might explain why the Republican Party is
trying to motivate its base with a last-minute, $10 million
advertising campaign that urges voters to register their
disapproval of President Clinton by electing Republican candidates
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   GOP strategists are denying that the purpose of the ads is to
turn the election into a referendum on Clinton. But what other
purpose could there be for an ad that demands: ``Reward Bill
Clinton. Or vote Republican''?
</P>
<P>
   The campaign reportedly was devised by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who knows a heck of a lot more about political strategy
than I do. But I can't help but wonder why Gingrich thinks it's a
good idea to fish for votes by attacking a president who has a job
approval rating of 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And another thing, as long as I'm wondering: Why are Republicans
in Congress pushing so hard to impeach a president when polls say
that more than 70 percent of Americans don't want him impeached?
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that all those folks who oppose impeachment might
just go out and vote Democratic in the expectation that more
Democrats in Congress would mean less likelihood of impeachment
proceedings against the Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the GOP's anti-Clinton blitz, many pundits were
insisting that the election could have a major impact on Clinton's
future.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans make big gains in the House and Senate, the
experts say, GOP leaders will interpret the election results as a
green light to charge ahead with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Republicans don't increase their grip on
Congress or they lose significant numbers of seats to the
Democrats, well, Gingrich and his cohorts would have to rethink
their impeachment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That's a fairly tricky theory when you consider that most
congressional elections are decided on the basis of local issues.
If a congressional election is a referendum on anything, it's most
often a referendum on the quality of constituent service provided
by the incumbent officeholder.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that Gingrich knows full well that those
anti-Clinton ads won't make a major difference in most
congressional races. The ads are apparently designed to inflame
confirmed Clinton-haters and boost voter turnout in areas where
Republicans have an edge to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   If the strategy is effective, Republicans will have a rationale
for pursuing impeachment even if the election fails to provide a
clear-cut mandate for going after Clinton. They could just point
out that Republicans won big in districts where the anti-Clinton
ads were seen, meaning that the pro-impeachment crowd prevailed in
the so-called referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Republicans need any cover. As long as they retain
a majority in the House of Representatives, they have the power to
impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   And if Republican leaders aren't deterred by polls suggesting
that nearly three-fourths of Americans oppose impeachment, there's
no reason to expect that a little thing like an election will make
them back off.

TRACING THE BLAME FOR TODAY'S POLITICAL CIRCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Election campaigns are instructive, but rarely in
the ways that the politicians intend. This year, if anything, the
campaigns seem more burdened with absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   The worst is how otherwise apparently intelligent people espouse
nonsense and non sequiturs when they run for office. They use
certain so-called hot-button issues to establish their credentials
and arouse a phlegmatic electorate. One of the sure-fire ones is to
ban the burning of flags.
</P>
<P>
   It gives the politicians from both major parties the chance to
wrap themselves in the flag. Of course, burning is the prescribed
way to dispose of worn or torn flags. So it is not the burning
itself that these politicians want to ban, it is the desecration of
the flag, a hallowed symbol.
</P>
<P>
   But the banners are selective in just what they consider
desecration. They do not oppose the commercial exploitation of the
flag. They voice no opposition to those who make swim suits and
underwear, shirts, pillow cases, and jeans patches from the flag.
They say not a word against car lots using the flag to sell their
products or doughnut emporia flying humongous flags in an effort to
suck in more customers.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not desecration at all that these pols are against, but
only one aspect of it, the political demonstration of burning the
flag, usually engaged in by hippies and other marginal outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the symbol of the American flag stands for anything, it
stands for free speech, even for toleration of the most obnoxious
sort.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these same super patriots support a ban on flag burning
paradoxically want the people (including the flag-burners?) to be
able to arm themselves against the possibility of their government
becoming oppressive.
</P>
<P>
   They say that's what the Second Amendment to the Constitution
provides. Well, not exactly; it provides for an armed militia. But
even reading the Constitution the way the gun aficionados would,
their reasoning falls short of landfall.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way in the world for the owner of a handgun to face
off against the forces of government. For this you would require
missiles, nuclear warheads, cannon, tanks, machine guns and other
heavy weaponry that have never enjoyed sanction even under the most
expansive reading of the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of bountiful campaign contributions and
the special favors that so often appear to be attached to them.
Normally sober men and women actually claim that there is no
connection between the donation of massive amounts of the dollars
and the beneficial government largess that is showered on to the
donors. It is merely a coincidence of political philosophies, or,
if you believe in miracles, it is a miracle. It is a game
candidates of both parties play, trotting out identical platitudes
to validate a system that reeks of favoritism on its better days,
and of corruption on its worst.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates say they are doing nothing illegal. The pity is they
are right, and in making this alibi have put their finger on the
problem. But it's not only fund-raising from interest parties that
is undermining the integrity of the political system. Under the
rules, individuals can give limitless funds to their own
candidacies, which endows a handful of people in this nation more
than equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   If we allow them this power to dominate the process, then we
might as well go all the way and set up a new standard for voting.
</P>
<P>
   We can abandon entirely the foolish notion of one man, one vote,
and assign the number of votes according to how much money each
person owns. Someone with a million dollars would get, say, 10
votes, and another with $20 million would get 200 votes. It seems
only equitable, given what we already countenance.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign season we've had the pleasure of being showered
with attack ads, as candidates spend millions in order to get a job
paying thousands.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, negative ads are considered by the specialists as
more beneficial than not someone in a contentious election battle.
</P>
<P>
   The question facing the electorate, which should be asked by
each voter while looking in the mirror, is why such transparently
low-down campaigning wins their hearts and minds.
</P>
<P>
   There is an old saying that we should heed: ``We have met the
enemy and he is us.''

TIME TO SHOW 'EM AT THE BALLOT BOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Freedom is like an insurance policy,'' Sam Rayburn used to
say. ``Its premiums have to kept up to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting is our way of doing that. It's a right won by heroes'
blood, and a duty no less imperative to the survival of a free
society than bearing arms in its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think it's a bore.
</P>
<P>
   How we vote, and how many of us vote, is the ultimate expression
of our nationhood. Casting our ballots in a federal election is the
one thing Americans do together every two years. Except for those
who opt out, the civic freeloaders.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks had a word for them. Athenians coined the
term ``idiotes,'' signifying ``those who do not participate in
public affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks the political scribes and talk-show pundits have been
forecasting public inertia, voter apathy. We're fat and satisfied
and won't vote, they tell us. Or we're disgusted with the banality
of partisan politics and won't vote. Or nobody really cares about
substantive issues like education, social security, health care and
campaign finance reform. And so we won't vote. Only angry people
vote, they say knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   Most assume that Tuesday's congressional elections will be
marked by an abnormally low turnout. Wouldn't it be wonderful if
the American people proved them wrong?
</P>
<P>
   We could, you know. We have before. There's nothing more
refreshing than a plain people's revolt against the vapid
assumptions of those who think they have us pegged.
</P>
<P>
   It happened just 50 years ago, in 1948. Harry Truman didn't have
a chance, we were told. He'd be snowed under by Thomas E. Dewey's
well-organized, well-financed campaign. The election was just a
formality.
</P>
<P>
   Then the people spoke!
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, it could happen again. If most people do not want
President Clinton to be impeached, for example _ as published
opinion samplings seem to indicate _ they can go to the polls and
vote out House Speaker Newt Gringrich's Republican majority. The
GOP-dominated House is clearly headed to impeach Clinton next year.
Voter intervention on Tuesday may be the only thing that could stop
that.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Democratic nor Republican candidates are making that an
issue for the most part. Most don't like to talk about it. They'd
prefer to glide by individually on local issues. Or personality. Or
sneaky ads, ostensibly paid for by someone else, telling us what
rotten stinkers their opponents are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't like negative ads,'' a former
congressional colleague told me last week, ``but you have to admit
they're effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Character assassination works. Sometimes. For a while. But I
have to believe there's an inherent sense of justice in the
American people that will not let it prevail indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Voters could put a stop to it. They're the only ones who can.
</P>
<P>
   How can private citizens effectively express their disgust with
gutter tactics that degrade our political process? Not by staying
away from the polls. By voting for candidates who have positive
agendas and do not engage in campaigns of fear and smear.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if we want to leave democracy in the hands of
the haters and the angry, boycotting the ballot box clearly
contributes to that end. Campaigns will just get nastier and
nastier to agitate anger, more and more dependent on big
contributors to pay for the ugly ads, less and less involved with
ordinary people like ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   That's what we buy when we stay away from the polls.
</P>
<P>
   American politics has drifted too far already from its public
moorings. There was a time, a generation or so ago, when elections
were a people business. People turned out in considerably greater
numbers to hear and question candidates in person.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they knew their public officeholders better,
trusted them more, identified with them more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates cultivated people, great numbers of people. They
built people-oriented organizations, with huge armies of
volunteers. They weren't nearly as dependent, therefore, on big
financial contributors. Their loyalties were with the masses. They
empathized with their needs and understood their concerns. Thought
their thoughts. Expressed their hopes.
</P>
<P>
   People didn't feel powerless to influence events, as increasing
numbers confess to feeling today. They felt, and were, part of this
pulsating process called democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In my last contested campaign for re-election to Congress, in
1986, there were 6,000 individual block captains with self-assumed
responsibility for canvassing every voter in the city blocks on
which they lived, and promoting turnout on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three thousand local families displayed my signs in their
front yards.
</P>
<P>
   Media advertising? Always previously, I'd bought 30-minute
television programs in prime viewing time and answered questions
called in by viewers.
</P>
<P>
   These programs became prohibitively expensive. In 1954, 30
minutes on the dominant station at 7:30 p.m. had cost $560. In
1980, I'd paid $8,000. By 1986, the same station _ now with a
smaller share of the market _ wanted $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   So we used radio. At prime drive times. We recruited several
hundred individual voters. Each cut a one-minute audiotape, all
using their own messages, in their own voices.
</P>
<P>
   That, to me, is democracy. It's a people's business. Not like a
corporation with preferred stock, the most votes going to the
biggest investors. Everyone owns an equal piece of it. And each of
our votes counts _ just as much as that of the wealthiest or most
prominent person in town.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy has a price: your participation.

DOUBLE STANDARD IN TEXAS TRUCKING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ One of the reasons cited for keeping Mexican
trucks out of the United States is the fear that overweight trucks
would create safety problems and damage U.S. highways.
</P>
<P>
   For that and other political reasons, provisions in the North
American Free Trade Agreement that would start cross-border
trucking remain delayed indefinitely, even though Mexican trucks
would be subjected to the same rules and regulations for U.S.
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   What few people know, though, is Texas allows thousands of
trucks daily to operate over the weight limits by issuing special
permits that cost a fraction of the damage caused to roads and
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The permits are called ``2060 permits,'' after the Texas
legislative bill number in 1989 that created the program.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 14,530 permits were issued by
the Texas Department of Transportation, raising revenues of $3.43
million, almost all of which goes to counties for road and bridge
repair reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 state DOT study, however, estimated that overweight
trucks cause $450 million in damage to state roads and bridges each
year.
</P>
<P>
   The state's gross weight limit is 80,000 pounds, counting both
the truck and its freight. The permit allows a 5 percent increase
in gross weight and up to a 10 percent increase on each axle's
weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, for every 10 percent increase in axle loading above
the legal limit, there is 50 percent more damage (caused to
roads),'' said Ray Barnhart, an Austin transportation consultant
who headed the Federal Highway Administration from 1981 to 1988
during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   The permit is for the 137,000 miles of county roads and the
77,000-mile state road system only. Federal highway funding would
be threatened if the 2060 permits allowed overweight trucks on the
state's 3,400-mile interstate highway system.
</P>
<P>
   Most state and county roads are built to handle 10,000 to 15,000
pounds. But under 2060 permits, trucks legally can be 84,000
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The state's bridges are a further concern. Inspected every 18
months, the bridges often have signs limiting weights to 10,000
pounds or 15,000 pounds. Yet, 84,000-pound trucks cross them
legally with 2060 permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It defies engineering principles,'' Barnhart said. ``I think
this is criminal. One of these days you'll have a major tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts concur that damage is being done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean the bridges will fall down. But there is not
the degree of safety that is expected,'' said Rob Harrison,
associate director at the University of Texas at Austin's Center
for Transportation Research. ``And bridges are expensive to fix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some part of the bridge's life is extracted every time a heavy
load goes over it,'' added Jose Weissmann, engineering professor at
the University of Texas at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bridge would need replacement sooner than expected'' when
heavy loads are allowed, said Weissmann, a former associate at the
Center for Transportation Research, part of the University of Texas
at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The base fee for 2060 permits, which are good for one year in
any 20-county area, is $75, plus a $5 administration fee.
</P>
<P>
   Fees to operate in additional 20-county areas are $125 each,
ranging up to a $2,080 cap to operate statewide, said Monty
Chamberlain, spokesman for the state DOT motor carrier division.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart said the reimbursement to counties for repairs, based
on a formula that considers the miles of roads in each county,
comes to less than $9 per mile statewide. Repair costs typically
range from $10,000 to $50,000 per mile, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most onerous piece of highway legislation I've
ever seen,'' Barnhart said. ``And it threatens the safety and lives
of every motorist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2060 fees are not based on science, but on political
clout,'' said Barnhart, who has criticized the 2060 permit in
testimony before Texas legislative committees.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful trucking lobby is a difficult barrier to change,
Barnhart said, adding he is not aware of any plans to change state
law in the upcoming 1999 legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trucking companies naturally want to increase
productivity'' with heavier loads, Weissmann said. ``They like this
permit and, like anyone, they go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that the 2060 permits rarely involve NAFTA
trade that is concentrated on the interstate highways. Most 2060
permits are for transporting specialized loads _ oil-drilling
equipment, timber logs, gravel and agricultural roads _ over
intrastate routes.
</P>
<P>
   But if Texas trucks are allowed to carry road-damaging loads
with a low-cost permit, international trucks will get permits, too,
whenever the NAFTA provisions are enacted for non-interstate
highway transport.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, 2060 permits are a problem. They ought to be phased out
in favor of lower axle limits, bridge-use restrictions and new,
better corridors to accommodate deliveries. And more weighing
stations should be built to enforce limits.
</P>
<P>
   Those can be goals as Texas receives higher levels of federal
highway funding the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, dangerous and heavy loads will be getting a
free ride in Texas.

ACERBIC SITCOM SHOWS PROMISE BUT NEEDS DOCTORING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ready for another Archie Bunker? That's exactly what the
producers of ``Becker'' are hoping because this Ted Danson vehicle
is all about being politically incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a good thing, really. Television has become so safe
and devoid of sharp edges that it's boring beyond its normal level.
Producers are so afraid that jokes will step on someone's feelings
that bland wins every time.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not start thinking that just because Danson's
character is acerbic and angry he's as funny or as important as
Bunker. First off, there's very little racial humor in the pilot of
``Becker'' and that was the catalyst to ``All in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Becker'' is a sitcom we're going to have to see a lot more of
to truly pass judgment. That's because the pilot is half annoying,
half encouraging. It's funny in a lot of places but predictable and
trite in others.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is in the attitude. Dave Hackel, the executive
producer, creator and writer of the pilot, wants to take his Howard
Beale-like anger at the world and give it a forum. Up on that soap
box steps Dr. John Becker, who has a compassionate practice in the
Bronx but lives his life as one unholy (literally) curmudgeon.
</P>
<P>
   He's fed up with everything. He goes on an assortment of rants _
most of which are dated or seem patently orchestrated. About talk
shows, Becker says: ``It's like America stepped in something and
it's scraping off its shoe right over my TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything can set him off: ``White trash is the only natural
resource this country will never run out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is spared. ``If you shut your mouth, it stops the words
from falling out like that,'' he tells Linda (Shawnee Smith), his
spacey nurse's aide.
</P>
<P>
   He yells out the window to his neighbor, who is playing loud
ethnic music: ``Hey, foreign guy! Turn it off or I call
immigration.'' He rants about bicyclists, car salesmen, Jesus (``I
think he fell asleep at the wheel'') and to Jake, the blind
newsstand operator who works out of Becker's favorite bar: ``Just
because you're blind doesn't mean you've got a sixth sense. It just
means you're blind.''
</P>
<P>
   Now most of this stuff is pretty funny. It would be funnier if
it seemed more natural, not just following a scene created to set
up another rant. But give Danson credit, he's funny as Mr. Bitter
and it's a role he could make his second-biggest if ``Becker''
rounds into shape. There's a load of potential here, but the kinks
need to be hammered out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem with being grumpy is that as an
unlikable character, most people will turn the channel if you have
nothing else to offer. Archie Bunker was tolerable not only because
he was funny, but because it was clear he was a big softy under the
blowhard exterior.
</P>
<P>
   But the producers go overboard with Danson. Sensing that need,
the producers have him fall for a 7-year-old patient who contracted
HIV and is losing the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding cast may help. No-nonsense head nurse Margaret
(wonderfully fleshed out by Hattie Winston) cuts him down a lot.
And Reggie (Terry Farrell), the female bartender/owner of his
favorite hangout, looks to be some kind of love interest down the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping ``Becker'' gets that far down the line. The world
of television needs a caustic hero we can love and hate. Make the
soap box less apparent and cut the sap, and ``Becker'' may be the
tonic TV needs.

A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE FOR SECURITY FORCE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Clenching his eyes tight and furrowing
his brow, Mans Nyberg used a thumb and forefinger to massage the
bridge of his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the flu,'' he said nasally. ``I'm sick, and we haven't
even started yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyberg, chief spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, was among the first of the
Vienna-based group to come here to Kosovo to begin laying the
groundwork for the arrival of 2,000 international observers to
verify an uneasy truce.
</P>
<P>
   Nyberg admits that it is a logistical nightmare, and says the
observers probably will not be at work here before the end of
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're setting up a headquarters, looking for office space
around Kosovo,'' he said. ``We need 1,000 vehicles. We need to find
accommodation for 2,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   But as any visitor to Kosovo will attest, the Serbian province
is not exactly suited for an onslaught of visitors. There are few
hotels, and most of them are clustered in Pristina, the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The observers, however, need to be in the rural countryside,
where most of the fighting took place and where the potential for
trouble recurring is greatest, but where amenities are lacking.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, the vast majority of people whose rights and
personal safety the observers are supposed to protect do not even
know they are coming.
</P>
<P>
   In central Kosovo, where the worst fighting took place, an
Albanian farmer stood outside his home, which had been destroyed by
Serb forces, and asked, ``What is OSCE?''
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE is a coalition of 54 countries, including the United
States and nearly all of the European countries, that seeks to
prevent conflict and nurture Western-style democracy in former
Eastern Bloc nations. Yugoslavia left the group in 1992 when the
Bosnian war exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The group was widely criticized for its oversight of the Bosnian
elections in September. When it said it would give preliminary
election results, then at the last minute announced it would not do
so, many accused OSCE of withholding the results because they
showed that Western-backed moderates had lost ground to hardline
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring the situation in Kosovo gives OSCE a chance to redeem
itself. It seems determined not to fumble that chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, gave permission to
OSCE to enter Kosovo as part of the deal brokered by the US special
envoy Richard Holbrooke. The observers are charged with verifying
that Milosevic complies with the United Nations resolutions that
call for the demilitarization of Kosovo, cutting troops and police
there back to the levels they were at nine months ago, when
fighting broke out.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps an even more important part of the OSCE mission is
to give ethnic Albanians who fled the fighting the confidence to
return to their homes before winter sets in. Up to 300,000 people,
most of them Albanians, fled their homes because of the fighting.
Many are returning to uninhabitable homes destroyed by Serb
shelling.
</P>
<P>
   Nyberg and Norwegian General Bjorn Nygard, OSCE's chief of
staff, believe the group will be able to accomplish both parts of
its mission.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, international observation here was handled by the
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, or K-DOM, a group of 51
Americans, 26 Europeans, 10 Russians, and one Canadian. They will
be absorbed into the OSCE team.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of NATO, part of the deal calls for the
monitors to be shadowed by a so-called extraction force of some
2,000 soldiers in nearby Macedonia. The idea is that the extraction
force would be called in to rescue observers if either Serb forces
or Albanian separatists decide to take any of them hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the observers believe their credibility rests in part
on their being unarmed, Nyberg admitted that many observers are
uneasy about a stealth military force being set up to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadows of NATO pressure,'' he said, dismissively, of the
extraction force idea. ``The issue of the security of our members
is over-inflated. If the (Serbian) army stays away, in barracks,
there will be no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if OSCE would report any provocation or show of force by
the Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Nyberg said,
``The KLA is not a party to the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, Adem Demaci, the liberation army's political
representative, ``gave the KLA's support for OSCE's mission. The
KLA have promised to show restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Nyberg set off to find office space and medication
for his flu, unaware that as difficult it would be to find the
former, it would be virtually impossible to find the latter.

`EVENING' EXPLORES THE DARKNESS OF DYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOAN SMITH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Susan Minot wanted to imagine the process of slowly
dying. She had recently endured the death of a friend, from
leukemia, and of her grandmother, ``who took to her bed and, two
months later, simply died.''
</P>
<P>
   And so she began her fourth book and her third novel,
``Evening,'' told from the point of view of a woman dying of
ovarian cancer, consumed by pain and memories, including a
once-repressed recollection of what seems now to have been the most
important weekend in her life _ an eventful wedding 40 years
earlier at which she'd fallen hopelessly in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most writers have something under their skins they've just got
to get out,'' Minot said over coffee at a small cafe near her
studio in the West Village, her hands fluttering eloquently over
her bare arms. ``It isn't a lovely feeling. I watched both of these
people, who were very close to me, go through this terrible ordeal
of pain and drugs and hospitals and disorientation, this kind of
drifting off, this horrendous isolation. That, you could say, was
the thing under my skin. I just can't forget about it, so one of my
ways of dealing with it is to try to imagine what it must have been
like for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But writing about a dying woman also was ``a way of exploring
what really matters.'' When death is imminent, what are the things
most likely to occupy the final moments of consciousness? And for
Minot, the moment of falling in love, especially if love is
frustrated, is ``the center of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   She has written about its messy power in her short stories,
including her 1989 collection ``Lust''; in her much-admired 1992
novel ``Folly'' about a sheltered upper-class Boston woman's single
secret romantic indiscretion; and in the screenplay she wrote for
the great Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci's ``Stealing
Beauty,'' in which a 19-year-old American girl travels to Tuscany
hoping to find her real father and to finally sleep with the boy
she fell in love with when she was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning of love is so full of hope,'' she said, ``so
full of the possibility of the fulfillment of everything you ever
wanted. It is a lovely, drugged, unreal feeling that is absolutely
crucial to the experience of life.''
</P>
<P>
   And Minot, who has a near-perfect ear, writes about it so
beautifully. Page through ``Evening,'' published by Knopf this
month to admiring reviews, and read a passage at random: ``She
heard soft paws crossing the floor above her. A blur passed by the
window, a cloud of fidgeting butterflies. She smelled sea water,
she smelled burnt sugar. Someone was baking a cake. The sound of
fingernails scraped the wainscoting behind the bamboo bookshelf.
She scanned the shelves of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the publication in 1986, when she was only 30, of
``Monkeys,'' a semi-autobiographical novel about an Irish Catholic
family of seven children growing up on the coast of Massachusetts,
she has enjoyed widespread admiration, not just for her sensitive
renderings of her characters' inner lives and relationships, but
for prose as fluid as music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sounds of words,'' she sighed. ``They're the tools,
they're what you use to tell your story. You can literally make
them sing. I've always thought that if you really could sing your
material it would be lovely.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet singing, she said, is one of the few arts she has never
explored.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time I could not decide whether to concentrate on
painting or writing,'' she said. ``When I was in graduate school
studying writing at Columbia (where she earned a Masters of Fine
Arts degree in 1983), I used to go upstairs one floor to study
film, then downstairs one floor for painting classes. They all
cross-pollinate one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why a friend who was interviewing Bernardo Bertolucci
for the New Yorker sent him to Minot when he needed a writer for a
film he was making about a young American virgin. ``I am in love
with film,'' she said. ``I've seen as many movies as I've read
books, and he is the master.''
</P>
<P>
   After directing his epics, ``The Last Emperor'' and ``The Little
Buddha,'' Bertolucci ``wanted to do something small.'' The idea was
sketchy, ``a girl on a mission to lose her virginity.'' And if
Minot wasn't crazy about the concept, she found Bertolucci ``very
open to what I had to say. He admitted that he had no idea what it
was like to be a young American woman and he wanted my ideas. So
I'd write something, he'd go over it, and we ended up
collaborating. Yet the way he works is absolutely his own, in that
he'd use the qualities of an actress, in this case Liv Tyler, to
develop the character I'd written in a certain direction. It was
very much his way of telling the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing fiction, she said, is ``deeply, deeply lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it so hard to do that I do it intensely so it doesn't
drag out forever. I've driven myself crazy, but it's good to know
what that is like, too, and at a certain point in every book you
have to put yourself through it or you won't go deep enough to come
up with something worth telling. What I like best is when I come up
with something and have no idea where it came from. It doesn't
sound like me. It's a surprise. Those are the things you search
for, the things that make you stop and say, `Now that, just maybe,
is kind of interesting.'''

CAN WE BE BOTH FIT AND FAT?
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   One of the most striking images in ``Fat'' on ``Frontline'' is
that of triathlete Dave Alexander, in peak physical condition at 5
feet 8 inches and 250 pounds. A veteran of 264 triathlons,
Alexander embodies what the program's producer, Antony Thomas,
calls a ``revolutionary'' notion: It's possible to be both fit and
fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline'' interviews a Dallas reasearcher whose long-term
studies of fitness levels in 25,000 people found that men who were
fat but fit had no increased mortality rate. Professor Steven Blair
thinks that since people come in so many different shapes and
sizes, applying a predetermined ``ideal'' weight to an individual
is faulty logic.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the program, which airs this week on PBS, will be no
news at all for those who closely follow the fortunes of fat. But
it's an interesting overview of the state of a subject close to the
hearts, so to speak, of many Americans. A lot closer to some hearts
than others. ``Frontline'' reminds us that 39 million Americans are
obese, defined as 20 percent above the medically determined
``ideal'' weight.
</P>
<P>
   Experts interviewed by ``Frontline'' say scientists are finding
increasing evidence of genetic susceptibility to obesity. Some
people can't help gaining weight, caught as they are in what one
expert calls the ``fat trap'' of the American diet and our
increasingly sedentary way of life. And obesity is becoming a
serious problem in other parts of the world, as we export our
fast-food, leisure-centered lifestyle to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   It may be easier than ever to become fat, but it's never been
harder to be fat. ``You see our society does not accept very well
the obese individual,'' one doctor tells ``Frontline.'' ``They are
being treated today as the modern moral equivalent of lepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn McAffee, a 500-pound woman, is shown talking to
pharmaceutical employees about her weight struggle and about
anti-fat prejudice. ``If you are a super-size person, you are a
target,'' she says. ``I've personally had experiences where people
try to run me down in cars, laughing at me.''
</P>
<P>
   In another segment, elementary school students are handed
photographs of four children and asked to pick the one they would
least like as a friend. The most rejected photo by far is of a fat
child. The students interviewed are candid about why they wouldn't
want to befriend him. ``Because he's fat,'' one after another says.
The teacher asks what they think fat people are like. ``Lazy,''
says one little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Fat (and formerly fat) people can be just as hard on themselves.
When ``Frontline'' interviews patients who have undergone risky and
painful stomach bypass surgery to lose weight, they eagerly revile
their old selves. ``I was pitiful,'' says one. ``I looked like a
blimp,'' says another.
</P>
<P>
   Anorexia and bulimia are the other side of obesity. The program
visits a British clinic where children as young as 6 are treated
for eating disorders. A very slim teenager says that when she looks
in the mirror, she sees ``a fat person _ a person who I just don't
like because it kind of repulses me.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment and fashion industries, and the media, are as
usual blamed for holding up an unrealistic ideal of slimness that
fosters eating disorders. Vidal Sassoon denies the connection,
saying he has seen very few models that he would consider anorexic.
``Frontline,'' meanwhile, shows footage of stick-thin models behind
the scenes of his latest fashion show. But can all models be
anorexic? If some people are genetically programmed to be fat,
surely there must be some who are genetically programmed to be
skeletal. Is this an example of anti-thin bias? Can there even be
such a thing in our culture?

IN KOSOVO, ETHNIC HATE COLORS THE COUNTRYSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ As she drove along the winding roads of
this old city, the Serbian woman, a college-educated professional,
sneered when asked what she thought of Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this garbage,'' she said, pointing to trash strewn
along the roadside. ``They live in garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five miles west of Pristina, Zekeria Cana, a
university-educated Albanian patriarch, scoffed at the suggestion
that Serbian civilians have legitimate fears about being attacked
by Albanian extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are the aggressors!'' he bellowed. ``It is a
characteristic of the Serb nation that they are barbarians.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Kosovo, where the Serbs hate the Albanians, the
Albanians hate the Serbs, and everyone hates the Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to fathom the fear and loathing that fans the conflict
that is the latest episode of instability in the perpetually
unstable Balkans is no simple task. While it is common to portray
the Serbs as blood-thirsty ogres beating up on the poor, oppressed
Albanians, the picture that emerges after a tour of the province
and talking to both sides is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is beautiful, framed by mountains, with rolling hills,
pristine brooks, and fertile farmland. At this time of year, with
its hills colored by foliage, it conjures images of southern
Vermont or northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the rural hush of central Kosovo, beneath Cicavica,
a mountain that looks hauntingly like Ben Bulben, the mountain in
the west of Ireland in whose shadow the poet William Butler Yeats
is buried, Linda Shiapi got emotional when describing the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so beautiful,'' the 23-year-old Albanian said wistfully.
``Can't you see why people would fight over it?''
</P>
<P>
   If Albanians think the Serbian-held province of Kosovo should be
ceded to them because they make up about 90 percent of the 2
million population, Serbs consider it their spiritual and national
birthplace, the site of a sacred Orthodox monastery and a
14th-century battle that they famously lost to the Ottomans.
</P>
<P>
   On one horizon, meanwhile, rises the smokestack of the biggest
electricity plant in Yugoslavia, which in part provides a more
practical explanation of why both sides want Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo hate and do not recognize the
Belgrade regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Most
Albanians want independence. It is not known how many would settle
for autonomous republic status within the Federation of Yugoslavia,
which is made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, the Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation
Army launched a guerrilla war against the Serbs. Milosevic
responded by unleashing a brutal offensive against the KLA, killing
scores of civilians in the process. The Yugoslav government says
more than 150 Serb police and soldiers and another 150 civilians
were killed. International observers say that about 700 Albanian
civilians were killed by Serb forces. Some died as collateral
damage, others in more premeditated circumstances that have been
referred to the war crimes tribunal at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb scorched-earth policy in Kosovo was similar to the
American debacle in Vietnam. Wanting to limit casualties, and wary
of fighting a guerrilla army on its home turf, the Serbs simply
bombed and burned villages where the KLA had a presence _ just as
the American government did to villages where the Viet Cong thrived
_ either not caring whether civilians got killed or hoping those
deaths would convince the rebels it wasn't worth the price of
revolution. But as American forces found out the hard way, such
brutality only strengthened the resolve of the local population.
</P>
<P>
   Just as many Americans were opposed to the Vietnam War, many
Serbs, especially in Belgrade, are appalled at what their
government did to civilians. But in Kosovo, it is hard to find a
Serb opposed to what happened. They feel isolated and vulnerable,
outnumbered and under constant siege, and most of them seem to
think the treacherous Albanians who harbored terrorists got what
was coming to them.
</P>
<P>
   It was the photographs of massacred Albanian women, their babies
dead beside them, that stirred the United Nations to authorize the
use of force to stop the Serb attacks and that has brought NATO for
the first time in its 50-year history within a whisker of bombing a
nation for crushing a rebellion within its own borders.
</P>
<P>
   In persuading Milosevic to pare back his troops to the levels
they were before the fighting began last February, US special envoy
Richard C. Holbrooke has provided the international community with
a window of opportunity to fashion a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   But so deep is the separation and mistrust between Albanians and
Serbs that few here believe last week's relative calm will last
beyond next spring. Seasonal cease-fires are common in the Balkans,
where winters are harsh and neither side feels like fighting the
elements and their enemies at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, battered but unbowed, is regrouping. Notoriously split
by factions and personalities, the insurgents have reorganized into
four regional units, according to KLA officials. Standing in a
field about 20 miles southwest of Pristina, an armed KLA man
insisted his group would honor the cease-fire it called last month.
But he was adamant when asked if he would put down his gun for
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will put down my arms when we achieve freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness in the countryside, where some 200,000 Albanians
lived for months in makeshift refugee camps, and where fireside
tales of Serb atrocities were told and sometimes embellished, is
such that most Albanians do not want the KLA to put down its guns.
But if the KLA resumes its attacks in the spring, as most everyone
here believes will happen, it is hard to imagine Milosevic standing
idly by.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Pristina, the provincial capital, most of the beggars
are Gypsies, about 40,000 of whom live in Kosovo. But young
Albanian children also sprint to cars stopped at traffic lights to
wash windshields with filthy sponges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinar! Dinar!'' they plead, repeating the word for money.
</P>
<P>
   The children are sometimes no more than 5 years old. At night,
prepubescent Albanian children sell cigarettes at intersections
until all hours. Serbs speak derisively about this, saying it shows
how irresponsible Albanians are for having such large families that
their children are forced to beg or work like adults even before
entering adolescence. Albanians have the highest birth rate in
Europe, Serbs the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   But Serbs are less likely to point out that since 1989, when
Milosevic unilaterally ended Kosovo's autonomy in one of his
recurring fits of extreme nationalism, thousands of Albanians have
been summarily fired from their jobs. The chef here at the Hotel
Grand, which is state-owned, was fired simply because he is
Albanian. He now runs a kebab shop a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Serb economic policy is sometimes nihilistic. Some factories sit
idle, as there are not enough Serbs to run them. Albanians who want
to open businesses here, meanwhile, have to pay the government much
more than Serbs do for the same privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians refuse to recognize the Yugoslav state, giving their
allegiance instead to an Albanian government in exile. They say
they want democracy, but only on their terms. They will not take
part in an election or census, the latter meaning there is no real,
accurate measure of how much of the population they constitute, the
former meaning they disenfranchise themselves from the regional
government that controls jobs and services. In this former
communist state where government jobs are often the most stable and
well-paying, Serbs keep them for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There is a de facto apartheid here, as Serbs frequent Serb-owned
businesses and Albanians patronize their own kind. Over a cup of
coffee, both sides are capable of saying the most vile things about
each other.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of Albanians in Kosovo are under the age of 30.
They seem as confident as Serbs do anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have our own country one day,'' said Shiapi, the
young, idealistic Albanian. ``One day soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to her well in Kijevo, a Serbian village in
central Kosovo, Radmila Ristic longs to join her brother in
Chicago. She looks much older than her 57 years. She rubs her big,
beefy hands together, wiping dirt from them as she stares out over
the land her family has farmed for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no future here,'' she said ruefully. ``Not for Serbs,
at least.''

LYCOS UNLEASHES $25 MILLION AD CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bloodhound didn't pass muster with focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherpa? As an advertising pitchman, the Sherpa didn't have
enough staying power to suit Lycos Inc., the Internet search
service.
</P>
<P>
   So a $25 million ad campaign that has just hit the airwaves
introduces a new company pitchman: a black Labrador retriever named
Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   With the dog cast as ``your personal Internet guide,'' TV ads
with a ``Go get it'' tagline aim to convince viewers that the
Waltham, Mass. company's search services can retrieve data from the
Internet as quickly and easily as a Lab can fetch a stick.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, the dog is a shown pictures of a frogman's flippers
and an antique yellow sports car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lycos, go get it!'' a voice-over says, and in a flash the dog
returns with the requested article. ``Unleash the new Lycos, and
the Internet is at your command,'' the voice-over notes.
</P>
<P>
   In a final scene, the dog is shown a photo of a model in a
fashion magazine. Lycos dashes off, and the next thing that viewers
hear is the sultry voice of an unseen woman, saying, ``Hi, I'm
Claudia.''
</P>
<P>
   Created by New York ad agency Bozell Worldwide, the ads are the
latest salvo in a fierce battle that has such Lycos rivals as Snap,
Yahoo, Excite, and Infoseek all trying to convince personal
computer users that their portals and search engines are the ideal
gateway to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A lot is riding on consumers' choices. Each Internet entry point
is packed with banner advertising. The more consumers who pass
through one of these gateways, or portals, the more the company can
charge advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In looking to set itself apart, Lycos has experimented with
several metaphors in its marketing and advertising, said Jan Robert
Horsfall, the company's vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Horsfall, the name Lycos derives from a Latin word
for a special kind of spider. Most spiders use their webs to trap
prey, but a Lycos spider leaves its web to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But spiders don't make for swell advertising images. So an
earlier ad campaign starred a Sherpa mountain guide.
</P>
<P>
   Sherpas evoke dangerous situations, and while that was
appropriate at a time when many PC users were fearful of getting
lost on the World Wide Web, most no longer regard the Internet as
treacherous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what they demand now from a search service is speed,
convenience, and friendliness _ not exactly traits one immediately
associates with mountain guides, Horsfall said.
</P>
<P>
   So Lycos auditioned a bloodhound to replace the Sherpa, but
focus-group testing revealed that speed and friendliness were not
the bloodhound's forte. Lycos opted for a Lab to plug its newly
streamlined search service.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Labrador retriever is a great symbol of approachability and
friendliness,'' said Horsfall, adding: ``This is one dog you want
to walk up to and pet.''

HIGH-YIELD FUND IS TOO RISKY FOR 80-YEAR-OLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My brother and I are in our 80s and have been conservative
investors in value-related stocks and municipal bonds for many
years. We're having a difference of opinion on a particular fund
we've held for five years: Alliance North American Government
Income Trust, Class B. My brother believes we have benefited from
the fund's high yield, currently more than 12 percent, since all
our dividends have been reinvested. We invested $57,408 in 1993 and
1994 and our position is now worth $72,000. It seems like rates
such as this would be a haven for investors seeking a high rate of
return, but high income is no longer one of our objectives. Safety
is. High yields carry resulting risks. I am reluctant to be exposed
to unneeded risks. Am I overly concerned?
</P>
<P>
   A.Z., Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's no question that this is a high-risk fund, and the
real returns on the fund are nowhere near as good as those yield
figures make it seem.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years the fund's average annual return has
been 5.63 percent, according to the latest report from Morningstar
Mutual Funds. The reason is that the generous income levels are
offset by erosions in net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1992 with a $10 net asset value, the B shares
entered this week at $7.43, and the fund's year-to-date total
return has been 0.8 percent. That's a pretty far cry from 12
percent plus, from my point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, by charter, must invest 65 percent of its portfolio in
investment-grade government securities of the United States,
Canada, and Mexico. The remainder may be invested in Central and
South American government securities.
</P>
<P>
   I'm with you all the way: This is not the fund for investors who
consider themselves conservative. Sure, the 29.57 percent gain of
1995 and the 23.05 percent for 1996 were spectacular, especially
for a bond fund, but don't forget the shuddering 30.80 percent loss
of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The best and highest use of this fund is as a short-term holding
for a speculative investor. I see little prospect that it will
deliver good returns to the long-term holder. (Note: Compare that
5.63 percent five-year average annual total return to the 7.42
percent for boring old Vanguard GNMA fund.)
</P>
<P>
   But there's one final factor, and since you have been municipal
bond investors, I'll bet this will be the final clincher for your
brother. That's taxes. When it comes to tax efficiency, this fund
has very little to offer.
</P>
<P>
   If you hold this fund in a taxable account, you see large
distributions adding up on your form 1040, while your real returns
may be more modest _ or negative.
</P>
<P>
   You write that your investments were made during 1993 and 1994,
so let's use the Jan. 1, 1994 market price for the shares as a
benchmark _ $10.31. If you were to sell, you would probably be able
to report a capital loss of $2.75 to $3 for each of the shares you
initially purchased. (The figure would vary for the additional
shares you bought through reinvestment of distributions, but you
would probably see a loss there as well.)
</P>
<P>
   So not only would a sale get you out of this high-risk holding,
but it would generate a significant capital loss, which could be
used to reduce your tax liabilities or to offset any gain you might
generate elsewhere in your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My siblings and I have set up a trust fund for our mother.
Our ages range from 36 to 56. My mother is almost 80, and the trust
will dissolve upon her death. The trust now holds four mutual
funds: $44,063 in Chesapeake, $77,871 in PIMCo Institutional
Capital Appreciation, $49,887 in PIMCo. Institutional Micro Cap,
and $20,734 in Harbor International. We want to be aggressive and
achieve maximum growth, but we believe we might be too heavily
positioned in small-technology companies. The trust lost 25 percent
of its value since April, most of it since mid-July. Our mother
receives $900 a month from the trust. My preference would be to
invest 30 percent in a Standard &AMP; Poor's Index fund, 30 percent in
a growth and income fund, 30 percent in a small-company fund, and
10 percent in an overseas fund. All funds would need to be rated
five stars by Morningstar. How do you suggest we position ourselves
for the next five years in the current market?
</P>
<P>
   C.M., North Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If it were up to me, I'd invest the entire portfolio in
fixed-income securities, which would allow the trust to generate
the $900 monthly income check with no invasion of principal _ this
would require generating a yield of only 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the realignment you suggest would be a more
conservative course than the current one, but I think it's still
too aggressive. After all, is the purpose of this trust to play the
market for capital gains or to support your mother?
</P>
<P>
   Even with the change you suggest, it's entirely possible that a
couple of tough market years, plus the steady sequence of
withdrawals, could substantially deplete the trust.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely, for example, that the portfolio you suggest could
yield more than 1 percent to 2 percent in dividends, and probably
closer to the former.
</P>
<P>
   So you would be effectively gambling that short-term market
gains will be sufficient to support the sequence of withdrawals.
Since I have a dim view of the short-term prospects for the market,
I think you're making a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed-income funds are boring, perhaps, but there are some
purposes, such as this one, for which they're perfect.

ANTI-CLINTON ADS BACKFIRE ON GINGRICH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORRANCE, Calif. _ There has to be a reason why Republican pols
from New York to this middle-class nerve center south of Los
Angeles are telling their national leaders to keep those three
anti-Clinton ads out of their races.
</P>
<P>
   There has to be a reason why the ads are showing up only in a
tiny number of TV markets with nothing even close to the trumpeted
$10 million behind them.
</P>
<P>
   There has to be a reason why the fourth, and nastiest,
commercial was withheld going into the final weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And there is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, if I had the money, I'd put 'em up here myself,'' said
underdog Democrat Janice Hahn, running for this modestly
conservative congressional seat. ``We're talking about the right
things, and this last-minute silliness only reminds people that
this Congress is obsessed with Clinton and not with them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of an odd national campaign, Newt Gingrich has put
the politics of impeachment ahead of substance, preferring to
communicate with fellow right-wingers as opposed to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Politics aside, what the speaker has done with his last,
over-hyped batch of watered-down campaign commercials is to remind
one and all that throwing President Clinton out of office is a
matter of votes, not evidence. The idea of some solemn,
constitutional process in which bipartisanship and national
consensus dominate is rejected. Instead, Republicans who have
Clinton in their sights are simply going to try to impeach him _ as
quickly as possible. The goal is not to persuade, it is to win.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the first victim of Gingrich's latest stunt any
pretense of judiciousness in the House Judiciary Committee's
``inquiry.'' The public is correct: This thing is almost entirely
partisan.
</P>
<P>
   The other victims are national Republican interests, as distinct
from House Republican and Gingrich interests _ once again.
California's GOP attorney general, Dan Lungren, who is in the final
stages of blowing his chance to be governor, said the other evening
between sparsely attended events that he traces his campaign's
slide to the House vote to formally launch its inquiry and to the
backlash he says that vote created.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis, whose gubernatorial
campaign right now is truly on fire, would differ, but Lungren has
a point, and it is made a lot more forcefully by veteran state
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gingrich never thinks beyond himself,'' one of them told me.
``He didn't need that vote at that time. Look at what's happened
since, nothing. It was only done to position people politically on
the assumption that Clinton was the issue. Well he wasn't then, and
he isn't now.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another California Republican, close to the candidacy of
state Treasurer Matt Fong against Senator Barbara Boxer: ``Maybe,
with very careful targeting, there might be a few House seats
Gingrich could tip with this stuff. But the cost to the rest of us
from backlash is high, and as always that doesn't concern him. It's
just like two years ago, when his ads about the congressional
campaign pulled the plug on poor Bob Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong stuff, but one need look no further than California's
36th Congressional District, a middle-class microcosm of upward
mobility from wacky Venice south to more working class San Pedro.
Once a defense industry hub, it is today more of a New Economy area
_ fiscally conservative but more live-and-let-live culturally,
almost equally divided between the parties. Won by the same 6 point
margin both times by Clinton, but also won handily both times by
outgoing Republican Governor Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The district was redesigned after the 1990 census to be
Republican, but it was won three times by a deft Democratic
centrist, Jane Harman, who is vacating it after losing her
self-financed bid to become the nominee for governor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, it should have been a slam-dunk for GOP state
legislator Steve Kuykendall, a mortgage banker from affluent Rancho
Palos Verdes. But it isn't, and both sides attribute the race's
tightness and volatility to the impeachment backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Hahn says that's only the beginning, that a tighter race
has brought her more attention and her opponent more scrutiny. Her
main argument down the stretch, she told me at a fund-raiser last
week, is that a Congress fixated on Clinton is not fixated on the
education, health care, and retirement security issues on which
voters are fixated.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the closeness of the race, House Democratic leader
Dick Gephardt chose Hahn _ a true scion of a famous family, whose
dad was the legendary Los Angeles County supervisor Kenneth Hahn
and whose brother Jimmy is the city attorney _ to be his
``Candidate from the Real World'' at a press conference mocking the
Gingrich ads.
</P>
<P>
   And to further emphasize it, the Kuykendall camp was terrified
that those commercials might end up on LA television screens. As it
turned out, the ads were confined to a longshot right-winger's
effort to unseat Representative Lois Capps in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Kuykendall's camp says he remains confident, and off the
demographics alone he should be. But the fact this is a horserace
on the final weekend is the perfect metaphor for the national
campaign _ a golden Republican opportunity in peril. And the blame,
his fellow Republicans agree, belongs on Gingrich's shoulders for
putting too much politics into an issue which only works when it
has none.

AWAITING THE SECOND REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGORY MOORE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Even to an observer of just a few days, this island
nation, forbidden to most Americans, presents striking
contradictions: a rich history all but obscured by grinding poverty
and crumbling infrastructure, a touted revolution slowly
compromised by a bifurcated economy that has created a privileged
class in what was to be a classless society.
</P>
<P>
   On a nearly one-hour ride from Jose Marti Airport to the
well-appointed Melia Cohiba Hotel along the beachfront Malecon
boulevard, the sense that Cuba is in trouble is inescapable. You
see it in the faces of the people, staring blankly from glassless
windows and darkened doorways.
</P>
<P>
   As ubiquitous images of the revolutionary hero Che Guevara stare
from billboards and buildings, the desire for change is palpable.
Many of the 12 million inhabitants here seem to be just biding
their time until the second revolution, one that can bring them
into the 21st century of decent housing, prosperity, freedom _ and
perhaps even satellite dishes and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seems to an American visitor _ part of a 32-member
delegation of journalists from the American Society of Newspaper
Editors who arrived in the country on a fact-finding mission 11
days ago. The Cuba we saw on our four-day stay, a stay carefully
choreographed by a watchful government, is a Cuba most of the
population rarely glimpses up close.
</P>
<P>
   Ours was a privileged view. We were ferried about in an
air-conditioned bus. We were accompanied constantly by Cuban
officials whose task it was to accommodate us. And we met with
Fidel Castro himself, something the few regular Cubans I spoke to
had ever done.
</P>
<P>
   We saw only fleeting, unofficial glimpses of the poverty that
grips many on the island. Our carefully orchestrated meetings were
scheduled nearly back-to-back so we had no time to roam. They were
aimed at illuminating the accomplishments of the 39 years since
Castro stormed Cuba, spreading the communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Cuba has much to be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   Officials boast that Cuba has no organized crime, and a low
overall crime rate. They note that few, if any, criminals have
guns. Theft, they admit, is a big problem, with prostitution a
growing aggravation. And yes, there is talk of a mounting drug
problem, though the Minister of Justice Roberto Diaz Sotolongo
denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cuba has many measures of its success: It has a minuscule
infant mortality rate of 7.2 per thousand, an illiteracy rate of
only 2 percent, a home ownership rate of 85 percent and a free
health care system that inoculates 95 percent of its children
against 12 diseases and which developed a vaccine that virtually
eliminated meningitis, a big killer.
</P>
<P>
   Concepcion Campa Huergo, a physician and president of the Carlos
Finlay Institute and the only ranking woman we met in the
government, said the institute is working on a vaccine for cholera
and hepatitis. And US officals here said the Cubans are consumed
with finding the cure for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But the confidence of the government seems sadly disconnected
from the hopes and dreams of the people.
</P>
<P>
   As we traveled through the narrow streets amid the crumbling
Spanish-style architecture, even on a weekday many people seemed to
have nothing to do. Yet the government claims an unemployment rate
of under 7 percent. Scrawny dogs roamed the roads and markets
looking for scraps. No doubt there are some Cubans who enjoy a
comfortable existence, but they appear to be outnumbered by their
countrymen living on the margins.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Cuban home is said to be sparsely furnished,
containing only a refrigerator (almost always an aging Philco), a
television (probably color), a battered sofa, and a beloved pet the
family can barely afford to feed. Despite the high rate of home
ownership, Cubans I spoke with said the average young person has
little hope of owning a home anytime soon unless they inherit it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the Soviet Union, once Cuba's great
benefactor, pumped nearly $5 billion into the country each year for
sugar exports and other goods. But with the Soviet Union's breakup
seven years ago, that aid is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cuba is on its own, hunting for new markets, trying to
rebuild its confidence _ and to survive. In a revealing meeting,
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and a possible
successor to Castro, said the first few years after Soviet aid
dried up were difficult ``not only economically, but ... on a
psychological level. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``To wake up one day and realize you are alone. That created in
many Cubans uncertainty _ `What are we now?' ... From that moment
to this year, the mood has drastically changed,'' he said. ``I
don't think anyone in Cuba is uncertain about our destiny. The mood
now is more optimistic, more constructive.''
</P>
<P>
   But to survive, the only communist government in the Western
Hemisphere has had to swallow a bitter pill. It's called
capitalism, although no one uses that word.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the country has been in what Economic Minister Jose
Luis Rodriguez calls ``the special period,'' one in which Cuba has
opened itself to billions in foreign investment and joint ventures
with international enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   And since 1993, the nation has authorized the circulation of
foreign currencies, most notably dollars, and the creation of
private businesses. The most profitable entrepreneurs are taxi
drivers, plumbers, carpenters, and restaurateurs who are limited to
seating 12 people at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for this freedom to pursue dollars and experiment
with a market economy, these enterprises pay taxes to the state, as
much as 1,000 Cuban pesos a month, regardless of what they take in.
That is roughly equivalent to $50, a significant amount by Cuban
domestic standards.
</P>
<P>
   These entrepreneurs have to work hard to attract dollars, since
Americans are banned from the country under terms of the
controversial 36-year-old US embargo constantly denounced by the
Cuban government. But somehow, dollars still permeate the economy.
For some, they are far easier to come by than pesos.
</P>
<P>
   And the growing dollar economy has had the effect of creating
two Cubas: one, in which people who get dollars (legally or
illegally) eat better, buy better goods, and enjoy greater status.
The other, ruled by the peso, is poorer, far less privileged, and
more dissatisified.
</P>
<P>
   All of those who work for the state _ be they doctors, lawyers,
police officers, or teachers _ are paid in pesos, about 350 a
month, or $17 at current rates. While there are some perks,
including cars, inexpensive housing, free medical care, and
educational benefits, state workers are acutely aware that others
doing ``less important'' work are being paid in dollars, with all
the buying power that brings.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, some professionals have quit their state jobs
and started driving taxis to earn dollars, officials acknowledged.
Allowing this dual economy to exist, Castro told us, is ``very
painful.'' He added: ``We would have preferred never to establish
these differences.''
</P>
<P>
   In this land of contradictions is yet another: There are places
_ including the island's most elegant establishments _ where Cubans
are apparently not allowed to go, an insidious form of apartheid
that government officials are reluctant to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But walk into the large hotels along the Malecon and in the
tourist mecca, Varadero, where foreigners lavishly spend their
currencies, and one can see uniformed workers, some with earpieces,
ready to stop any Cuban who might try to enter the lobbies. Why?
Perhaps out of fear that just the sight of such opulence and
consumption might incite insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's ministers defend the accelerated effort to bolster
tourism, saying this is the only way to attract the foreign capital
needed to rebuild this nation. This year, Cuba expects to have 1
million visitors, mostly Canadians, but Germans and Spaniards, too.
By the year 2000, Cuba hopes to double that number, and by 2010, to
have 7 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dire straits Cuba finds itself in, there are some
steps toward capitalism the country is simply not willing to take.
One of those is resurrecting gambling casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not interested in gambling,'' said Tourism Minister
Osmany Cienfuegos. ``Some other countries in Latin America are
thinking about this. But for Cuba, gambling has a very special
meaning. Gambling in Cuba brings vices. For the people it has a
very psychological meaning in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   While the burgeoning tourist trade and other changes may bring
some stability, it comes at a cost.
</P>
<P>
   On my last night in Havana, I spoke with a young man of about 21
who waited tables in a restaurant. In perfect English he told me
his dream is to be a teacher. But he said he makes more money
waiting tables than he can ever make standing in front of a high
school class.
</P>
<P>
   He believes in many of the ideals of the revolution, but wants
to own a home, own a car, and have a family. And he wonders how can
he do that on 250 to 350 pesos a month.
</P>
<P>
   It's a question many Cubans are asking as they appear to
patiently await the second revolution, the one that will inevitably
come after Fidel Castro leaves the scene.
</P>
<P>
   And then maybe, just maybe, Cuba can seize the 21st century and
its promise of a better life.

FIDEL CASTRO IS EVER THE TIRELESS REVOLUTIONARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGORY L. MOORE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Fidel Castro is a striking figure. Ramrod straight and
over 6 feet tall, he is, at 72, fit and trim. Meeting with a group
of US journalists here eight days ago, he promised to talk for as
long as we wanted. Six intense hours later _ with only a 10-minute
break _ he finished.
</P>
<P>
   He was nothing like the beard-stroking pontificator that is
often portrayed. Instead, wearing his trademark fatigues, he was
charismatic, curious, passionate, a lover of books, and a lively
debater.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation with our delegation from the American Society
of Newspaper Editors, Castro answered 15 questions, sometimes
making long speeches before coming back to the point. He complained
about the press, denied he has accumulated personal wealth, talked
about baseball, and speculated about Cuba's future without him.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union may have crumbled, he said, but Cuba remains
committed to the principles of its revolution. Evidence of its
success lies in the fact that most people have jobs, own their own
homes, and all have access to free health care and free education,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He lambasted the United States for its longstanding embargo
against the island. He called it an act of war and a violation of
Cubans' human rights. ``It has caused enormous pain for nearly 40
years,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter. ``But the
revolution proves that if you have a little and you distribute it
equally, you can make miracles happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On American newspapers' desire to operate in Cuba in the same
way that Cable News Network already does, Castro was discouraging.
It's acceptable, he said, for American reporters to visit Cuba for
special events like the pope's visit last January, but not on a
permanent basis, not yet. What would make him change his mind? ``If
I were certain objective reporters would come to Cuba and not be
biased beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised the success of Cuban Major League Baseball players,
but bristled at a suggestion that he had dispatched them to the
United States. ``We did not send them,'' he thundered. ``You stole
them. If you have to compete against $6 million vs. 3,000 pesos,
you cannot win.'' He said, half-jokingly, that maybe a couple of
Cuban teams could join the Major Leagues to show just how good they
are.
</P>
<P>
   Castro became most animated about a Forbes magazine report
suggesting he had accumulated $1.5 billion in personal wealth,
demanding, ``What right do they have to write such slander?'' He
said he owns no property and recently donated 17,500 gifts
accumulated from his many travels. Along with some books, he said,
he kept the black $30 Seiko watch on his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a revolutionary,'' he said. ``I do not need
a bank account anywhere. I have made a decision to die in my trench
with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about retirement, he scoffed. ``Do you think one has the
right to retire in the midst of such a struggle the country faces?
There is only one reason to be here at my age. Duty and
responsibility. As long as I have the necessary energy to do what
is imposed on me, I will remain.''
</P>
<P>
   And after he is gone, what happens?
</P>
<P>
   ``People consider without reason that my absence could alter the
course of events,'' he said. ``The day I am no longer here nothing
is going to happen and possibly things will be even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted, the editors eventually ran out of questions. Castro
moved to a downstairs lobby to shake hands and pose for photos for
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving with his entourage, the revolutionary leader slipped
into a sparkling black Mercedes-Benz, and was whisked away.

LIVES ENTITLED TO OUR PRAYERS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One is the image of our warmest fantasies: her tufts of
strawberry-blond hair, her plump cheeks, and full-bodied wail.
</P>
<P>
   The other is the embodiment of our worst nightmares: her violent
conception, her shrunken limbs, and fragile lungs.
</P>
<P>
   In an old industrial city, a young woman goes into labor in the
nursing home bed where for three years she has lain comatose and
vulnerable to an as-yet-unidentified predator. The 2-pound
premature infant she delivers clings to life in a hospital's
neonatal intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   In a wealthy Boston suburb, the sound of a car door is our only
link to the mother who left her robust newborn on the steps of a
modern castle, complete with turret and fairy godmother. All 7
pounds, 6 ounces of health and possibility settles into the home of
one of scores of families clamoring to adopt her.
</P>
<P>
   Two births. Two babies. One difficult, confusing week in the
annals of maternity.
</P>
<P>
   By the simple act of conferring a name on the baby left on a
Newton doorstep, we will a promising future for Baby Julia. By
withholding as much from the baby born to an unconscious rape
victim, we betray our lack of hope for Baby Girl. We try not to
think too much about their mothers, one oblivious to her
motherhood, the other apparently too frightened to acknowledge
hers.
</P>
<P>
   We know nothing of the circumstances of Baby Julia's conception
and birth, yet we spin a story line that suits our need for happy
endings. We imagine a young mother with a face out of a Walker
Evans photograph and a heart out of a Bing Crosby movie canvassing
a Newton neighborhood to select the perfect home for her princess.
She sees the lights of the stone castle. Fade to the fairy
godmother fetching her morning newspapers and discovering the
irresistible foundling.
</P>
<P>
   We edit out the terror and desperation this newly-minted mom
must have felt as she wrapped her daughter, umbilical cord still
attached, in a small, bloody towel. Where did she deliver this
baby? In a back seat, in the predawn chill of an October morning?
Did she drive herself to the house where she left her child? Was
she alone? Did the contractions take her by surprise? Had her
pregnancy advanced just as unacknowledged and undetected as the
pregnancy of the comatose woman in the nursing home?
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, we know too much about the circumstances of Baby
Girl's conception and birth. The most we can muster for her future
is a prayer that if she survives _ she is in critical condition at
Floating Hospital for Children at the New England Medical Center in
Boston _ she will not emerge as damaged as the mother who bore her,
a 24-year-old woman rendered silent and defenseless after an
apparent drug overdose in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While Massachusetts courts pondered the fate of these two
babies, a judge in New Jersey sentenced a young woman for killing
her newborn son at her senior prom. Melissa Drexler had admitted
giving birth to a healthy boy in a bathroom stall during the prom
last year. She wrapped him in a plastic bag and placed him in a
trash can before returning to the dance.
</P>
<P>
   Was Drexler uncaring or unbalanced? Was her crime a symbol of
our culture's indifference to human life or a case study of our
ignorance of the mind's capacity for denial?
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the prosecution and defense drew different
portraits of the tearful young woman in the dock. Drexler's friends
had written to the court on her behalf, noted prosecutor Elaine
Leschot, but it was her job to speak for a discarded baby. ``The
friend of the baby in this courtroom is me,'' Leschot said.
``Somebody has to say, `We will protect the helpless.'''
</P>
<P>
   She was right, of course. But so was Steven Secare, the defense
lawyer, who reminded the court how many countries consider
psychiatric treatment rather than imprisonment the proper response
to such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of both the mother's distress and the baby's death,
Judge John A. Ricciardi tried to walk a middle course. He would
leave it to others to explain how a teenage girl could deliver a
baby before the salad course and continue partying through dessert.
``What the law is concerned with is that a life has been taken,''
he said before sentencing Drexler to 15 years in prison. ``The
victim here has as much right to life as any one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler will be eligible for parole after two years and 11
months. She is not ``a monster,'' the judge declared. ``She's
entitled to our understanding, to our compassion, and, indeed, our
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   No less so than Baby Julia and Baby Girl and the mothers who
bore them.

ACERBIC SITCOM SHOWS PROMISE BUT NEEDS DOCTORING 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS 5thgraf, The problem, to identify network)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ready for another Archie Bunker? That's exactly what the
producers of ``Becker'' are hoping because this Ted Danson vehicle
is all about being politically incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a good thing, really. Television has become so safe
and devoid of sharp edges that it's boring beyond its normal level.
Producers are so afraid that jokes will step on someone's feelings
that bland wins every time.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not start thinking that just because Danson's
character is acerbic and angry he's as funny or as important as
Bunker. First off, there's very little racial humor in the pilot of
``Becker'' and that was the catalyst to ``All in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Becker'' is a sitcom we're going to have to see a lot more of
to truly pass judgment. That's because the pilot is half annoying,
half encouraging. It's funny in a lot of places but predictable and
trite in others.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is in the attitude. Dave Hackel, the executive
producer, creator and writer of the pilot for CBS, wants to take
his Howard Beale-like anger at the world and give it a forum. Up on
that soap box steps Dr. John Becker, who has a compassionate
practice in the Bronx but lives his life as one unholy (literally)
curmudgeon.
</P>
<P>
   He's fed up with everything. He goes on an assortment of rants _
most of which are dated or seem patently orchestrated. About talk
shows, Becker says: ``It's like America stepped in something and
it's scraping off its shoe right over my TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything can set him off: ``White trash is the only natural
resource this country will never run out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is spared. ``If you shut your mouth, it stops the words
from falling out like that,'' he tells Linda (Shawnee Smith), his
spacey nurse's aide.
</P>
<P>
   He yells out the window to his neighbor, who is playing loud
ethnic music: ``Hey, foreign guy! Turn it off or I call
immigration.'' He rants about bicyclists, car salesmen, Jesus (``I
think he fell asleep at the wheel'') and to Jake, the blind
newsstand operator who works out of Becker's favorite bar: ``Just
because you're blind doesn't mean you've got a sixth sense. It just
means you're blind.''
</P>
<P>
   Now most of this stuff is pretty funny. It would be funnier if
it seemed more natural, not just following a scene created to set
up another rant. But give Danson credit, he's funny as Mr. Bitter
and it's a role he could make his second-biggest if ``Becker''
rounds into shape. There's a load of potential here, but the kinks
need to be hammered out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem with being grumpy is that as an
unlikable character, most people will turn the channel if you have
nothing else to offer. Archie Bunker was tolerable not only because
he was funny, but because it was clear he was a big softy under the
blowhard exterior.
</P>
<P>
   But the producers go overboard with Danson. Sensing that need,
the producers have him fall for a 7-year-old patient who contracted
HIV and is losing the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding cast may help. No-nonsense head nurse Margaret
(wonderfully fleshed out by Hattie Winston) cuts him down a lot.
And Reggie (Terry Farrell), the female bartender/owner of his
favorite hangout, looks to be some kind of love interest down the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping ``Becker'' gets that far down the line. The world
of television needs a caustic hero we can love and hate. Make the
soap box less apparent and cut the sap, and ``Becker'' may be the
tonic TV needs.

QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT THE CIA'S ROLE IN THE MIDEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord avoids any
mention of one major development: an increase in the power _ and
the profile _ of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials say the agency will do nothing more than monitor
the peace process, as it has done several times in the Mideast. But
former officials and analysts say the agency has never assumed such
a public assignment in so turbulent a region. Even some of those
who support the CIA's offer to help the peace process concede that
the secretive agency is not prepared for the scrutiny and
complaints it will receive.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and critics alike warn that officers will have
trouble balancing two conflicting roles: serving as mediators while
remaining Washington's objective eyes and ears in the region.
</P>
<P>
   R. James Woolsey, a former director of central intelligence,
backs the agency's new, high-profile venture, provided CIA officers
have strict limits on their monitoring roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they report back to the US government, there's no
problem,'' Woolsey said. ``What gets dicey is if they have to
assess what the Palestinians are doing and then report directly to
Israel officials. That gets them betwixt and between.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the plan for CIA involvement has drawn the
support of several left-leaning groups such as Americans for Peace
Now while drawing criticism from the right.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Republican Richard C. Shelby, who heads the Senate
Intelligence Committee, says the CIA is in danger of overstepping
its authority. Appearing on the Fox television network Oct. 25 he
said, ``What is the role of the CIA? Is it to be an arbitrator? Is
it to be bodyguards? I think not.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence specialists say the CIA's involvement in the region
is nothing new. They say the CIA has long maintained contacts with
Israeli security agencies as well as Yasser Arafat and his inner
circle, even when the Palestinians were fighting Israel. In the
aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur war, US intelligence agencies kept
track of Israeli troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-page agreement signed on Oct. 23 speaks vaguely of the
American government's attendance at biweekly meetings to ``review
the steps being taken to eliminate terrorist cells and the support
structure that plans, finances, supplies and abets terror.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be done by a ``US-Palestinian committee.'' In
addition, a ``high ranking US-Palestinian-Israeli committee'' will
meet at least twice a week ``to assess current threats'' and
coordinate anti-terrorism strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: CIA officials will be actively involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA is the right choice and they have a good working
relationship with both Israelis and Palestinians,'' said Richard
Shultz, an international security expert at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   But Shultz said the agency runs a risk whenever it crosses over
from covert to overt policy-making as it monitors the peace
process. ``What if the CIA issues a status report saying things are
not going well? Does the administration lean on the CIA to say,
`What can you say that's positive?'''
</P>
<P>
   That's not merely a hypothetical issue. Historians say that
during the 1980s, President Reagan's intelligence director, William
Casey, became convinced that Mexico was close to having a
revolution. Casey ordered a National Intelligence Estimate _ a
weighty report that offers the best intelligence from the Central
Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and other spy
services. When they concluded that Mexico would not have
revolution, Casey ignored the expertise and ordered that the final
report to be more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey, the former CIA director, said the CIA can avoid such
problems by reporting impartially to Washington, even when the news
is bad. ``If some deputy assistant secretary says, `You're too
negative, can't you take the adjectives out?' they can tell 'em to
go peddle their papers,'' Woolsey said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most members of Congress have been cautious about
speaking out against the CIA's commitment in the region. Senator
John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said it is difficult to tell whether
the agency is taking on a new task or simply getting more publicity
than usual. Either way, Kerry said, ``I am prepared to see the CIA
play this role because our interest in furthering the cause of
peace in the Middle East is overriding.''
</P>
<P>
   But others warn that the CIA is entering a foreign policy
minefield. Joe Stork, who directs Mideast programs for Human Rights
Watch, the nonprofit group, found it ironic that the peace accord
became public just as news reports emerged about the agency's close
relationship with an oppressive military government in Honduras in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the CIA's record of complicity with abusive governments
and security forces elsewhere in the world, we're concerned about
the role they're playing in this peace agreement,'' Stork said.
``Maybe it's a reformed CIA, but it begs questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stork sees other potential problems in the document signed at
the White House. At one point, it exhorts the Palestinians to take
``all measures necessary'' to prevent terrorism. Later, the
document says human rights should be honored ``without derogating
from the above'' promise to quash terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be read to say, `Security first, human rights
second,''' Stork said. Yet at Americans for Peace Now, spokesman
Lewis Roth said, ``We're very supportive of the strong American
role in the peace process, and certainly the CIA as an agency
representing the United States in the region seems to have
developed enough trust from the Israelis and the Palestinians so
that it can play a bridging role.''
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the Palestinian delegation to the early peace
talks says the CIA's involvement could spell political problems for
the Palestinians. ``It's not likely to be something that's going to
endear Yasser Arafat to his critics _ this will be seen as the
Palestinian Authority operating at the behest of the US agency
that's close to Israel,'' Khalidi said.

<P>
   The most recent launch of Discovery was one of those moments
when Americans everywhere stopped whatever they were doing and
stared at their television sets. Many watched CNN, which hired
legendary anchorman Walter Cronkite for the occasion of John
Glenn's triumphant return to space. Cronkite had been the voice of
Glenn's first mission in 1962. Glenn was then an authentic American
hero.
</P>
<P>
   So much has changed in 36 years. As Discovery disappeared out of
camera range and through the sky last Thursday, Cronkite spoke of
the majesty of space travel. Had he expanded his commentary, he
might also have mentioned the breath-taking cynicism that made this
particular mission possible.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's return to space was hardly heroic. It was instead the
story of one of the most tawdry political tradeoffs in recent
memory.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was straightforward. Glenn got to fly on the space
shuttle in return for his unceasing efforts to derail the Thompson
Committee hearings concerning the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign
finance scandals. Lest anyone forget, those scandals involved vast
amounts of Asian money finding its way into the campaign accounts
of the presidents reelection campaign and the Democratic National
Committee, two ledgers that meet the definition of the phrase
``distinction without a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those monies came from operatives with direct ties to
the government of the People's Republic of China. Other of those
funds came through the mysterious John Huang, whose access to the
White House and top-secret intelligence data remains the subject of
a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was explicit with the White House about what he expected
in return. USA TODAY columnist Walter Shapiro, in a recent column
for Slate magazine, chronicled the chain of events: ``On July 6,
1997, the Sunday before the Thompson hearings began, Glenn used his
appearance on `Meet the Press' to publicly lobby for his
last-hurrah launch into space. He was followed on the broadcast by
NASA administrator Daniel Goldin, who purred, `I want to tell you
John is an outstanding astronaut and a great American. He has a
burning desire to go back into space. And we're giving it very
serious consideration, and we'll see where this goes.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where this went,'' Shapiro wrote, ``was toward a month of
nonstop obstructive tactics by Glenn patently designed to block any
serious examination of Clinton's ... campaign fund-raising abuses.
(I) attended every day of the hearings and this was one time when
Glenn was anything but an American hero.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Glenn deny, of course, that any such deal
was struck. And one supposes that they are, as the Wall Street
Journal Editorial Page noted, ``legally accurate'' in this regard.
No one has knowledge that they talked face-to-face about it. But
you would have had to have been born yesterday to believe that what
happened Thursday, five days before the midterm elections that may
decide whether or not President Clinton is impeached by the House
of Representatives, was a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is 77 years old. The oldest man ever to travel in space,
astronaut Story Musgrave, did so at the age of 61. At age 67, NASA
informed him he was too old for space travel.
</P>
<P>
   NASA maintains that Glenn's purpose on this mission is to allow
the agency to study the effects of aging in space. Given that the
medical data on Musgrave is much more complete (and therefore more
pertinent to the supposed medical inquiry), NASA would have been
much better off sending Musgrave instead of Glenn. But Musgrave
never threw sand into the gears of an inquiry into the president's
corrupt campaign practices, so he was cast aside to make room for
someone who had.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons to vote straight Republican on Tuesday is to
send a clear message to Washington that this kind of conduct is
unacceptable. Corrupting the space program for the benefit of a
favorite son who has done the president's bidding is sleazy by any
measure. The fact that it is no less sleazy than many other public
actions taken by the Clinton administration is but another reason
to punish the president's party at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's ride on the space shuttle was described in this
newspaper Friday as a ``journey of the national spirit.'' It would
have been better described as a metaphor for heroism in the age of
Clinton. Had Glenn investigated the Clinton campaign's fund-raising
abuses without fear or favor and cooperated fully with Senator
Thompson and his staff, then he would never have been on the launch
pad Thursday. His obstruction of a serious inquiry into corrupt
practices is what qualified him for the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now taints even those agencies of government that
represent our highest aspirations. For years, the space program was
emblematic of America's greatness: our willingness to reach for the
stars. Today, the Discovery still flies in perfect orbit, guided by
the programmers of perfect software, piloted by the best men and
women the nation has to offer. But it is diminished by the
sleaziness for which Clinton stands. The heroism of 36 years ago is
not heroism today.

WHAT REAL HATE SPEECH SOUNDS LIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prochoicers were quick to link the cold-blooded murder of
Barnett Slepian, the New York abortion doctor, to ``hate speech''
from the prolife mainstream. On the CBS Evening News last week, Dan
Rather raised the charge that ``rhetoric from the anti-abortion
movement is helping to incite this kind of murderous violence.'' A
New York Times editorial warned, ``Frequent accusations by some
anti-abortionists that abortion providers are committing murder can
only fuel more terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   This variety of guilt by association _ blaming decent if
passionate prolifers for the awful crimes of a fanatic on the
fringe _ has become routine. When John Salvi killed two abortion
clinic employees in Brookline on the last day of 1994, the Planned
Parenthood spokesman promptly censured the ``inflammatory
rhetoric'' of abortion opponents for having ``fostered this
climate.'' The National Organization for Women declared, ``The
National Right to Life Committee, the Pro-Life Action League and
Operation Rescue ... are responsible for these shootings.'' Slepian
himself vented the same outrageous accusation. ``These nonviolent
people who are clasping their rosaries,'' he said then, ``... bear
some responsibility for the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it only in the context of abortion that such charges are
made. When Matthew Shepard was beaten to death in Wyoming, the
``homophobia'' of anyone who disapproves of homosexuality was
blamed for the atrocity. The lynching of James Byrd in Jasper,
Tex., was the fault, in part, of ``racism'' from those who oppose
racial preferences. The terrorist attack on the federal building in
Oklahoma City? That was laid to ``extremism'' from conservative
radio talk-show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   It amounts to a kind of intellectual blackmail: Keep your
opinions to yourselves, the Left threatens its critics, or we will
condemn you and your ``hate speech'' for encouraging homicide. (The
bullying is almost always one-way _ conservatives did not indict
environmentalists for the crimes of the Unabomer, or hold antiwar
protesters liable for the murders of the Weather Underground.) But
that is not the worst of it. Those who play the hate-speech card as
a way of demonizing people they disagree with are not only
poisoning public discourse, they are trivializing the power of
speech that truly (ital) is (unital) lethal.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good month to reflect on the toxicity of words meant
to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 9 marks the 60th anniversary of (ital) Kristallnacht,
(unital) the 1938 ``Night of Shattered Glass'' unleashed by the
Nazis to terrorize Germany's Jews. The date was chosen specially by
Josef Goebbels, Hitler's propagandist, to honor the birthday of
Martin Luther, the 16th century monk who was a father of the
Protestant Reformation and the founder of what became the Lutheran
church.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler greatly admired Luther: ``He saw the Jew as we are only
beginning to see him today.'' Indeed. Luther saw the Jew as
``hopeless, wicked, venomous, and devilish ... our pest, torment,
and misfortune.'' Initially certain that his version of
Christianity would appeal to Jews, he expected large numbers of
them to convert. When that failed to happen, he turned violently
against them. In 1543, Luther published ``On the Jews and Their
Lies,'' a work that would become known throughout Germany _ perhaps
the most widely disseminated work of antisemitism by a German until
the rise of the Nazis 400 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``What then shall we Christians do with this damned, rejected
race of Jews?'' Luther asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, their synagogues should be set on fire, and whatever
does not burn up should be covered or spread over with dirt, so
that no one may ever be able to see a cinder or stone of it....
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, their homes should likewise be broken down and
destroyed....
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirdly, they should be deprived of their prayer-books and
Talmuds, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing, and blasphemy are
taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourthly, their rabbis must be forbidden under threat of death
to teach any more....
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifthly, passports and traveling privileges should be
absolutely forbidden to the Jews....
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixthly, I advise that ... all cash and treasure of silver and
gold be taken from them....
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn down their synagogues, forbid all that I enumerated
earlier, force them to work, and deal harshly with them.... If this
does not help we must drive them out like mad dogs, so we do not
become partakers of their abominable blasphemy and all their other
vices. I have done my duty. Now let everyone see to his.''
</P>
<P>
   (ital) That (unital) is hate speech.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years ago next Monday, on the night of Luther's birthday,
Nazi gangs rampaged across Germany. In every Jewish neighborhood,
windows were smashed and buildings were torched. All told, 101
synagogues were destroyed, and nearly 7,500 Jewish-owned business
were demolished. On that night, 91 Jews were murdered; 26,000 more
were rounded up and sent to concentration camps. It was the
greatest pogrom in history. And it was nothing compared with what
was to come.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, words can kill. There is such a thing as deadly rhetoric,
and its effects can be long-lived and murdereous. But one is not
guilty of lethal hate speech merely for voicing an opinion that Dan
Rather or Planned Parenthood don't share. The assassination of Dr.
Slepian was bad enough. No one should be using his death as an
excuse to slander others.

basking in the warm water discharged from a nearby Fort Pierce
Utilities Authority power plant. But the plant, operating less
often under a new agreement to pool power with other utilities, is
generating less warm water. So Liberta Scotto, director of the
Manatee Observation and Education Center, built in 1996 at the
mouth of the creek, proposed the showers as a two-year experiment.

ELECTIONS LIKELY TO OUTLINE CLINTON'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ In ways that the principals in Washington can
neither now imagine nor deny, the pace, intensity, reach, rhythm,
and very likely even the outcome of the presidential impeachment
drama will be incontrovertibly altered by Tuesday's elections in
places like this.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the unusual circumstances and unprecedented stakes of
this year's midterm elections are apparent here in central Florida,
where the four critical elements of this year's contests are
dramatically underlined in one congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the city neighborhoods, military bases, tourist
attractions, retirement enclaves, orange groves, and bass-fishing
centers scattered between Jacksonville and Orlando, is the American
political landscape writ large: A strong economy. Few competitive
races. The near certainty that a Republican will win a
gubernatorial race. And a whiff of scandal pervading everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election has to be watched closely in the White House,''
said Michael Birkner, a Gettysburg College historian. ``Mr.
Clinton's 1999 will be deeply affected by the results of the 1998
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is seldom mentioned on the stump as
congressional candidates race from shopping malls and autumn fairs
to political forums and downtown rallies. But though his name does
not appear on a single ballot anywhere in the country, his fate in
the White House and perhaps in history may be sealed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No House Judiciary Committee member who returns to the capital
for this month's impeachment hearings will be unmarked by Tuesday's
results. Some lawmakers who are likely to cast votes on an
impeachment resolution on the House floor in December will have
been repudiated by the voters back home in November. Some of the
jurors in any Senate trial of the president next year will be
chosen this week.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan anger over impeachment that has coursed quietly but
unmistakably beneath the midterm campaigns boiled over with an
exchange of late-hour television advertisements. Even if voters
ultimately make their choices on the basis of candidates' views on
taxes and trade, education and the environment rather than on the
president's conduct, the elections are an important marker in the
sex scandal that has engulfed Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The election results could add fuel to the drive to impeach the
president, or they could persuade lawmakers to find a less severe
resolution to the episode, such as a congressional reprimand or
censure.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee approval of three resolutions of
impeachment against Richard M. Nixon in 1974 came three months
before midterm elections, before the voters had rendered their
verdicts. The votes on any resolutions of impeachment against
Clinton will probably come only weeks after the 1998 midterm
elections, after the voters' verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when President Clinton first won the White House,
Florida was the most competitive political state in the nation,
with close contests in 21 of the state's 23 congressional
districts. This year, with Jeb Bush almost certain to win the
governor's office in Tallahassee, 18 of Florida's House members are
unopposed, and analysts agree that only one of the 23 races is
remotely competitive.
</P>
<P>
   And in that one race, where Democratic Representative Corinne
Brown is being challenged by onetime local NAACP president Bill
Randall, a cloud of scandal hangs over the battle. Brown is facing
charges of financial irregularities and questions about how her
daughter acquired a $50,000 Lexus, while Randall is facing
questions about fathering a son out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this classic battleground _ Clinton lost the area by
100,000 votes in 1992, only to win it by 300,000 votes four years
later _ as elsewhere around the country, peculiar local factors
provide the leitmotif of the election. Not since 1982, when
Democrats successfully transformed midterm elections into a broad
debate over the future of Social Security, have off-year elections
been conducted on national themes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, despite the backdrop of scandal and a $10 million
infusion of Republican ads reminding voters about the president's
conduct and his misleading statements, there is little evidence
that the election is a referendum on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Though a Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll conducted last week
showed that voters, 47 percent to 25 percent, are less likely to
support a candidate who favors impeachment, the polltakers who
conducted the survey minimize the impact of impeachment on
Tuesday's races.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at it upside down and inside out and you see zero
impact of impeachment, zero referendum on Bill Clinton,'' said
Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans don't disagree. William McInturff, a GOP consultant,
compared the Clinton scandals to a baked Alaska dessert. ``There
are flames everywhere, but they burn off and disappear. The
alcohol's kind of gone but there are traces left. Now this looks
like a very normal offterm election. It's very remarkable how
little Clinton's in the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's fate is very much tied to the election. There are
as many scenarios as there are outcomes to the contests.
</P>
<P>
   In the unlikely event of a Democratic takeover of the House, for
example, the Republicans might re-think their drive to impeach the
president in the last few weeks of their control of the chamber _
or they could rush to complete it before their power ebbs.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans, who now hold a 22-seat advantage in the
House, tighten their hold, they could feel more emboldened to act
against the president. If their margin, the smallest majority since
1954, diminishes even further, they could feel more restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size of a Republican majority will tell us a lot about
what happens to him,'' said Austin Ranney, a political scientist at
the University of California at Berkeley. ``And the way the
elections are interpreted could cause a backlash against the
Republicans, not the president, and it may open the way toward a
resolution of this different from impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   For months the public has felt that the course of the
presidential sex scandal was out of their hands. Tuesday, the
public regains control. And its verdict will almost certainly shape
the verdict on the president's conduct _ and shape the politics of
the remainder of the century and the beginning of the presidential
campaign of the year 2000.

MEDICAL COMMUNITY'S RESPONSE TO DOCTOR'S KILLING   IS MUTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would have sent a powerful message: hundreds of doctors, in
white lab coats, standing as one at the funeral of Dr. Barnett
Slepian. But there was no long white line mourning the New York
obstetrician murdered nine days ago for practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   When a police officer is killed in the line of duty, law
enforcement mourns as one. When a firefighter dies doing his job,
the funeral is attended by scores of colleagues from around the
country. When writer Salman Rushdie was targeted for death in 1989
by the ayatollah, authors picketed the Iranian mission to the
United Nations and called for the withdrawal of their books from
any store that chose not to sell Rushdie's novel.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of Slepian's murder, the response from the
medical establishment has been muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is everybody?'' asks Dr. Richard Hausknecht, a New York
physician who helped establish the first legal abortion clinic in
New York City in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a bright, capable, and highly trained ob-gyn
performing his life's work; he provided prenatal care, he delivered
babies, provided contraception and safe, legal abortions. And he
was brutally killed before his family's eyes. Just think of those
kids in the kitchen with their daddy. But there is silence from the
elected House and Senate and the medical establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, where three doctors who perform abortions have been
wounded by a sniper in the past four years, the response from the
medical establishment has been outrage _ and action. On Monday, the
day of Slepian's funeral, the Canadian Medical Association
announced a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest
of the individuals involved in the Canadian shootings. Law
enforcement officials believe one person may be responsible for the
three Canadian shootings and Slepian's assassination. The
association is trying to get its regional organizations to up the
reward to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physicians in this country banded together to help each
other,'' said Marc Perreault, of the Canadian Medical Association.
``The more money offered, the more information might come in, and
we will not tolerate violence of any kind against doctors, and we
just saw this as the best way to protect physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Canadian organization's US counterpart _ the
300,000-member American Medical Association _ has offered a more
tepid response. On Monday it issued a statement expressing shock
and sorrow at Slepian's death and noted that ``violence is never an
acceptable response to resolving the philosphical, moral, and
religious differences we may share as a people.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Smoak, chairman of the AMA board of trustees, said in
an interview Thursday that the AMA would also meet tomorrow with
Attorney General Janet Reno and the FBI to express concern over the
violence, and get information on how health care workers can better
protect themselves. But on Friday, a spokesman for Reno said the
attorney general will be on vacation all week, and had no meeting
scheduled with the AMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local medical society (in New York) has a very strong
expression against this useless killing, and we have shown
responsiveness,'' said Smoak. ``I'm not sure what you can expect to
hope for, except that law enforcement can bring the killers to
justice and you protect yourself as best as you can.'' There are no
immediate plans, he said, for the AMA to offer reward money or to
organize any formal demonstration against the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
called for all groups in the abortion debate to speak against
violence, an increase in state and federal intervention, and
increased physician training in abortion _ in all, a much stronger
response than the AMA's.
</P>
<P>
   While several doctors from around the country have volunteered
to go to Buffalo to work in Slepian's place until a permanent
replacement can be found, such expressions appear isolated and not
anything close to an expression of medical solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the medical community as a whole, in every single
community, not to be out condemning this horrific act is
astonishing,'' said Kate Michelman, president of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. ``All doctors
should be out there, but ACOG are the only ones,'' she said,
referring to the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie J. Regan, a history professor at the Univerity of
Illinois and author of ``When Abortion Was a Crime: Medicine, and
the Law in the United States, 1867-1973,'' said the lack of a
unified voice is shocking but not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is shocking to me because Dr. Slepian as well as other
physicians assassinated and attacked are members of the medical
profession,'' Regan said. ``If this could happen to one portion of
the profession, it could happen to any other if their procedures
become politicized.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not surprising, she said, because the AMA has always
viewed abortion with suspicion. Consider that the AMA and Boston
physician Horatio Shorter were in the vanguard in making abortion
illegal in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   That opposition, say Regan and Carole Joffe, author of ``Doctors
of Conscience: The Struggle to Provide Abortion Before and After
Roe v. Wade,'' led to the push to criminalize the procedure in the
late 1800s _ not on moral grounds but in an effort to set
professional standards and drive out midwives and others who had
not received the same training.
</P>
<P>
   Much more recently, in 1997, the AMA endorsed legislation that
would ban late-term abortion, a procedure referred to by abortion
foes as ``partial birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is safe to say that some abortion providers feel
disappointed in the mainstream medical community,'' said Stephanie
Mueller, communications director for the National Abortion
Federation, an organization of abortion providers that works almost
like a mini-AMA.
</P>
<P>
   Michelman is more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organized medical profession has allowed the antichoice
zealots to demonize the medical service of abortion. They have
isolated the doctors and health care professionals who perform
abortions, as if it is some untouchable service. But this is a
medical service that (more than 1 million) women need and receive
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, however, it was the strong demand for abortion
that accounts for some of its isolation from the rest of medicine.
Only 10 percent of abortions are performed in hospitals. The vast
majority are done in clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is so safe, and can be done without general
anesthesia, abortion providers really pioneered the freestanding
outpatient surgery clinics,'' said Joffe.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a downside: This not only made it easier for
antiabortionists to target and picket clinics, it also ``made it
easier for organized medicine to not face the reality that abortion
is a medical procedure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That disassociation comes with other costs for those doctors who
perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the terror campaign ... people who have made abortion
provision a center point of their career have had promotions
denied, privileges at hospitals canceled, and partners will say
they should receive less remuneration because they bring a stigma
to the practice,'' said Joffe.
</P>
<P>
   And in medical schools, most students don't have to learn how to
do abortions if they don't want to, unlike other widely used
procedures. In fact, students frequently have to make a great
effort _ such as taking elective classes when they are already
working more than 80 hours a week _ to learn the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might come up in an ethics class, but students don't learn
about the procedure, how it is done, how to manage complications,
or how to talk to a patient about an unplanned pregnancy,'' said
Patricia Anderson, executive director of Medical Students for
Choice, a California-based group that is advocating for instruction
on abortion and has 100 chapters in medical schools around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in 1995 found that only 12 percent of all
ob-gyn residency programs required training in abortion, and there
is nothing to indicate the numbers have gone up appreciably since
then.
</P>
<P>
   After that study, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
Education ruled that to be accredited, all ob-gyn residency
programs should require abortion training. But Congress did an
end-run around that rule, saying that schools that did not provide
the training _ and thus failed to win accreditation _ would still
get federal money. So far, no program has lost its accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect, said Anderson, is ``Students ... are getting a
strong message: Abortion is not a medical issue.''
</P>
<P>
   More training, abortion rights supporters say, would mean more
doctors able to perform abortions, thereby making it harder for key
individuals to be targeted by abortion foes. It would also mean
more doctors in other fields who would speak out against
antiabortion violence.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Students for Choice was formed after Dr. David Gunn was
killed outside a Pensacola, Fla., clinic on March 10, 1993 _ the
first person to be killed in abortion-related violence. Although
that murder shocked the nation, the murder of Slepian on Oct. 23
resonates in a different, and perhaps more powerful, way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is because Slepian was murdered in his own home by a
sniper's bullet that blasted through the kitchen window. Or perhaps
it's because his sons and wife watched his life ebb away as the
sniper fled. Or perhaps because so many of his patients _ many
holding the hands of the children he delivered into the world _
came to his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, some, like Jodi Magee, executive director
of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, believe that
Slepian's murder ``is a watershed moment for us in the physician
community. There is an image of him as a fuller person and doctor
... that is galvanizing doctors who are saying this is
unacceptable. The statement by ACOG is an example of this.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the AMA does indeed arrange a meeting with the nation's
top law enforcement officials, it may signal a new urgency.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, almost too much for some to hope that Slepian's
murder will be the rallying cry for a move to bring abortion back
into the medical mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to believe that,'' said Michelman, ``but I don't
know.''

EVERYBODY'S INVITED TO LISTEN IN TO SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the most powerful computers on Earth have been built
specifically to scan radio waves picked up by huge radiotelescope
dishes in search of some sign of a signal from intelligent beings
on another world _ a task that has been likened to searching for a
needle in a cosmic haystack.
</P>
<P>
   But now, scientists involved in SETI _ the Search for
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence _ have their eyes on another
computer: Yours.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, lots of yourses. The plan is to enlist at least
100,000 volunteers to help analyze radiotelescope data with their
own ordinary desktop (or even laptop) PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is at once disarmingly simple and amazingly
powerful: Divide up that huge haystack into lots of tiny bundles of
hay, and send each bundle to an individual. Instead of looking for
a needle in a giant haystack, many thousands of individuals can
search through their small bundles _ a much more manageable task.
</P>
<P>
   It's called distributed computing, and it's an idea that may
someday be applied to a variety of tasks in science and other
fields. It has already been used, for example, to help crack a
computer code. But this application comes with an unusually grand
potential payoff. Some volunteer who signs up for the project might
someday be credited with what many scientists and philosophers
believe could be the most important and transformative discovery in
human history. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Like the lottery, it's one of those low-probability but
high-impact outcomes. Only in this case, the whole world would be
changed, instead of one lucky person's bank account. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The project has been in the works for three years, but just
two weeks ago it got the funding needed to bring it to reality.
Grants of $50,000 each from the Planetary Society, a nonprofit
space advocacy group, and from Paramount Pictures, which hopes to
use the project as a promotional tie-in for its December release of
another ``Star Trek'' movie, will pay for perfecting the computer
software that will be sent free of charge to all who sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Already, more than the desired 100,000 people have signed up,
although not all may end up participating. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``It brings a new level of personal involvement'' to
exploration, said Louis Friedman, executive director of the
Planetary Society. It used to be that the only way ordinary
citizens could play a role in projects such as planetary
exploration or the search for extraterrestrials was by contributing
money, he said, but distributed computing allows hands-on
involvement, which could someday also be applied to analyzing data
from robotic exploration of other planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be so elitist and esoteric, only a few people could
work on it,'' Friedman said. ``The number of SETI researchers in
the world now is about 20. Now it will be more than 100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The program won't tie up the volunteers' computers; it will only
work during moments when the computer is switched on but sitting
idle. In fact, it's just the world's most sophisticated screen
saver.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other screen saver, it is designed to load
automatically after the computer has been unused for a few minutes
(as with all screen savers, the exact interval can be set by the
user). It then begins processing a chunk of data from the world's
largest radiotelescope dish, the Arecibo observatory in Puerto
Rico, downloaded earlier over the Internet. Each chunk of data will
consist of 250 kilobytes, or a quarter of a megabyte, and the
program itself will take up about 10 megabytes on the user's hard
drive _ comparable to many application programs today, and less
than most videogames.
</P>
<P>
   As the program crunches the data, the screen will show exactly
what it's doing, with colored graphs showing the peaks of intensity
as it scans through hundreds of radio frequency channels, looking
for strong peaks of transmission that stand out from the background
noise.
</P>
<P>
   When the analysis of that data is complete _ typically, it
should take a week or two of idle moments, but can vary
considerably, depending on how long the computer is left on _ that
chunk is sent back to a central computer at the University of
California, Berkeley, where the project will be run. At the same
time, a new packet of data is downloaded. All this happens
automatically whenever the computer user logs onto the internet,
and does not interfere with other activity.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the entire search operates in a ``piggyback'' mode. The
Arecibo telescope, the most powerful of its kind, is in use
virtually full time for astronomical projects, but a group of
Berkeley astronomers came up with an ingenious plan for using the
telescope for the SETI project without interfering with its primary
work. They simply attached a second radio receiver to the back end
of the receiving platform suspended high above the 1,000-foot dish.
</P>
<P>
   This secondary receiver points in a random direction, controlled
by the primary researchers observing plans. But that's fine with
the SETI astronomers, because they have no idea where to look
anyway. Over the course of a year, their random observations cover
virtually all of the sky that's visible from Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which will be sent free to volunteers, won't be
ready until April, although a few copies will be sent out for
testing in December.
</P>
<P>
   In full swing, the project is expected to increase by about
tenfold the power to detect faint signals, said project scientist
Daniel Werthimer of Berkeley. It will also make it possible to look
for more subtle kinds of signals &UR;  &LR; than past searches.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that nobody's done before is look for
pulsing signals. It's very hard. Nobody's been able to do that
before because it's so computationally intensive,'' Werthimer said
in a telephone interview from Arecibo last week. ``We'd like to
look for as many patterns and frequencies as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The searches now in operation _ the SETI Institute's Project
Phoenix, the Planetary Society funded BETA project at a
radiotelescope in Harvard, Mass., and Berkeley's SERENDIP project
at Arecibo, among others _ use different strategies and are looking
for different types of signals, since nobody really knows what an
alien civilization might be sending.
</P>
<P>
   ``In SETI, we should try as many things as possible,'' Werthimer
said. ``A hundred years ago, we might have said smoke signals were
the thing to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, new technologies may suggest completely different
ways of sending signals across the vast distances between the
stars. While most searches have concentrated in radio waves, one
team is gearing up for a search for laser pulses from other stars
instead.
</P>
<P>
   If a promising signal does get discovered in one of the packets
of data sent out by the new project, which is titled SETI(AT)home,
the person whose computer found it won't know about it right away.
Intriguing signals are found all the time _ and usually turn out to
be airplanes or satellites or other terrestrial interference.
</P>
<P>
   The project leaders don't want to get people all excited about
such false alarms, so any ``hits'' will be sent back to Berkeley
for further analysis and testing.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever finds that first signal will get credit. The data
will be labelled with the finder's identity, and if a signal does
prove to be real after weeks of followup, he or she will be
notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person that did it will find out and become famous,''
Werthimer said, ``but they won't know right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a home or office computer who wants to join the
project can sign up on line, or by calling the Planetary Society.
The SETI(AT)home software will be available in versions for PC, and
eventually Macintosh and Unix-based computers.

TWO SIDES FUEL HAWAII VOTE ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ All these years later, Joseph Melillo and Patrick
Lagon still laugh at each other's stories, even the repeats. They
still fuss over each other's breakfast orders. They still want to
marry each other.
</P>
<P>
   Together for more than two decades, Melillo and Lagon have been
unofficially engaged for going on eight years. They came close
once, and they like to think they're close again. But the couple
won't know if they can until every islander has a say.
</P>
<P>
   Melillo and Lagon are at the heart of one of the hardest
political fights ever in Hawaii. On Tuesday, voters will consider
amending their state constitution to ban same-sex marriages.
Passage would empower the legislature to do so. Failure would open
up the possibility of Hawaii's becoming the first state to allow
gays and lesbians to wed _ unions whose legal standing could then
be tested in other states with laws restricting marriage to
opposite-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying we have equal rights as long as we marry
someone we don't love, which in our case would be a woman,'' said
Melillo, who applied for a marriage license in 1990 and turned to
the courts when he and Lagon were turned down. ``Well that's not
who I want to marry.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the state supreme court sided with them and two lesbian
couples, declaring that Hawaii was violating its own constitution
by denying them the same right to marry as heterosexuals. The
decision was stayed pending appeal, and it remains unclear how the
court will rule if the amendment fails.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Hawaii has become ground zero in the debate over
legalizing same-sex marriage. Mainland money has poured into both
sides. Both have gone for the gut. Amendment supporters imply
homosexuality will be taught in the schools. Opponents ask whose
rights will be taken away next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the first; we don't want Hawaii to be
known for this,'' said spokeswoman Jennifer Diesman of Save
Traditional Marriage-'98, the largest of the island groups formed
to push the amendment. ``We don't want this decided by three
politically appointed judges. This is our community and this should
reflect our judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the state is an unlikely place for such a blunt
political experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Proud of its ``aloha spirit,'' Hawaii outlawed discrimination
based on gender long ago. It was the first state to legalize
abortion. Discriminating against gays in employment is specifically
outlawed. Intermarriage is common, reflected in the multi-ethnic
complexion of residents. The historically ``traditional'' family _
a man and woman of the same race, religion and class _ ceased to be
traditional years ago. Yet Hawaii has always had a conservative
undertone, one that remains strong, and gay activists say tolerance
is being strained.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, polls have shown that the vast majority of
Hawaiians oppose same-sex marriage. The governor and his Republican
challenger are against it. One-quarter of the state's 1.1 million
residents belong to the Roman Catholic Church or to the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which push for the amendment's
passage every Sunday. The Salt Lake City-based Mormons have donated
$600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the outcome is uncertain. Amendment supporters continue
to lead in the latest polls, but both sides say the vote could be
close. Blank ballots count as ``no'' votes _ a considerable boost
for opponents. The ballot language itself is also confusing and
counterintuitive, and could lead some to think a ``no'' vote is a
vote against same-sex marriage. A large percentage of voters remain
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much controversy, I just don't know,'' said Mary
Kwon, a hotel housekeeper. ``If gay people want to marry, I don't
see why not. But if we're the first state, all the gay people will
come here to get married and then want to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   While some amendment supporters have played on that fear,
opponents have highlighted another.
</P>
<P>
   At every opportunity, the people working for the initiative's
defeat have painted it as legalized discrimination: using the
constitution to deny rights to a specific group. That's tough talk
in a state where many Japanese-Americans remember the internment
camps of World War II and native Hawaiians suffered discrimination
of their own. The campaign's TV ads barely mention same-sex
marriage at all. Again and again, Jackie Young, who heads the group
known as Protect Our Constitution, tells audiences, ``This
constitution is for all of us.'' Coalition members include the
Japanese American Citizens League, African American Association of
Hawaii and League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're trying to do in essence is write us out of the
constitution,'' said David Smith, a senior strategist with the
Human Rights Campaign, a Washington-based gay political group that
has set up an office in Honolulu and spent more than $1 million to
oppose the amendment. ``We're trying to take out the emotion of
same-sex marriage and talk about giving the legislature the power
to overrule the supreme court on matters concerning civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   For Father Mark Alexander, a Catholic priest and church
spokesman on the issue, the survival of the ``traditional'' family
is at stake. The Mormon Church opposes same-sex marriage on moral
grounds, said Elder Don Hallstrom, the sect's senior leader in
Hawaii. The Hawaii Christian Coalition's web site warns that any
state that allows same-sex marriage should ``fear the wrath of
God.'' But other supporters of the amendment stress that they do
not condemn homosexuals in general, only their right to marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a great many single dads, great gay parents, but I
can't be for something that pushes people away from the core of
family,'' said the Rev. K.C. Russ, who runs Affordable Weddings of
Hawaii and whose background is in youth ministry. ``I'm not bashing
gays. I'm just fighting for the kids because I see so many problems
coming from the deterioration of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on Hawaii, 29 states and Congress have already
passed laws restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples. A measure
on the upcoming ballot in Alaska would amend its constitution to
define marriage as the union of one man and one woman, a reaction
to a superior court ruling that choosing a life partner was a
fundamental right. In Hawaii, each side charges the other with
having a hidden agenda and importing support to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're religious extremists and the next thing they'll want
to do is limit women's reproductive rights. Hawaii is definitely on
their map,'' said Yolanda Lozano, a partner in Remote
Possibilities, a Maui company that specializes in gay and lesbian
commitment ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Said Michael Gabbard, the founder of Alliance for Traditional
Marriage in Honolulu, ``They're trying to force their values down
the throats of the people of Hawaii. ... The bottom line is that
homosexuality is not normal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the TV ads currently being run by amendment supporters
warns that homosexuals coming to Hawaii for commitment ceremonies
are chasing away heterosexual honeymooners from Japan, although it
cites no proof. An early TV spot featured a groom rushing past a
bride on the beach, into the arms of another man. Another featured
a young boy reading aloud from a children's book called ``Daddy's
Wedding.'' The tagline: ``If you don't think homosexual marriage
will affect you, how do you think it will affect your children?''
</P>
<P>
   Amendment opponents were outraged, and retaliated with an ad
featuring a female doctor warning that abortion rights could be
threatened next.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique situation,'' said Jon Van Dyke, a
constitutional law expert at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu
who opposes the amendment. ``On the other hand, when discrimination
against one group becomes law, there is always going to be the
chance of discrimination against another group.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless what happens Tuesday, further litigation is expected.
Either way, Dan Foley, the attorney representing the three couples
who challenged Hawaii's law, said the centerpiece of the 1993
ruling should stand: Same-sex couples must be given the same
benefits as heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Melillo, 51, and Lagon, 41, do not expect to be
donning tuxedos _ or silk Hawaiian shirts _ anytime soon. Instead,
they will continue catering other islanders' private parties and
restart their silk-screening business. The couple has hefty legal
bills, and they note with bemusement that mainland gay rights
organizations refused their requests for help until after they
triumphed in superior court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get tired of this; it weighs on us,'' Lagon said. ``But
we're not going away, and we're still together.''

CLINTON HAS A MINOR ROLE IN THE SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In the South, where President Clinton was rejected
in most states in 1996, the White House scandal is not a
significant factor in this year's campaign, and the Democratic
Party has a chance to hold its own in major races.
</P>
<P>
   While political analysts in Washington are debating the wisdom
of a Republican Party decision to use the issue in an eleventh-hour
advertising offensive, contests in Dixie appear to be turning on
other matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama and South Carolina, incumbent Republican governors
are struggling for survival in the face of Democratic initiatives
to create state lotteries to finance education programs. Thinly
veiled racial themes are being used by GOP candidates in Georgia
and Arkansas, and personalities are very much in play in other
races around the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``If history is any guide, next Tuesday's election is about
local issues,'' said Doug Sosnick, one of Clinton's chief political
advisers on the White House staff.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign winds up, it appears that the embattled
Democratic Party could escape with a standoff in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jeb Bush is favored to win the governor's office that
had been held by a Democrat in Florida, Republican Governor Fob
James of Alabama is trailing in polls going into the final weekend.
And in closely contested Senate races, Republican Senator Launch
Faircloth is involved in a desperate fight to keep his seat in
North Carolina, while Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a Democrat, holds
a slight lead in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Republican pollster Whit Ayres believes that the
Clinton factor could hold down Democratic turnout in some cases,
but most of the statewide races are expected to be determined by
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   _Alabama: Republican Senator Richard Shelby is breezing to an
easy reelection, but James has become the most vulnerable GOP
incumbent in the South. Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman, the
Democratic gubernatorial candidate, leads James 49-43 in the latest
published poll. Siegelman's advantage is attributed to his proposal
to institute a state lottery to fund college scholarships for
Alabama students, a concept that worked for outgoing Georgia
Governor Zell Miller. James is hurt by weakness in his own party.
Elements of the Republican business establishment tried
unsuccessfully to take out James in the GOP primary earlier this
year when they backed Winton Blount. ``A lot of Blount supporters
have come to Siegelman,'' said Giles Perkins, executive director of
the Alabama Democratic Party. ``We believe the race will be very
tight and come down to whether the voters of Alabama want a new
education program or not.''
</P>
<P>
   _Arkansas: Republican Governor Mike Huckabee is far in front of
his Democratic challenger, but Blanche L. Lincoln, a former
Democratic congresswoman, holds an equally commanding lead in state
polls over Republican Fay Boozman in the race for a Senate seat
being given up by retiring Democratic Senator Dale Bumpers.
Boozman, who hurt himself with remarks about a ``protective
shield,'' caused by adrenaline fueled by fear, that keeps rape
victims from getting pregnant. has drawn criticism for an ad
attacking Lincoln for supporting ``foreign aid to Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   _Florida: Jeb Bush is expected to join his brother, Texas
Governor George W. Bush, in the ranks of the nation's governors by
defeating Democrat Buddy MacKay. Bush, who is reaching out to an
erstwhile Democratic constituency with a moderate approach, has
held a comfortable lead all year. MacKay is hobbled by an
internecine struggle within the state Democratic Party growing out
of the ouster of a black legislative leader. Nevertheless,
Democratic Senator Bob Graham has a 30-point polling lead over his
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   _Georgia: With the popular Miller not a candidate for
reelection, Republican businessman Guy Millner and Democratic state
Representative Roy Barnes are locked in a nip-and-tuck race for the
governor's office. Rather than linking Barnes to the president,
Millner has tied him to prominent black politicians, primarily the
mayor of Atlanta, Bill Campbell. Senator Paul Coverdell, a
Republican, is expected to win reelection easily.
</P>
<P>
   _Louisiana: In the last reliable Democratic bastion left in the
South, Senator John Breaux is a heavy favorite over a weak
Republican adversary.
</P>
<P>
   _North Carolina: The Clinton issue is most visible in the Senate
race here, where Faircloth accuses John Edwards, the Democratic
candidate, of serving as a Clinton acolyte and supporting the
president's tobacco tax hike. Edwards, who is tied with Faircloth
in polls, responded with a new ad this week: ``Lauch Faircloth
keeps hitting John Edwards with Bill Clinton. But it's Lauch
Faircloth who has voted with Bill Clinton over 200 times. Is Lauch
a liberal?''
</P>
<P>
   _South Carolina: Former State House minority leader Jim Hughes,
a Democrat, is waging a strong campaign to unseat Governor David
Beasley. Hughes is an advocate of a state lottery to fund
education; Beasley antagonized members of his conservative base
last year by trying to take down the Confederate battle flag from
atop the state capitol. The local issues have turned the governor's
race into a neck-and-neck stretch run. Hollings, a Democratic
incumbent with an irascible style, did not help his cause by
inviting his opponent, Representative Bob Inglis, to ``kiss my
fanny.'' But the five-term senator hangs on to a lead in statewide
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   _Tennessee: Governor Don Sundquist, swept into office by a
Republican tide in 1994, is believed to be well ahead of John Jay
Hooker, a Democratic populist.
</P>
<P>
   _Texas: The governor's race is expected to be a warm-up for
incumbent George Bush as he prepares for a run at the Republican
presidential nomination. Bush has held an overwhelming lead all
year over Land Commissioner Gary Mauro and has no need to use
Clinton as a cudgel.

MUCH HANGS IN THE BALANCE IN GOVERNOR RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No one has jumped into the Charles River just to make a
point. No one has fallen off a stage after giving a speech. And no
one has resorted to Yiddish curse words.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1998 run for governor has been relatively low on
theatrics that have been mainstays of other campaigns, it has still
been a tense, largely negative, battle that remains a close contest
as voters prepare to cast their ballots Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Paul Cellucci is the no-new-taxes candidate,
promising to steer the Commonwealth safely through whatever
economic times lie ahead. Democrat Scott Harshbarger is the social
activist, hoping to take advantage of the state's strong financial
picture to expand health care, improve education, and better-train
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Massachusetts election that really does matter,''
said Elizabeth A. Sherman, director of the Center for Women in
Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts. ``It
is more of a turning point than people realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from setting a tone and an agenda for the state, the next
governor will grapple with whatever economic downturn may arise,
will appoint at least three judges to the seven-member Supreme
Judicial Court, and will oversee the redrawing of the state's
congressional lines. On education, the governor will help determine
whether state spending for public schools continues after funding
for the Education Reform Act of 1993 expires.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not always the issues that voters hear about.
Debates between the two men have been nasty, with each candidate
trying to talk over the other, interrupting, and name calling.
``That's a lie'' or ``Tell the truth'' has been a common refrain
from Harshbarger to Cellucci. ``Scott, you can't handle the
truth,'' Cellucci sneered back at the last matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, they have made such a mess of their
presentations in the context of these debates, it makes it hard for
thoughtful voters to make up their minds,'' said Michael Cudahy, an
independent media consultant who was once active in Republican
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who did not tune out were treated to a diet of death
penalty, taxes, welfare, and teacher testing by Cellucci, the
acting governor. And Cellucci's agenda largely overwhelmed Attorney
General Harshbarger's attempts to talk about crumbling schools and
health insurance for children.
</P>
<P>
   Bird-dogging it all has been Cellucci's estimated $700,000 in
personal debt. First in the Republican primary, and now in the
general election campaign, Cellucci's opponents have questioned how
he accumulated so much red ink and whether he can be trusted to
hold the state's purse strings, and have been unsatisfied by his
accounting of his finances.
</P>
<P>
   Even the heretofore unspoken rumor of gambling as a possible
explanation for Cellucci's debt entered the campaign give and take.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Cellucci vehemently denied any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are totally false, there's no truth to them,
there's nothing there, and believe me, they've searched,'' he said.
Cellucci described himself as a ``casual fan'' of horse racing and
denied that he had ever lost hundreds of thousands of dollars at
the track.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also tried to turn the issue around against
Harshbarger, accusing him of attacking Cellucci's family. Jan
Cellucci, the acting governor's wife, spoke out for the first time
during the race. She said Harshbarger and his supporters had gone
too far, and she said he ought to apologize. Harshbarger refused to
yield, calling Cellucci's tactic ``sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Argeo Paul Cellucci, 50, was born in Marlborough and raised in
Hudson. He has spent the bulk of his adult life in politics,
beginning with the Board of Selectmen in Hudson, moving on to the
state House of Representatives, the state Senate, and then the
lieutenant governor's office. It was former governor William F.
Weld's resignation in the summer of 1997 that led to Cellucci's
elevation to the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Luther Scott Harshbarger, 56, was born in New Haven and raised
in Pennsylvania Furnace, Pa., a small farming town. He has spent
his career as a public servant working on criminal justice issues,
running the Middlesex district attorney's office and then the
attorney general's office. It was US Representative Joseph P.
Kennedy II's decision to drop out of the governor's race in the
summer of 1997 that catapulted Harshbarger to the head of the
Democratic pack.
</P>
<P>
   In person, both men are mild mannered and would never be
considered larger-than-life. Cellucci is a State House insider,
close to Democrats and Republicans. Harshbarger is an outsider
within his own party _ unpopular for some of his
political-corruption prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways there are more similarities between the two men
than differences. There is a dogged quality to each of their
personalities and to each of their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The race began on primary night in mid-September with Cellucci
immediately going after Harshbarger, describing him as a risk to
the state's economic security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our state cannot afford to return to the failed policies of
the late 1980s,'' Cellucci said in his victory speech at the Park
Plaza hotel in Boston. ``The state cannot afford Scott Harshbarger
as governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the last seven weeks, Cellucci has portrayed
Harshbarger as someone who would raise taxes, increase spending,
and hurt the economy. In television advertising, Cellucci mocked
Harshbarger for having the wrong priorities, portraying him as a
dilettante attorney general more interested in suing a toothpaste
manufacturer than prosecuting crime.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, on the other hand, launched his general election
campaign with a victory speech aimed at the Democrats who had made
him their standard bearer, rather than to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor's agenda is my agenda,'' he said, mentioning every
social program and issue under the sun that he hoped to address and
fix as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's campaign has been more about attacking Cellucci
for failing working families than about his own plans for the
corner office.
</P>
<P>
   On the minimum wage, Harshbarger derided Cellucci for opposing
an increase every year until he began running for governor. On
health care, Harshbarger scolded Cellucci for vetoing legislation
that would have increased the tobacco tax to pay for covering
uninsured children. And on education, Harshbarger ridiculed
Cellucci for promising to hire 4,000 teachers, and then not funding
the positions.
</P>
<P>
   Though the candidates have tried to stick to their scripts, the
animosity between them became apparent. While they have hurled
insults at each other inside the debate halls and on the campaign
trail, their sign-wielding supporters have gotten into fistfights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when I've ever seen a campaign that has
degenerated into so much personal insult and affrontery,'' Sherman
said. ``It's just palpable. They can't help themselves. They are
true enemies.''

FREE-WHEELING MEMORIES OF THE MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If the threatened Y2K computer catastrophe crashes
everyone's computer, I'd be the only one in this joint who could
produce Election Day copy _ on my 50-year-old Royal Standard
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'd never see it because everything down line is
online. The whole bleeding process of turning computer terminal
words into printed words is controlled by computers. No more
typewriters. No more linotype machines. None of the older presses
that printed off cast-metal cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   And if all our newfangled voting and computerized
ballot-counting systems crashed in a Y2K catastrophe, we would be
cast back into the era of paper or punch-out ballots. I'd be able
to once again wear my large lapel pin that declares:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm From Chicago ... Two Ballots, Please!''
</P>
<P>
   The local precinct people here never thought that was very
funny. I'm not sure they had even the foggiest idea why that might
be amusing. But for anyone growed-up on Chicago machine politics,
it kindles a kind of uncivilized civic nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Machine politics doesn't refer to computerized voting or the
vintage voting machines, although they were an integral part of the
larger political machine. It was not uncommon to see a local
precinct worker, sometimes called a ``ward heeler,'' step behind
the voting machine privacy curtain to ``assist'' a bewildered
voter.
</P>
<P>
   The most magnificent of all machines ever invented by man was
the good ol' Chicago political machine. It was the closest we've
ever come to true perpetual motion because it ran on an endless
supply of greed, power and control, and was well-oiled by legions
who were, of course, vested in the machine system.
</P>
<P>
   That it developed from a street science to an art form under
former Mayor Richard J. Daley was in part a result of the man's
political acumen and partly a natural evolution. The so-called
Daley (read that, Democratic) Machine was a more refined version of
the machine that for years ran the Republican-controlled areas
generally referred to as ``Downstate.'' And it was thus in so many
other states where Democratic politics naturally attached to the
working class and poor folks in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   If you heard truly strange stories about Chicago machine
politics, chances are they were true. Leftover Halloween ghosts had
a habit of coming out of the grave to vote _ at least once. Names
of dead people remained on voter registration lists longer than
names remain on today's computerized mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had these mysterious voters long passed into precincts
on the other side (which is not to be confused with voting
Republican), but many of them officially resided in vacant lots,
demolished buildings and yes, even cemeteries. Just an address, any
address, was needed. No one much checked out these things.
</P>
<P>
   And the really live _ sometimes, barely _ voters who stumbled
into the precinct polling places, such as local barber shops, hair
salons, American Legion halls, school auditoriums and even church
basements, oftentimes were derelicts or unfortunates who'd taken 13
steps on a 12-step program.
</P>
<P>
   For doing their civic duty, they were rewarded with a small
stipend, sometimes as small as a half-pint of ``musky'' _
muscatel-fortified wine. Lord only knows how many Chicago votes
were lubricated with a few ounces of cheap beverage, especially in
the days when local public houses were officially closed during
voting hours.
</P>
<P>
   There were election judges, of course, reportedly trained by the
Cook County Clerk and apportioned to polling places on a formula
ensuring representation from both sides. Alas, dozens of precincts
could not secure even one registered Republican to serve, and only
the higher calling of civic duty compelled some Democrats to
volunteer as Republican precinct election judges.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the polls closed and the taverns opened, the long,
drawn-out process of vote-counting was where machine politics
proved itself. Voting results from numerous so-called key precincts
seemed to disappear into the night, held back, some charged, to be
played as a trump card against the opposition's strong gains in
other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, this strategy was also used by the Downstate
Republicans, where election judges explained that they'd taken
ballot boxes home with them to keep them secure. So secure were
some of those Downstate returns that they didn't surface for days.
</P>
<P>
   Which was too late, in many cases, to sway results of a national
election in which all those Chicago ballots were bounced, bobbled
and counted. Some, they say, were counted several times, in the
interest of, say, accuracy. That would be Democratic accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the infamous words of one icon of Chicago Democratic
politics that ``Chicago ain't ready for reform!'' things have moved
closer to the surface. Or maybe just deeper, and less obvious than
the years in which the current mayor's father ran the machine.
</P>
<P>
   If circumstances would allow, I'd vote today _ and at least
twice _ for anyone who promised to work 110 percent to fix the
Social Security mess and the predicted Y2K computer catastrophe.
And against anyone even slightly involved in perpetuating the
impeachment machine in Congress.

WISCONSIN WOMAN MAY BE FIRST GAY NON-INCUMBNENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ Tammy Bald-win walks from one end of the private
dining room to the other, microphone in hand, fielding questions on
everything from taxes to Social Security to campaign finance from
members of the county bar association.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year veteran of the Wisconsin Legislature, whose
campaign literature describes her as having ``challenged
traditional stereotypes of public officials,'' is trying to shatter
one more: She wants to become the first openly gay non-incumbent
elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin's sexuality is nothing more than a blip on the voters'
radar, and a non-starter for her Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gay comments that popped up during the primary have
disappeared, and the religious right has largely become silent
since the recent beating death of a gay Wyoming college student.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, this state capital that is the bedrock of
Wisconsin's liberalism has become Ground Zero for gays and lesbians
seeking to topple one of the last hurdles in their struggle for
civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   In an election year unprecedented for the number of openly gay
candidates for Congress, Baldwin, a 1984 graduate of Smith College
in Northampton, Mass., is regarded as having the best chance among
three lesbians and one gay man.
</P>
<P>
   While openly gay members of Congress have served for more than a
decade _ including Representatives Barney Frank, a Newton Democrat,
and Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican _ their sexuality was not
revealed until after they were in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to break that barrier of electing someone who
the voters, when they elected them for the first time, know,'' said
David B. Mixner, a former adviser to President Clinton on gay
issues. Mixner predicted that just as 1992 was considered the year
of the woman, one of the themes of this election could be ``the
year of the lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Baldwin, the other lesbian candidates for
Congress are Christine Kehoe, a San Diego City Council member, and
Retired Army Colonel Margarethe Cammermeyer of Seattle. All three
women are Democrats running in swing districts represented by
Republicans but carried by Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Cammermeyer, whose district is the most conservative, is thought
to be the longest shot among the three women. A recipient of a
Bronze Star as a nurse in Vietnam, she became a celebrity six years
ago when she was forced out of the Army National Guard after
acknowledging she was a homosexual. She sued to be reinstated and
won.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth gay candidate, Democratic businessman Paul Barby,
faces an uphill climb in his second bid to unseat Representative
Frank Lucas, a popular Oklahoma Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Kehoe in San Diego also faces the difficult task of trying to
unseat an incumbent, Republican Representative Brian Bilbray.
Although she trails slightly in published polls, tracking polls
show her gaining ground, gay activists say.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of Baldwin, who is running for an open seat
being vacated by Republican Scott L. Klug, many analysts say the
odds look more favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Although no independent polling has been done, Baldwin, 36, is
widely thought to have a slight edge over her GOP opponent, former
insurance commissioner Josephine Musser, a social moderate, who has
riled many conservatives for refusing to oppose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an election that won't be decided until the last vote
from the last hamlet in this district is counted,'' said Rod Hise,
executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal groups like Emily's List, the Gay and Lesbian Victory
Fund, and organized labor have poured money into Baldwin's
campaign. As of Oct. 1, she had raised $846,788, compared to
Musser's $472,066, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   As a testament to the national attention of Baldwin's effort,
she has attracted more than $113,000 from out-of-state
contributions, compared to $5,400 for Musser, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been great national interest in this race,'' said
Baldwin's campaign manager, Paul Devlin, a native of Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who wins, Wisconsin will be sending its first
woman to Congress as a result of this contest, and that has become
a far bigger interest for residents here than Baldwin's sexuality,
said Don Kettl, a University of Wisconsin political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Musser says she refuses to make Baldwin's sexuality an issue.
``I have said that this is not a part of our campaign, our issues,
our message or our strategies, and I intend to keep it that way,''
she said.

WHY NOT BLOW A HURRICANE AWAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why can't a missile be exploded in the eye of a hurricane to
break it up?
</P>
<P>
   D.W., Roslindale, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Great question, D.W. The answer will blow you away.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane gets its energy from the warm waters of the ocean.
The water has to be at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit to get a
hurricane going and keep it going. &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Even before they've formed into the recognizable spinning
pattern characteristic of hurricanes, tropical depressions are
stirring up the ocean below them and drawing up heat from a depth
of 200 feet _ over an area 300 miles in diameter. That is a huge
amount of ocean, providing the growing storm with a fantastic
amount of energy. By the time it gets going, a hurricane is a force
of nature far stronger than anything we puny little humans can
throw at it.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are astonishing. According to Kerry Emanuel,
professor of atmospheric science at MIT, the average hurricane is
using energy at a rate of 3 trillion watts. . That's the same as
the energy you'd need to light 30 billion one-hundred watt light
bulbs simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That happens to be nearly the same as the entire electrical
generating capacity of every power plant on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A big hurricane like Mitch, which tore up the western Caribbean
last week, could be even more powerful _ 3 times 10 to the
thirteenth power. That's 30 trillion watts of energy per second!
That's three times more than all the energy used by the entire
human race for the year in 1990! In bomb terms, to blow up a
hurricane, you'd have to match its explosive energy, equivalent to
a one megaton bomb (83 Hiroshima atomic bombs-worth) every 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Why not bomb just the eye of the storm? That's where most of the
power of the storm is.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent of a hurricane's energy is converted into
wind and spread out across the storm. The rest stays right near the
eye, helping draw more heat up out of the ocean and sending it
thousands of feet up into the storm.
</P>
<P>
   That's what keeps a hurricane going. And that's why they die
when they get over land. No heat means no hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel says, ``If you want to attack a hurricane you want to
try to keep the storm from absorbing heat from the ocean. Then you
might have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He says one idea is spreading a layer of polymer, like a giant
sheet of liquid plastic wrap, over the surface of the ocean below
the storm. That would slow the evaporation of water where ocean and
atmosphere meet, and the storm couldn't draw up heat from the ocean
as efficiently. Heat is hurricane food. The storm would starve.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledges there's little chance the polymer slick _
which would be like an oil slick, only non-polluting _ could hold
together in the extreme conditions of the hurricane, because the
storm is wildly churning the surface and stirring the water to
depths of 200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It's really another far-fetched idea. Just not quite as
far-fetched as any of the others,'' Emanuel says.
</P>
<P>
   How about breaking up storms when they're weaker, before they
turn into hurricanes? Frank LePore of the National Hurricane Center
says there are two problems with that idea. First, we don't know
where to aim. And even if we did, the only bullets we've tried so
far don't work.
</P>
<P>
   There are 80 to 100 pre-hurricane storm systems each year in the
eastern Atlantic off Africa. ``Only 6 percent turn into
hurricanes,'' LePore says. ``We don't know which ones will, and
which ones won't.''
</P>
<P>
   They're immense, hundreds of miles wide and thousands of feet
high. Finally, he says, ``they're not neatly spinning around yet.
They're too diffuse to know where to aim. There is no easy
target.''
</P>
<P>
   Operation Storm Fury in the 1960's was a US government
experiment to seed hurricane clouds with silver iodide crystals, to
turn some of the thunderstorm clouds near the eye of the hurricane
into rain clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Turning moisture into rain uses energy and cools things off.
Remember: No heat means no hurricane. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But the crystals didn't do the trick. It turns out things are
too warm inside the hurricane to get cloud-seeding to work.

BRACE YOURSELF: HERE COMES TV'S SWEEPS PERIOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As of this writing, Roseanne was staging the public spectacle of
trying to snag escorts for her three single, twentysomething
daughters. Her ``Date My Daughters'' contest is being conducted
from the pulpit of her new talker, and so far the only criteria is
being Jewish and mentally stable, although standing upright, being
unmarried and clear of criminal activity would rank high on my
list.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Roseanne drill some poor audience member the other day
(he finally asked his girlfriend to stand after it was apparent
Rosie wouldn't let him be) clearly shows that the outspoken one has
fallen in line with the ratings-at-all-cost hustlers she used to
dismiss as spineless parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeps can do that to you. November isn't as crucial (and
therefore as out-and-out silly) as May _ but the ``above-average''
offerings designed to help local stations pull higher ratings and
earn fatter checks from advertisers are still uneven, and often
empty and trashy as well.
</P>
<P>
   The general rule in my household is to steer clear of sitcoms
and approach dramas with some trepidation, even steady offerings
like ABC's ``The Practice.'' That law drama on Nov. 15 begins a
three-episode story line featuring, well, Tony Danza, as a
street-smart (it's a stretch!) lawyer who fancies himself a ``man
of the people.'' (On second thought, Danza spouting David E.
Kelleyisms should prove rather intriguing.)
</P>
<P>
   On cue, Chris Carter delivers the new season of ``The X-Files,''
(Nov. 8) supplanting ``NYPD Blue'' as the drama series so arrogant
it must arrive oh-so-fashionably late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   As for the movies, miniseries and specials, well, read the
warning labels. Productions this month will star Christopher Reeve,
Whoopi Goldberg and Sidney Poitier, but one sure shot might be Ken
Burns' examination of architect Frank Lloyd Wright (Nov. 10-11) on
PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The networks will also trot out high-priced theatrical buys: Fox
has ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' (Nov. 1), ABC delivers ``The
Birdcage'' (Nov. 12) and NBC presents ``Twister'' (Nov. 15), all
edited for TV and filled with pesky commercials. (Just go rent the
things.)
</P>
<P>
   What you won't see is NBC's version of Shakespeare's ``The
Tempest.'' After losing its shirt on another literary barn-burner,
``Crime and Punishment,'' the network decided to stick the Peter
Fonda production in the December schedule, where it can do the
least damage. (You can also kiss goodbye any future productions of
that nature.)
</P>
<P>
   At least ``David &AMP; Lisa'' (Sunday, ABC), about a psychiatrist
(Poitier) and the troubled teens he helps, had a graceful pace and
literary feel.
</P>
<P>
   And continuing in that literary vein, we do have an Alex Haley
project. CBS is quite high on ``Mama Flora's Family'' (Nov. 8 and
10), though each Haley-inspired project since ``Roots: The Next
Generation'' has dipped in quality. Even ``Mama Flora'' sounds
calculated. It stars Cicely Tyson as a woman of modest means who
survives three generations and pulls a ``Touched by an Angel'' on
her family members: She instills the importance of God and family
in their lives. There's even a cameo by Della Reese.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, catch Reese's ``Touched'' sidekick, Roma
Downey, along with another in-house star, Moira Kelly (''To Have
and to Hold'') in the network's ``Monday After the Miracle'' (Nov.
15). This one's about the relationship between the grown-up Helen
Keller and her teacher, Annie Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   The most-discussed movie, the ABC remake of the Alfred Hitchcock
suspense thriller ``Rear Window,'' (Nov. 22) even appears
manipulative. For Reeve, who takes over the role played by Jimmy
Stewart, this is the first major acting job since that riding
accident. Producers are promising to put his character, a
quadriplegic, in much more jeopardy than was the case in
Hitchcock's version of the Cornell Woolrich story about a man
convinced that his neighbor is a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will probably tune in just to see Reeve, a journeyman
actor who now commands far more attention than he did before his
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Noth returns for more of the same, reprising his role as
Detective Mike Logan from ``Law &AMP; Order,'' in a murder mystery that
also stars his ``L&AMP;O'' buddies Jerry Orbach, Benjamin Bratt, Sam
Waterston and S. Epatha Merkerson.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg appears in ``A Knight in Camelot'' (Nov. 8), about a
20th-century scientist accidentally flung back in time to
sixth-century England. If you've seen ``A Connecticut Yankee in
King Arthur's Court,'' you've got the general idea.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of cable movies look promising: HBO's ``Winchell,'' with
Stanley Tucci as the legendary journalist (Nov. 21), and ``A
Soldier's Sweetheart,'' with Kiefer Sutherland in a Vietnam-related
drama slated for Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most anticipated happening of sweeps is in series
TV, where Fred Savage (''Wonder Years'') joins his kid brother in a
Nov. 6 episode of ABC's ``Boy Meets World.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that would be the 90-minute installment of ``NYPD
Blue'' set for Nov. 24. Jimmy Smits exits the 15th Precinct after
four seasons, opening the doors for a Dec. 1 debut of Rick
Schroder.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on Smits' post-''Blue'' plans.
</P>
<P>
   Is he Jewish? Roseanne might still have an opening.

FLUSH TIMES FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A windfall of federal dollars is about to land on Massachusetts'
formidable biomedical research enterprise, fueling an unprecedented
spending spree on everything from Alzheimer's to asthma, confocal
laser microscopy machines to clinical trials, aspiring young
scientists to new buildings for them to work in.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boon? Here's one way to gauge:
</P>
<P>
   Roll together the $80 million that Congress just appropriated
for more than 15 new rail transportation projects from Springfield
to Cape Cod; the $50 million extra voted for the Boston Harbor
cleanup; the additional $20 million for the Big Dig; and $14
million for nine national parks in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   The grand total of $164 million earmarked for all these
tax-funded blessings is still $10 million short of the new money
the National Institutes of Health is expected to funnel to
Massachusetts hospitals and universities in the coming year,
swelling the state's total NIH revenue stream to more than $1.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The extra $174 million far exceeds the entire current annual
federal take of Massachusetts General or Brigham and Women's
hospitals. It's more than the combined yearly federal research
outlays for Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital, and
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a boost like this creates a tremendous opportunity for
Harvard, for the people of Boston, for technology companies, for
the general welfare of society _ a tremendous opportunity,'' exults
Dr. Joseph Martin, dean of Harvard Medical School. ``It's the
largest increase, both by percentage and by amount, we have ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's increase comes on top of already flush times for
medical research. ``This is not the first good year,'' notes NIH
director Harold Varmus. ``The last three years we've had 6 or 7
percent increases when inflation was only 2.5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local research institutions have managed to do considerably
better than that. ``In the past year we've seen a 20 percent
increase in our overall grant income through recruitment of a lot
of good people,'' reports Aram Chobanian, dean of Boston University
Medical School. ``Since 1991, we've risen from 41st to 20th among
all US medical schools in federal funding.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects are even brighter. The 1999 windfall is supposed
to be just a down payment on a breathtaking new era of federal
investment in medical research.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston-based lobbying effort has quietly been building
bipartisan support for nothing less than a doubling of the NIH
budget over the next five years, from $13.6 billion in 1998 to
$26.4 billion in 2003. Massachusetts institutions historically reap
10 percent of NIH ``extramural'' funds _ the 78 percent of the
budget that the agency spends outside its Bethesda campus.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are no guarantees that the 1999 bonanza will be
repeated in the next four budget cycles, deans and department
chairmen and disease-funding advocates plan to keep pushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress just doesn't write five-year contracts, so we have to
keep the pressure on,'' says Arthur Ullian, an energetic
59-year-old Boston real estate developer rendered paraplegic by a
1991 bicycle accident, who has become a spearhead of the ambitious
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Their success so far has surprised even Ullian and his unusual
cast of co-conspirators, who include scientists such as cancer
researchers Dr. Judah Folkman of Children's Hospital and Eric
Lander of MIT, mutual-fund guru Peter Lynch, biotech entrepreneur
Henri Termeer, liberal Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and conservative Sen.
Connie Mack of Florida, quadraplegic movie star Christopher Reeve,
and Boston University student Travis Roy, paralyzed from an
accident during his first college hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   The winning argument, Ullian says, was a canny combination of
hard-headed economics and unabashed emotion. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``We had Travis Roy testify from his wheelchair,'' Ullian
recalls. ``He said, `I know we can cure this thing if we put our
minds to it. I just want to hug my mother.' The senators just
crumbled. There was silence. Then each of the 12 senators started
talking about their own experience with illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the conspicuous involvement of spinal cord-injured
advocates such as Ullian, Reeve, and Roy, it's not surprising that
regrowth of damage nerved cells stands to gain new prominence from
the congressional largesse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a large increase in effort on spinal cord
regeneration,'' says Dr. Gerald Fischbach, director of the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which will reap
what Fischbach calls an ``unexpectedly large'' $124 million, or 16
percent, budget increase. ``I believe there is a wonderful
opportunity. We now know there are factors that inhibit and enhance
nerve regeneration.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one of the remarkable departures in the recent NIH
funding saga is that advocates of the disease-by-disease approach
have put aside their usual rivalries, at least temporarily, in
favor of a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality has always been that pitting one disease against
another is an artificial juxtaposition,'' says Daniel Zingale,
executive director of AIDS Action. ```AIDS research benefits
Alzheimer's, and cancer research benefits AIDS. I think that
resonated with the Congress.'' (AIDS research, at $1.7 billion the
largest NIH category except for cancer, will gain 12.1 percent _
enabling an expected, and overdue, emphasis on developing AIDS
vaccines.)
</P>
<P>
   The result of an across-the-board budget increase is a
cornucopia of new opportunities that has NIH officials and their
advisers working overtime on spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the question is: What are we going to do with the money?''
says Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of the American Heart
Association. ``The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has
come up with three priorities: the role of inflammation in
atherosclerosis, the interaction of genes and environment, and how
we can make new blood vessels and heart tissue grow.''
</P>
<P>
   On NIH director Varmus' list of priorities are ``genomics'' _
the translation of new genetic knowledge into targeted therapies _
and stepped-up human trials of new drugs against cancer, arthritis,
neuromuscular diseases, drug abuse, and alternative medicines, such
as a study of the putative antidepressant herb St. John's Wort that
the NIH already has under way. (The overall budget for alternative
medicine research has jumped from $20 million to $50 million, and
the area has won new status as a research center with grant-making
authority.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most critical payoffs, research administrators said,
are not in such sexy areas as spinal cord regeneration, AIDS
vaccines, or breast cancer therapies, but rather in general growth
of the nation's medical research infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, NIH-funded researchers can expect to get grants
that come closer to covering the actual costs of their projects &UR; , &LR; 
instead of the 90 percent that has become standard practice. ``Full
funding will mean scientists can spend more time doing the science
and less looking for money,'' says Dr. John T. Potts, MGH's
director of research.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, NIH will foster training of physicians to do
clinical research. ``There was a appalling 30 percent decline in
the number of physicians who were first-time applicants for NIH
grants between 1994 and 1996,'' says Dr. David Nathan, president of
Dana Farber Cancer Institute. ``If you extrapolate that, there
won't be any physician investigators by the year 2003.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most fundamentally, the new money will improve the
prospects that good proposals will get funded. In recent years, NIH
has been able to fund fewer than a third of projects deemed worthy
after rigorous review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important impact of all this is sort of a spiritual
one,'' says Dr. Eugene Braunwald, vice president for research at
Partners Healthcare. ``In the last 10 years, some of our
outstanding fellows and residents and graduate students have not
really even considered a career in biomedical research. By
augmenting research funding, we'll have a tremendous effect,
particularly in Boston where we have such superb young minds.''

MODERN SCIENCE CONFIRMS JEFFERSON RUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many historians have long held it unthinkable, but new DNA
evidence suggests it is almost certain that Thomas Jefferson, that
icon of American idealism, fathered at least one child with his
slave, Sally Hemings, even as he opposed ``race mixing'' and
believed blacks to be inferior.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic test results released last week strongly support
persistent but often-dismissed rumors that the third US president
had a long-lasting liaison with Hemings, during which six children
were born, of whom four lived to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the DNA evidence ``seems to seal the case'' that
Jefferson fathered the mulatto slave's last child, Eston Hemings
Jefferson, born in 1808 during Jefferson's first presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   If so, their liaison likely endured for at least 20 years, if it
began, as Hemings's son Madison said in an 1827 newspaper
interview, in 1788 when Jefferson and Hemings were in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said that Jefferson appears not to have been the
father of Hemings's first child, born in 1790, Thomas Woodson
(whose name comes from a later owner). But the evidence could not
rule out Jefferson's paternity, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation of the 196-year-old rumor is the most dramatic
application so far of new DNA methods that use the Y, or male,
chromosome to trace male lineages. The Jefferson project, headed by
Dr. Eugene Foster, a retired pathologist at the University of
Virginia in Charlottesville, Va., compared tell-tale patterns on
the Y chromosome of present-day descendants of the Jefferson family
with those of descendants of Thomas Woodson and of Eston Hemings
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   The results were published by the scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Foster, the report is authored by two British
genetic specialists, M.A. Jobling of the University of Leicester
and C. Tyler-Smith of the University of Oxford, and others.
</P>
<P>
   The testing was undertaken in an effort to settle the debate
over the most potent character issue involving Jefferson, an
enigmatic and extraordinarily private president.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Gordon-Reed, a black law professor at New York
University Law School and author of the 1997 book, ``Thomas
Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,'' has argued
that traditional, mainly white Jefferson historians dismissed the
rumor and ignored the evidence of black oral history on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a powerful incentive to turn aside anything to
suggest that the story might be true,'' Gordon-Reed said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some also believed that Jefferson ``was too cerebral to be
interested in sex,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Those historians include Mount Holyoke College professor Joseph
Ellis, who was quoted earlier this year as saying, ``I believe his
deepest sensual urges were directed at buildings, rather than at
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon-Reed called the findings ``quite gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that no matter what was said in my book it would never
be resolved based on what was (previously) known,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as a number of revisionist scholars emphasize
the disconcerting racist beliefs and other weaknesses of Jefferson,
a slave owner who declared in the Declaration of Independence that
``all men are created equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Historian Ellis and geneticist Eric Lander at the Whitehead
Institute in Cambridge, Mass. coauthored a commentary accompanying
the report in Nature. They said the new revelation adds ``a
dimension of hypocrisy'' and ``only deepens the paradoxes'' in
Jefferson's life.
</P>
<P>
   While never freeing the bulk of his slaves, Jefferson freed the
children of Sally Hemings, two informally by helping them escape
and the the other two formally. Eston, in particular, was said to
closely resemble Jefferson, contributing to the rumor of the
president's paternity, but this was countered by others who
attributed parentage to one or the other of two Jefferson nephews.
</P>
<P>
   For the testing project, Foster gathered blood samples from 19
men, including several descendants of Jefferson's paternal uncle,
as Jefferson himself had no surviving sons.
</P>
<P>
   The testing found that a specific pattern of genetic markers on
the Y chromosome of those Jeffersonian descendants exactly matched
the marker pattern on the Y chromosome carried by a male descendant
of Eston Hemings Jefferson. The genetic fingerprint is rare, the
scientists said, leaving only about a 1 percent probability that
they matched by chance.
</P>
<P>
   All males carry a Y chromosome that has been passed down through
their father's lineage, changing little from one generation to
another. (The two X chromosomes of a female, by contrast, can be
shuffled between paternal and maternal lineages). However, only in
the past two years have scientists found enough variable genetic
markers on the Y chromosome to match a distinctive pattern with a
particular male lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, who was born in 1743, married in 1772, but his wife,
Martha, died in 1782 after bearing six children. Only two of them,
both girls, survived to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1774, Sally Hemings, who was Martha's half-sister, came to
Jefferson as property bequeathed to him. She was one of about 150
slaves kept by Jefferson at Monticello, his estate outside
Charlottesville. Sally was described by a slave, Isaac Jefferson,
as ``mighty near white ... very handsome, long straight hair down
her back.''
</P>
<P>
   The affair is said to have begun when Jefferson, serving as
ambassador to France, brought Hemings to Paris in 1787 to care for
his daughter. Madison Hemings said specifically that his mother
became Jefferson's concubine at that time. Sally Hemings returned
with him to Monticello in 1789, and records show that Jefferson was
at Monticello during the times when all the children would have
been conceived.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor of their affair first became public when a former
Jefferson ally who turned against him publicized it in a newspaper
article in 1802, but the report was deemed politically motivated
and untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rumor persisted. In 1974, historian Fawn M. Brodie was
the first modern writer to give strong credence to the affair. Her
best-selling book, ``Jefferson: An Intimate History,'' stirred a
controversy that has lasted until now.
</P>
<P>
   Lander, the Whitehead Institute geneticist, pointed out that the
one child known from the DNA findings to be Jefferson's was born in
1808 _ six years after he had been accused of the liaison with his
slave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inconceivable that he didn't have a relationship before''
the damning newspaper article ``and then started one after'' it had
been published, said Lander.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson-Hemings question has been a popular topic for the
past few years among tourists visiting Monticello, and the guides
who lead tours around the historic site ``range from true believers
to absolute deniers,'' said Cinder Stanton, senior research
historian at Monticello. ``There's no party line,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   As for herself, Stanton, who has studied Jefferson's life for 30
years while at Monticello, said her position has recently changed.
Initially skeptical that he would engage in such an exploitative
relationship with a slave, Stanton said she became more or less
persuaded following a recent oral history project that involved
interviews with 20 descendants of Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing that story over and over again moved me from thinking
it was improbable to thinking it was probable,'' she said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lander and Ellis note that the DNA findings reveal nothing about
the character of the relationship, whether it was ``a tale of lust
and rape'' or mutual affection or ``something in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon-Reed, the NYU law school historian, said, ``I came away
feeling that we have no way of knowing, except that they had
children together over a 20-year period and they were named after
people who were important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Eston, for example, was named for Jefferson's favorite cousin,
Thomas Eston Randolph; Madison, in honor of Dolley Madison, wife of
President James Madison; Beverley (a son) and Harriet for members
of the Randolph family to whom Jefferson was related.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Allgor, assistant professor of history at Simmons
College agrees. If the affair were mainly about power and lust, she
says, ``Jefferson could have moved on'' to other, younger women.
</P>
<P>
   Allgor believes that the impact of the report will be felt
widely, ``because it was so easy for so long to think of Jefferson
not as a human being but an embodiment of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the new understanding that Jefferson's
descendants include people who are white, black, and intermediate
in color ``challenges our racial categories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what an American family looks like _ not dark people
down in the small house and white, First Family of Virginia people
up in the big house,'' Allgor said. ``An American family looks like
everybody.''

EARLY CLUES TO THE ELECTION NIGHT TREND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Tuesday, Nov. 3, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Face it, it's going to be a long night for the
politically crazed. But for normal people with jobs to get to,
there's still a way to get a sense of the election results without
joining the junkies after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   On television, the trick is to take the right clues from the
statewide races where the polls close first, and from a
representative sampling of usually under-covered House races. It is
more than possible to get the drift before the big ones out here
check in after 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, is my cheat sheet:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; 6 O'CLOCK &QC; 
 &LR;  _Kentucky is traditionally a decent barometer of national trends,
but this year it is an off-year gem. The Senate seat opened by
Democrat Wendell Ford's retirement is must-carry for each party and
is a very tight race between two congressmen, one a GOP Hall of
Fame pitcher (Jim Bunning), the other an early 1960s captain of one
of Adolph Rupp's famous UK basketball teams (Scotty Baesler).
</P>
<P>
   And that race has opened up two of the country's closest 32
incumbent-less House races, for Bunning's 4th District seat in the
east and Baesler's 6th District in central Kentucky. In addition,
the 3d District, which includes Louisville, presents a good example
(in Republican Anne Northrup) of an incumbent who should win but
who has been pressed. If you watch on cable, House results are
constantly scrolled across the bottom of your TV.
</P>
<P>
   _Indiana is almost as good, with three House seats likely to
provide quick clues to the national trend. In the
Indianapolis-centered 10th District, Democratic freshman Julia
Carson is like Northrup _ favored but pressed.
</P>
<P>
   But to the south, along the Ohio River are two much closer
races. In the southwestern 8th, New Right Republican John
Hostettler is again in a tight one. And right next door in the 9th,
from which veteran Democrat Lee Hamilton is retiring, the race is
also close and one the GOP badly needs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; 7 O'CLOCK &QC; 
 &LR;  _The clues at this hour will be about the Deep South. In Florida,
Jeb Bush is favored to be elected governor on his second try.
Barring a gigantic upset, the real issue here is how quickly the
networks call it, and how close Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay
makes it, an early hint about the intensity of Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   _Georgia is another state where the GOP has a decent shot at
picking up a governor's office. But here the race between
businessman Guy Millner and legislative leader Roy Barnes has been
very close and polluted by race-baiting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; 7:30 P.M. &QC; 
 &LR;  _North Carolina ia a doozie this year. Not only is the critical
Senate fight between GOP Senator Lauch Faircloth and wealthy lawyer
John Edwards a nail-biter, but three of the mercurial state's 12
House districts (all currently Democratic) are in play as well.
Faircloth's campaign will provide a clue to sentiment about the
president because he has used a ``Clinton Clone'' motif to tar his
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2d District around Raleigh, freshman Bob Etheridge has an
anti-Clinton-advertising opponent; and Representative Mel Watt, who
is on the Judiciary Committee, has been pushed in the 12th to
Etheridge's west. Perhaps the Republicans best chance at a pickup
is in the textile-oriented 8th, from which 12-termer Bill Hefner is
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   _Ohio will also provide early clues. In the governor's race,
former Democratic Attorney General Lee Fisher has trailed Bob Taft
all fall, but he has hung around. The result and the margin will
hint at Democratic turnout because this race has seen a major
investment of labor union resources on Fisher's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Two House races here are also critical. In the 1st District
around Cincinnati, a Gingrich Revolutionary, Representative Steve
Chabot, has had to work to keep a seat that has a large percentage
of potential black voters. And in the 6th to the southeast,
Democratic Representative Ted Strickland is having another close
race, this time with Lieutenant Governor Nancy Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AFTER 8 O'CLOCK &QC; 
 &LR;  This is when the deluge starts. On TV, the key Senate and
governor races are easy to follow, but the House races are tougher.
If you follow on cable, some order is possible by watching for
results in the following 12 races:
</P>
<P>
   _Nonstunners. As with Representatives Northrup and Carson above,
look for the numbers on two Democrats: Frank Pallone Jr. in New
Jersey's 6th District and Jerry Costello in Illinois' rural 12th;
and two Republicans: freshman Heather Wilson in New Mexico's 1st
and Dick Baker in Louisiana's Baton Rouge-based 6th.
</P>
<P>
   _Weak Incumbents. Two embattled Democrats' fates will be
revealing: Jay Johnson out of Wisconsin's 8th District and Lane
Evans downstate in Illinois' 17th District. The same goes for two
Republicans: Bill Redmond in New Mexico's 3d and Vince Snowbarger
in Kansas's 3d District.
</P>
<P>
   _Open Seats. These provide the best chances for party shifts,
and here are four critical ones: the fights for Colorado's 2d
District, from which Democrat David Scaggs is retiring; eastern
Pennsylvania's 15th, which is losing a rare pro-impeachment
Democrat, Paul McHale; Idaho's 2d District, which Republican Mike
Crapo is leaving for the Senate; and Mississippi's 4th, where GOP
Representative Mike Parker is moving on for a possible run for
governor next year.
</P>
<P>
   _Impeachment. Those much-publicized anti-Clinton TV ads were
spread around more than two dozen House districts in the final
days. If I had to pick one place to gauge their impact early, it
would be the 5th District in up-country South Carolina, represented
by a veteran Democrat, John Spratt.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are 24 House races referred to here. If you hit
the hay before midnight and the GOP hasn't won 15 of them, it's in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So enjoy.
</P>
<P>

POLL PUTS BOXER, FONG IN A DEAD HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a volatile race with momentum see-sawing
between the candidates, incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer and her
Republican challenger, state Treasurer Matt Fong, appear to be in a
statistical dead heat heading into Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer is favored over Fong by 45 percent to 43 percent _ a
statistically insignificant edge given the poll's margin of error
of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, according to a poll
commissioned by the San Francisco Examiner and KTVU-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The tight race reflected by the poll contrasts with a survey
released last week that showed Boxer had surged to a 9-percentage
point lead based primarily on a barrage of negative television
advertising against her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner/KTVU poll raised new caution flags for Boxer,
including the voters' continued negative impression of her. Voters
in the Central Valley, a key swing area in statewide elections,
support Fong by 11 percentage points over the Democratic incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The changing numbers point to a campaign to be decided on which
candidate can best get their voters to the polls, said Del Ali, of
Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research in Columbia, Md., which
conducted the poll for the Examiner and KTVU.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing she (Boxer) has going for her is Gray Davis,'' Ali
said, referring to the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who leads
in recent surveys. ``It could be that he wins by such a wide
margin, and enough Democrats come out to the polls that they carry
her over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is, there could be ticket-splitting, with
Davis voters going over to Fong.''
</P>
<P>
   The statewide telephone survey of 809 likely voters was
conducted Oct. 26-28. All those surveyed were registered voters who
said they regularly vote in elections. The poll showed 12 percent
still undecided about the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also revealed several obstacles for Fong:
</P>
<P>
   _ Women, who have fueled Democratic victories in statewide
elections, overwhelmingly support Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Independents, the fastest growing group of voters, back Boxer
by 51 percent to 41 percent with 8 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boxer is a favorite among voters in the San Francisco area,
besting her opponent 57 percent to 36 percent. And, in a reversal
from an Examiner/KTVU poll two weeks ago, she is favored 44 percent
to 41 percent in the Los Angeles area, a traditional Democratic
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   But she trails Fong in the Central Valley, in Northern
California and in the San Diego area.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer campaign manager Rose Kapolczynski said the campaign's
nightly internal polling showed the senator favored by 5 to 7
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   At a Friday fund-raiser in San Francisco with first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, Boxer said she always had close races and expected
this one to be no different. She said four out of the past five
California senate races were won by a candidate, including herself,
who got less than 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a two- to five-point race, I've said that all
along,'' Boxer said. ``It all depends on who gets out to vote. That
is really the big issue. Our own internal polls show us winning in
every single group, including men. So we're happy about that. But I
still believe these races are always tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer has outspent her opponent 2-1 on commercials in the past
month. The commercials, which attack Fong on issues like gun
control, abortion, the environment and health care, are aimed at
undermining his image as a moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The Fong campaign is using advertising to hammer Boxer's
positions on taxes and crime.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has replaced a campaign commercial featuring Fong's
mother, March Fong Eu, the former secretary of state, with one
using newspaper clips accusing Boxer of being a ``liberal and
ineffective'' senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent a great deal of time since the beginning of the
campaign listing off his (Fong's) positions on issues like
education, crime, the environment,'' Fong spokesman Steve Schmidt
said. ``That part of the campaign has ended. We will now remind
voters why they so dislike Barbara Boxer.''

QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT THE CIA'S ROLE IN THE MIDEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord avoids any
mention of one major development: an increase in the power _ and
the profile _ of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials say the agency will do nothing more than monitor
the peace process, as it has done several times in the Mideast. But
former officials and analysts say the agency has never assumed such
a public assignment in so turbulent a region. Even some of those
who support the CIA's offer to help the peace process concede that
the secretive agency is not prepared for the scrutiny and
complaints it will receive.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and critics alike warn that officers will have
trouble balancing two conflicting roles: serving as mediators while
remaining Washington's objective eyes and ears in the region.
</P>
<P>
   R. James Woolsey, a former director of central intelligence,
backs the agency's new, high-profile venture, provided CIA officers
have strict limits on their monitoring roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they report back to the US government, there's no
problem,'' Woolsey said. ``What gets dicey is if they have to
assess what the Palestinians are doing and then report directly to
Israel officials. That gets them betwixt and between.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the plan for CIA involvement has drawn the
support of several left-leaning groups such as Americans for Peace
Now while drawing criticism from the right.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Republican Richard C. Shelby, who heads the Senate
Intelligence Committee, says the CIA is in danger of overstepping
its authority. Appearing on the Fox television network Oct. 25 he
said, ``What is the role of the CIA? Is it to be an arbitrator? Is
it to be bodyguards? I think not.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence specialists say the CIA's involvement in the region
is nothing new. They say the CIA has long maintained contacts with
Israeli security agencies as well as Yasser Arafat and his inner
circle, even when the Palestinians were fighting Israel. In the
aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur war, US intelligence agencies kept
track of Israeli troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-page agreement signed on Oct. 23 speaks vaguely of the
American government's attendance at biweekly meetings to ``review
the steps being taken to eliminate terrorist cells and the support
structure that plans, finances, supplies and abets terror.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be done by a ``US-Palestinian committee.'' In
addition, a ``high ranking US-Palestinian-Israeli committee'' will
meet at least twice a week ``to assess current threats'' and
coordinate anti-terrorism strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: CIA officials will be actively involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA is the right choice and they have a good working
relationship with both Israelis and Palestinians,'' said Richard
Shultz, an international security expert at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   But Shultz said the agency runs a risk whenever it crosses over
from covert to overt policy-making as it monitors the peace
process. ``What if the CIA issues a status report saying things are
not going well? Does the administration lean on the CIA to say,
`What can you say that's positive?'''
</P>
<P>
   That's not merely a hypothetical issue. Historians say that
during the 1980s, President Reagan's intelligence director, William
Casey, became convinced that Mexico was close to having a
revolution. Casey ordered a National Intelligence Estimate _ a
weighty report that offers the best intelligence from the Central
Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and other spy
services. When they concluded that Mexico would not have
revolution, Casey ignored the expertise and ordered that the final
report to be more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey, the former CIA director, said the CIA can avoid such
problems by reporting impartially to Washington, even when the news
is bad. ``If some deputy assistant secretary says, `You're too
negative, can't you take the adjectives out?' they can tell 'em to
go peddle their papers,'' Woolsey said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most members of Congress have been cautious about
speaking out against the CIA's commitment in the region. Senator
John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said it is difficult to tell whether
the agency is taking on a new task or simply getting more publicity
than usual. Either way, Kerry said, ``I am prepared to see the CIA
play this role because our interest in furthering the cause of
peace in the Middle East is overriding.''
</P>
<P>
   But others warn that the CIA is entering a foreign policy
minefield. Joe Stork, who directs Mideast programs for Human Rights
Watch, the nonprofit group, found it ironic that the peace accord
became public just as news reports emerged about the agency's close
relationship with an oppressive military government in Honduras in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the CIA's record of complicity with abusive governments
and security forces elsewhere in the world, we're concerned about
the role they're playing in this peace agreement,'' Stork said.
``Maybe it's a reformed CIA, but it begs questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stork sees other potential problems in the document signed at
the White House. At one point, it exhorts the Palestinians to take
``all measures necessary'' to prevent terrorism. Later, the
document says human rights should be honored ``without derogating
from the above'' promise to quash terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be read to say, `Security first, human rights
second,''' Stork said. Yet at Americans for Peace Now, spokesman
Lewis Roth said, ``We're very supportive of the strong American
role in the peace process, and certainly the CIA as an agency
representing the United States in the region seems to have
developed enough trust from the Israelis and the Palestinians so
that it can play a bridging role.''
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the Palestinian delegation to the early peace
talks says the CIA's involvement could spell political problems for
the Palestinians. ``It's not likely to be something that's going to
endear Yasser Arafat to his critics _ this will be seen as the
Palestinian Authority operating at the behest of the US agency
that's close to Israel,'' Khalidi said.

SEATTLE KEEPS ITS UNIQUE WARES OPEN TO ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ From its early days as an outpost, when the educator
Asa Mercer recruited East Coast women to come West to marry its
lovelorn lumberjacks and thus keep them at their saws, Seattle has
boasted an admirable authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Unpretentious and honest, it's a city that delights in its
location in one of the country's most stunning areas, a city
confident enough in itself that it unconsciously starts trends
rather than unwittingly following them.
</P>
<P>
   One of its best traditions is Pike Place Market, the farmers'
and artisans' bazaar that thrives in a narrow perch between I-5 to
the west and the city's steep eastward rise. The market is a mecca
where tourists and locals, young and old, indigent and well-heeled,
rub shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Public markets, of course, are famous as great people mixers.
It's no mistake that when George Bernard Shaw's Professor Henry
Higgins goes afoot to study his city's various dialects, the venue
he chooses is London's Covent Garden, then a busy
fruit-and-vegetable market.
</P>
<P>
   But Pike Place, now in its 91st year, does more than just
provide a common meeting place. It also grounds the city in its
unique identity.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Quincy Market in Boston, anchored by the same assemblage
of upscale retailers and souvenir shops that one might find in
Baltimore or Houston, San Francisco or Chicago, Pike Place market
brings together a distinctive collection of local farmers,
artisans, and craftsfolk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings a little soul to the city,'' said Russell Hartwig,
who was tending a jewelry stall there on a recent Sunday morning.
``Things are made here, more or less by the person you are buying
from. It isn't the same mass-produced stuff shipped in overseas
from ill-paid slaves. There is individuality, creativity, to what
you see.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for small artists and entrepreneurs to display
and sell in a low-cost stall or booth lets a thousand creative
personalities bloom, said Beverly Plansky, who sells
custom-designed silver jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a living as an artist selling your wares without
having to deal with the corporate world,'' she said. That, she
says, allows artists to support themselves at prices the public can
afford.
</P>
<P>
   As a spinoff, Plansky said, the market crowds support nearby
restaurants, which number in the dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig himself is a good example of the possibilities Pike
Place Market allows. A cook at a fraternity house during the
college year, he spends the summer selling the hand-blown glass
jewelry his longtime girlfriend makes.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for low-cost craft capitalism lead to an
astounding array of things for sale. In a walk of several blocks,
the market offers local watercolors, etchings, and photographs,
hand-crafted jewelry, leather work, native art, carved goods,
homemade toys, pottery, and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   To say nothing of the cornucopia of local produce. Hungry? How
about some succulent peaches at $1 a pound? A mouth-watering
cluster of grapes? Looking for salad stuff? Try the green peppers,
or the beefsteak tomatoes. This is prime produce, fresh from the
farm.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the several markets where fishmongers peddle
Pacific seafood, the deli full of kosher delights, the stalls with
jams and jellies, baked goods, and flavored honeys. All against the
backdrop of flower stalls that paint the crowded market in the
colors of the Northwest in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best way to gain a perspective on what Pike
Place Market does for Seattle is a Sunday morning walk from the
Pioneer Square area to Pike Place. Pioneer Square is perhaps the
more famous Seattle locale, its tower a landmark. By day it boasts
a wide variety of galleries, shops, and restaurants, as well as the
Elliott Bay Book Co., one of the nation's finest bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Even a fine summer Sunday morning, however, finds its streets
more or less deserted, as they will be until commercial doors start
to open later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the field to the large population of street folk and
wanderers for whom Seattle serves as home base. At such a time,
it's easy to see how the Seattle-coined Skid Road, for the street
down which felled logs were skidded to the bay, morphed from
logging lexicon to take on down-and-out connotations. Even in the
bright of day, the vagrants sprawled in doorways and sidewalks,
begging or raising a morning bottle, give the area a gothic feel.
</P>
<P>
   But a mile away, Pike Place Market has already drawn a crowd of
hundreds into the city. To be sure, the street people have a place
here, too. But they don't predominate in quite the same way. Even
tiny Victor Steinbrueck Park, a bay overlook a block north of the
market where drifters, alcoholics, and addicts abound, is made safe
by the crowds drawn to Pike Place.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is part of the magic of the marketplace.

LYCOS UNLEASHES $25 MILLION AD CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bloodhound didn't pass muster with focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherpa? As an advertising pitchman, the Sherpa didn't have
enough staying power to suit Lycos Inc., the Internet search
service.
</P>
<P>
   So a $25 million ad campaign that has just hit the airwaves
introduces a new company pitchman: a black Labrador retriever named
Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   With the dog cast as ``your personal Internet guide,'' TV ads
with a ``Go get it'' tagline aim to convince viewers that the
Waltham, Mass. company's search services can retrieve data from the
Internet as quickly and easily as a Lab can fetch a stick.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, the dog is a shown pictures of a frogman's flippers
and an antique yellow sports car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lycos, go get it!'' a voice-over says, and in a flash the dog
returns with the requested article. ``Unleash the new Lycos, and
the Internet is at your command,'' the voice-over notes.
</P>
<P>
   In a final scene, the dog is shown a photo of a model in a
fashion magazine. Lycos dashes off, and the next thing that viewers
hear is the sultry voice of an unseen woman, saying, ``Hi, I'm
Claudia.''
</P>
<P>
   Created by New York ad agency Bozell Worldwide, the ads are the
latest salvo in a fierce battle that has such Lycos rivals as Snap,
Yahoo, Excite, and Infoseek all trying to convince personal
computer users that their portals and search engines are the ideal
gateway to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A lot is riding on consumers' choices. Each Internet entry point
is packed with banner advertising. The more consumers who pass
through one of these gateways, or portals, the more the company can
charge advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In looking to set itself apart, Lycos has experimented with
several metaphors in its marketing and advertising, said Jan Robert
Horsfall, the company's vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Horsfall, the name Lycos derives from a Latin word
for a special kind of spider. Most spiders use their webs to trap
prey, but a Lycos spider leaves its web to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But spiders don't make for swell advertising images. So an
earlier ad campaign starred a Sherpa mountain guide.
</P>
<P>
   Sherpas evoke dangerous situations, and while that was
appropriate at a time when many PC users were fearful of getting
lost on the World Wide Web, most no longer regard the Internet as
treacherous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what they demand now from a search service is speed,
convenience, and friendliness _ not exactly traits one immediately
associates with mountain guides, Horsfall said.
</P>
<P>
   So Lycos auditioned a bloodhound to replace the Sherpa, but
focus-group testing revealed that speed and friendliness were not
the bloodhound's forte. Lycos opted for a Lab to plug its newly
streamlined search service.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Labrador retriever is a great symbol of approachability and
friendliness,'' said Horsfall, adding: ``This is one dog you want
to walk up to and pet.''

`DOTCOMS' GIVE WOLFE EARLY BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe's new novel, ``A Man in Full,'' won't be on bookstore
shelves until Nov. 6, but it is already a marketing phenomenon,
racking up thousands of advance orders on the ``dotcoms,'' the
book-selling Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   And publishing industry watchers predict that with a 1.2-million
copy launch, it will debut at No. 1 on the first-possible New York
Times best-seller list _ probably that of Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it will be No. 1,'' said Daisy Maryles, executive
editor of Publisher's Weekly, the trade magazine. ``People wait for
a Tom Wolfe. He doesn't write every year.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the unreleased ``A Man in Full'' was No. 2 in
sales at Amazon.com, the Seattle-based virtual bookstore, edged out
only by the latest Oprah Winfry book club selection, ``Midwives,''
by Vermonter Chris Bohjalian.
</P>
<P>
   While Amazon.com refuses to give out sales figures on individual
titles, public relations director Bill Curry said ``it's not
unusual to see a book go to No. 1 on our bestseller list before the
book is in the stores.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Amazon.com sales are being rung up without heavy
promotion _ other than the 40 percent discount it gives to all the
``selected featured titles,'' shipping not included. On Friday,
Curry noted, the Wolfe book was not being promoted on either of its
high-profile sites, its Homepage or its Daily Scoop.
</P>
<P>
   But, Curry added, the hourly updating of its sales ranking acts
like an instant bestseller list, letting readers know ``what's
going on in the world right now, not last week or a month ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly heavy advance sales have been registered on Amazon.com
for other blockbuster novels earlier this year _ John Grisham's
``Street Lawyer,'' Tom Clancy's ``Rainbow Six,'' and Stephen King's
``Bag of Bones.''
</P>
<P>
   As one indication of the widespread early interest in ``A Man in
Full,'' publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux has moved the
publication date up from Nov. 12 to Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things broke faster than they thought,'' said Maryles
_ among them the novel being chosen as a finalist for the 1998
National Book Awards, a Time magazine cover story for its Nov. 2
issue, and jump-the-gun reviews in nationally circulated papers
such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In the industry, a 1.2 million-copy launch is big, but not
monumental. This year, Grisham's ``Street Lawyer'' had a 2.8
million first printing, Clancy's ``Rainbow Six'' 2 million, and
King's ``Bag of Bones'' 1.31 million.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of all the buzz and hype is a 742-page novel _ the
kind that reviewers will inevitably call ``sprawling'' _ set in
Atlanta. It involves an aging real estate developer facing the loss
of his 28,000-acre plantation when his business ventures go sour.
Just as Wolfe's 1987 bestseller, ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' was
set in motion by a racial incident, ``A Man in Full'' takes off
when a local black football hero is accused of raping the daughter
of a prominent white businessman.
</P>
<P>
   The National Book Award nomination came as a surprise to many
editors and reviewers because review copies did not become
available until several days after the finalists were announced
Oct. 14. The aggressive prepublication marketing of ``A Man in
Full'' is feeding off the nomination, as well as the Time cover.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's ``book detail page'' notice states that the book
``is not yet available. You may still order this title. We will
ship it when it is released by the publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Brown, vice president of marketing at Farrar, Straus,
said that under its agreements with distributors, ``all the dotcoms
will begin fulfilling their advance orders on the same day we let
the bookstores put it on sale.''

NARRATIVE'S PULL: REREADING `BELOVED' ON FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its murderous reds and bleak Midwestern snows, its manifest
acceptance of ghostly witnesses, Jonathan Demme's ``Beloved''
manages to capture the central and specific tragedy of Toni
Morrison's mythic novel. What it doesn't do, and probably should
not, is evoke the sweeping, multilayered lyricism of a great work
of fiction. The passion and earnest fidelity that Oprah Winfrey
(who both produced and stars in the movie) and director Demme
brought to this project have their imprint all over the film, from
the starkly emotional performances of Winfrey and Thandie Newton to
the literal translation of text-to-script. And certainly much of
the power of the movie owes its debt to that intensity of intent.
But in daring to comprehend the legacy of grief and violence left
by American slavery, Morrison's ``Beloved'' triumphs over those
agonies of history with the rhapsodic pull of narrative. Dense with
allusion and shifting time and narrators, Morrison's ``Beloved'' is
wed to a sonorous, Faulknerian prose, and it suggests that the pure
act of telling a story can supersede its evil: If a dead child can
reappear to love a mother out of her mind, so, too, can a cri de
coeur from an old woman take on the magical force of a eulogy
recited in starlight. No visual medium can fully encompass that,
any more than a poem can deliver the colors of the canvas it seeks
to describe.
</P>
<P>
   The story line of both novel and film may be familiar ground by
now. Sethe, a former slave, lives with her daughter Denver in a
house in Ohio; the sorrow of the past has also taken up residence,
in the form of a ghost girl named Beloved. The year is 1873; 18
years before, Sethe _ pregnant with her fourth child _ escaped from
Sweet Home, the Kentucky plantation where she was born. Her
children had been sent ahead to her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, a
freed slave living in Ohio. With the aid of a white girl who helped
her give birth in a boat near the Ohio River, Sethe made her way to
blessed freedom _ blessed at least for 28 days, until terror, not
content with owning yesterday, showed its face again and took the
future as well.
</P>
<P>
   Now an old friend from Sweet Home has ventured to knock on the
door of 124 Bluestone Road, the house near Cincinnati where Sethe
and Denver try to endure. Beat back by a pulsing scarlet light that
awaits him over the threshold (a garishly creepy Halloween effect
in the movie), Paul D at first recoils, until Sethe reassures him:
``Not evil, just sad.'' Full of his own silent memories of the path
he walked out of slavery, Paul D comes carrying a modicum of hope;
what he hadn't bargained on was the broken-child spirit whose
misery rules 124 with spectral tyranny. Throwing furniture along
with her infantile rages, the girl finally appears in the flesh _ a
beautiful young woman who walks out of the water to Sethe's door,
making guttural noises and, when asked her name, spelling out the
word on a nearby tombstone: B-e-l-o-v-e-d. And there's way too much
angry yearning behind that beauty to suggest that this will be a
wholly sweet reunion.
</P>
<P>
   By taking the dramatic risk of making Beloved the girl a
blatantly otherworldly character, Demme's ``Beloved'' handles well
the insistent fact of her, and attempts to suggest the mythic
undertow of the novel: that memory is as alive as you or me; that
reality as we know it is merely the summation of truth we cannot
see; that, in Denver's words, ``death is a skipped meal'' compared
to some kinds of loss. For ``Beloved'' is also a story about the
cost of attachment _ the price you pay for loving thick, whether
it's Sethe's maternal devotion, Denver's need for her sister, or
Paul D's red, red heart, hidden within the sheath of memory. Beyond
the tragic particulars of Sethe's story and the demonic history it
represents is a quieter, more ineffable notion _ that Beloved's
reappearance, to each of these people, only serves to remind them
of what they no longer possess.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took my milk.'' Those four monosyllables come hurled out
of Sethe's history like stones off a cliff, and they testify to the
unthinkable iniquities she has already suffered. Part of Sethe's
tale of ``rememory,'' the words form one of several refrains in the
novel of such resonant restraint that they begin to seem like a
poetry of oppression: the choruses of black men and women and
children strangled by slavery. (``Those white things have taken all
I had or dreamed,'' said Baby Suggs before she died.) Some of this
litany appears in Baby Suggs's holy soliloquies in the forest,
where she preaches to a woodland congregation. ``Cry,'' she tells
them, ``for the living and the dead. Just cry.''
</P>
<P>
   As mesmerizing as this exhortation is in the hands of Beah
Richards, who plays Baby Suggs in the film, it's only the first
half of her speech in the novel, which continues on to a fierce,
heartbroken crescendo. ``And O my people, out yonder, hear me, they
do not love your neck unnoosed and straight. So love your neck; put
a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and hold it up.'' Filled with the
unconquerable weapon of language, Morrison's ``Beloved'' never
pulls its punches on the evils of slavery. And though the film may
seem unstoppably brutal, it actually leaves out (or abbreviates)
some of the worst moments in the novel _ including the story behind
that gravestone, which taught Beloved her name and for which Sethe
paid with blood and soul.
</P>
<P>
   More important, much of the background of Sethe's loved ones has
disappeared: Denver's early deafness, supplanted by a phobic
refusal to leave the house; the life at Sweet Home Sethe shared
with Paul D and her husband, Halle; Paul D's subsequent horrors on
a Georgia prison farm; Baby Suggs's giving up on grace toward the
end of her life. These offstage stories may not seem essential to
Sethe's central agony, but they are. They enhance the pain of it,
explain the sickening inhumanities that led her to her own act of
outrage, and together paint an even bleaker picture than the film
allows. Such omissions are rarely surprising in the translation of
novels into film, where time and bearable endings reign supreme. To
his credit, Demme has transformed much of Morrison's incantatory
narrative into dialogue, a risk that preserves a certain chronology
of fact.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said shortly after the publication of ``Beloved,'' in
1987, that the original idea for her novel came from a news story
she'd discovered about a tragedy similar to ``Sethe's rough
choice,'' as Baby Suggs calls it. Certainly what Demme has brought
through loud and clear is Sethe's slow descent into madness: numbed
by a sorrow too great to bear, then seduced and reawakened by this
wild child who emerges from her amniotic grave, heading for love
and resolution. This fixed nexus of ``Beloved'' probably begged to
be filmed, with its unequivocal dramatic possibilities and
day-by-day battle with the past. Harder to elucidate are the more
far-flung nuances of the novel: the intangible burdens of slavery,
from the survivor's guilt of future generations to the cauterized
hopes of an entire community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' the novel is wider and sadder in all directions than
any screen adaptation could ever be, though that inevitability of
literature shouldn't have stopped it from being made. Mass
culture's formulas alone will guarantee legions of moviegoers who
might never have gone near Morrison's demanding narrative. And the
daring performance of Newton's Beloved suggests the radical
sensuality of the novel, as well as the child's own mutable
necessity to each of these characters: their eventual belief that,
in Morrison's words, ``other than what they themselves were
thinking, she hadn't said anything at all.'' Like its girl-spirit's
watery birthplace, the mythic voices of ``Beloved'' _ its wrestling
with evil, its resplendent chords of memory _ are far deeper than
anything you can see, either in a darkened theater or the light of
everyday life.

<P>
   Like most Americans born during or after the Vietnam War, Burns,
30, is too young to have watched Jimmy Cagney, Spencer Tracy, or
Bing Crosby movies, even on late-night TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish-American ethnic story was presumed to have ended when
John F. Kennedy was elected president. The Irish had suburbanized.
Assimilated. They were indistinguishable from WASPS, save for their
Catholicism and peculiar fondness for green beer and shamrocks
around St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the American Irish are back. Big time. With their Hibernian
cousins across the Atlantic on the up and up, they've become a
pop-culture commodity. Witness the current television season, with
three TV shows about Irish-American families and a third _
``Turks,'' set in Chicago _ slated for a midseason premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The shows are about as true-to-life as Father O'Malley was in
1944. They also date to that previous era _ or notions of the era.
Each one is a jaw-dropping parade of anachronisms and stereotypes.
Fox's ``Costello,'' set in a South Boston bar (where else?), was
canceled after four episodes. CBS's ``To Have and Hold,'' about the
newlywed McGrails of Dorchester, draws its dramatic tension from
his family: three cops and a fireman, all of whom drink too much
(of course), and a mother with a brogue who breaks plates over a
son's head, then makes the sign of the cross.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Trinity,'' about a family in New York's Hell's Kitchen,
presents a broader range of Irish caricature. The siblings in this
show are a priest, a policeman, a labor-union representative, an
alcoholic, and a successful sister whose emotional life is a mess.
As Mike Flaherty wrote in Entertainment Weekly, ``Allusion is also
made to a brother who overdosed at the age of 15 (what was he, a
leprechaun?).''
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to have noticed in Hollywood, but the American
Irish are overwhelmingly middle- and upper-middle-class, and still
Irish, as Burns showed in ``The Brothers McMullen,'' which takes
place largely on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church is at the center of far fewer lives. But
humor, self-deprecation, a predilection for the tragic, and
emotional reticence remain fundamental. Burns's movie opens in a
graveyard, with a recently widowed mother breaking a silence she's
kept for 30 years. The McMullen brothers show their affection by
insulting one another.
</P>
<P>
   The American Irish have long suffered by comparison to the
legendary tale tellers of their ancestral land. (And any involved
in this season's Irish TV shows deserve to suffer.) It would be
premature to say there's a renaissance in Irish-American writing in
the making. But Burns is one of a handful of writers who've
recently started retelling Irish-American tales.
</P>
<P>
   James Carroll won a National Book Award for his memoir ``An
American Requiem.'' Alice McDermott's ``Charming Billy,'' set among
the Irish milieu that was the backdrop of her well-regarded ``At
Weddings and Wakes,'' was nominated for this year's award. Comedian
Colin Quinn, of ``Saturday Night Live,'' recently staged a one-man
autobiographical drama, ``An Irish Wake,'' and is writing a memoir.
And Frank McCourt was born in New York, the setting of much of
``'Tis,'' the sequel to ``Angela's Ashes.''

PLAYWRIGHT MCDONAGH CROSSES THE BORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN DEZELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arguably the hottest cultural commodity to come out of Ireland
in the past year are the plays of 28-year-old Anglo-Irish Martin
McDonagh. Four of them ran simultaneously in London's West End
during the summer of 1997. Last winter in New York, the Joseph Papp
Public Theatre staged ``The Cripple of Inishmaan,'' and the
Atlantic Theatre Company brought over the Druid Theatre production
of ``Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' which transferred to Broadway,
where it won four Tony awards.
</P>
<P>
   Dark, disturbing, and hilariously funny, McDonagh's plays are
postmodern hybrids of Irish theatrical tradition and American pop
culture, and hijinks handling of the cliches of both. Sitting in
farmhouse kitchens that could be sets in any Irish bog drama,
characters in McDonagh's Leenane Trilogy fulminate about lumps in
porridge and about the details of American sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Pictureseque villages are lawless places, where Americans who
come looking for the nearby settings they saw in John Ford's movie
``The Quiet Man'' can get lost for years. Family ties strangle. The
church is a fleeting, pathetic presence in the persona of an
alcoholic, depressed, but well-intentioned priest in ``The Lonesome
West.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Walsh (or is it Welsh? he's so inconsequential no one in
the play can remember) is treated with some sympathy, perhaps
because he is in such a state of despair. ``Ah, there be a lot
worse priests than you, Father, I'm sure,'' another character tries
to reassure him. ``You're a terror for the drink and you have
doubts about Catholicism. Apart from that, you're a fine priest.
Number one, you don't go abusing poor gasurs, so, sure, doesn't
that give you a head start over half the priests in Ireland?''
</P>
<P>
   McDonagh turns the Irish traditions of family, faith, and
fatherland upside down and inside out. But he treats them more
adroitly than any number of older, more earnestly iconoclastic
writers. Dealing deftly with cultural bogeymen appears to be a
point of pride with young Irish writers. ``There is nothing more
tedious than Irish writers banging on about the oppression of
Catholicism,'' novelist Patrich McCabe said in an interview last
year. McDonagh, McCabe, and many of their contemporaries view the
world through prisms that are neither ground with tedious identity
politics nor clouded with the specter of political correctness.
Which may explain their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``McDonagh is the first playwright of the 21st century,'' said
American Repertory Theatre director and drama critic Robert
Brustein. ``He's the best Irish playwright since Synge; he may be
better than Synge. He has the Irish control of language and poetry,
but you expect that. He is very funny and dark. Yet he has a way of
evoking both human failure and virtue that is powerful and
universal. No one writing today can touch him.''

RIVERDANCE OVERSHADOWS IRISH EXPLOSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Riverdance,'' the exuberant, seemingly ubiquitous Irish dance
extravaganza, bowed out of the Wang Theatre this weekend, after
selling out the cavernous performance hall during most of its third
Boston run in less than two years. It has played to nearly 5
million people on three continents since its 1994 debut as an
extended commercial in a Eurovision song contest _ notwithstanding
competition from Michael Flatley's frantic-tapping, air-boxing,
Eire-satz spinoff, `Lord of the Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Razzle-dazzle stage shows with Irish roots have become a
worldwide symbol of Celtic chic in the late '90s: a time when
everything green-tinged has turned red hot. Frank McCourt's
``Angela's Ashes'' recently entered its third year on the New York
Times bestseller list, where it has overlapped at various points
with Thomas Cahill's ``How the Irish Saved Civilization,'' Nuala
O'Faolain's ``Are You Somebody: The Accidental Memoir of a Dublin
Woman,'' and ``A Monk Swimming,'' by Malachy McCourt, Frank's
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The Druid Theatre's production of Martin McDonagh's mordantly
funny ``Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' which won four Tony Awards this
year, is selling out on Broadway. From U2 and the Cranberries
through Black 47 and Cherish the Ladies, a wide variety of Irish
music has been simultaneously popular. Irish authors are pulling
down record advances, cashing in on the international success of
novelists like Roddy Doyle (``Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha,'' ``The
Commitments'') and Patrick McCabe (``The Butcher Boy''). Doyle and
McCabe have written screenplays based on their books for an Irish
film industry that is flourishing, thanks to the ascendance of Jim
Sheridan (``My Left Foot,'' ``In the Name of the Father'') and Neil
Jordan (``The Crying Game,'' ``Michael Collins,'' ``The Butcher
Boy'').
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Riverdance,'' with its upbeat muddle of folk art,
multi-culti fuzziness, and feel-good American showbiz, is by no
means emblematic of the artistic efforts coming out of Ireland and
Irish America right now, many of which are dark, edgy, and keenly
rendered. Contemporary Irish literature, film, and theater are
brimming with bleak, blackly humorous explorations of centers that
cannot hold: the impoverished family in ``Angela's Ashes''; the
brutally indifferent church and village society of ``The Butcher
Boy''; McDonagh's post-romantic west of Ireland, where simple
country folk scorn themselves and their surroundings, and act on
murderous impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a counter-melody to the Celtic Tiger's'' success in the
international economy, said Declan Kiberd, the literature professor
at University College Dublin who wrote ``Inventing Ireland.'' The
popular explosion of brooding social portraiture and tragi-comedy
is taking place in the midst of unprecedented peace, secularism,
and prosperity in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish live with paradox,'' Kiberd pointed out. ``There is
an Irish condition, having to do with colonial history, in which
there are two versions of reality: official and unofficial. People
don't see pagan and Christian as opposed, or past and future. So
while it was once a cliche that the Irish were obsessed with the
past, now they are interested in having power over the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in any decade in Ireland you get an incredibly high number
of quality writers and novelists and playwrights,'' he added. ``The
question is, why is there so much current interest in the US and
Britain?''
</P>
<P>
   The melodies and counter-melodies of Irish arts, literature, and
entertainment are playing extraordinarily well in the United
States, to the surprise of some observers. ``When I was growing up
in the Bronx, the kids who took step-dancing classes were the ones
who couldn't run fast enough,'' said Peter Quinn, a novelist and
speechwriter who has written extensively about Ireland and Irish
America. These days, there are waiting lists for Irish dance
classes, and Americans flock to traditional Irish music festivals.
Quinn attributes the surge of interest to the receding influence of
the Catholic Church. Through the mid-1960s, ``our whole emotional
life was involved with the church,'' he said. ``There was
tremendous psychic energy drawn into the church. And now a lot of
creativity, a lot of the best minds, are going into secular
pursuits.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Quinn said, ``Irish culture has always been kind of
marginal and out of the mainstream, and that appeals to a lot of
people now. We're living in the decline of the culture of the
superego, of the great European cultures. Irish culture is an id
culture. It's passionate, and dark, it is an exploration of human
failure. Survival. And now people are exploring that marginal
experience'' in music, movies, books, and plays.
</P>
<P>
   Some have found the explorations poignant and revealing. When
Boston's Sugan Theatre staged Tom Murphy's harrowing play
``Famine,'' it quickly became clear to Sugan artistic director
Carmel O'Reilly that ``this was a story that had not been told.''
The company mounted the production in 1995, two years before
commemorations marking the 150th anniversary of the worst year of
the Irish Famine raised awareness of the catastrophe that drove
more than 1 million people out of Ireland to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came in droves'' to the Sugan show, said O'Reilly.
``They came up from Rhode Island, from as far away as New Jersey.
The response was tremendous; we got cards and letters from Irish
Americans who didn't really know what they'd come out of, thanking
us. Knowing something about what had happened was a spiritual
experience for some people. A way of reconnecting with this
immigrant experience that left a lot of people rootless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got negative reactions, too,'' O'Reilly continued. ``There
were people who were bitterly angry that we had shown the Irish
that way _ poor and dirty and drunken, reduced to stealing turf.
There is a shame about that, a feeling that Irish Americans spent
all these years building them-selves up, and we shouldn't be
telling people about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The declasse part of the Irish experience was never spoken of
until recently,'' said the director Jim Sheridan, who ran the Irish
Arts Center in New York in the 1980s before he began making hit
movies with Daniel Day-Lewis. ``The origin of `Angela's Ashes' was
a play that Frank and Malachy McCourt did, `A Couple of
Blackguards.' It ran for years, and no one paid attention. That
wasn't a legitimate field. Until the influx of the immigrants in
the 1980s, Irish-American audiences were very conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now there's a distance. There's been a shift of wealth,
and Irish culture is for sale. There hasn't been much to buy
besides Waterford in the Aer Lingus catalog. Now you can go to
`Riverdance.' You can look at `Angela's Ashes' or `My Left Foot.'
And you can say `Look at how far we've come.'''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Ireland that today's senaithe, or storytellers, are
revealing to the world ``is history,'' noted Kiberd. McCourt's
1940s Limerick and the Cold War backdrop of ``The Butcher Boy'' are
long gone. The implacable politics of ``In the Name of the Father''
at this point appear to be contained. Even some of Doyle's
present-day tales are dated: The title characters of ``The
Commitments'' formed their anachronistic soul band in a late-'80s
Dublin overrun with drug use and unemployment. Dublin today is a
cosmopolitan capital of the fastest-growing economy in the European
Union, bustling with trilling cell phones, traffic noise, tourists,
and men and women in designer suits closing deals over large cups
of cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   Remote, religious Ireland _ like the mythical land of mist,
musicmakers, and senaithe _ has all but disappeared. But it is the
remoteness, religion, and myth that have gone missing. The
musicmaking and the storytelling are thriving _ along with
moviemaking and the visual arts _ because Ireland, for all its
seismic social changes, remains a place where those things matter.
</P>
<P>
   Irish residents who earn their livings in the creative arts have
been exempt from paying income tax since 1969. The poet and Nobel
laureate Seamus Heaney is a celebrity in Dublin. The Irish press
covered multiple angles of the Druid Theatre's Broadway success
last spring, and fans at home were grumbling for weeks after the
Tonys that McDonagh, who lost out to ``Art'' in the best play
category, was robbed.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the world, it is its ``remarkable adaptability''
and ``open-endedness'' that have kept Irish culture vital and made
it ``universal,'' according to Adele Dalsimer, cofounder of Boston
College's Irish Studies program. Traditional Irish music, for
example, traveled to Appalachia, returned to Ireland in the form of
country-Western, mixed it up with rock 'n' roll, and has recently
grown the offshoot of Celtic rock. ``Riverdance'' would never have
existed were it not for the Broadway musical, and, as the Irish
journalist Fintan O'Toole has pointed out, Broadway wouldn't be
what it became without the original song-and-dance man, George M.
Cohan, whose father, a son of famine immigrants, was a famous
traditional Irish dancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish arts tide shows few signs of slowing. Critically
acclaimed in London and Dublin, Conor McPherson's ``The Weir'' is
reportedly on its way to Broadway early next year. McPherson is the
other hot 28-year-old Irish playwright (along with Martin McDonagh
_ see accompanying story), and wrote the screenplay for this year's
successful independent film ``I Went Down.'' ART is doing
McDonagh's ``The Cripple of Inishmaan,'' and the Huntington is
producing Sebastian Barry's ``The Steward of Christendom'' this
season. Meanwhile, the screen version of veteran playwright Brian
Friel's ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' is due out in November. Another
spate of Irish memoirs _ including one by Peter Sheridan, the
director's brother, and the sequel to ``Angela's Ashes'' _ is
expected out next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the economy, it feeds on itself,'' said Ciaran
O'Reilly, producing director of the Irish Repertory Theatre in
Manhattan. ``Maybe it's happening by virtue of great art and talent
that's suddenly being embraced. Maybe it's just coming into Irish
Americans' consciousness for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or maybe it's just hip.''

SEVEN STATES TO VOTE ON ANIMAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Anticockfighting ballot questions in Arizona and Missouri are
among eight animal-related issues facing voters in seven states
Tuesday, continuing a trend of taking control of such decisions
away from elected lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Including the votes in Arizona and Missouri, six of the ballot
questions are supported by animal-rights activists:
</P>
<P>
   _In Alaska, voters will decide whether to ban the practice of
wolf snaring, used primarily for predator control and fur sales.
</P>
<P>
   _California voters will be asked whether to ban the sale of
horses for human consumption, and whether to outlaw the use of
certain traps and poisons.
</P>
<P>
   _Ohio voters will be asked whether to ban target shooting and
restore protections for mourning doves.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in two other states will face ballot questions supported
by pro-hunting groups:
</P>
<P>
   _In Minnesota, voters will be asked whether to approve a
constitutional amendment affirming that hunting and trapping are
valued elements of the state's heritage ``that shall be forever
preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   _Utah voters will decide whether to enact a constitutional
amendment requiring all animal-protection initiatives to be
approved by two-thirds of voters to take effect, rather than the
current majority.
</P>
<P>
   The use of ballot questions on animal-rights issues has gained
significant ground since 1990, when California voters outlawed
mountain lion hunting, said Wayne Pacelle, senior vice president of
the Humane Society of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, voters have approved 10 of the 12 animal-protection
questions put before them, he said.

FUTURE OF BLOOD SPORT AT STAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Two tough birds slash and peck in a feather-flying
brawl that ends with one triumphant and the other defeated, maybe
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   That's cockfighting, but it also happens to be a pretty fair
description of the battle going on between Belton Hodges and Ken
White over the future of the blood sport, and just maybe, the
future of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are opposing leaders in a campaign to decide whether
to outlaw cockfighting in the state. Polls indicate that ballot
questions making cockfighting a felony will probably pass Tuesday
here and in Missouri, limiting the legal range of the sport to
Oklahoma, Louisiana, and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Though cockfighting is the immediate focus, the face-off between
Hodges and White is about more than that. It is a contest that
exposes fault lines in a longstanding conflict over whose Arizona
this is, with Hodges and White representing the competing forces _
natives versus transplants, rural dwellers versus urbanites _ that
are redefining this rapidly growing state.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, 78, a Phoenix native from a long line of cockfighters,
says he is protecting the state's heritage, preserving a besieged
western culture built on individual freedoms and upholding a
common-sense view of the proper place of animals, fowl, and vermin:
well below humans on the evolutionary scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been invaded and become a heavily urbanized state, by
people raised in the major cities of the East,'' said Hodges,
former president of a national cockfighting group. ``They've
forgotten the fact that a large group of people lived here together
before they arrived. And we cherish our manners and our customs. If
they don't like fighting cocks, they can go play golf or whatever
it is they like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   White, 45, a Brooklyn native who arrived here three years ago
from San Francisco, says he is working to eliminate an ugly vestige
of the past, one that considers cruelty to animals to be
entertainment and desensitizes adults and children to acts of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what the West was, in its entirety, is what
anybody needs the West to be today,'' said White, executive
director of the Arizona Humane Society. ``We don't need to settle
squabbles with a shootout, we don't need to force people to marry
at the point of a shotgun. The West has a heritage that is rich,
but there are some things we need to make sure never happen again,
and cockfighting is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop of the cockfighting conflict is the explosive
growth Arizona has experienced in recent years. Flooded by retirees
and warm-weather seekers, the state's population has nearly tripled
since 1970 to 4.6 million people. It is the second-fastest growing
state in the nation, after Nevada, and Phoenix has emerged as the
nation's sixth-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been real social upheaval. As a small community grows
into a larger city, the old-time residents clearly have significant
changes in their lives, and change can be wrenching,'' said Tom
Rex, research manager at the Center for Business Research at
Arizona State University. ``Cockfighting is a good example of what
this state used to be like, but isn't anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, cockfighting is a pretty straightforward
activity. Three men _ participants are nearly all male _ enter an
enclosed dirt ring, two with prized gamecocks in their arms and one
to serve as referee.
</P>
<P>
   The knee-high birds, their multicolored feathers glowing with a
lustrous sheen, are fitted with knifelike spikes, or gaffs,
sharpened at the tip. The gaffs are placed over bone spurs that
grow from roosters' ankles and are the birds' most potent weapon in
the wild. Cockfighters say the metal blades are necessary to
equalize fights between birds whose natural spurs grow to different
lengths; opponents say the purpose is to guarantee the bouts will
be bloody.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the fight, wagers are made and the handlers coo at
their birds, holding them close to their intended foe. At the
referee's signal, the handlers drop the birds and step back to
watch them fight, often until one is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Cockfighting is out of season right now, Hodges said, as the
birds go through a molting period. But underground videos of fights
show bloody contests in which gamecocks lunge at each other, wings
flapping, leaping over each other's backs, and making
lightning-quick cuts and gouges. Men in jeans and camouflage pants
urge the birds on, in one case rubbing a downed bird's face in the
dirt to encourage it to fight on; the bird was soon tossed in a
losers' barrel brimming with carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 45 cockfighting venues in Arizona, from
backyard pits ringed with chicken wire to perhaps a half-dozen
larger, barnlike structures, most on the California border.
Anywhere from 15,000 to 50,000 fights take place a year, depending
on which side is doing the estimating.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three attempts to outlaw cockfighting have failed in the
Arizona Legislature since the 1950s, killed by lawmakers who were
enthusiasts or at least sympathetic to the pleas of a small but
vocal pro-cockfighting lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Anticockfighting forces, under the umbrella of a Tucson group
called Citizens Against Cockfighting, came to understand that
legislatures change more slowly than the general population in a
place like this. This year's ballot question is the first time the
issue has been put directly to voters, and independent polls show
overwhelmingly support for making cockfighting a felony punishable
by up to two years in prison and a $150,000 fine; attending a
cockfight would be a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Similar support is seen in Missouri, where cockfighting had been
outlawed for more than 100 years, until a 1985 state Supreme Court
decision struck down the law as unconstitutionally vague. Since
then, repeated attempts to outlaw the blood sport have failed in
the Missouri Legislature, said Barbara Gray, campaign manager of
Missourians Against Cockfighting.
</P>
<P>
   If the Arizona and Missouri cockfighting bans are approved, ``we
will immediately focus our attention on a ballot initiative in
Oklahoma ... to eliminate this gruesome and nasty blood sport
nationwide,'' said Wayne Pacelle, senior vice president of the
Humane Society of the United States. New Mexico and Louisiana do
not allow ballot initiatives, he said, so efforts in those states
will continue in legislative chambers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, Hodges is still raising fighting birds behind
his tidy red-brick ranch house in south Phoenix, a home brimming
with cockfighting paraphernalia and memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   A retired railroad engineer with a silver pompadour and a pinch
of Skoal tobacco in his mouth, Hodges talks about his birds with a
mix of admiration and disdain. He revels in what he considers their
take-no-prisoners courage against overwhelming odds, then derides
them as ``just chickens, not dogs or cats.'' He says he does not
name them _ though there is one retired fighter called ``Pretty
Boy'' _ and says their only purpose in life is to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges is well aware of the polls showing Arizona residents are
against cockfighting, and he is perplexed. ``Watching what nature
intended, watching two birds fight, is a felonious offense? It's
one of my rights they're taking away.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the appeal, Hodges and fellow cockfighters talk
about the pride of purifying bloodlines, the two years it takes to
raise birds from the egg to the ring, and the pure pleasure of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty miles away, at the Arizona Humane Society, White scoffs
at Hodges' rationale.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do this in nature? I don't think they would ingest
steroids, strap stilettos to their ankles, confine themselves to
wooden pens, and ask human beings to wager on who was going to die
first,'' says White, a trim man wearing stylish glasses, deck shoes
without socks and a red polo shirt with the Humane Society logo.
``This kind of thing is at the core of societal violence and it's
not just about Belton's life choices.''
</P>
<P>
   White, does, however, acknowledge a certain sympathy for Hodges.
``To be his age and see his world change that dramatically is
sad.''

CAMPAIGN DEBATES OK, BUT TV ADS CRUCIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Someone _ I don't remember who _ recently suggested
that it would be a good idea to require candidates for public
office to participate in debates.
</P>
<P>
   The idea would be to promote an alternative to the programmed
television commercials that now dominate most major political
campaigns _ those campaigns that are successful anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The idea certainly is tempting but, alas, would likely violate
the First Amendment. Freedom of speech also includes the freedom
not to speak, and the last time I checked the First Amendment also
applied to political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The debate issue predictably surfaces in every political season.
Challengers and other candidates with more energy than campaign
dollars will typically demand to debate better-known or
better-financed opponents, who often will dance around the
invitation and come up with repeated scheduling conflicts or other
excuses to avoid a head-to-head encounter.
</P>
<P>
   There were only three major televised debates featuring
statewide candidates this fall. Gov. George W. Bush, after much
prodding, debated his Democratic challenger, Garry Mauro, in El
Paso, Texas, a couple of weeks ago. Democrat John Sharp and
Republican Rick Perry, the candidates for lieutenant governor,
debated, also in El Paso, a few weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And, last week, Democrat Jim Mattox and Republican John Cornyn
butted heads in Dallas in their attorney general's race. Candidates
who doubt their abilities to think quickly or speak coherently and
convincingly in a spontaneous exchange are reluctant to debate
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Many front-runners, particularly those whose leads in the polls
are as wide as Bush's, also believe, with some justification, that
debates and other joint appearances with their opponents can do
little more than benefit their opponents. A televised debate
obviously gives an underdog more public exposure and, front-runners
fear, more credibility in the eyes of the voters. Front-runners
also fear, perhaps more than anything else, that they will commit a
major gaffe or blunder that could embarrass them before the voters,
damage their own credibility and make them more vulnerable to their
opponents' attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, nevertheless, continued what has become something of a
tradition of gubernatorial debates in Texas and finally agreed to
one debate with Mauro. And from all indications, it hasn't affected
the likely outcome of the gubernatorial race. It actually was one
of the duller events of the political season. Bush didn't make any
major mistakes, Mauro didn't come close to scoring a knockdown
punch and both candidates' rhetoric was largely uninspiring.
</P>
<P>
   But the mere fact that the televised debate was held was
important to the political process because it afforded voters who
made the effort to watch it _ either live or on taped replays _ an
opportunity to see the two candidates field questions about
important issues from an impartial moderator and challenge each
other's answers. In so doing, Bush and Mauro clearly outlined some
important differences.
</P>
<P>
   The liveliest televised debate of the fall was clearly last
week's shootout between Mattox and Cornyn, who eagerly displayed
their sharp political and philosophical differences in the attorney
general's race. As political debaters exchange charges and
countercharges, there, of course, is no guarantee that what they
are saying about themselves and each other is true.
</P>
<P>
   Lies can as easily be uttered by candidates during a debate as
they can be presented in political advertising. But the important
difference in a debate is that an opponent can immediately fire
back to challenge a statement that he or she believes is _ or knows
to be _ untrue. Debates, candidate forums, chamber of commerce
speeches, courthouse tours, endorsements by interest groups and
newspapers and, to be sure, party affiliation all play roles in
helping voters decide how to cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   But television advertising _ with all its exaggerations,
misrepresentations and downright lies _ will remain a dominant
factor in determining the outcome of major statewide races in
Texas. Sharp, for example, who has been criticizing Perry for
avoiding recent joint appearances in the lieutenant governor's
race, is, nevertheless, banking heavily on TV ads, some of which
have been blasted by Perry as unfair and inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't completely ignore the commercials. I paid $6.7 million
for them,'' Sharp told a Houston business group last week.

ANTHOLOGY SHOWS ALL SIDES OF JOHN LENNON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Whether singing about working-class heroes or whatever gets
you through the night, John Lennon was rock's most genuine, most
ardent, most shoot-from-the-hip star. He was the creative fuel of
the Beatles, but it was in his post-Beatles solo career that his
true personality emerged. He wore many hats _ as peace activist,
house-husband, primal-scream advocate, black-humored satirist, FBI
antagonist, mind-games analyst, impish wastrel, and, almost without
fail, musical seer.
</P>
<P>
   All of these boldly unapologetic stances are celebrated in a
new, four-CD boxed set, ``The John Lennon Anthology,'' due out
Tuesday (it's expected to retail for $70-$75). It collects close to
100 previously unreleased Lennon nuggets, from stunning homemade
acoustic recordings to studio outtakes, live tracks, and highly
personal family conversations with wife Yoko Ono and son Sean.
</P>
<P>
   Together they paint a picture of a burningly complex yet
winsomely funny artist whose influence on rock 'n' roll was
unsurpassed. In his colorful, vigorously candid way, Lennon paved
the way for Kurt Cobain, Billy Corgan, and many other rock
iconoclasts.
</P>
<P>
   Like the three ``Beatles Anthology'' volumes that preceded it,
the new Lennon anthology takes the listener behind the scenes,
showing songs as they progress from demo to studio tapes, providing
studio banter (some hilarious exchanges with producer Phil Spector)
and giving a diarylike expression of Lennon's innermost thoughts,
from romantic to cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted this to embody a total picture of John,'' says
executive producer Ono, during a recent phone interview from her
home in the Dakota apartment building in Manhattan, where she lived
with Lennon until he was murdered by a crazed fan while entering
the building in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to include just the proper stuff about John,''
she added. ``Some of it is not that proper, because his black humor
was a little bit too sharp, but that was John. I didn't want to
censor it. I just wanted to show him as he was. The brilliant self
that he was.''
</P>
<P>
   She succeeded admirably _ and maybe, finally, this will help
Ono's image with some of those stuck-in-cement die-hards who still
scorn her as the ``Dragon Lady'' who broke up the Beatles. She has
treated Lennon's catalog with dignity for many years _ and this new
project is the most intimate, and arguably the most creative, boxed
set in the history of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   The timing also feels right. For many Lennon lovers, it has
taken years of healing to get to the point of being able to hear
his songs again without dissolving into regret. And this is the
right time, because it's also encouraging to revisit the music of
an artist who wasn't mimicking trends, as so often happens with
today's ``rock stars,'' but was creating his own.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Premiere of ``Hero''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural significance of the new box jumps out from the
start. It opens with the first-ever take (a solo acoustic version)
of ``Working Class Hero'' from 1970. Like a minstrel of the
apocalypse, Lennon snarls the famous lines: ``As soon as you're
born, they make you feel small/By giving you no time instead of it
all/ &QC; 
Until the pain is so big you feel nothing at all.'' And then a
verse that still gives chills: ``When they've tortured you and
scared you for 20-odd years/Then they expect you to pick a
career/But you can't really function, you're so full of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The song didn't sit well with the authoritiies, but neither did
a lot of Lennon tunes. Next up is ``God,'' in which he questions
religious icons and concludes ``I just believe in me, Yoko and me _
that's reality.'' More reality comes in a mesmerizing home tape of
``I Found Out,'' in which, atop his muddy solo electric guitar, he
sings, ``There ain't no guru who can look through your eyes.'' And
that's not to overlook ``I Don't Want to Be a Soldier,'' with its
tense line, ``I don't want to die.'' Vietnam, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   And this is just on the first CD, which also includes the first
take of his idealistic anthem, ``Imagine,'' done with harmonium, as
Spector is heard in the background admonishing some guests: ``Can
you be very quiet in the kitchen, please?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first take of `Imagine' was very powerful,'' says Ono, who
was there. ``It's like John was singing without knowing that it
would have such an incredible influence on the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine all the people living for today .../Imagine all the
people living life in peace,'' Lennon sings in the forceful, and
yet heartfelt, tone that he brought to everything he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``John didn't record something unless it really came from his
heart,'' Ono says. ``Somebody once said that the truth is a very
precious thing and you have to take it in small dosages. John
thought it was important to have a piece of truth told in every
song he did. He didn't want to just give something generic.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Lennon anthology so extraordinary is hearing
Lennon's voice front and center on the home tapes, before it often
got mixed down in the studio. His messages are thus even more bold,
as if he's singing right in the same room with the listener.
</P>
<P>
   There are home recordings from throughout his solo career,
climaxing with songs that ended up on 1980's ``Double Fantasy''
album. One is ``Watching the Wheels,'' his poetic ode to
house-husbandry, done hypnotically on acoustic guitar. He thumbs
his nose at the corporate rec-ord industry by singing that he's
``no longer riding on the merry-go-round/I just had to let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the serious philosophical songs that emerge
from the home tapes. Lennon's wry, satirical bent is illuminated in
three spontaneous parodies of Bob Dylan. Lennon affects Dylan's
pinched, nasal voice in ``Serve Yourself'' (a spoof of ``You Gotta
Serve Somebody''), singing, ``You've got to serve yourself, lads,
there ain't no room service here! .../You got to save yourself and
that's all there is to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes another poke at Dylan by mock-singing ``Knockin' on
Heaven's Door'' and then doing an untitled, spontaneous talking
blues about Vietnam, this time imitating the dour side of Dylan's
voice: ``The official Soviet newspaper said the temple members had
protested the mindless war in Vietnam and were persecuted and were
finally forced to seek refuge in another country. Wow, it sounds
like a ballad to me!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Off-the-cuff genius
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These things just came out,'' says Ono. ``It wasn't like John
was laboring or finding words in a dictionary or anything. It just
came out of his head. It was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Another spontaneous creation was the country twang of ``Life
Begins at 40,'' a home tape of Lennon on guitar and rhythm box.
``We'd like to welcome you to the Dakota Country-and-Western
Club,'' he says, sounding like Hank Williams. ``Life begins at 40,
age is just a state of mind .../And if that don't work, I'll jerk
around until my next birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   This song, in particular, sounds as though Lennon had drunk a
beer or two or three before devising it. ``Sometimes he had one too
many beers, and you can hear it,'' admits Ono. ``But he was still
there as a singer and a musician. He was still spot on.''
</P>
<P>
   The sensitive-father side of Lennon also comes out in some of
the home tapes. There's one called ``Loud,'' in which son Sean is
banging away on an electric guitar. ``I like it very loud,'' says
Sean. ``Well, that's how I like it too,'' says Dad. Another has
Sean asking where he was before he was born. ``You were still in
the sky,'' says John. When Sean wonders what he landed on when he
came down from the sky, John adds, ``A little cardboard box with a
little blanket in it _ like they bring the groceries in, but it was
you instead of the groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennon's unique wit fills this boxed set, but so do his bold
political pronouncements, as heard in a live version of ``Attica
State,'' condemning the suffocating conditions that led to the
prison riots there. Further highlights are two versions of the
provocative ``Woman Is the Nigger of the World,'' which show Lennon
to be ahead of his time in supporting female empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   The least revelatory part of the box concerns sessions for his
``Rock 'n' Roll'' album in 1974. That came during a time when he
and Ono had broken up for nearly a year and a half and he was
partying heavily with rock buddies like Harry Nilsson and Keith
Moon in Los Angeles. The album has cover versions of classics such
as Little Richard's ``Rip It Up'' and Buddy Holly's ``Peggy Sue,''
but this was just a limbo period before Lennon reunited with Ono
and rekindled his creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The new anthology is chronologically arranged _ and the CDs are
titled according to different eras: ``Ascot,'' ``New York City,''
``The Lost Weekend,'' and ``Dakota.'' But after all of Lennon's
many moods and stances, it's compelling to see how positive he was
before his death. He never became the ``90-year-old guru'' that he
jokingly predicted he'd become in studio banter with Spector, but
he was definitely at peace with himself.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Grow Old With Me,'' he sings, ``Grow old with me, our best
is yet to be.'' In the poignant ``Beautiful Boy,'' he sings of
Sean: ``I can hardly wait to see you come of age.'' And in the
eerie ``Borrowed Time,'' represented by another home tape on
acoustic guitar, he sings, ``Now I'm older, the more that I see,
the less that I know for sure .../But the future is brighter.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ono, compiling this box (with the help of chief engineer Rob
Stevens) was a labor of love filled with tears. ``Oh, I was crying
most of the time or was choked up because he's no longer here _ you
know that feeling,'' she says. ``But it was a revelation to be
reminded of what an incredible talent he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'd listen to how brilliant he was, I felt like my
personal emotion just disappeared. And, as artist to artist, I just
felt like saying `Bravo.''

TAKE A CRUISE ABOARD A BARGE, SEE THE WORLD ALONG THE RIVERBANKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's play word association.
</P>
<P>
   We start with a ``vessel.'' We place it in the ``water.'' We put
198 ``passengers'' aboard and provide them with comfortable
``accommodations.'' We hire ``service'' personnel to cater to their
essential needs and individual whims. And we develop an
``itinerary'' that includes multiple ``ports.''
</P>
<P>
   What do we call this experience? A ``cruise,'' right?
</P>
<P>
   Not aboard the River Explorer, a daring and innovative venture
that offers an unusual perspective of America's inland waterways _
and their significant role in history and modern-day commerce _
from two connected barges propelled by a 3,000-horsepower towboat.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, now. Fess up. You grimaced upon reading that last
paragraph, didn't you?
</P>
<P>
   Barges? Towboat? Immense, flat river barges _ not those
intimate, similarly named passenger boats that ply European canals
_ are designed to carry coal, grain, oil products, lumber and other
materials, aren't they? Not humans. Especially not humans on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Don't dare make that suggestion to Eddie Conrad, chairman and
chief visionary of New Orleans-based RiverBarge Excursion Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad already has defied the odds by achieving success for nine
years with ``RV barging'' on America's rivers. Five weeks ago, his
longtime dream became reality with the debut of the River Explorer,
billed as a ``floating community'' on explorations of four to 10
days on the Mississippi, Ohio, Missouri and Cumberland rivers and
on the Intracoastal Waterway in Texas and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural season includes six winter sailings between
Galveston, Texas, and New Orleans, La., one timed to showcase Mardi
Gras celebrations at each extreme and en route. Also scheduled is
one excursion in each direction between Galveston and Port Isabel,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe wager that you've neither seen nor imagined anything
quite like the River Explorer, constructed in Jennings, La. Its
three components _ the LaSalle and DeSoto barges and Miss Nari
towboat _ stretch for 730 feet, comparable in length to many large
cruise ships, but have a maximum width of 54 feet and rise only 50
feet above the water.
</P>
<P>
   Its on-board tone is as distinctive as its appearance. Unlike
most passenger vessels _ including steamboats operated by Delta
Queen and other companies _ the River Explorer schedules few
organized activities. ``We try to minimize herding,'' Conrad says.
``Herding works well for cattle but not for people.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no casino. Not even bingo. There are no lavish
song-and-dance revues. No magicians. No art auctions. No
napkin-folding demonstrations. No ``fluffy drink specials featuring
flaming flamingos,'' the line says. No pool games. No pool.
</P>
<P>
   While his approach may befuddle devoted cruisers, Conrad says
proudly, ``You won't find the word `cruise' anywhere in our
brochure or advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The star attraction is clearly the river.
</P>
<P>
   Limited musical entertainment focuses on river lore.
Storytelling sessions detail legendary characters and their
exploits. Frequent commentary piped throughout the vessel relates
how rivers fostered industry and helped communities grow and
prosper, how they provided the impetus for the founding of New
Orleans, Memphis, St. Louis, Cincinnati and many other towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exploring these rivers provides people an opportunity to find
their heritage,'' Conrad suggests. ``People talked a few
generations ago of traveling to Ireland or England or other parts
of the world to trace their roots. But our roots are here in the
heartland.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the River Explorer represents America's first ``hotel
barge'' enterprise, Conrad is quick to remind that passenger
barging was a favored mode of transportation in the nation's
infancy, indeed that George Washington arrived for his inauguration
on a barge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barging evolved as the best and safest means to move people,
and it remains the safest way to travel on the river,'' says
Conrad. ``And with our shallow draft (drawing only 6 feet of
water), we can access more ports. That's important, because we're
trying not to offer canned itineraries. We want flexibility. We
want every excursion to stand on its own. Part of the appeal is
that there is always a certain amount of uncertainty and adventure
along the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling at about 7 mph, it's a comfortable adventure. Diverse
sights _ a snowy white egret, a rusty freighter or an elegant
antebellum home high on a bluff _ are easily observed through
picture windows in staterooms, along corridors and in public areas.
Sunsets are spectacular when viewed from the vast open-air Sky
Deck.
</P>
<P>
   And if the River Explorer eschews traditional cruise enticements
too eagerly in some respects _ some travelers do enjoy organized or
disorganized fun, especially when paying $200-$300 per day _
oceangoing lines should take note of its passenger-friendly
amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Among these: bathtubs, refrigerators, coffee-makers and
televisions with VCRs in every stateroom; ice machines conveniently
placed in corridors; complimentary soft drinks, lemonade, tea and
coffee available by self-service at any hour; a prohibition against
tipping; and a basic fare that includes all land excursions and
port charges.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice touch: Binoculars are provided for every passenger,
with the request only that they be left in the stateroom upon
departure.
</P>
<P>
   A casual, family-style ambience prevails throughout. All 99
staterooms are identical except that upper-level cabins feature
small balconies beyond their ample 200-square-foot dimensions. No
one wears coats and ties or evening dresses. Passengers dine in the
Galley _ a large and comfortable room _ when and with whom they
please. And they are encouraged to raid the refrigerator day or
night for sandwiches, sweets or surprises, or to dip into a
``perpetual cookie jar'' in the main lobby.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passengers, officers and crew members mingle easily. The captain
answers to Kenny. The bargemaster _ no cruise director here _ is
introduced as Rock, his assistant as Sonny. The all-American crew
is designated as BargeMates, and each member performs various
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hire people as waiters, bartenders, housekeepers,
busboys and dishwashers,'' Conrad says. ``People have an
opportunity to rotate. We don't like titles. Teamwork is the only
way you can get barges up and down the river, and this is no
exception. Our captains come down from the bridge to help sort
luggage. And they don't wear uniforms with gold bars.''
</P>
<P>
   RiverBarge Excursions Line president Jeff Krida, a former
president of Delta Queen Steamboat Co., elaborates: ``Our main
emphasis in hiring is to find people whose mamas and daddies raised
them right.''
</P>
<P>
   While this idealistic approach is laudable, drawbacks quickly
become evident in its implementation. During an early-October
sailing between New Orleans and Vicksburg, Miss., some passengers
expressed confusion about the on-board chain of command and whom to
consult for specific requests or concerns. Service was consistently
provided with a smile _ ``We're told never to ignore a passenger's
request,'' one beaming BargeMate said _ but efficiency was erratic.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, start-ups in any service-oriented travel venture
are difficult; even long-existing companies refer to early sailings
on new ships as ``shakedown cruises,'' and most experienced
passengers avoid them. Imagine the challenge of starting from
scratch, using employees who, with few exceptions, have never been
to sea. Or to river.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the venture's potential seems almost unlimited,
especially if the vessel's vast space is used to maximum advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The two custom-built barges, named for famed river explorers,
consist of two interior decks each with a joint open upper deck
that includes a lounge, a jogging track and two hot tubs. Elevators
access all areas (but because of the vessel's length, expect to do
considerable walking).
</P>
<P>
   All staterooms are on the aft LaSalle barge. Twin beds are
easily converted into a ``super queen'' _ only about 3 inches
narrower than a king _ and, unlike on many cruise ships, aren't
lodged against a wall. Individual air-conditioning units allow
passengers to set temperatures to their liking. Television
reception includes ESPN, CNN, HBO and other cable outlets (but not
local channels). Bathrooms are spacious. Storage room is ample but
not extravagant.
</P>
<P>
   Among public rooms _ all on the forward DeSoto barge _ the
second-floor Pilot House at the front of the vessel is especially
inviting. Though the River Explorer's controls are elsewhere, this
room is a re-creation of a working pilot's station with radar,
charts and other instruments used by river pilots. Passengers gaze
through huge windows and listen to communications between the barge
and other vessels.
</P>
<P>
   On the same deck, a large lobby is ideal for relaxation and
river viewing. Nearby, a library/card room is notable both for its
classy decor and the care devoted to selecting books (many with a
maritime theme) and videos available on an honor system. Dozens
more seats are positioned beside windows in corridors.
</P>
<P>
   One significant oversight likely to be addressed soon,
considering the potential revenue to the line: No cocktail service
is offered anywhere on this deck. (Bars are on the lower floor and
the Sky Deck.)
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the lower level is the Galley, designed to seat about
230 passengers _ well above the vessel's capacity _ and never
crowded, given the flexible dining hours.
</P>
<P>
   Self-service buffets are featured at breakfast (with staples
including bacon, sausages, grits, fruit, cereals, made-to-order
omelets and pancakes, waffles or French toast) and lunch (a choice
of two or three hot entrees, a carving station, a salad bar with
exquisite dressings, innovative soups and cold cuts).
</P>
<P>
   Dinner menus change nightly. Passengers are offered soup or
salad and one of three entrees, including a Blue Plate Special that
reflects regional cuisine and on most evenings a dish suitable for
vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights on our October excursion included Cornish game hen,
veal piccata and a roast pork loin. While some passengers expressed
disappointment at the sparsity of beef, lamb and lobster, most were
delighted by seafood gumbo, Louisiana crab cakes, red beans and
rice, fried-shrimp po-boys and ratatouille.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the emphasis on an educational experience, the line's
chefs might enhance appreciation by printing descriptions _ even
brief histories _ of signature dishes. One passenger from Iowa was
aghast at the ``foreign material'' in her rice (it was a delectable
chicken-and-sausage jambalaya); another from California asked
whether the ``sauce'' could be removed from her crawfish touffe.
</P>
<P>
   Also advisable is more frequent use of a grill on the open deck
for hamburgers, hot dogs and barbecue as lunch-hour alternatives
when weather permits.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprague showroom, arguably the vessel's most beautiful room,
encompasses both DeSoto interior decks with its cozy balcony
overlooking the main seating area. Named after one of the most
famous stern-wheelers on the Mississippi River, this is the perfect
venue for music and dancing, even for small-scale theatrical
productions. It also can be used for meetings and lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, during the October sailing, the Sprague was underused. A
Dixieland band played as part of pre-departure christening
festivities in New Orleans, then disembarked. A solo performance by
songwriter/musician Tom Hook _ billed as ``the Riverman'' _ was
well-received.
</P>
<P>
   But the only after-dinner ``entertainment'' on back-to-back
evenings consisted of storytelling sessions focusing on the
historical Mississippi ports Natchez and Vicksburg. While enjoyable
and enlightening, these seem better suited to mornings or
midafternoons. Even the Sprague's grand player piano was mostly
silent during this excursion, though RiverBarge officials promised
regular use _ with dancing encouraged _ on subsequent trips.
</P>
<P>
   Considerable thought has gone into the land packages, all
offered as part of the basic fare. At ports where some distances
are involved (visiting battlefields in Vicksburg and diverse sites
in Memphis, for instance), group bus tours are scheduled. Free
shuttle vans are provided where appropriate. In Natchez, a more
compact destination, passengers are issued a set of coupons they
can use at their leisure to board convenient trolleys and access
antebellum homes and other landmarks. A 30-minute horse-and-buggy
tour is included.
</P>
<P>
   So is this first U.S. hotel barge destined for success, the
forerunner of a trend?
</P>
<P>
   Early reaction is positive: Several trips are sold out, some as
group charters. A millennium excursion is fully booked 14 months in
advance. Conrad already talks of launching a second vessel within
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't fit now into the locking systems of the upper
Mississippi, Tennessee, Tombigbee and Arkansas rivers,'' he says,
``so our next barge will be only 600 feet long and hold 156
guests.''
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, passengers on the October cruise were
retirees. Conrad envisions senior citizens as his primary clientele
but also hopes to lure teachers and families with children when
school isn't in session (though most kids would require more
diversions).
</P>
<P>
   It's not an inexpensive vacation: Brochure prices, based on
double occupancy, range from $740 per person for a three-night
excursion in a lower-level stateroom to $2,335 per person for
accommodations with a balcony on some eight-night trips. Those
rates do compare favorably with Delta Queen brochure prices, and
the inclusion of land tours and service charges makes them more
palatable.
</P>
<P>
   The main long-term challenge likely lies in sustaining the river
as the main lure. ``We're trying to tell a story within a certain
outline,'' Conrad says.
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell whether passenger reaction dictates that the
outline also call for a dance band, bingo and fruity drinks with
``flaming flamingos.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, just call this the anti-cruise. &QL;

A FRIENDSHIP, IN BLACK AND WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
NIGHT TALK 
By Elizabeth Cox 
St. Martin's, 288 pp., $13.95 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evie and Janey Louise grew up as friends, best friends in that
precious, almost holy way only girls of a certain age can be
friends. When they found each other, they were not quite little
girls, not yet teenagers hinting of young womanhood. Life could
still seem fresh and simple, though each already bore tender,
similar scars. Both were fatherless: Janey Louise's daddy was dead
and gone; Evie's just up and gone.
</P>
<P>
   So each filled the painful spaces in the other's life,
especially at night when they would lie in Evie's room and share
secrets as intimate as an embrace. Dreams, fears, all the things
that could busy a child's mind, unfolded in the hush of their
nights like a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a friendship often consigned to the shadows, so much
so the girls were warned not to tell anyone they even slept in the
same room _ Evie was white, Janey Louise was black, and they lived
in segregated, small-town Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Cox's uneven, yet involving ``Night Talk'' is
certainly about the resilience of Evie and Janey Louise's
friendship through four tumultuous decades. But at its core, it is
a novel about the insidious nature of the great American dilemma,
and how perceptions of race and racism can infringe on and even
threaten the most intimate relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The novel bounces between the 1950s and 1970s, when Volusia,
Janey Louise's mother, is dying of cancer. The slow decline of this
once-mighty woman beckons Evie and Janey Louise (now called Jane)
back to their hometown, the fictional Mercy, Ga., and allows Evie,
who narrates the story, to reminisce about their tinderbox
relationship. As they return home, Evie and Jane have been
estranged for three years, their friendship left ragged by the
socio-political upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s. Says Evie, ``The
politics ... pulled us apart. Her friends told her not to trust me,
and mine were wary of us.'' It's a sad admission.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins in 1949 as Evie's father, August, a research
biologist handcuffed by domestic life, abandons his family. On that
night, Jane and Volusia moved in with Agnes Bell, and her children,
Evie and Tucker. Volusia has been the Bells' housekeeper for two
years, so no one looks askance at her residence with a white
family.
</P>
<P>
   These are the years before the landmark Brown v. Board of
Education decision, before Rosa Parks refused to surrender her seat
on a Montogomery, Ala., bus. Mercy is a typical well-mannered,
God-fearing Southern town where Negroes are expected to know their
place or suffer the brutal consequences.
</P>
<P>
   As children, those realities constantly intrude on Evie and
Jane, and this is where Cox excels in capturing the small, but
soul-stifling indignities of racism. When the girls venture down to
the new, grand department store, a woman points at Jane, and scolds
Evie, ``You know good and well you're not supposed to bring her in
here,'' before Jane runs out the door. At the movies, Jane, forced
to sit in the segregated section, sneaks down from the balcony to
sit with Evie. She crawls under the seats, soiling and ripping her
dress, to get a better view of her favorite star, Rita Hayworth.
</P>
<P>
   Jane endures these outrages quietly, and perhaps because of
this, Evie, as a child, does not consider how damaging these
incidents are to her friend. Racism begins in the gut, then settles
deeply into the bones, becoming a daily part of life, which Evie
accepts as the natural order of things. Even when Evie writes to
her father after seeing a photograph of Jane's daddy, she describes
him as ``a handsome man, even though he is colored.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox handles these sections with certainty and sincerity. But the
book later suffers wobbly moments, especially after one of the
friends is arrested for murder the day of Volusia's funeral. It's a
dramatic device to push the women to overlook their differences,
but it's too much like a daytime soap opera, with life-altering
revelations delivered in long-sealed envelopes. Another problem is
Volusia, who seems as if plucked from 1930s central casting. Less a
character than a symbol, she's the quintessential hat-making,
home-cooking, storytelling, long-suffering negress, like Louise
Beavers in ``Imitation of Life,'' but with a dash more sass and
bite. And the shifts between the past and present, sometimes within
the same chapter, are at times confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cox is an graceful writer who confronts a difficult
issue, and handles it with pathos and recognition. There may always
be things white people will never truly understand, and hard, hurt
places where black people will never permit them to go. Yet for
those willing, there is much to savor and learn from all that is
sweet and sustaining between us.

SAVE THE EARTH WHILE TRAVELING IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I did a double take the first time I saw the message in a hotel
bathroom in British Columbia several years back.
</P>
<P>
   It read: ``Please rehang towels for use a second day; only
towels left on the floor or in the tub will be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the skeptic, I turned to the co-pilot and said, ``These
people are just trying to save money on housekeeping and
towel-washing.''
</P>
<P>
   And I was right. Well, half-right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working together to protect our environment is a win-win
situation for the traveler and those in the industry,'' says
Patricia Griffin, founder and president of the Houston-based
`Green' Hotels Association, whose worldwide membership has grown to
150 properties in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's mandate is to appeal to the ecological conscience of
hoteliers and their guests. Implementing water-saving measures,
using energy-saving techniques and reducing solid waste can indeed
stretch the budget of a hotel or any other travel-service provider.
Beyond that, Griffin says, these programs help ``save our planet.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking steps &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The concept is growing in scope and popularity. Many hotels now
ask guests to consider using towels and bed linens more than once.
Liquid soap and shampoo dispensers replace paper-wrapped bars and
miniature bottles. Recycling bins stand adjacent to trash cans.
Strategically placed reminders encourage guests to avoid excessive
use of electricity. Drinking water often is served by request only
in hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   On the new River Explorer barge, every passenger is provided a
mug and encouraged (though not required) to carry and use it
throughout the vessel in an effort to reduce paper waste. Crew
members will gladly wash the mug at any time or place.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to most traditional cruise ships, which
heavily promote twice-daily replacement of towels and washcloths as
part of routine ``pampering,'' towels and linens aboard the River
Explorer are changed every other day unless a passenger requests
more frequent service.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, too, that most travelers at sea would embrace _ or
at least accept _ environment-protection measures just as they do
on land. We relish being pampered while on vacation or at the end
of a long business day, but we try not to leave our common-sense
values at home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some hesitation &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Griffin concedes that innkeepers were sensitive when first
approached with ideas such as placing towel- and sheet-changing
request cards in rooms. ``Hotel managers feared insulting even one
guest,'' Griffin says. ``Now some hotels estimate that 70 to 90
percent of their guests participate (in agreeing to reuse towels
and linens).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most travelers recognize the importance of helping preserve
the environment. Very few people go to a hotel because of the hotel
itself; they go because of a beach or the water or a park _ because
of the beauty of a destination. A hotel's efforts can help protect
this for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by public response, some hotels and other establishments
have expanded their ``green'' programs. Griffin cites a Toronto
hotel that recycles stained tablecloths into napkins, chef's aprons
and neckties. A Wisconsin bed-and-breakfast installed a blue tile
floor made from recycled automobile windshields. Other hotels make
cloth laundry bags from retired sheets. A Florida hotel bought a
mulcher to chop up its garden clippings and create its own mulch.
(The mulcher paid for itself in three months).
</P>
<P>
   Reducing paper use is a common objective: Coins or chips are
gaining popularity as an alternative to paper receipts for car
parking and coat checking. Restaurants, banquet facilities and even
some room-service operations are eschewing individual packets and
instead using pourers for sugar, pitchers for cream and small
serving dishes for butter, jellies and other condiments.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's association also promotes (and sells to hotels) a
toilet-tank fill diverter that saves } of a gallon of water per
flush, is invisible to the guest, doesn't affect the flush and
costs less than $1.
</P>
<P>
   Even with so much progress in the industry, Griffin says, the
traveling public must stand at the forefront of
environmental-protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
   So what can we do? Among initiatives Griffin recommends:
</P>
<P>
   Spend travel dollars with businesses interested in protecting
destinations. Encourage the adoption and expansion of ``green''
programs. Express your support by writing a note or speaking
directly to the management of a hotel, tour company, cruise line or
airline.
</P>
<P>
   Use hotel vans, buses and local transit systems to reduce
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Use electronic ticketing for air travel to reduce paper use.
</P>
<P>
   At visitor centers, take only brochures or maps necessary for
planning or enjoying a trip. Return others to the brochure stand.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid disposable cameras. And buy rolls of film with 36 shots
rather than 12 or 24; it helps reduce packaging waste and is
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Use zippable plastic bags for cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of buying small toothpaste tubes, squeeze some
toothpaste into a clean contact-lens case or contact-lens cleaning
capsule. These also are handy for carrying salves or pills (but
make sure you mark them appropriately).
</P>
<P>
   Reduce the amount of water you use for bathing or showering in
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Leave unused bottles of amenities in hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>

SUMMER PHLOX GROWS WELL IN A WELL-DRAINING SOIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a `Robert Poore' phlox. How do I care for it?
</P>
<P>
   I have a ``Dracaena marginata'' that grew tall and spindly
indoors. I moved it outdoors last spring, and it has put on several
shoots near the bottom. Can I cut off the top and root it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The phlox you have is a summer-flowering perennial, ``Phlox
paniculata'' `Robert Poore.' Summer phlox are taller than the
spring-flowering Louisiana phlox and are generally in the 3- to
5-foot range. However, I've read that `Robert Poore' can grow even
taller.
</P>
<P>
   The fragrant flowers of summer phlox come in large, dome-shaped
clusters. Your variety is a bright pink, and there are also white,
lavender, rose and red varieties. Some have a contrasting eye.
</P>
<P>
   Summer phlox likes sun or partial sun and an organically
enriched, well-draining soil. Powdery mildew can be a problem with
some varieties, so it's wise to provide good air circulation by not
crowding plants. `Robert Poore' is touted as disease-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   You can remove the top of a leggy dracaena cane, treat the cut
end with a rooting hormone and plant in a well-draining potting
compost. You also can cut 2- to 3-inch pieces of stem and root them
similarly. Cuttings will root more quickly in a humid atmosphere,
but do not overwater the soil. Ideal temperature is 70-75 degrees.
Keep in bright, but not direct, sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Q: I would like information on planting potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can plant potatoes two weeks before to two weeks after
the average last freeze date, Feb. 14. Or you can plant 12 to 14
weeks before the average date of our first frost, Dec. 11. Potatoes
need to mature in a cool soil.
</P>
<P>
   If you find seed potatoes in time for fall planting, plant 3 to
4 inches deep in a compost-enriched, slightly acidic soil. When you
see about 6 inches of top growth, rake the soil over the plant,
leaving only an inch of growth exposed. Repeat this process weeks
later when you again see 6 inches of growth. Harvest time varies,
from 85 to more than 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   Since grocery-store potatoes have been treated to prevent
sprouting while in storage, they usually don't sprout in the
ground. You can buy seed potatoes from catalogs or save small
potatoes from spring crops, a common practice because locating seed
potatoes in time for fall planting can be difficult. Sometimes,
however, spring potatoes don't sprout due to a natural dormancy.
One way to break this dormancy is to harvest the spring potatoes
and store in an area where temperatures are in the 50-degree range
up to a month before fall planting time. Then keep the potatoes at
normal temperatures until you're ready to plant.
</P>
<P>
   Plant the small seed potatoes whole.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest time varies from 75 to more than 100 days. Usually the
plants begin to yellow when it's time to harvest the tubers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am always looking for new plants, especially hummingbird
plants. What can you tell me about ``Zauschneria californica'' and
``Z. cana?'' Common name is California fuchsia, but it is not a
true fuchsia.
</P>
<P>
   Many books that list hummingbird plants accent flowers for more
northern and eastern areas and often omit some of the great ones we
can grow. I'm thinking of three clerodendrums, shrimp plant,
hamelia and ``Odontonema strictum.''
</P>
<P>
   A: I have read that the California fuchsia, or hummingbird
flower, is a summer-fall bloomer with trumpet-shaped orange to red
flowers that attract the small birds. There are white and pink
forms. The plants spread by underground stems as they colonize.
</P>
<P>
   I have not seen this plant here nor ``Z. cana,'' which is denser
and has more silver in its leaves. But the other plants you mention
occasionally are available in the Houston area. They are excellent
garden choices to draw butterflies and hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   We've mentioned each at various times in this column. The
clerodendrums are underused here. Your list included ``C.
speciossisimum,'' ``C. paniculatum'' and ``C. fragrans,'' and I
would like to add ``C. ugandense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``C. speciossisimum,'' or Java glorybower, has 12- to 18-inch
pyramidal flower clusters of intense red blooms and large, velvety
leaves. This old-fashioned, easy plant can grow more than 10 feet
tall. It tolerates pruning if you want a shorter shrub. Protect
with mulch in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``C. paniculatum,'' or pagoda glorybower, matures to 4 to 5
feet, has rounded or oval foliage to 16 inches long and 12-inch
pyramidal clusters of small scarlet blooms. Protect in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``C. fragrens pleniflorum'' is a shrub that spreads by suckers,
is up to 8 feet tall and has 10-inch leaves and clusters of double,
pale pink blooms. The fragrant flowers resemble those of a florist
hydrangea. ``C. bungei'' has the same, oval leaves with toothed
edges, dark green on top, rusty beneath and clusters of rosy-red
blooms. The latter is the familiar, old-fashioned shrub known as
cashmere bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``C. ugandense,'' or blue butterfly bush, is a leggy shrub that
accepts pruning to encourage bushier growth. It has glossy, 4-inch
leaves and beautiful 1-inch blooms with one violet-blue petal and
four pale blue petals for many months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Firespike (Odontonema) is a shade-tolerant perennial that
produces spikes of waxy, deep-red blooms in fall. This plant is
easy to grow and is more readily available now. Hamelia and shrimp
plant are even easier to locate.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, more books are being written for our growing area.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've had a blue skyflower bush (``Duranta plumeri'') in my
garden for two years. The bush is very healthy, but it has never
bloomed. Any advice?
</P>
<P>
   A: If your plant is getting a good amount of sun, I imagine it
will bloom eventually. Sometimes plants are a little on the
obstinate side about flowering and just take their time. Since it
is healthy and growing, hold off on any nitrogen, as it may have
been growing at the expense of flowering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duranta plumeri'' is synonymous with ``Duranta repens.''
Common names include golden dewdrop (because of the small golden
berries that follow the blue blooms) and blue skyflower. These
graceful shrubs have arching branches. Protect during hard freezes
with a heavy layer of mulch. Prune any dead wood in early spring
before new growth begins.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: My bougainvillea survived last winter because the weather was
so mild, so now it is huge. It is outgrowing the trellis. Do I
prune it back? At what time of the year? Will trimming encourage it
to bloom?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since your plant has made it through a winter or two, it may
be root-hardy if planted in the ground. A heavy blanket of mulch
will help protect it in cold weather. You can prune bougainvillea
to shape or direct the growth during the growing season. You also
can prune after flowering. You might nip branches that are in the
way now, but any heavy pruning will encourage growth that will be
more vulnerable should we have an early frost. So try to live with
the plant pretty much as it is now, then prune hard early next
spring when we're out of danger of a freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Should top growth be damaged during a freeze, leave all or at
least a good deal of dead wood until we're out of the danger of
frost. This protects live or green wood farther down the branch and
closer to the base of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Those gardeners with container-grown bougainvillea sometimes
prune long stems for easier storage in a garage or sheltered area
in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Use a high-potash fertilizer, such as a hibiscus fertilizer, to
encourage color. A tablespoon every three to four weeks is
adequate. A tablespoon of Epsom salts when you fertilize also is
beneficial. Stop fertilizing during late fall and winter. Water
only when you see a slight wilt.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Some bougainvillea varieties bloom best in fall when
nights are long and days are short.

<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Godzilla''  &LR; _ The lead-footed remake of the
cheesy Japanese original features superior technology and little
else. Humorless and dull. The performances are as mechanical as the
monster. The only redeeming quality is that the failure of
``Godzilla'' to generate profits on the big screen temporarily
might slow down Hollywood's rush to remake high-tech trash.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Wild Man Blues'' &LR;  _ I always thought Woody Allen, in spite of
his so-called personal life choices, was a pretty smart guy. But,
after watching Barbara Kopple's nonfiction account of Allen's jazz
band's European tour, you start to wonder. While Allen the film
director is a control freak, in his private life he's humiliated in
one excruciating sequence by his mother. Allen is seen as a grown
man desperately seeking the approval of his distant mother. No
wonder his episode of ``New York Stories'' was titled ``Oedipus
Wrecks.'' His wife, Soon Yi Previn, seems to take particular
delight in stating she's never seen ``Annie Hall.'' No wonder he's
got the blues.

 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The idea that professional athletes and dancers should
have doctors who specialize in injuries common to their vocation is
not exactly radical. Athletes use their muscles to the extreme,
often leading to painful conditions that most people, thankfully,
never experience.
</P>
<P>
   But what about musicians, such as the classical pianist who
practices etudes and arpeggios up to 15 hours a day, or the rock
guitarist running pentatonic scales six hours in a row? Besides the
damage to these players' social lives, couldn't there also be a
nearly athletic muscular strain born of such continuous physical
demands?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael E. Charness, associate chief of neurology at Brigham
and Women's Hospital and associate professor of neurology at
Harvard University Medical School, believes the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Charness, director of Brigham and Women's ``performing arts
clinic,'' is one of a handful of doctors in that narrow medical
specialty. In addition to the Wednesday clinic at the hospital, he
also runs a musicians-only clinic on Saturdays at the New England
Conservatory. Only one other local doctor shares Charness's beat:
Fred Hochberg at Massachusetts General Hospital, who also
specializes in brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Charness, a classical pianist, said, ``I've seen a lot of
musicians who go to doctors with their problems, just to be told
it's all in their head. Or they are told to stop playing their
instrument. You can't tell musicians that.''
</P>
<P>
   Charness's patients _ Boston Symphony Orchestra musicians,
Boston Pops players, and Berklee College professors among them _
say he understands them. Many of them will not talk about their
injuries on the record because, they say, being an injured musician
is taboo in competitive musical circles, where the credo ``no pain
no gain'' dominates, and any weakness is ammunition for your
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   But Conservatory graduate Karen Choo, a 24-year-old vioinist
with ulnar nerve problems, was happy to share her thoughts on the
doctor at a recent post-operative appointment. She makes her
living, for the time being, as an economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first when I got the pain, I thought it was just because
... my technique wasn't strong anymore,'' she said as she exercised
her fingers with a rubber band ``gymnasium.'' ``I felt relieved to
know that it was actually a physical problem, and to know that
there was something I could do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charness should know. He's had the same operation Choo had, for
musical injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to practicing medicine and being a research
scientist in the field of fetal alcohol syndrome, Charness has
played piano since he was 9. He's married to a professional flute
player, and their three children are all musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a neurologist, I'm a scientist, I'm a dad, I'm a
musician,'' Charness says with a smile. ``I feel privileged to be
all of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from McGill University and Johns Hopkins
University Medical School, Charness did his first residency at
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took his second residency at the University of
California at San Francisco. While working there, friends told him
he had to meet a flutist named Deborah Nathan, from New York City,
who they thought was a perfect match for him. Not only did she
share his passion for classical music, they said, but the fact that
her father, David G. Nathan, was a noted doctor _ and now president
of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute _ was a plus.
</P>
<P>
   Charness flew to New York to meet this person, and within seven
hours, the two were engaged. The moment of knowing came, he says,
when they played Mozart sonatas together. ``She auditioned me,'' he
jokes. ``I passed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was a great guy right away,'' said Deborah Charness,
who now performs with several local groups and teaches out of her
home studio in Newton. ``But the problem for me as a professional
musician would have been marrying an amateur musician. If he was
not good, and wanted to come home and play with me, it would have
been unbearable. But Michael was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Charness said he struggled to keep up with his
wife-to-be. Six weeks after they met, they performed publicly
together, at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And all the extra practicing was taking a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to have trouble playing,'' Charness says. ``I'd had a
little bit already, but it got worse. I was developing a problem
with coordination in my hands, first one, then the other. If I
wasn't a musician, I would never have known that I had a problem at
all, because it was not immediately apparent. I began to pay a lot
of attention to it. I was very interested in the fact that a person
could be so disabled, and yet appear normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Charness shared his concerns with a friend and violinist who
also was a doctor. He told Charness the problem was a pinched nerve
in the elbow, and suggested surgery to decompress the ulnar nerve
(funny bone). In August of 1984, Charness, who was then doing a
postgraduate fellowship in science at UC-San Francisco, had the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was done in an hour, with local anesthesia, and I went back
to work the next day,'' he says. ``I improved gradually.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Charness's improvement spread by word of mouth among his
musician friends, he says. And one by one, they began to come to
him with their particular pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seeing them as patients, but it wasn't like it is now. I
would see them in the back of the science lab, after-hours. When I
started looking at these problems, I didn't have any more expertise
than anyone else. But I did know that you could have very important
problems as a musician without having a lot wrong with you in
obvious ways.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 Charness relocated to Boston, where he had been hired as
chief of neurology at the Veterans Administration Hospital in West
Roxbury, a post he still holds.
</P>
<P>
   And in Boston, as in California, musician friends soon began to
seek his advice. In the insular world of classical musicians, word
spread quickly, and patients began to come here from Europe,
Canada, and across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Charness's practice at the Brigham is full, and limited _
to musicians only. His patients have constant access to him via
e-mail, which he checks continuously on his laptop, responding
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   And there's plenty of work. So much work, in fact, that he has
been able to keep a team of physical therapists and surgeons quite
happy with his referrals. Regina Campbell, owner and clinician at
Performing Arts Physical and Occupational Therapy, said her
business has grown substantially because of Charness's patients,
and that 95 percent of her patients are musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dr. Charness's musicianship has allowed him to
interface with musicians in a special way,'' said Campbell. ``He
understands them. He knows what they're talking about, knows the
instruments, the posture, the technique. He knows what it's like to
play too much, and he knows how to fix it.''

THE DARK DAYS OF A PAINTER OF BRILLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henri Matisse, painter of warmth and light, was born near the
bleak beet fields of northern France, not far from the Belgian
border, in the same region that had produced Vincent Van Gogh. We
think of them as opposites, of Van Gogh as the quintessential
tortured soul, of Matisse as transmitter of joy and voluptuousness.
Their lives must surely have been equally opposed, no?
</P>
<P>
   No. In her majestic biography that tracks Matisse from his birth
in 1869 to 1908, by which time he'd painted ``The Joy of Life,''
one of the key works of a career that stretched until his death in
1954, Hilary Spurling spins a tale of poverty, rejection, and
despair. Thank goodness, it's also a tale of determination: Without
that, Matisse might have bowed to parental pressure and remained a
law clerk in a provincial town. Or he might have stuck with an
early and somewhat successful formula, one that led to a friend
calling him ``a delicate painter, master of the arts of grey.'' The
style for which Matisse would become famous pitted pink against
orange, blue against green; his high-key colors sing. If ever there
were a painter not ultimately identified with gray, it was Henri
Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   A sickly youth, he was a 20-year-old lying in a hospital bed
when his mother brought him a paint box to pass the time. ``From
the moment I held the box of colors in my hand, I knew this was my
life,'' he later said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history _ but one skimpily recorded until Spurling
came along. There's no shortage of books on Matisse, of course, one
of the most picked-over painters of all time, but most are art
historical or straight hagiography. Spurling sets out to offer an
exhaustive look at the minutiae of the first half of Matisse's life
and place him in the context of a world in political as well as
artistic tumult. As Matisse arrived on the scene, Impressionism's
revolution had already ripped apart the French art world, which had
been as tightly ruled by an entrenched bureaucracy as the
government itself.
</P>
<P>
   It was a political scandal, the ``Humbert Affair'' _ worse than
Watergate and Monica rolled into one _ that almost killed Matisse's
career early on. The Humberts, at the zenith of financial and
political power in France, were also found to be at the center of a
world-class scam that rocked the nation and threatened its banking
system. And the Humberts' chief lieutenants were Matisse's in-laws,
on whom Matisse and his devoted wife had depended utterly.
</P>
<P>
   What little work Matisse was able to produce during that
1902-'03 crisis, when he was primarily involved in damage control _
dealing with lawyers, jailers and an intrusive press _ has been
labelled his ``dark period,'' a retreat to the somber palette of
Flemish painting. ``Matisse scholars have put the change down to
native prudence, failure of nerve, an innately bourgeois instinct
to retrench,'' Spurling writes. She argues convincingly that
Matisse didn't merely get cold feet, that the shift was the result
of cataclysm in his personal life and extreme financial hardship.
Suddenly, he was the sole support of a wife, three young children,
and his in-laws, who were found innocent of any wrongdoing in the
Humbert mess but were ruined nonetheless. During this period,
Matisse had to paint what collectors would buy. The Humbert affair,
which the authorities covered up for the better part of a century,
also explains Matisse's reputation for being cold-hearted and
mean-spirited, Spurling contends: It made him secretive and wary of
others.
</P>
<P>
   The minute he could, Matisse stopped painting for the market.
The dealer Ambroise Vollard wanted him to paint more of the same.
Matisse even had more of the same _ which he deliberately
destroyed, although ``the hands of the butcher and the baker were
outstretched waiting for the money,'' he later recalled. He set his
wife and daughter to scrubbing and scraping the offending canvases,
which were too expensive to destroy, canvases on which he'd paint
his authentic work.
</P>
<P>
   By pawning his wife's emerald ring _ with her permission _ he
scraped together the cash to buy Cezanne's ``Three Bathers,'' a
painting he felt he had to confront on a daily basis. Spurling
writes that ``Matisse absorbed Cezanne _ as he said Cezanne himself
had absorbed Poussin _ into his bloodstream at so deep a level
that, though the underlying relationship is unmistakable, it is
hard to pinpoint any specific visual resemblance.''
</P>
<P>
   What he learned from contemplating his Cezanne each morning was
at least as important as what he got from the various academies and
ateliers where he studied. One of the book's dominant themes is the
struggle to find a mentor, a master sufficiently secure not to
demand that his pupils ape his style. Gustave Moreau, Symbolist and
recluse, came closest for Matisse, who also spent long days copying
masters including Chardin in the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more fascinating aspects of Spurling's book is its
descriptions of the interactions among painters, their
conversations on canvas and off, which put paid to the stereotype
of the artist working in isolation. Spurling tells you more than
you may want to know about artists unknown to all but scholars, but
manages to interest you in how Matisse finally pulled away from the
pack. By the time the book ends, painting in Paris is basically a
two-man race between Matisse and Picasso. A dialogue and also a
duel, Spurling calls it, describing how the two goaded each other
on, competing, for instance, in assimilating the African art that
deeply affected them both.
</P>
<P>
   Matisse was consumed by color that had a life of its own, and
ridiculed by most for paintings like the portrait of his
long-suffering wife with a green stripe down the middle of her
face. For his dazzling color he was labelled ``Fauve'' _ ``wild
beast.'' But after more than a decade of public contempt,
perceptive people came around. Spurling's sentence ``The buyers
were two Americans, a brother and sister, Leo and Gertrude Stein,''
makes you want to stand up and cheer. Sarah Stein, a Stein by
marriage, was an even greater supporter: She converted the
legendary art historian Bernard Berenson to Matisse's cause, and
convinced her friends back home in San Francisco to buy Matisses,
too, which accounts for that city's wealth of work by the artist.
Sergei Ivanovich Shchukin, the Russian textile magnate, became
another great Matisse collector, but his canvases ``spent the
central decades of the 20th century shut up in a Soviet cellar,''
Spurling writes. (She avoids the current debate over their fate in
Russia, where the government now proudly flaunts them, refusing
restitution to the Shchukin heirs.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unknown Matisse'' does just what Volume 1 of a biography
should do _ it makes you eager for Volume 2, which, according to
Spurling's publisher, is years down the road. But this lengthy
first installment leaves Matisse at a good moment in his career,
finally able to provide a proper home for the children he'd had to
parcel out to relatives better able to care for them, finally
supported by a loyal little band of collectors. Spurling makes you
feel confident about Matisse's future _ the way Matisse, just shy
of 40, was starting to feel about himself.

   &UR; PET NAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bernie was invited to his friend's home for dinner. Morris, the
host, preceded every request to his wife by endearing terms,
calling her Honey, My Love, Darling, Sweetheart, Pumpkin, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie looked at Morris and remarked, `That is really nice, that
after all these years that you have been married, you keep calling
your wife those pet names.`
</P>
<P>
   Morris hung his head and whispered,` To tell the truth, I forgot
her name three years ago.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERFECT HEARING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An elderly gentleman had serious hearing problems for a number
of years. He went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him
fitted for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear
100%.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the
doctor said, `Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be really
pleased that you can hear again.`
</P>
<P>
   The gentleman replied, `Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just
sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will
three times!`

   My friend Julie Morganstern gave me a 6-inch-high chubby ceramic
Chinese ``lucky cat'' for my birthday. It came with printed
instructions to put the cat in my shop window or at the entrance to
my house. Since I work out of my 30th-floor apartment, I decided to
glue the cat outside my door.
</P>
<P>
   It has since been a conversation starter, eliciting such
questions as ``Why do you have a cat outside your entry instead of
a mezuza?'' My answer: ``Because I'm not Jewish.'' (Of course, I'm
not Chinese either, but never mind.)
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I opened the door to get the Sunday paper and found a
2-inch-high miniature clone of my lucky cat sitting alongside the
original. I laughed out loud for at least five minutes. The next
Sunday, another clone appeared. I've asked several people if they
are responsible for my cat having kittens, and none of them seem to
know anything about it. To date, I've received four little kittens
that have added a tremendous amount of delight and charm to my
life.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like my lucky cat really does bring good fortune. I wonder
what will be outside my door today.

   Four-year-old Rebecca was told by her mother, Sharon Edelstein,
that she would get hurt if she continued bouncing on her bed. ``I
won't get hurt,'' Rebecca said, and continued bouncing. Her mother
repeated the warning and added that she might also break the bed.
``No, I won't,'' Rebecca insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother gave up. ``Fine,'' she said. ``Do it. You'll have to
live with the consequences.'' Rebecca immediately stopped bouncing.
``I don't want to go and live with them, Mommy,'' she said. ``I
don't even know the Consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her 90th birthday, Lillian Susskind asked her
daughter, Henny Weiss, to accompany her to her favorite store to
replenish her wardrobe. Cane in hand, she cheerfully selected and
tried on several outfits. When the time came to pay, she placed her
cane on the counter, freeing her hands to find the correct amount
of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Elated by her fabulous bargains, she took her shopping bags and
marched proudly toward the exit, forgetting her cane. An astonished
cashier, cane in hand, ran after her, shouting ``Madam, this is
Loehmann's, not Lourdes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Avenue bus was headed downtown when a gray-haired
woman got on with a young man in his late teens, possibly her
grandson. He hesitated a moment, apparently uncertain about the
correct procedure of swiping his Metrocard, and she set him
straight.
</P>
<P>
   He then started to take one of the seats in the front, when she
reminded him that those seats were reserved for the elderly.
``Well, you are one,'' he said. ``Don't be silly,'' she replied as
she guided him toward the back of the bus. ``I'm only 76.''
</P>
<P>
   _ SAMI I. SAID
</P>
<P>
   Mary M. Wheelwright was recently reminded of a hobby she had as
a little girl growing up in Manhattan. She went through a stage of
being entranced by what she considered the fascinating and exotic
names of taxi drivers. She would read them, write them down and
carefully save them.
</P>
<P>
   After a year or so, beaming with pride, she presented the list
to her parents. She couldn't understand why they looked at each
other and seemed to be having a hard time stifling laughter. They
didn't enlighten her until some years later. Her list was titled
``Taxi Drivers I Have Had.'' As Ms. Wheelwright says, ``Ah
innocence!''
</P>
<P>
   A young supermarket clerk was stocking shelves as Liz Miller
wandered in vain, looking for peanuts. ``Where are the nuts?'' she
finally asked. ``Up and down every aisle, lady,'' he replied. ``Up
and down every aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   I went to the bank last week to deposit a check into my savings
account and noticed that the bank was having a promotion. If you
opened a savings account with $500 or more, the bank would give you
a limited-edition Yankee baseball. My husband and brother are
die-hard fans, so I thought this would be a great gift for one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   I told the teller I did not want to open a new account, but I
would like a baseball. She sent me to customer service, where I
asked to speak to the manager. I was told I'd have to open a new
account to get a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I was then sent to another customer representative who went into
the office of a vice president to consult. He obviously told her
the same thing the manager told me.
</P>
<P>
   I said, fine, close the account I have now (which I've had for
more than 20 years) and open a new one. I also told her that there
were three customers waiting to open new accounts, and that I could
not believe that she was going to waste 20 or 30 minutes on
paperwork and get no new money. She had to do it that way, she
said. The vice president had instructed her, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later I walked out of the bank with my new
account and Yankee baseball. Maybe next week I'll go back for the
Yankee cap promotion.

   Jamie deRoy lives on an upper floor of a building undergoing
repairs to the facade. Recently, she stepped out of the shower and,
naked, walked into her bedroom where her cat was sitting at the
open window. She began opening a clothes drawer when she heard a
man say, ``You are so cute.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned around to find that one of the repair men was working
outside her window. What was the appropriate reaction, she wondered
_ shock or disappointment? He was talking to her cat.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a cell phone, what's the next best thing?
Tracey Zabar saw a little girl reach into a shopping bag, pull out
a wedge of cheese, hold it to her ear and start chatting.

<P>
   Carmel Quinn, who some years ago was a fixture on Arthur
Godfrey's television and radio programs, was browsing with a friend
at a Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore when a woman approached her. ``Excuse
me,'' the woman said, ``I couldn't help hearing you speaking to
your friend. You sound just like Carmel Quinn, and you look like
her, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Carmel Quinn,'' Ms. Quinn replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' the woman replied. ``You can't be. I'd know her if I
saw her.''

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, President Clinton said that the Mideast peace
accord with Arafat and Netanyahu has helped him with his own
personal growth. The President went on to say, 'It's the first time
I've ever been part of a non-sexual threesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier tonight, Frank Gifford took calls for one hour on
'Larry King Live.' Unfortunately, most of the calls were from
Kathie Lee trying to make sure Frank was really there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA is making final preparations to the Space Shuttle for
John Glenn's historic return to space. Today, they put a bumper
sticker on the shuttle that says, 'Ask me about my
grandchildren.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a recent interview, Woody Allen said that Mia Farrow is an
unfit mother to her adopted children. Woody went on to say, 'As far
as I know, she's not interested in dating any of them.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night in an interview, Frank Gifford said his
extra-marital affair was the most stupid thing he ever got involved
with. Which coincidentally is the same toast he made at his
wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a recent interview, David Duchovny said he likes
pornography. You can read the entire interview in this month's
issue of 'Alien Jugs.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Hillary Clinton attended a luncheon with 125 gay
and lesbian activists. Hillary said, 'It was fantastic. It's the
first time I've been in a room full of people who haven't had sex
with my husband.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the FAA announced that due to possible side
effects, pilots should not take Viagra before flying. The FAA said
passengers should be concerned if the pilot comes on the intercom
and says, 'We'll be flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet, six
inches.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today in Cape Canaveral, Fla., the Space Shuttle Discovery
blasted off, taking John Glenn on his historic return to space.
There was one glitch -- when the countdown got to T minus 20, Glenn
yelled out 'Bingo!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``John Glenn went back into space today and just before he left,
he said it's really exciting achieving weightlessness. Which
coincidentally is the same thing Calista Flockhart says.'' ``Before
John Glenn's historic launch in 1962, NASA said to him 'Godspeed
John Glenn.' They struggled with what to say this time but finally
they came up with 'Hang onto your ass, grandpa, here we go.'''

   SCI-SLEEP-DEPRIVATION (Undated) _ Depending on what the FDA

   SCI-ZOO-NATURE (Undated) _ Sometime in mid-December, Timmy and
Dan, two silverback male gorillas, and their respective troops will

   Bernie was invited to his friend's home for dinner. Morris, the
host, preceded every request to his wife by endearing terms,
calling her Honey, My Love, Darling, Sweetheart, Pumpkin, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie looked at Morris and remarked, `That is really nice, that

   &UR; PERFECT HEARING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An elderly gentleman had serious hearing problems for a number
of years. He went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him
fitted for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear
100%.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the
doctor said, `Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be really
pleased that you can hear again.`
</P>
<P>
   The gentleman replied, `Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just
sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will
three times!`

   My friend Julie Morganstern gave me a 6-inch-high chubby ceramic
Chinese ``lucky cat'' for my birthday. It came with printed
instructions to put the cat in my shop window or at the entrance to
my house. Since I work out of my 30th-floor apartment, I decided to
glue the cat outside my door.
</P>
<P>
   It has since been a conversation starter, eliciting such
questions as ``Why do you have a cat outside your entry instead of
a mezuza?'' My answer: ``Because I'm not Jewish.'' (Of course, I'm
not Chinese either, but never mind.)
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I opened the door to get the Sunday paper and found a
2-inch-high miniature clone of my lucky cat sitting alongside the
original. I laughed out loud for at least five minutes. The next
Sunday, another clone appeared. I've asked several people if they
are responsible for my cat having kittens, and none of them seem to
know anything about it. To date, I've received four little kittens
that have added a tremendous amount of delight and charm to my
life.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like my lucky cat really does bring good fortune. I wonder
what will be outside my door today.

   Four-year-old Rebecca was told by her mother, Sharon Edelstein,
that she would get hurt if she continued bouncing on her bed. ``I
won't get hurt,'' Rebecca said, and continued bouncing. Her mother
repeated the warning and added that she might also break the bed.
``No, I won't,'' Rebecca insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother gave up. ``Fine,'' she said. ``Do it. You'll have to
live with the consequences.'' Rebecca immediately stopped bouncing.
``I don't want to go and live with them, Mommy,'' she said. ``I
don't even know the Consequences.''
</P>

   Shortly after her 90th birthday, Lillian Susskind asked her
daughter, Henny Weiss, to accompany her to her favorite store to
replenish her wardrobe. Cane in hand, she cheerfully selected and
tried on several outfits. When the time came to pay, she placed her
cane on the counter, freeing her hands to find the correct amount
of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Elated by her fabulous bargains, she took her shopping bags and
marched proudly toward the exit, forgetting her cane. An astonished
cashier, cane in hand, ran after her, shouting ``Madam, this is
Loehmann's, not Lourdes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Avenue bus was headed downtown when a gray-haired
woman got on with a young man in his late teens, possibly her
grandson. He hesitated a moment, apparently uncertain about the
correct procedure of swiping his Metrocard, and she set him
straight.
</P>
<P>
   He then started to take one of the seats in the front, when she
reminded him that those seats were reserved for the elderly.
``Well, you are one,'' he said. ``Don't be silly,'' she replied as
she guided him toward the back of the bus. ``I'm only 76.''

   _ SAMI I. SAID
</P>
<P>
   Mary M. Wheelwright was recently reminded of a hobby she had as
a little girl growing up in Manhattan. She went through a stage of
being entranced by what she considered the fascinating and exotic
names of taxi drivers. She would read them, write them down and
carefully save them.
</P>
<P>
   After a year or so, beaming with pride, she presented the list
to her parents. She couldn't understand why they looked at each
other and seemed to be having a hard time stifling laughter. They
didn't enlighten her until some years later. Her list was titled
``Taxi Drivers I Have Had.'' As Ms. Wheelwright says, ``Ah
innocence!''
</P>
<P>
   A young supermarket clerk was stocking shelves as Liz Miller
wandered in vain, looking for peanuts. ``Where are the nuts?'' she
finally asked. ``Up and down every aisle, lady,'' he replied. ``Up
and down every aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   I went to the bank last week to deposit a check into my savings
account and noticed that the bank was having a promotion. If you
opened a savings account with $500 or more, the bank would give you
a limited-edition Yankee baseball. My husband and brother are
die-hard fans, so I thought this would be a great gift for one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   I told the teller I did not want to open a new account, but I
would like a baseball. She sent me to customer service, where I
asked to speak to the manager. I was told I'd have to open a new
account to get a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I was then sent to another customer representative who went into
the office of a vice president to consult. He obviously told her
the same thing the manager told me.
</P>
<P>
   I said, fine, close the account I have now (which I've had for
more than 20 years) and open a new one. I also told her that there
were three customers waiting to open new accounts, and that I could
not believe that she was going to waste 20 or 30 minutes on
paperwork and get no new money. She had to do it that way, she
said. The vice president had instructed her, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later I walked out of the bank with my new
account and Yankee baseball. Maybe next week I'll go back for the
Yankee cap promotion.

   Jamie deRoy lives on an upper floor of a building undergoing
repairs to the facade. Recently, she stepped out of the shower and,
naked, walked into her bedroom where her cat was sitting at the
open window. She began opening a clothes drawer when she heard a
man say, ``You are so cute.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned around to find that one of the repair men was working
outside her window. What was the appropriate reaction, she wondered
_ shock or disappointment? He was talking to her cat.

   Carmel Quinn, who some years ago was a fixture on Arthur

at a Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore when a woman approached her. ``Excuse

your friend. You sound just like Carmel Quinn, and you look like
her, too.''
</P>
<P>

   Augusto Pinochet soon may be back in Chile, or free on bail in
London, having frustrated the efforts of Spanish and subsequently
French, Swiss and Swedish magistrates and citizens, as well as the
wishes of most of his countrymen, who according to recent polls
want to see the dictator tried somewhere, anywhere, for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But his arrest will still have served a purpose, beyond warming
the hearts of the thousands of friends, relatives and colleagues of
his victims _ men and women who have waited nearly a quarter of a
century for justice and solace.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its ethical and legal implications, the dictator's
detention will have revealed many of the contradictions and deeper
truths about how societies move from authoritarian to democratic
rule, and how they settle scores with a past that never should have
existed.
</P>
<P>
   Both in general and in specific reference to Chile, Pinochet's
predicament raises far more questions than answers _ questions that
years ago should have been asked in Chile and Latin America, and in
countries as dissimilar as Mexico and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called transitions to democracy in Latin America during
the 1980s, in eastern Europe in the late '80s and early '90s, as
well as in Asia and Africa, all rested on a few basic premises that
at the time seemed self-evident. Dictatorships do not just fade
away; military rulers do not simply walk into the sun when they get
bored or tired. Achieving their departure and the overall
dismantling of their regimes, as of one-party systems, implied
providing them with a way out: a safe departure, to a safe haven,
for a safe future.
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, the political golden handshake of explicit
amnesty or tacitly letting bygones be bygones was accompanied by a
willingness to know, if not to punish. Truth Commissions, Never
Again Commissions, White Books and the like were created and
supported.
</P>
<P>
   But the implicit understanding always was that the personal and
financial integrity of the dictators remain protected and that
details of their policies _ economic in some cases, geopolitical in
others _ be preserved by their democratic successors. In Chile, in
Argentina, in Uruguay, in a certain sense initially in Nicaragua
with Somoza, in South Korea, South Africa and even in some cases in
eastern Europe, this was the deal _ formal and institutionalized in
some cases, de facto in others _ that made democracy possible. It
seemed a small price to pay, a pill not too bitter to swallow, a
necessary and sufficient condition for moving on.
</P>
<P>
   But too many questions simply went unanswered. Who made the
deals? Who did the political leaders truly represent and were those
people ever truly consulted? How freely did the leaders and the led
consent to the deals and how well informed about them were the
countries' most interested parties, that is, the citizens?
</P>
<P>
   Would the arrangement withstand international and historical
scrutiny, particularly of a passionate and critical nature? How
would skeptical or frankly adverse local minorities react? Would
they be able to compromise on the understandings reached by others?
Would those agreements resist the test of time, further
investigations and new revelations? Today's situation in at least
two other countries illustrates the many pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   By now, South Africa's Truth and Amnesty Commission has released
its findings _ albeit, in the absence of all of the nation's
political parties while in the presence of tensions and discomfort
between two old friends and heroes who are true role models for
transitions everywhere: Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for today's disenchantment with the
commission's report, its very existence and premises, one fact
clearly stands out. The idea that inspired its creation and work
was that the spirit of national reconciliation guiding the shift
from apartheid to majority rule in South Africa should also prevail
in dealing with the country's past. But this is no longer as
relevant or widespread as when the commission was set up.
</P>
<P>
   What then seemed fair, prudent and tolerant, today appears
callous and cynical; what today is deemed unacceptable and
insensitive then felt cautious and moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was better to demur in asking too many questions back
when Mandela was freed, when negotiations with the white minority
were in full swing and hanging by a thread, when civil war or a
mass exodus by the white community seemed imminent. Perhaps then
was the time to formulate those doubts, rather than now, when
resentment and discontent have set in.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly for Mexico. The country is painfully, desperately,
slowly proceeding with its move toward democratic rule, and while
settling scores with the past is certainly not the most pressing
task, it is one of the most delicate ones. From the student
massacre in Tlatelocolo in 1968 to the localized ``dirty war'' of
the 1970s to the electoral fraud of the 1980s and the corruption of
the 1990s, the PRI has a great deal to answer for.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe, sincerely, that the best solution is to bury the
past, the dead and the bank accounts and move forward. Others think
that some degree of accountability and punishment is indispensable
to ensure that impunity cease being a leitmotif of Mexican
political life.
</P>
<P>
   But no one really knows the cost of each option: whether
forgiving and forgetting is possible, or if burrowing into the past
is unavoidable. The Chilean precedent confounds everyone willing to
think the matter through.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chile has left its friends and its people perplexed,
perhaps undeservedly. For the past decade, the conventional wisdom
about the country was simple. Moderation and sensibility had
prevailed, national reconciliation had been achieved, successful
economic policies had been pursued. The past decades of
revolutionary turmoil and bloody repression had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know that while Chile is a more prosperous nation than
before, it is as unequal in wealth and income distribution as ever,
and the polarization of its society is as acute as 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the country's left, and center, and sympathizers and allies,
as well as for much of international public opinion, Pinochet is
the personification of evil: The man with the dark glasses is as
bad as they come. Yet for a large minority of the population, he is
still the saviour of a nation threatened by heathen communism and
inflationary socialism.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably preferable for Chileans to have uncovered this,
and for the rest of the world to begin to grasp that dealing with
the past is a very complicated matter, and that easy solutions, as
brisk and painless as they may seem, generally do not work.
</P>
<P>
   We can thank the dictator for this, but for nothing else.

   NEW YORK _ Scott Ritter knows Iraq pretty well by now. A veteran
arms inspector for the U.N. Special Commission charged with
tracking Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, Ritter, who
recently resigned his post, was intimately involved in the U.N.
effort to keep Saddam Hussein honest.
</P>
<P>
   Over an extended period, Ritter and other inspectors worked to
break the code Saddam was using to issue instructions involving the
movement of weapons Iraq wanted to keep hidden from inspectors.
Well into this year, the cat-and-mouse game being played in Iraq
made regular headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What few know is that the U.N. inspectors, with Israeli help,
eventually broke the Iraqi code and were on the verge of a major
breakthrough in uncovering concealed weaponry. Then this summer the
inspections were halted. That's when Ritter quit his job _ out of
pure frustration, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In this conversation with David Makovsky, correspondent for
Ha'aretz, Ritter reveals how weapons were being moved around in
Iraq.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID MAKOVSKY: How did Iraq conceal weapons from UNSCOM?
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT RITTER: In April 1991, Saddam Hussein issued a
presidential directive ordering that Iraq lie to the Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency), (and that Iraq) would keep (its mass destruction)
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1991, the materials that were kept were turned over under
instruction of the president to the Special Security Organization
(SSO) and Special Republican Guard (SRG). These are presidential
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is this special organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The SSO is one of the most secretive organizations in Iraq.
It probably numbers around 5,000 people. The SRG is the military
arm that had four brigades, around 15 battalions, and is about the
size of a division _ maybe 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the special organization set up for this purpose of
concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The special organization was set up to protect the president
of Iraq. Back in the 1980s this special security organization also
had a responsibility for protecting Iraq's weapons. ... So they
have been linked from the very beginning with these weapons, but
today they have the responsibility of hiding them from the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is their job basically to conduct one big shell game?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's right, it's a shell game. Now what you're getting to
is the problem I faced. We were beating our heads against the wall
going after the shell game. We're playing their game. I said to
(then) chairman (of UNSCOM, Rolf Ekeus, that) rather than going
after the shells, let's go after the man moving the shells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why I went to Israel and started working with the
Israelis is because I believe that the methodologies that Israel
uses to hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed
to use to go after the weapons of mass destruction. So I asked
Israel to help the commission formulate analytical models,
analytical techniques and to advise on operational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I first approached (Israel) in 1994. We started working in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Israel's unique contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can just say Israel had a good reputation of being
innovative, of being capable, of being good. And we approached
Israel due to all those factors. It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by
these missiles, not New York City, and we were actually, frankly
speaking, a little dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of
enthusiasm, that emanated from Washington on this issue. The U.S.
treated it more as an academic exercise and I thought Israel
treated it as it is _ a matter of life and death. So we came to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the frustration. It was not a single source of
information. We used everything that we had available to us. And
that's why what happened in July and August (when the U.S. halted
inspections) was so frustrating. Because now that we have
identified how they're doing it, and now that we get the kind of
information we need on the timely basis we need, we're inside their
decision-making cycle. We're reacting before Iraq can react.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the concealment work?
</P>
<P>
   A: It basically works like a mafia organization. ... you have
cells. And ... the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the
Special Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These
elite organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Now they don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you
need a truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and
vehicle resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to
that Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do
something for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.

</P>
<P>
   Now they don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you
need a truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and
vehicle resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to
that Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do
something for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As the evidence has mounted against President Clinton, I
believed that he would resign in shame and in the best interests of
our country. But it is now obvious that Clinton will not
voluntarily resign.
 &HT;    Impeachment proceedings will drag on for months and preoccupy
our nation to the detriment of ourselves and the world.
 &HT;    Our attention should be focused on a global economy that is
crumbling and could melt down and on a number of unstable military
situations, from Korea to India to Pakistan to Kosovo. Aside from
the alarming international scene, domestic problems such as health
care, social security and education must be solved.
 &HT;    Our nation, which has been a source of stability and good
throughout the world, cannot be leaderless at such a crucial time _
and yet we are.
 &HT;    President Gerald Ford's recommendation that Clinton be publicly
rebuked in the well of the House of Representatives is not the
answer. It would only further diminish Clinton's effectiveness at a
time when we need a strong, respected president _ not a man whose
reputation has been totally destroyed by an embarrassing public
rebuke on the House floor.
 &HT;    By now, Clinton has been reduced to attending political
fund-raisers and making endless phone calls to friends seeking
their advice on his pitiful personal crisis.
 &HT;    More than 180 newspapers have called for Clinton to resign. Many
have editorialized that his inexcusable actions in the Oval Office
threaten to seriously erode the integrity of the nation and damage
the standards, morals and ethics of our young people.
 &HT;    History teaches us that for any free society to survive and
thrive it must rest on a strong moral and ethical base. The issue
is not, ``Did he lie under oath?'' The issue is, ``Did he lie?''
And the answer is yes.
 &HT;    Clinton has taught our children to lie. Clinton has taught our
nation that a man does not have to be faithful to his wife and
family and can repeatedly devastate them by his irresponsible
actions. Clinton has taught our students in high school and college
that anything goes in their sexual behavior.
 &HT;    No wonder at least seven Boy Scouts in Utah who won Eagle awards
for observing the oath of honor and duty to God, country and self _
the highest commendation boys age 11 to 17 can earn _ refused their
certificates with Clinton's signature as honorary president of the
Boy Scouts of America.
 &HT;    Our children learn the words of our first president, George
Washington, who said, ``I cannot tell a lie.'' Two hundred years
later we have a president, Bill Clinton, who cannot tell the truth.
 &HT;    Any person who observes Clinton's behavior _ ranging from
intelligent to clever to wildly reckless and juvenile _ can only
conclude that he is emotionally unstable. And he shows a complete
inability to learn from the ill-chosen experiences of his youth,
from promiscuity to ``experimentation'' with drugs to evading the
draft.
 &HT;    Again and again, as a married adult, he has taken advantage of
women _ whether it's Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky
or others whose names are not in the public record. He has earned
their disrespect and destroyed their lives. Any business executive,
high school principal or police chief who repeatedly lied and had
sex with an employee would be fired.
 &HT;    Why should we accept a lower standard from Clinton, who as
president is charged with life-and-death responsibilities?
 &HT;    Any member of the military who lies will be court-martialed,
without regard to whether he was under oath. Any military person
who is involved in sexual harassment or adultery will be
court-martialed.
 &HT;    Clinton, as commander in chief, surely must be held to these
same standards. He has the ability to order our precious sons and
daughters off to war to fight and die. Yet the motivation, wisdom
and rationality of his judgment are highly debatable in matters of
domestic and foreign policy.
 &HT;    Clinton has lied to the people he loves the most and he has
repeatedly devastated them _ his immediate family and closest
colleagues and friends _ and yet the pattern persists. He is
willing to inflict serious long-term damage on the Democratic
Party, our nation and millions of people throughout the world just
to stay in power.
 &HT;    As a young man campaigning for Congress in Arkansas in 1974,
Clinton repeatedly included references to President Richard Nixon's
predicament. ``I think it's plain that (Nixon) should resign and
spare the country the agony of this impeachment and removal
proceeding,'' Clinton said, according to the Arkansas Democrat on
Aug. 6, 1974. ``There's not any point now in (Nixon) putting the
country through an impeachment since he isn't making any pretense
of innocence now,'' Clinton said, according to the Little Rock
Gazette on Aug. 8, 1974.
 &HT;    After making these demands on Nixon, why doesn't Clinton hold
himself to the same standard of accountability and resign?
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't understand duty, honor, country or faith,
courage, service or truth _ and honor beyond all. He certainly does
not understand the Navy's ethic: ``When principle is involved, be
deaf to expediency.''
 &HT;    We cannot take the privileges and freedom we have in this great
nation for granted. We, the people, must be the guardians at the
gate.

 &HT;    
 By GAIL COLLINS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I covered Connecticut state government in the 1970s, and I can
still remember how wonderful the women were. I'm not really
thinking about Ella Grasso, the first
woman-elected-in-her-own-right governor. Grasso still seemed more
like a traditional pol with an extra X chromosome.
 &HT;    The women I really admired were the state legislators, those
battle-scarred survivors of charter-revision and zoning boards who
waded diligently through important but utterly unglamorous issues
like special education and ambulance regulation. They seemed
miraculously dvoid of ego.
 &HT;    Next to them, the men looked like squalling children (albeit
children who had all the real political power). I couldn't wait
until the women moved up, so they could run the whole country the
way they ran the subcommittee on inland wetlands.
 &HT;    It didn't quite work out that way. Connecticut never got another
female governor, and Rep. Barbara Kennelly, who is running this
year, trails by stomach-churning margins in the polls. There are
exactly two female elected governors in the country, Christie Todd
Whitman of New Jersey and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. (A
third, Jane Dee Hull, was elected secretary of state in Arizona and
moved up when Gov. Fife Symington was convicted of fraud.)
 &HT;    New York, which gave us a generation of female political
superstars, has turned into the hellmouth of women in politics. Liz
Holtzman, Bess Myerson, Carol Bellamy, Geraldine Ferraro, Karen
Burstein and Ruth Messinger all crashed and burned. The lucky ones
found jobs in the nonprofit world; the less fortunate wound up
sharing a defendant's table with Sukhreet Gabel's mom.
 &HT;    Just a few years ago, women had good reason to expect a steady
and inevitable progression toward gender parity in politics. In
1992, they scored an unprecedented number of victories in the
national elections, and there was genuine anticipation that some
top women would be on the presidential short list by 1996 _ or
certainly 2000.
 &HT;    But instead, the big names have almost all faded away. Ferraro's
1984 vice-presidential nomination was a high point for the women's
movement, but also the last good day in Ferraro's political career.
Ann Richards of Texas is out of politics. Whitman, once mentioned
as a likely vice-presidential nominee, had a close call last year
against a relatively weak male challenger.
 &HT;    There are nine women in the Senate, and the three freshmen up
for re-election this year - Barbara Boxer, Carol Moseley-Braun and
Patty Murray _ are all in trouble. The one given the best odds is
Murray, of Washington, who is running against another woman.
 &HT;    One reason that women are having trouble winning the top
political offices is that those are the jobs men want to keep. The
offices most accessible to women are those too cheap to be
interesting to male pols. New Hampshire, for instance, not only has
a female governor but also a legislature that's more than 30
percent female. This achievement may have something to do with the
fact that the job pays $100 a year.
 &HT;    The number of women in Congress keeps inching up, but there is
no House woman within a mile of a real leadership role. People who
remember watching Holtzman and Barbara Jordan hold forth during the
House Judiciary impeachment hearings on Richard Nixon may notice
that 20 years later the only woman in the majority party on
Judiciary is Sonny Bono's widow.
 &HT;    ``It almost looks like it could be the end of the last century,
except no one's taken our right to vote away,'' says Pat Schroeder,
the former representative.
 &HT;    Where did all that momentum go, and why? Was the Year of the
Woman just that _ one year? Every political loss is an individual
story, but if you look around, it's easy to come up with reasons
why women seem to be hitting a glass ceiling.
 The Mommy Detour  
 &HT;    Women in politics get a slow start; a study once found that male
legislators were on average 20 years younger, though the gap has
since narrowed. ``Men decide to run in two hours after someone in
the law firm says, 'You've got to run,''' says Cathy Allen, a
political consultant in Olympia, Wash. ``The average woman takes
two years to decide. She'll wait until she has the perfect campaign
manager, the right 17 endorsements, until she's gotten down to a
perfect size 10 and the kids are out of school.''
 &HT;    Mixing child rearing and Congress is tough, since constituents
themselves tend to be big babies, demanding lots of attention and
refusing to make allowances for anyone else's needs. Only one of
the four women who have given birth while in the House has stayed
on.
 &HT;    Reps. Enid Greene Waldholtz of Utah and Susan Molinari of New
York became poster people for Republican family values when in 1995
and 1996, respectively, they gave birth to daughters, but before
the babies were walking, their mothers were out of office.
 &HT;    Molinari, who was married to another House member, grew strapped
for time and money and quit. Greene Waldholtz fell into disgrace
when her husband turned out to be a con man who had illegally
financed his wife's campaign with money obtained from her father.
 Guilt by Association (With Men)  
 &HT;    A current theory holds that a woman stands an excellent chance
of making a presidential ticket in 2000 since both parties will be
looking for candidates who are guaranteed never to be caught with
an intern underneath the telephone table.
 &HT;    But the Greene Waldholtz saga is a reminder that neither gender
is immune to the pitfalls of misplaced love. (During a weepy
five-hour news conference, she denounced her husband and claimed
she knew little about the finances of her campaign and her
household, and didn't even have the access codes to the family
answering machine.)
 &HT;    Moseley-Braun of Illinois is perhaps the most endangered
incumbent senator this year, mainly because of political baggage
stemming from her association with Kgosie Matthews, her former
fiance and campaign manager.
 &HT;    Matthews has been accused of everything from misuse of campaign
funds to sexual harassment to breaking immigration laws. A former
lobbyist for Nigeria, he was presumably also the genius behind
Moseley-Braun's decision to meet with the brutal Nigerian dictator
Gen. Sani Abacha, a gaffe that has become a serious campaign issue.
 It's the Fund-Raising, Stupid  
 &HT;    The issues that women gravitate toward in politics _ day care,
education, child protection _ do not attract a lot of big donors.
Women, the champions of the neighborhood fund-raiser, would
undoubtedly benefit from a campaign-finance system in which
candidates got matching funds and were prohibited from taking huge
donations.
 &HT;    But campaign finance reform keeps receding, and some contrarians
say that Emily's List is one of the reasons. That's near-heresy:
Emily's List, a political action committee that ``bundles''
donations from backers interested in promoting Democratic women in
politics, has done more than any group to put women's campaigns on
an equal financial level with men's.
 &HT;    Still, nearly any discussion of campaign finance reform
inevitably raises the question of what such reform would do to
Emily. Bill Curry, a former adviser to President Clinton, says that
at one White House meeting, Ann Lewis, a Clinton campaign official,
laced into Curry as a ``chauvinist'' for pressing reform. ``The
Emily's List group did more to slow Clinton down on campaign
finance reform than anyone,'' Curry says.
 Left on the Left  
 &HT;    One of the most interesting factoids gleaned from a generation's
worth of survey research on women in politics is that while men
often embark on a political career to make business contacts, women
generally get into the game because they want to help.
 &HT;    ``Most women begin with community concerns, not ambition,'' says
Harriet Woods, the former president of the National Women's
Political Caucus. That impulse to help is in keeping with what
pollsters find about women voters _ they're more likely to support
social spending and activist government.
 &HT;    But perhaps as a result, while the nation in general is trending
toward the right, female candidates tend to be seen as left of
their party's center. Boxer, struggling in California to keep her
Senate seat, is viewed as more liberal than her state's voters, and
Whitman has never been able to win over the right wing that
dominates the Republican Party's organizational base.
 &HT;    Support for abortion rights, usually a plus in general
elections, often hurts Republicans in their primaries. The abortion
issue has always been a rallying point for the women-in-politics
movement, but it's also a problem. Some of the staunchest
abortion-rights advocates will admit that the issue sometimes
overshadows everything else, giving the public the idea that women
are one-note candidates.
 &HT;    ``There's this perception that women's groups are focused
entirely on choice,'' says Ruth Messinger, the recent New York
mayoral candidate. ``It's hard to get voters to understand that a
higher percentage of women means more day care and better HMOs.''
 Time to Play Rough  
 &HT;    Lately, female candidates have been hammering away at the
mom-who-cares theme so hard that it almost trivializes the jobs
they're seeking. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a former Arkansas
congresswoman who left office after having twins but is now running
for the Senate _ broadcasts commercials that show her balancing the
family checkbook.
 &HT;    Patty Murray won her Senate seat in 1992 as a ``mom in tennis
shoes''; this year, she is being marketed as a ``quietly
effective'' person who used to teach school. Stressing women's
unthreatening, nurturing side makes for good spin, but we may have
gone overboard in idealizing the nonaggressive worker bees.
 &HT;    Politics is still a struggle for power, and anybody who wants
change has to be willing to wrestle money or privilege away from
whoever has it. The point of gender equality isn't to raise women's
self-esteem, or even to pack the Education Committee with people
who love children _ the Education Committee already loves children.
 &HT;    The point is that once women hit a critical mass, large numbers
will lap over into places such as Commerce and Finance, injecting
big-bucks, hard-muscle deliberations with a larger version of
what's important in the world.

 By GAIL COLLINS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I covered Connecticut state government in the 1970s, and I can
still remember how wonderful the women were. I'm not really
thinking about Ella Grasso, the first
woman-elected-in-her-own-right governor. Grasso still seemed more
like a traditional pol with an extra X chromosome.
 &HT;    The women I really admired were the state legislators, those
battle-scarred survivors of charter-revision and zoning boards who
waded diligently through important but utterly unglamorous issues
like special education and ambulance regulation. They seemed
miraculously devoid of ego.
 &HT;    Next to them, the men looked like squalling children (albeit
children who had all the real political power). I couldn't wait
until the women moved up, so they could run the whole country the
way they ran the subcommittee on inland wetlands.
 &HT;    It didn't quite work out that way. Connecticut never got another
female governor, and Rep. Barbara Kennelly, who is running this
year, trails by stomach-churning margins in the polls. There are
exactly two female elected governors in the country, Christie Todd
Whitman of New Jersey and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. (A
third, Jane Dee Hull, was elected secretary of state in Arizona and
moved up when Gov. Fife Symington was convicted of fraud.)
 &HT;    New York, which gave us a generation of female political
superstars, has turned into the hellmouth of women in politics. Liz
Holtzman, Bess Myerson, Carol Bellamy, Geraldine Ferraro, Karen
Burstein and Ruth Messinger all crashed and burned. The lucky ones
found jobs in the nonprofit world; the less fortunate wound up
sharing a defendant's table with Sukhreet Gabel's mom.
 &HT;    Just a few years ago, women had good reason to expect a steady
and inevitable progression toward gender parity in politics. In
1992, they scored an unprecedented number of victories in the
national elections, and there was genuine anticipation that some
top women would be on the presidential short list by 1996 _ or
certainly 2000.
 &HT;    But instead, the big names have almost all faded away. Ferraro's
1984 vice-presidential nomination was a high point for the women's
movement, but also the last good day in Ferraro's political career.
Ann Richards of Texas is out of politics. Whitman, once mentioned
as a likely vice-presidential nominee, had a close call last year
against a relatively weak male challenger.
 &HT;    There are nine women in the Senate, and the three freshmen up
for re-election this year - Barbara Boxer, Carol Moseley-Braun and
Patty Murray _ are all in trouble. The one given the best odds is
Murray, of Washington, who is running against another woman.
 &HT;    One reason that women are having trouble winning the top
political offices is that those are the jobs men want to keep. The
offices most accessible to women are those too cheap to be
interesting to male pols. New Hampshire, for instance, not only has
a female governor but also a legislature that's more than 30
percent female. This achievement may have something to do with the
fact that the job pays $100 a year.
 &HT;    The number of women in Congress keeps inching up, but there is
no House woman within a mile of a real leadership role. People who
remember watching Holtzman and Barbara Jordan hold forth during the
House Judiciary impeachment hearings on Richard Nixon may notice
that 20 years later the only woman in the majority party on
Judiciary is Sonny Bono's widow.
 &HT;    ``It almost looks like it could be the end of the last century,
except no one's taken our right to vote away,'' says Pat Schroeder,
the former representative.
 &HT;    Where did all that momentum go, and why? Was the Year of the
Woman just that _ one year? Every political loss is an individual
story, but if you look around, it's easy to come up with reasons
why women seem to be hitting a glass ceiling.
 The Mommy Detour  
 &HT;    Women in politics get a slow start; a study once found that male
legislators were on average 20 years younger, though the gap has
since narrowed. ``Men decide to run in two hours after someone in
the law firm says, 'You've got to run,''' says Cathy Allen, a
political consultant in Olympia, Wash. ``The average woman takes
two years to decide. She'll wait until she has the perfect campaign
manager, the right 17 endorsements, until she's gotten down to a
perfect size 10 and the kids are out of school.''
 &HT;    Mixing child rearing and Congress is tough, since constituents
themselves tend to be big babies, demanding lots of attention and
refusing to make allowances for anyone else's needs. Only one of
the four women who have given birth while in the House has stayed
on.
 &HT;    Reps. Enid Greene Waldholtz of Utah and Susan Molinari of New
York became poster people for Republican family values when in 1995
and 1996, respectively, they gave birth to daughters, but before
the babies were walking, their mothers were out of office.
 &HT;    Molinari, who was married to another House member, grew strapped
for time and money and quit. Greene Waldholtz fell into disgrace
when her husband turned out to be a con man who had illegally
financed his wife's campaign with money obtained from her father.
 Guilt by Association (With Men)  
 &HT;    A current theory holds that a woman stands an excellent chance
of making a presidential ticket in 2000 since both parties will be
looking for candidates who are guaranteed never to be caught with
an intern underneath the telephone table.
 &HT;    But the Greene Waldholtz saga is a reminder that neither gender
is immune to the pitfalls of misplaced love. (During a weepy
five-hour news conference, she denounced her husband and claimed
she knew little about the finances of her campaign and her
household, and didn't even have the access codes to the family
answering machine.)
 &HT;    Moseley-Braun of Illinois is perhaps the most endangered
incumbent senator this year, mainly because of political baggage
stemming from her association with Kgosie Matthews, her former
fiance and campaign manager.
 &HT;    Matthews has been accused of everything from misuse of campaign
funds to sexual harassment to breaking immigration laws. A former
lobbyist for Nigeria, he was presumably also the genius behind
Moseley-Braun's decision to meet with the brutal Nigerian dictator
Gen. Sani Abacha, a gaffe that has become a serious campaign issue.
 It's the Fund-Raising, Stupid  
 &HT;    The issues that women gravitate toward in politics _ day care,
education, child protection _ do not attract a lot of big donors.
Women, the champions of the neighborhood fund-raiser, would
undoubtedly benefit from a campaign-finance system in which
candidates got matching funds and were prohibited from taking huge
donations.
 &HT;    But campaign finance reform keeps receding, and some contrarians
say that Emily's List is one of the reasons. That's near-heresy:
Emily's List, a political action committee that ``bundles''
donations from backers interested in promoting Democratic women in
politics, has done more than any group to put women's campaigns on
an equal financial level with men's.
 &HT;    Still, nearly any discussion of campaign finance reform
inevitably raises the question of what such reform would do to
Emily. Bill Curry, a former adviser to President Clinton, says that
at one White House meeting, Ann Lewis, a Clinton campaign official,
laced into Curry as a ``chauvinist'' for pressing reform. ``The
Emily's List group did more to slow Clinton down on campaign
finance reform than anyone,'' Curry says.
 Left on the Left  
 &HT;    One of the most interesting factoids gleaned from a generation's
worth of survey research on women in politics is that while men
often embark on a political career to make business contacts, women
generally get into the game because they want to help.
 &HT;    ``Most women begin with community concerns, not ambition,'' says
Harriet Woods, the former president of the National Women's
Political Caucus. That impulse to help is in keeping with what
pollsters find about women voters _ they're more likely to support
social spending and activist government.
 &HT;    But perhaps as a result, while the nation in general is trending
toward the right, female candidates tend to be seen as left of
their party's center. Boxer, struggling in California to keep her
Senate seat, is viewed as more liberal than her state's voters, and
Whitman has never been able to win over the right wing that
dominates the Republican Party's organizational base.
 &HT;    Support for abortion rights, usually a plus in general
elections, often hurts Republicans in their primaries. The abortion
issue has always been a rallying point for the women-in-politics
movement, but it's also a problem. Some of the staunchest
abortion-rights advocates will admit that the issue sometimes
overshadows everything else, giving the public the idea that women
are one-note candidates.
 &HT;    ``There's this perception that women's groups are focused
entirely on choice,'' says Ruth Messinger, the recent New York
mayoral candidate. ``It's hard to get voters to understand that a
higher percentage of women means more day care and better HMOs.''
 Time to Play Rough  
 &HT;    Lately, female candidates have been hammering away at the
mom-who-cares theme so hard that it almost trivializes the jobs
they're seeking. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a former Arkansas
congresswoman who left office after having twins but is now running
for the Senate _ broadcasts commercials that show her balancing the
family checkbook.
 &HT;    Patty Murray won her Senate seat in 1992 as a ``mom in tennis
shoes''; this year, she is being marketed as a ``quietly
effective'' person who used to teach school. Stressing women's
unthreatening, nurturing side makes for good spin, but we may have
gone overboard in idealizing the nonaggressive worker bees.
 &HT;    Politics is still a struggle for power, and anybody who wants
change has to be willing to wrestle money or privilege away from
whoever has it. The point of gender equality isn't to raise women's
self-esteem, or even to pack the Education Committee with people
who love children _ the Education Committee already loves children.
 &HT;    The point is that once women hit a critical mass, large numbers
will lap over into places such as Commerce and Finance, injecting
big-bucks, hard-muscle deliberations with a larger version of
what's important in the world.

 By FAREED ZAKARIA  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Sometime this summer the post-Cold War world ended.
 &HT;    It was a brief, giddy age.
 &HT;    We were thrust into it headlong barely 10 years ago, when the
Berlin Wall cracked, Eastern Europe freed itself and the Soviet
Union disintegrated.
 &HT;    Suddenly the United States became not just the sole surviving
superpower but the repository of the sole surviving ideology.
Countries around the globe fell over themselves to embrace
capitalism, democracy and the American way _ from mutual funds to
Madonna. As if conscious of the need to play its part, the American
economy surged to historic highs.
 &HT;    The new forces of globalization swept the world. Economics and
technology reigned supreme and ancient civilizations struggled to
become emerging markets. Western nations moved furiously into a
postindustrial, information age with explosions of new industries
and wealth.
 &HT;    As economies intertwined, cyberspace took off and capital (and
capitalists) sloshed around the world at a heady pace, the old
world of international politics and national security seemed
utterly obsolete. Even thinking in terms of national boundaries was
considered old-fashioned. ``We treat the world as a single
nation,'' declared Alfred Zeien, CEO of Gillette.
 &HT;    The new world order found a new world stage. Where international
attention was once focused on the U.N. General Assembly or
U.S.-Soviet summits, for the last decade it has been lavished on
Davos, an Alpine ski resort in Switzerland. There, each year in
late January, the international business and media elite gathered
at the World Economic Forum, and developing countries strove
mightily to impress the conferees by dispatching their presidents
and prime ministers or, better still, their economists.
 &HT;    Once the most dazzling figures on the international scene were
diplomats; now they were economists. Every country worth its salt
had a brilliant young economist charting its new course. Every year
a new reformist regime bubbled with promise. Ukraine, Tunisia and
Portugal all had their 15 minutes of fame _ and their country funds
a resulting 15 percent uptick.
 &HT;    It is difficult to mark the end of an era with precision, but
just as Russia's embrace of the Western model ushered in the
beginning of a new age in world affairs, so the collapse of Russian
reform this past July heralded its end.
 &HT;    There were other signs. The Asian financial crisis, Japan's
deepening depression, nuclear explosions in South Asia, the
emboldening of Saddam Hussein and the return of terrorism all wore
at the easy assumptions of peace and prosperity that have
characterized the 1990s.
 &HT;    It remains difficult to see on the horizon a worldwide
depression or a large-scale war, but gone is the expectation that
the post-Cold War world was inexorably evolving into something new
and better.
 &HT;    Three times this century the United States waged and won a world
war against an evil empire. Each time _ in 1919, 1945 and 1989 _ it
hoped that, with this struggle over, with this evil vanquished,
with this empire defeated, international affairs would be quite
different from the past. The dismal cycle of war and destruction
would be replaced by an ever-expanding realm of peace, prosperity
and liberty.
 &HT;    And for the third time this century, that hope has faded as
politics returns to the world of nations. What is different this
time is that, when finally the entire world seemed to admit that
the American dream was their dream too, America lost interest.
 &HT;    Today, apathy about the world pervades every aspect of American
society. Coverage of foreign news by networks and newsmagazines has
plummeted. The number of foreign news reports broadcast by NBC
dropped from 1,013 in 1988 to 327 in 1996.
 &HT;    For decades, White House news conferences were dominated by
questions about foreign policy. Today, even at a joint meeting with
President Clinton and President Yeltsin, reporters ask a few
obligatory questions about foreign policy and quickly move to the
domestic crisis of the moment. Book publishers are uninterested in
publishing anything about world affairs.
 &HT;    These trends reflect an increasingly competitive business
environment and an increasingly frivolous public culture, but at
the heart of things lies the simple fact that the average American
is simply not interested in the world.
 &HT;    The United States, we are often told, is isolationist at its
core. The settlers came to the New World to escape the court
intrigues and internecine power struggles of the Old. And, indeed,
America's lack of interest in the world beyond is real and
deep-rooted.
 &HT;    But American isolationism is a curious thing. The relentless
march of 13 colonies north, south and west across a continent can
hardly be called isolationism. This territorial expansion required
a complex series of negotiations with France, Spain, Britain and
Mexico _ and wars with three of the four _ in addition to a stream
of bloody battles with the Native Americans.
 &HT;    More curious still is American behavior in this century. While
sometimes disengaging from the international scene altogether
(during the 1930s, for example), America also conceived of and
sponsored the most ambitious international projects in this
century, or any other for that matter. The League of Nations, the
United Nations, the Marshall Plan, the Helsinki Final Act _ all are
products of American power and principle.
 &HT;    For decades, European ``sophisticates'' have mocked the hope for
a new and better world. The world is intractable, they say; human
beings are fallible; problems are endemic; foreign policy is an
ongoing process. There is wisdom in such caution.
 &HT;    But in fact, the dream is worth dreaming. Free markets, free
trade, an open world economy and political cooperation are an
alluring alternative to war, pestilence and disease. Indeed, for
developing countries, hitching their wagons to the global economy
has proved to be the only way out of thousands of years of poverty.
 &HT;    Over the last 30 years, East Asian nations brought literally
hundreds of millions of people out of medieval conditions of
malnutrition, sickness and despair _ easily the fastest rate of
poverty alleviation in human history. And in the 1990s so many
countries around the world seemed poised to follow that example.
 &HT;    So why did these promising developments go awry? Who lost the
post-Cold War world?
 &HT;    Well, transforming the world is a tall order. The realities of
international politics always intrude on dreams. But they have done
so in these last few years more quickly and thoroughly than they
might have because Americans _ leaders and public alike _ lost
faith in their own ideals.
 &HT;    Exhausted by its long struggle with the Soviet Union, without
fears of war or depression, America in the 1990s has still wanted
to transform the world, but it has not wanted to work the
transformation itself _ or to pay for it.
 &HT;    Central to any transformation of the post-Cold War world was the
transformation of Russia. As with Germany and Japan in 1945, an
enduring peace required that Moscow be integrated into the Western
world. Otherwise a politically and economically troubled great
power _ which strides continents and has the world's second-largest
storehouse of nuclear weapons _ would remain bitter and resentful
about the post-Cold War order.
 &HT;    In the early 1990s, the most important Russian leaders wanted
Russia to go down this path and be partners with the West. Yet
throughout the 1990s few American statesmen _ with the notable
exception of Richard Nixon _ ever wanted to make the transformation
of Russia an American goal.
 &HT;    ``Russians will define Russia's future,'' Bill Clinton has said
many times, as if to absolve America (and himself) of ``losing''
that country. The United States has certainly tried to help
liberalize Russia's economics and politics, but considering the
size of that country and the history of its problems _ and when
compared to the initiatives of the 1940s and '50s in Europe and
Japan _ these efforts have been weak and halfhearted.
 &HT;    In the late 1940s, both Japan and Germany had been at war with
America, killing, torturing and maiming Americans with savage
brutality. And yet a few years later, Americans committed
themselves to rebuild these countries and thus transformed
ever-warring Europe into a benign trading bloc.
 &HT;    Who knows how hopeless a defeated Japan or Germany would have
looked 10 years after World War II without major American
involvement? Who knows what Russia could have looked like today if
the United States had been truly ambitious?
 &HT;    More recently, when the turmoil in East Asia first broke,
Americans looked on as if it were a freak show. Many commentators
took it as an opportunity to gloat about the virtues of the
American way of life and the poverty of Asian values. Policy makers
seemed to believe that matters could be left to the IMF and that no
political response was necessary. Globalization would do the work
for them. The market would force countries to become genuinely free
economies.
 &HT;    The discrediting of communism would make nations naturally
accept liberal democracy and the rule of law. Goldman, Sachs,
Morgan Stanley and other banks and mutual funds would do the work
of transformation. Washington would watch and cheer.
 &HT;    ``We can't want reform in any country more than its government
and its people do,'' Lawrence Summers, the deputy secretary of
treasury, often intones, perfectly expressing this view of America,
and of the average American, as concerned spectator.
 &HT;    But until yesterday the United States wanted certain kinds of
reform more than the government and the people themselves. We have
cajoled, urged, bribed and threatened regimes to liberalize their
economies along Anglo-American lines.
 &HT;    Now, in the '90s the modesty of American ambition has not been
matched by a modesty of rhetoric. In 1992, it is worth recalling,
Clinton accused his predecessor of spending too much time on
foreign policy, but his criticisms of President Bush's policy at
least implied an even more ambitious and expensive one.
 &HT;    Clinton accepted all Bush's concerns, but added to them the need
to restore Bosnia to its unified multiethnic status, pressure China
to democratize, help Haitians in despair, rebuild the Somali nation
and assist further in Russia's reforms. All this from an
administration promising to pay less attention to foreign policy!
Of course, most of this proved to be merely rhetoric.
 &HT;    Over the last year and a half, Washington has insisted on
keeping tight control of the international response to the global
economic crisis _ while offering very little by way of policy
ideas, initiatives, organization or money.
 &HT;    Last year, the Japanese government, which has provided far more
in aid to Southeast Asia than the United States, offered to set up
a $100 billion ``Asian Monetary Fund'' to prevent a further loss of
confidence in that region. Washington instinctively vetoed it.
 &HT;    Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington has
enjoyed playing the part of sole superpower _ being visited by all,
making glorious speeches, strutting around the globe. But it has
not wanted to pay the bills in political capital, energy, attention
or dollars.
 &HT;    We are eager to lead on any problem that can be solved quickly
and on the cheap. We trumpeted NATO expansion as the most ambitious
new project for the security of Europe, and then quickly explained
that it would cost virtually nothing. We declared that the
restoration of Bosnia as a single, multiethnic nation was vital,
but made it clear that we had no intention of paying the high price
that this would entail.
 &HT;    We have sought to bring order to the periphery _ Haiti, Somalia
_ because it was easier than stabilizing the core: Russia.
 &HT;    The way foreign policy is made nowadays has exaggerated this
fitful leadership. (Now you see us, now you don't.) Crises that
flash vividly onto television take on an urgency that may have
little to do with their intrinsic importance, which explains
America's continued indifference to the (untelevised) horrors in
Sudan, which outstrip as a humanitarian catastrophe anything
happening in the Balkans.
 &HT;    While public support for serious international initiatives has
always been fragile, politicians used to be able to build support
for them steadily, over months and years. The public was, after
all, initially against American involvement in World War II, the
Marshall Plan, the Persian Gulf War and almost all free-trade
agreements.
 &HT;    But politicians have increasingly become unwilling, and unable,
to educate and guide public opinion.
 &HT;    Last year, Clinton could not convince his own party to give him
authority to negotiate trade agreements, the first time such
authority has been denied in a generation. (And at a time when the
American economy was at a 35-year peak and unemployment was 4.7
percent!)
 &HT;    Since politicians do not want to lead and the public does not
want to be led, foreign policy is increasingly being made by narrow
interest groups (business lobbies, ethnic organizations) often with
a single agenda, who pressure Congress and the administration to
enact their favorite policy. For example, Polish- and
Hungarian-Americans fought for NATO expansion; African-American
lobbyists pushed for the invasion of Haiti; Cuban-Americans have
sought harsh sanctions on Cuba and so on.
 &HT;    America is full of unilateral declarations, righteous rhetoric
and spasmodic interventions. Economic sanctions and air power have
become the indispensable handmaidens of today's foreign policy
because they offer, in Eliot Cohen's phrase, the allure of modern
courtship: gratification without commitment.
 &HT;    With a few exceptions, sanctions provide the opportunity for
cheap moralizing _ taking a stand that pleases some domestic group,
while in fact doing little to change the reality on the ground.
 &HT;    Bombing makes it possible to reap the glory and rewards of
military action with none of its usual costs. Problems that might
be solved by bombing, we readily undertake. Problems _ often more
serious and long-term _ that cannot be addressed by this method we
ignore. We have become a nation of cheap hawks.
 &HT;    Our current path is an alluring alternative to real
international leadership, with its hard choices, gray areas and
persistent struggle.
 &HT;    The Truman administration, in contrast, put into place
containment policies that would have to be pursued steadily for
decades before they bore fruit. It dealt with dictators and
guerrillas and financed political parties and intellectual groups _
whatever was necessary to promote American interests and ideals.
Despite an extraordinary position of power, it yielded to its
allies in negotiations time and time again.
 &HT;    In other words, it engaged in international politics and in so
doing, transformed it. Just as important, the Truman administration
educated the American people about the world they lived in.
 &HT;    Well, perhaps the sophisticates were right; perhaps the ambition
to change the world was absurd. Perhaps America must be willing to
accept the world as it is. This would represent a tremendous loss
of faith, but could bring a different kind of stability to the
world and a sense of limits to American politics. It would mean a
scaling back of lofty aims along with a willingness to share the
benefits and burdens of global leadership with its allies.
 &HT;    But this is not what has happened. There are no signs that the
Clinton administration _ or the American people _ are ready for
realism. What we have now is the rhetoric of transformation but the
reality of accommodation: a hollow hegemony.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've never forgotten the day my brother died. I was 10, and he
was 17. It was the middle of summer, I remember, because it is
impossible to forget a Mississippi summer: hot and indelible like
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Not the sort of pain I knew as a child, but the kind that comes
from grief, the kind I saw in my mother's hot tears, heard in her
wailing that seemed to tumble up from a place so deep inside it
would take a thousand hands to rescue.
</P>
<P>
   That was my first experience with death. Then, before I turned
25, I lost both my mother and father, and the only grandmother I
ever knew. When I was 28, I miscarried my first child.
</P>
<P>
   Neither death nor grief is a stranger to me. And neither are the
words and experiences shared in the soon-to-be-released ``A Broken
Heart Still Beats: After Your Child Dies,'' (Hazelden) a
compilation of excerpts from poems, works of fiction and essays
that articulate the chaos of feelings that comes with such a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The editors, Mary Semel and Anne McCracken, came up with the
idea of the book as they separately, yet simultaneously, found in
literature comfort from the deaths of their own children _ a
comfort that far exceeded anything they had found in traditional
self-help books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off doing this for ourselves with no thought that
it was a book,'' said McCracken in a telephone interview from her
home in Baltimore. ``After our sons died, Mary and I both had
emotions we couldn't put words to, questions we couldn't frame and
so we independently turned to literature to deal with our grief.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken, 49, a former journalist, and Semel, 54, a
psychotherapist, were introduced through mutual friends. Before
long, the two began exchanging the literary finds that they found
comforting.
</P>
<P>
   Some two years later, the mothers decided that if it was ``so
helpful to us to find these well-known writers who could put our
feelings into words, it could help other bereaved parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that anything helps,'' Semel said, ``when you
find some gifted person to put what you're feeling into the right
words, I think there is a kind of catharsis ... solace knowing
others have endured the same pain.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Semel's son Alexander, they called him Allie, was three weeks
short of his 17th birthday when he was killed in an accident.
McCracken's son Jake was only 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life was completely changed when my son was killed,'' Semel
said. ``It was like a bomb dropped on my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Semel and McCracken's book takes parents through the stages of
grief and the coping and healing process that follows the death of
one's child. The excerpted works, accompanied by personal and
poignant memoirs by the editors, came from proven authors who had,
as McCraken says, ``hiked this territory before us, explored it
thoroughly and come back with nuggets of gold.'' The writers _ from
Robert Frost to William Shakespeare, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Anne
Tyler _ validated the mothers' feelings of despair and also their
desire to hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Broken Heart,'' scheduled to be in bookstores across the
country Nov. 14, will do just that for other grieving parents, the
editors believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the strength of the book is that most grief books have
the authoritative voice of one person _ a minister, a rabbi, a
therapist, one family, one death,'' McCracken said. ``This offers a
chorus of voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Including their own.
</P>
<P>
   McCracken recalls, for instance, losing her son as she and her
two young children were ending a visit with her mother in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had had a lovely 10-day visit,'' she remembered. ``We were
about a mile down the road, and a man in the opposing lane had a
seizure, blacked out at the wheel and came straight into my car.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Jake and his 2-year-old sister were in the back seat.
McCracken was critically injured. Her son died some 45 minutes
later from his injuries. It was August 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, she said: ``It's a permanent wound. You don't
get over (it). You go on with your life. You fashion a new kind of
life with this big hole in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who will come after Semel and McCracken, for those
who know the pain of this ultimate loss, there is, at least, ``A
Broken Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McCracken: ``Even if you don't read it from cover to cover,
there is that sense that you are not alone.''

   BRANSON, Mo. _ If the King of Rock 'n' Roll were alive, he would
have his own theater in Branson.
</P>
<P>
   The bright neon marquee would light up E-L-V-I-S and the music
would play from speakers designed to look like teddy bears and
hound dogs (animals also for sale as Beanie Babies in the Elvis
``Love Me Tender'' Gift Shop).
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Marie and the grandkids would do a few numbers in the first
half of the show, which would be produced by ex-wife Priscilla.
</P>
<P>
   The hits would flow from a nine-piece band, the buses would stop
here and the ``All Shook Up'' crowd would cheer for more _ then
line up for autographs (or sweaty scarves) as the King waved
farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis would fit right in, along with Mel Tillis, Andy Williams,
Bobby Vinton, Mo Bandy, Jim Stafford, the Osmond Brothers, Mickey
Gilley, Charley Pride, Box Car Willie, the Lennon Sisters, Shoji
Tabuchi and Yakov Smirnoff.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Elvis impersonators can be found in this southern
Missouri mecca for music lovers, and Presleys' Country Jubilee (no
relation) is one of the longest-running shows on 76 Country
Boulevard (state Highway 76).
</P>
<P>
   People flock to Branson, a town of some 3,700, at a rate of some
5.5 million a year. The town's traffic problem was once legendary;
but since 1990, $100 million has been invested to open up roads,
taking the burden of bumper-to-bumper off Highway 76.
</P>
<P>
   A tourism market survey by Virginia-based D.K. Shifflet puts
Branson in the top 20 destination cities in the United States,
right up there with San Antonio, Orlando, Las Vegas and Myrtle
Beach, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   While senior citizens make up the bulk of autumn and winter
tourism, especially on bus tours, families flock to Branson in the
spring and summer. The median age for a Branson tourist is 49.2,
compared to 40.9 in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The town has been dubbed ``Las Vegas without the gambling and
drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Add ``and with lower prices'' to that. Branson's show ticket
prices average $22, compared to tickets for big shows in Las Vegas
that can reach $75 to $90.
</P>
<P>
   When you aren't in a theater, there's still a lot to do:
miniature golf, Ripley's Believe It or Not, Silver Dollar City, go
carts, the scenic railway, a winery, golf, shopping, camping,
fishing and water sports on lakes Taneycomo and Table Rock. Nearby
Springfield, Mo., is, after all, the national headquarters of Bass
Pro Shops.
</P>
<P>
   Lake living attracts the big fish and the big names.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Williams was the first non-country entertainer to build a
theater in Branson in 1991, followed quickly by the Osmond Brothers
in 1992 and the Lennon Sisters, who joined the Lawrence Welk
Champagne Theater in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who really packs 'em in is Shoji Tabuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese wonder on the violin with a bowl haircut and
disarming, gee-whiz attitude, Tabuchi performs to an often sold-out
crowd from a lavish theater where even the extravagant bathrooms
attract the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Tabuchi, who moved to the United States 30 years ago, mixes
country, laser lights, ancient Japanese taiko drums and the talents
of his teen-age daughter, Christina.
</P>
<P>
   In heavily accented English, Tabuchi introduces his songs and
steps nimbly as he plays ``In the Mood'' or ``Orange Blossom
Special.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson is a friendly place. No wonder the show-biz types are
putting down roots here. Residents say it isn't unusual to run into
a celebrity at Wal-Mart. Hard to imagine ``Mr. Vegas'' Wayne Newton
in the express line.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Clark was the first big name to have a theater, but it was
owned by someone else. Today the Platters do a $36 dinner show at
the Roy Clark Celebrity Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his Moon River Theater, Williams
talked about the town and his reasons for building here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother, Don, was here with Ray Stevens. He was Ray's
manager ... and he asked me to come down (to Branson),'' Williams
said. ``He said, `I think people would come see you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Williams decided to take a chance and open his own theater,
against the advice of his friends, agent and lawyer. Without ever
playing Branson, Williams jumped right in and built a $12 million
theater, a beautiful building with a rough stone exterior and the
``Moon River'' meandering by.
</P>
<P>
   It's right across the street from Bobby Vinton's Blue Velvet
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   At the Blue Velvet, Vinton shares the stage with the Glenn
Miller Orchestra _ no original members, but the sound is true. So
even if you aren't a big Vinton fan, the show offers Big Band
sounds and you can get up and dance.
</P>
<P>
   Vinton belts out such hits as ``Roses are Red'' and ``Blue
Velvet,'' and a newer country song ``Not Enough Roses in Texas''
while exhorting the crowd to shout ``Ho Ho'' after every number.
</P>
<P>
   The color blue and the flower the rose are thematic in the
theater. The lobby is blue, as are the curtains.
</P>
<P>
   And if a lady wants to spend $3.75 on a rose, she can present it
to Vinton and get a kiss in return. (There were no takers during
our show.)
</P>
<P>
   This is high-energy stuff; even Vinton's mother (of
indeterminate age) takes the stage in a short, tight black dress
and does some high kicks singing ``When You're Smiling.'' Besides
Mama, three of Vinton's five children are on stage.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Family is the theme throughout Branson _ family shows, family
members and family prices, and many shows are free for children
younger than 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Presleys pioneered the family show concept back in 1963,
when Lloyd Presley and son, Gary, stopped taking their show on the
road and opened their own theater. In 1967, they moved the show and
became the first to build on Highway 76. Theirs wasn't the first
Branson show _ that honor goes to the Baldknobbers Hillbilly
Jamboree, which began in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gary Presley's role as ``Herkimer,'' complete with
sparkling overalls, missing teeth and floppy hat, keeps audiences
laughing. His son, Eric, plays clown, too, with ``Cecil.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the jokes are chestnuts, but the crowd of 1,600 loves
them. (On stage, Cecil is dressed as a baby in a carriage. Emcee
says to Herkimer, ``Is he spoiled?'' Herkimer replies, ``No, he
always smells that way.'')
</P>
<P>
   The musical entertainment is top-notch. Current hits, gospel and
old favorites share the stage; the finale is a patriotic ``Proud to
Be an American.'' We saw nine Presleys on stage in a cast of 22,
playing to a full house on a Saturday night. They ranged from
8-year-old Sarah to 74-year-old Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting and greeting every bus, the Presleys talked
business upstairs in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any hit songs of our own, but we get to do
everyone else's,'' Gary Presley muses. When he isn't doing
Herkimer, he plays guitar and brother, Steve, plays the drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat thing about Branson is the variety, (and) everyone
works real hard putting on a good show,'' Steve Presley adds.
</P>
<P>
   Show changes in the last 30 years? More sequins and better
lighting, the Presleys say.
</P>
<P>
   When Tillis signed on in 1990, ``He went back to Nashville and
said, `Guys, you gotta come to Branson,''' says Steve Presley.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Tillis is in his third Branson location and has been
packing in the crowds, thanks to appearances by his daughter, Pam.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can make it here; Willie Nelson is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   ``His manager called me up and said, `Why can't we draw 1,500 a
night? We draw 15,000 at a concert,''' Steve Presley says. Nelson,
he says, was doing a three-hour concert while the Branson crowds
want variety.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Williams says, ``People wanted to see Willie Nelson do some
tap dancing and tell some jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of TV variety shows, Williams believes he knows his
Branson audience. His show mixes Broadway, movie themes, film
clips, dancing penguins, an audience Q&AMP;A, acrobats, singers and the
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   This show is not a nostalgic review of hits. The 69-year-old
singer does newer songs, some made famous by Mariah Carey, Sting
and Bryan Adams. His wonderful voice fills the theater, and the
production numbers, such as ``Circle of Life'' from ``The Lion
King,'' are vibrant and dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   If country is what you want, you'll find it here. There are the
barbecue restaurants along Highway 76, Dolly Parton's Dixie
Stampede where you eat chicken with your hands and watch a rodeo
dinner show, a ride on the Showboat Branson Belle, or a seat at the
Shepard of Hills outdoor drama about life in turn-of-the-century
Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   Branson has been called a land cruise _ with entertainment and
buffets from one end of town to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Bus tours bring visitors from around the country and Branson
loves its bus tours. The buses get VIP parking and the riders get
special group seating.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainers take time on stage to announce the tours and where
they are from. About 65 percent of Branson business comes from
organized tours, says Cindy Merry, a Branson publicist.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Yakov's American Pavilion, Russian comedian Yakov
Smirnoff jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who offered to teach me English? Shoji Tabuchi _ and
he learned it from Mel Tillis.''
</P>
<P>
   Smirnoff takes time to meet and greet all 13 buses in his
parking lot after a full-house Saturday morning show. He also signs
autographs by the exit door and poses cheerfully with fans for
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded comedian _ remembered for his line ``What a
country!'' _ makes the audience part of his show, encouraging jokes
and bringing tourists on stage.
</P>
<P>
   If Branson is the home of American patriotism _ where most every
show in town does gospel or ends with ``God Bless America'' _
Smirnoff is the leader of the band.
</P>
<P>
   His show, ``From Red to Redneck,'' is topical _ from Clinton
jokes (and clean ones at that) to life in these United States
(always punctuated with his new trademark line, ``I'll bet you
never looked at it like that'') to funny asides about life in
Branson (``My middle name is now Bubba'').
</P>
<P>
   He credits Willie Nelson with pointing him toward the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked to do Farm Aid with Willie, performing in front of
40,000 farmers, and I thought they'd look at me (like I was) from
another planet,'' he says. Smirnoff was a hit and Nelson said he
should consider doing his act in Branson.
</P>
<P>
   With a wife and two young children, Smirnoff is enjoying life in
the family-friendly Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who travel to this destination have a certain
mindset,'' Smirnoff says. The former Los Angeles resident says he
finds the routine of two shows a day in Branson more conducive to
family life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people should come to Branson and see how America
ought to be,'' he says.
</P>

   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: The airport at Springfield, Mo., is about 40
miles from Branson. Allow an hour's drive-time from the airport to
Branson.
</P>
<P>
   On the bus: A number of companies do bus tours to Branson, which
include hotel and show tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets: Ticket prices range from $12 for the Frederick's
Waltzing Waters Show (a grand pianist), to $33 for Andy Williams'
Christmas Show. Dinner shows, such as the Dixie Stampede and the
Roy Clark Celebrity Theater, are in the mid-$30s.
</P>
<P>
   Most shows in Branson go dark by Dec. 19 and re-open in March.

GLENN ECLIPSES A RICH ARRAY OF SHUTTLE EXPERIMENTS

(HLW) 
 By WARREN LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Although eclipsed by the attention given John Glenn's
return to space, the crew of the shuttle Discovery is conducting
one of the most ambitious and diverse programs of scientific and
commercial research yet attempted on a nine-day mission.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the aging-related research involving Glenn, the
seven-member crew is methodically working through scores of
experiments ranging from solar physics and astronomy to the design
of new drug delivery systems, studies of artificial bone, and
testing insulation material for the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   A major event planned for Tuesday is the recovery of the Spartan
solar observation spacecraft, which was released from the Discovery
on Sunday for two days of studies centering on the Sun's hot,
outermost layer, the corona. The 3,000-pound Spartan has been
trailing the Discovery by about 30 miles. It is to be snared by the
shuttle's robot arm and returned to Earth in the orbiter's cargo
bay.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is being poked and prodded during the mission because of
similarities between what happens to astronauts in space and bodily
changes due to age, like loss of bone and muscle mass, greater
susceptibility to infection and sleeping difficulties. The
experiments require him to provide 10 blood samples and 16 urine
samples while in space.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the shuttle on Sunday, Glenn said he did not like
being stuck with needles and tried to avoid Dr. Scott Parazynski,
the crewmate responsible for most of the blood collection, whom the
senator sometimes calls ``Igor'' or ``Count Dracula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I like Discovery, there's no place to hide when he
comes after me,'' Glenn remarked.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodletting is part of a ``protein turnover'' experiment to
study muscle wasting by tracking protein building and breakdown.
Data are collected in six three-day sessions held before, during
and after the flight. Each session, including two in space,
requires five blood samples each taken from the 77-year-old senator
and a fellow crew member, 35-year-old Pedro Duque.
</P>
<P>
   In order to track the formation of new protein from amino acids,
both men take capsules of alanine, an amino acid tagged with a
special molecule that can be found in newly built protein.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, the subjects intravenously receive another
tagged amino acid, histidine, which measures protein breakdown.
Along with blood, urine samples will also be returned to Earth,
where the tagged molecules will be measured.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Glenn and another crewmate, Dr. Chiaki Mukai, 46,
are doing sleep studies by wearing specially instrumented suits and
caps to measure breathing, chest expansion, eye movement and brain
waves when they go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Discovery's crew members either conduct or take part
in long hours of research, with little free time. And these
undertakings do not include some experiments that require little or
no human attention, like work on an electronic nose for detecting
toxic compounds.
</P>
<P>
   The nose is a three-pound box full of chemical sensors connected
to a small, palmtop computer. The sensor array, developed by NASA
and California Institute of Technology researchers, is designed to
detect a variety of gases and gas mixtures by mimicking the way the
human nose detects changes in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Because astronauts in the confines of the planned international
space station must breathe filtered and recycled air, researchers
say they need a monitoring system that detects the accumulation of
potentially harmful gases before they become a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 80 experiments aboard the Discovery are
housed in a pressurized laboratory in the cargo bay that is
connected to the shuttle's crew quarters by a tunnel. This
laboratory, privately owned and operated by Spacehab Inc., of
Vienna, Va., contains research like an experiment with aerogel, the
lightest solid known.
</P>
<P>
   Aerogel, which has a hazy blue appearance, is a porous material
so light and ethereal that it has been nicknamed frozen smoke.
Tests show that a single window pane of aerogel has the insulation
properties of up to 30 panes of glass and trapped air. If this
material can be made transparent, perhaps by modifying under
weightless conditions the size or uniformity of pores that compose
most of it, aerogel could revolutionize the thermal window
industry, scientists at the space agency say.
</P>
<P>
   Spacehab also houses a bioreactor, a device that allows cell
cultures to be grown in space in rotating cylinders. Astronauts are
tending several experiments for growing human cells, including
research into making artificial and synthetic material more
acceptable for human implantation by seeding it first with bone
cells. This work, researchers said, could lead to synthetic bone to
repair limbs damaged by accidents or for dental reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Other experiments, like the Hubble Space Telescope Orbital
Systems Test, or HOST, developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md., are in the shuttle's open cargo bay. A
platform in the bay contains several instruments and devices
tentatively scheduled to be installed on Hubble during its next
servicing mission in the year 2000, said Rud V. Moe, payload
coordinator at Goddard.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery is flying at an altitude of about 340 miles, twice
the normal shuttle orbit, mainly so the HOST package is exposed to
conditions normally found at Hubble's elevation. The instruments
include a faster computer with more memory to control the
telescope's operations and a solid-state data recorder that will
back up a similar device installed two years ago in place of
Hubble's original mechanical tape recorder.
</P>
<P>
   HOST is also demonstrating a mechanical refrigeration system
that could cool detectors on Hubble's Near Infrared Camera and
Multi-Object Spectrometer, a valuable instrument that is no longer
working because it has exhausted its supplies of super-cold liquid
coolants stored in pressurized bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument requires cool detectors to measure the heat of
distant objects. The new system, if shown to work in space, could
extend the operation of the infrared instrument for more than five
years, Moe said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Depression among older people is an often unrecognized and
untreated problem that can tarnish the golden years for millions of
people who might otherwise find joy, not anguish, in their old age.
</P>
<P>
   That includes older people in nursing homes as well as those
living independently. Experts estimate that as many as 90 percent
of depressed elderly Americans are not being treated.
</P>
<P>
   More than five million Americans age 65 and older _ nearly one
in six _ suffer from serious, persistent symptoms of depression,
and another one million have major clinical depression, an
immobilizing disorder that can lead to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   From 1980 to 1992, suicide rates rose by 9 percent among all
Americans 65 and older and by 35 percent among those aged 80 to 84.
Only a small percentage of those deaths are believed to represent a
calculated escape from an incurable, incapacitating illness.
</P>
<P>
   Most older people contemplating suicide see their primary care
doctor within the month before killing themselves, and 40 percent
make that visit in the week before committing suicide. Rarely do
these doctors detect suicidal potential in older people before it
is too late.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to treat depression in the elderly, as in younger
people, is a costly mistake. It can lead to a loss of self-reliance
and the ability to live independently, which in turn increases the
burden on other family members and the cost of daily care and
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Depression increases the likelihood that a serious physical
illness will develop or get worse. Depressed older people make more
medical visits, require more tests and stay longer in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Also lost is the contribution they can make to their families
and society, including caring for children and elderly friends,
meal preparation, tutoring and volunteer work for myriad social and
cultural organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Many mistaken beliefs and expectations about depression and
aging impede effective treatment that would brighten the days of
older people, improve their physical health and enhance their
relationships with family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH It is natural to become increasingly depressed with age.
</P>
<P>
   FACT Dr. Barry Liebowitz, an expert on the emotional disorders
of aging at the National Institute of Mental Health, said,
``Depression is not the outcome of natural processes of aging and
should not be considered normal.'' Advancing age per se does not
cause depression.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH Of course older people are depressed; their spouses and
friends are dying all around them.
</P>
<P>
   FACT The death of spouses, companions and friends can cause
profound sadness and sometimes even major depression, but at any
age mentally healthy people bounce back from such losses and,
within a year or so, find new sources of support and pleasure.
Untreated depression, on the other hand, often results in social
isolation, which only exacerbates the depression.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH So many older people have serious health problems, why
wouldn't they be depressed.
</P>
<P>
   FACT Mentally healthy people of any age who have chronic
physical disabilities or diseases soon learn to adapt to their
limitations and get the most out of life that they can. It is not
so much that illness causes depression as that depression increases
the risk of illness, functional decline and even symptoms of
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the biological consequences of a health
problem _ not the person's reaction to it _ or the medications used
to treat another illness can cause depression.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as many as 40 percent of stroke victims experience
changes in brain chemicals, and those changes result in chronic
depression. Experts also suspect that there are many other older
people who become depressed following hidden strokes, including
transient ischemic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH Older people who are healthy and financially secure have no
reason to be depressed; they should be happy about their good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   FACT With rare exception, depression is a medical illness.
People who are ill with diabetes or arthritis, say, are not
expected to cure themselves by changing their mental outlook. If
people who are depressed could ``look on the bright side,'' ``pull
themselves together '' or ``be grateful for all the good things'' _
as they are often told to do _ they would. What they need is
concern, compassion and effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At any age, depression can be difficult to diagnose because it
has many different causes and symptoms. In older people, the
picture is often complicated by the coexistence of other serious
physical problems that overshadow the depression.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, depression is overlooked because it is seen as
``understandable'' in light of the person's other problems. But
whether depression is precipitated by death of a spouse or a heart
attack or it seems to strike out of the blue, it warrants
professional attention. In every case, relief of the depression can
facilitate a person's return to normal functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, the classic symptoms of depression _ deep
sadness and lack of pleasure in people and activities they once
enjoyed _ are often replaced by irritability and apathy, a
pervasive disinterest in life and what it may have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Other common hallmarks of depression in the elderly include
difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, loss of appetite,
diminished energy and a physical slowing down. These symptoms are
easily mistaken for signs of age _ and disregarded.
</P>
<P>
   Liebowitz, writing in The Decade of the Brain, a publication of
the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, pointed out that
``depression is chronic and recurring and requires long-term
treatment accompanied by lifestyle changes and, commonly,
environmental manipulations. Social support _ particularly from
family members _ is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, treating depression in the elderly is similar to
treating it in younger people.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some important differences. Dr. Herbert Harris,
also of the National Institute of Mental Health, noted that adverse
reactions to antidepressant drugs are more common in older people,
who tend to develop unwanted side effects even at relatively low
doses.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors must also look out for adverse interactions with other
medicines the patients take. Sometimes the patient must try several
different treatments in succession before the one with the most
benefit and fewest side effects is found.
</P>
<P>
   Older people who are depressed can also be their worst enemies.
Compliance with treatment tends to be poor and short-lived,
particularly in light of drug side effects, the number of drugs
many of them have to take for other conditions and the lack of
follow-up by the prescribing physician.
</P>
<P>
   Another inhibiting factor in effective treatment is the belief
of doctors and family members that depression is the least of an
older person's problems and not worth treating. Yet, Dr. George
Alexopoulos, a psychiatrist at Cornell University Medical College,
reports that treating depression in a patient with Alzheimer's
disease, for example, improves both the depression and the symptoms
of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   And among patients with heart disease and those living in
nursing homes, treating depression improves physical functioning,
decreases pain, improves the person's outlook and prolongs life. &QL;

   MARK TWAIN
</P>
<P>
   Back from an around-the-world speaking tour, Samuel Clemens was
in England, standing in his dining room, thinking of nothing in
particular, when he was handed a cablegram. It read:
</P>
<P>
   ``Susy (his 24-year-old daughter, still in America) was
peacefully released to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 10 years later, he still marveled:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the mysteries of our nature that a man, all
unprepared, can receive a thunderstroke like that and live. There
is but one reasonable explanation of it. The intellect is stunned
by the shock and but gropingly gathers the meaning of the words.
The power to realize their full import is mercifully wanting. The
mind has a dumb sense of vast loss _ that is all. It will take mind
and memory months and possibly years to gather together the details
and thus learn and know the whole extent of the loss. A man's house
burns down. The smoking wreckage represents only a ruined home that
was dear through years of use and pleasant associations. By and by,
as the days and weeks go on, first he misses this, then that, then
the other thing. And when he casts about for it he finds that it
was in that house. Always it is an essential _ there was but one of
its kind. It cannot be replaced. ...

<P>
   After his wife died, Lewis _ author of the Narnian Chronicles
stories, as well as scholarly and religious books _ turned
understandably to what he knew best. He tried to blunt his grief by
writing about it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. ... The same
fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I
keep on swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, it feels like being mildly drunk, or concussed.
There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I
find it hard to take in what anyone says. Or perhaps, hard to want
to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet, I want the others to be
about me. I dread the moments when the house is empty. If only they
would talk to one another and not to me.

</P>
<P>
   On a March evening in 1932, kidnappers took the 18-month-old son
of American aviator hero Charles Lindbergh and his wife, leaving
behind a ransom demand on the nursery window sill. Negotiations
went on for an interminable 10 weeks, but soon after the Lindberghs
paid the ransom, their child's dead body was found in nearby woods.
The boy's distraught mother, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, used a journal
as a place to spill her grief.

   W.E.B. DU BOIS
</P>
<P>
   Social critic, black advocate and founder of the NAACP, Du Bois
lost his 2-year-old son, Burghardt, to nasopharyngeal diphtheria.
The night before Burghardt died, his father frantically tried to
find one of the two or three black physicians living on the other
side of town, with no success. White doctors in Atlanta at this
time would not treat even desperately sick black children. Du Bois
took early solace in the certainty that his child would now at
least be spared the cruelties of life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ... I saw his breath beat quicker and quicker, pause, and then
his little soul leapt like a star that travels in the night and
left a world of darkness in its train. The day changed not; the
same tall trees peeped in at the windows, the same green grass
glinted in the setting sun. Only in the chamber of death writhed
the world's most piteous thing _ a childless mother.
</P>
<P>
   ... We could not lay him in the ground there in Georgia, for the
earth there is strangely red; so we bore him away to the northward,
with his flowers and his little folded hands. In vain, in vain! _
for where, O God! beneath thy broad blue sky shall my dark baby
rest in peace _ where Reverence dwells, and Goodness, and a Freedom
that is free?
</P>
<P>
   All that day and all that night there sat an awful gladness in
my heart _ nay, blame me not if I see the world thus darkly through
the Veil _ and my soul whispers ever to me, saying, ``Not dead, not
dead, but escaped; not bond, but free.'' No bitter meanness now
shall sicken his baby heart till it die a living death, no taunt
shall madden his happy boyhood. ... Well sped, my boy, before the
world had dubbed your ambition insolence, had held your ideals
unattainable, and taught you to cringe and bow. Better far this
nameless void that stops my life than a sea of sorrow for you. ...
</P>
<P>
   If one must have gone, why not I? Why may I not rest me from
this restlessness and sleep from this wide waking? Was not the
world's alembic, Time, in his young hands, and is not my time
waning? Are there so many workers in the vineyard that the fair
promise of this little body could lightly be tossed away? The
wretched of my race that line the alleys of the nation sit
fatherless and unmothered; but Love sat beside his cradle, and in
his ear Wisdom waited to speak. Perhaps now he knows the All-love,
and needs not to be wise. Sleep, then, child, _ sleep till I sleep
and waken to a baby voice and the ceaseless patter of little feet _
above the Veil.

   De Vries' autobiographical novel, ``The Blood of the Lamb,''
ends with these lines.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time heals nothing _ which should make us better able to
minister. There may be griefs beyond the reach of solace, but none
worthy of the name that does not set free the springs of sympathy.
Blessed are they that comfort, for they too have mourned, may be
more likely the human truth. ``You had a dozen years of perfection.
That's a dozen more than most people get,'' a man had rather
sharply told me one morning on the train. He was the father of one
of Carol's classmates, a lumpish girl of no wiles and no ways,
whose Boston mother had long since begun to embalm her dreams in
alcohol. I asked him to join me sometime in a few beers and a game
or two at the bowling alleys, where one often saw him hanging
alone. He agreed. Once I ran into Carol's teacher, Miss Halsey.
``Some poems are long, some are short. She was a short one,'' Miss
Halsey had summed up, smiling, with the late-Gothic horse face
which guarantees that she will never read any poems, long or short,
to any children of her own. Again the throb of compassion rather
than the breath of consolation: the recognition of how long, how
long is the mourners' bench upon which we sit, arms linked in
undeluded friendship, all of us, brief links, ourselves, in the
eternal pity.

<P>
   Having lost two children, his wife and father within five years,
the Indian poet and spiritual leader surely knew grief as well as
anyone. The ``lost sweet touch'' we all try to feel again, Tagore
sought in the ``allness of the universe.'' The ``overspreading
pain'' of separation, he wrote, ``deepens into loves and desires,
into sufferings and joys in human homes; and this it is that ever
melts and flows in songs throughout my poet's heart.''

   The End
</P>
<P>
   It is time for me to go, mother; I am going.
</P>
<P>
   When in the paling darkness of the lonely dawn you stretch out
your arms for your baby in the bed, I shall say, ``Baby is not
there!'' _ mother, I am going.
</P>
<P>
   I shall become a delicate draught of air and caress you; and I
shall be ripples in the water when you bathe, and kiss you and kiss
you again.
</P>
<P>
   In the gusty night when the rain patters on the leaves you will
hear my whisper in your bed, and my laughter will flash with the
lightning through the open window into your room.
</P>
<P>
   If you lie awake, thinking of your baby till late into the
night, I shall sing to you from the stars, ``Sleep, mother,
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   On the straying moonbeams I shall steal over your bed, and lie
upon your bosom while you sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   I shall become a dream, and through the little opening of your
eyelids I shall slip into the depths of your sleep; and when you
wake up and look round startled, like a twinkling firefly, I shall
flit out into the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   When, on the great festival of puja, the neighbors' children
come and play about the house, I shall melt into the music of the
flute and throb in your heart all day.
</P>
<P>
   Dear auntie will come with puja-presents and will ask, ``Where
is our baby, sister?'' Mother, you will tell her softly, ``He is in
the pupils of my eyes, he is in my body and my soul.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ The draw was septuagenarian &UR;  &LR; John Glenn's return
to space, but another astronaut was on the minds of a captive,
capacity audience reclining in tilted armchairs inside the
planetarium here.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of Christa McAuliffe, the Concord High School teacher
who perished in the Challenger explosion in 1986, literally
surrounded 100 people watching the liftoff of the space shuttle
Discovery. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' said Jack Bentz, a great-grandfather who
watched the launch projected on the 40-foot dome of the planetarium
named for McAuliffe. ``I felt that something was going to happen.
But when we saw they were safe, I let out a big sigh.''
</P>
<P>
   But while McAuliffe's fate was on the minds of everyone here,
the memory of her courage and inspiration was stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Auger, 26, of Pembroke, brought her 7-year-old son to
the planetarium to witness history and to honor McAuliffe's
accomplishments as the first US civilian to be selected for space
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Auger recalled watching the Challenger explosion live on
television, but not being aware that the tragedy would be so
historic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, she knows. So, bearing witness to Glenn's flight
in the city where McAuliffe taught social studies had special
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about Christa,'' Auger said.
</P>
<P>
   As her son paid rapt attention to simulated displays in a
shuttle mockup, Auger described how he had sat ``mesmerized'' by
the ``fire'' that thrust the shuttle skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice for him to see this, especially in a place like
this,'' Auger said.
</P>
<P>
   Planetarium director Jeanne Gerulskis decided only this week to
invite the public to a CNN broadcast of the launch.
</P>
<P>
   The planetarium had been deluged by so many calls asking whether
a special event was planned that Gerulskis decided to throw open
the doors free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the callers, Gerulskis said, ``I didn't know if anyone
would come.''
</P>
<P>
   The seats were quickly taken, and an overflow crowd watched the
launch from other venues in the planetarium complex.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the small dome, applause echoed off the curved walls as
Discovery hurtled toward space 19 minutes behind schedule. Until
that point, the planetarium had been eerily quiet as spectators
from infants to 80-year-olds were bathed in images of blue Florida
skies.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast was the first showing of a shuttle launch in the
planetarium, which opened in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, shuttle liftoffs had been carried by small TV
monitors in the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Gerulskis said she hoped that Glenn's journey will rekindle an
interest in the space program that has declined dramatically since
McAuliffe and six crewmates died over the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Vetter, the planetarium's development director, believes
such a resurgence is possible _ even though the scientific basis
for many shuttle missions does not grab the public's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's turnout bolsters that thinking, she said, and helps
reaffirm the planetarium's forward-looking mission instead of
dwelling on past tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Vetter said, the planetarium showed videos of
the Challenger explosion. Now, it was time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christa would have wanted us to move forward,'' Vetter said.
``Instead of showing Christa's story, we're showing Christa's
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   That vision may have been glimpsed by Melissa Cappucci, a
9-year-old from Concord.
</P>
<P>
   As she left the planetarium with her mother and younger brother,
Melissa talked excitedly of watching her first launch.
</P>
<P>
   She also talked of a new-found goal: ``I would like to walk on
the moon.''

<P>
   This summer I suffered a miscarriage. Although I had no
particular reason to worry that I might miscarry, it probably
featured more prominently as a possibility in my mind than it would
for most women.
</P>
<P>
   I study the history of the biomedical treatment of development
anomalies for a living, and so I knew going into my pregnancy about
the many ways human development can go fatally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to ease my concerns about future pregnancies, my husband,
a physician, declared it simply a case of what his colleagues call
PPP _ pretty poor protoplasm. It made sense. I tried to believe it.
I should have been able to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Why, just that week I had been working on an article about
genetic anomalies. When infants have birth defects, well-meaning
doctors often quiz parents, especially mothers, about their habits,
medications, family history and so on. This conveys to parents an
inadvertent message of blame.
</P>
<P>
   About a month later my friend Libby, who studies women's
experiences of pregnancy and birthing, came home from a long trip
to England. ``Out with it,'' she said. ``Tell me all the ways
you're blaming yourself.'' So I started to list the 14 or so ``my
fault'' explanations I had come up with, topping the list with my
personal favorite: A few days before the miscarriage, I
accidentally slammed my fingers in the garage door and a searing
pain went through my whole body. That's when it must have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Libby nodded at each explanation, and even offered a few more.
She had heard it all. Inhaling a sudden blast of jet exhaust. Too
much sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when we had come up with every explanation we could,
Libby said, ``You know, you'll never know why, and it probably
wasn't anything you did.'' I had to agree with her. After all, I'm
a science-minded person. The ``genetic bad luck'' explanation made
sense to me.
</P>
<P>
   I had to agree that, if slamming one's fingers in a garage door
really caused miscarriages, garage door sales would be up and
abortion clinic attendance down. So when Libby absolved me of the
explanations, I felt relief. And then I felt powerless.
</P>
<P>
   I sensed the presence of a kindred spirit lurking behind the
news reports of Judith Rich Harris' new book, ``The Nurture
Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do.'' Ms. Harris,
who has two daughters, clearly approached this work from a personal
point of view. She had raised her daughters in roughly the same way
by her account, and yet they had turned out tremendously different.
</P>
<P>
   After much research and thinking, Ms. Harris has concluded, as
her subtitle _ ``Parents Matter Less Than You Think and Peers
Matter More'' _ indicates, that parental influence may not matter
as much as peers' influence. Interviews with her betray the same
combination of feelings I felt after my talk with Libby: relief and
powerlessness.
</P>
<P>
   This strikes me as the trope of middle-class motherhood for the
1990s. Mothers are much less likely to slow down for their
pregnancies, much more likely to continue their careers as their
children develop pre- and postnatally.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us are quite willing to make the in-vogue motherhood
trade-off: a lot less perceived power in terms of our nurturing
abilities in exchange for a lot less guilt. We are happy to be able
to accept the possibility that our children will be fine if we get
them into a good day-care facility. Working mothers I talk with
like Ms. Harris' theory.
</P>
<P>
   But giving up the idea of motherly power takes away some of
motherhood's wonder. After my miscarriage, an older woman said to
me, ``You're so lucky to be living in an age when people won't
blame you for your miscarriage.'' I agreed, but I also thought,
``You were so lucky to think you could control what happened to
your baby.''
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years ago, medical men thought pregnant women had a
lot more power, and they worried about what would happen if that
power were redirected away from motherhood and gentle femininity
and toward careers and political concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Not unusual was the kind of book by C.J. Bayer, published in
1897: ``Maternal Impressions: A Study of Child Life Before and
After Birth, and Their Effect Upon Individual Life and Character.''
Bayer argued in favor of a theory popular for centuries, the belief
that the ``mother's mental influence'' _ her thoughts, desires and
fantasies _ could dispose a gestating child to turn out deformed,
physically or morally.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Bayer used as an example the Pomeroy case in Boston, where ``a
boy aged 14 enticed two children about 3 years old, into a church
and killed them in his insane desire to see blood flow,'' he wrote.
``At the trial, his mother testified that she often went to the
slaughterhouse to see her husband butcher, and it always pleased
her to see blood flowing. ... This was preceding the birth of this
boy,'' the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer could explain just about every ``abnormal'' child this
way. He anxiously advised prospective mothers to read at once his
chapters on ``Mothers' Longings'' and on epilepsy. (It doesn't seem
to have occurred to Bayer that his book might, by his logic, result
in an epidemic of problem children.)
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, this maternal impression theory held sway.
Mothers were warned not to desire or eat too many cherries, lest
their children come out with cherry-colored birth marks. Conjoined
twins, better known as Siamese twins, were banned from display in
Paris because the government feared it would cause a rash of such
births.
</P>
<P>
   My miscarriage would have been a cinch to explain under this
theory. After all, I was thinking and writing about genetic
anomalies when I miscarried: maternal impressions, pretty poor
protoplasm. During the next pregnancy, I should perhaps follow
Bayer's recommendation: Sit quietly, ``use judgment, and do not
brood over any particular idea.'' In other words, give up being a
teacher, writer, thinker. Not surprisingly, Bayer didn't believe
women should work outside the home and he didn't even want them to
socialize much during their pregnancies. (Parties have a way of
inducing wild desires.)
</P>
<P>
   One sort of picture, in Bayer's utopia, teams of socially
responsible citizens fanning out across the land to distract
pregnant mothers.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, I'll take the world of the stuff-just-happens
PPP theory, which lets me keep working. And if I should get lucky
with the next batch of protoplasm and have a child, and then, after
all, turn out to be a neglectful mother, and my child blames me?
Back to the science well for one more hit of guilt alleviation.
</P>
<P>
   A new gene theory, published in September, suggests that good
maternal behavior has a genetic basis, and that a mother's father
gives her those genes _ assuming the mother's mother doesn't shut
out his contribution. So this theory would allow me, in an
equal-opportunity twist, to blame my father for failing to endow me
with good maternal behavior. Or should I blame my mother for
shutting out his contribution?
</P>
<P>
   To say that middle-class mothers are generally shifting in the
direction of the guiltless-but-powerless self-image is not to say
that people have stopped worrying about how much power mothers
have. A new law in South Dakota subjects women who drink during
pregnancy to severe penalties. Clearly heavy drinking during
pregnancy leads to dangers like fetal alcohol syndrome. But where
are we going when we start to police mothers' prenatal power? Will
we return slowly to a time of blatant negative eugenics, in which
mothers' and fathers' genetic powers are policed, too? Would women
with no nurturing gene have to take parenting classes before having
children?
</P>
<P>
   I would feel less inclined to believe that we're on a slippery
slope toward genetically policed pregnancies if the discovery of
the ``gene of the week'' didn't always seem to carry an encoded
instruction about genetic guilt _ who should be blamed for passing
on or not passing on the featured gene.
</P>
<P>
   I am left with two questions and two tentative answers. First,
will there ever be a way to enjoy maternal power without suffering
maternal guilt? Probably not, because power is supposed to come
with responsibility, and responsibility entails guilt when
something goes wrong. Genetics only makes this formula more
evident.
</P>
<P>
   Second, how often is a theory accepted and disseminated
primarily because it fits our social and personal needs? In other
words, are perfectly viable theories sometimes aborted or neglected
not because they have inherent problems with evidence or logical
coherence, but because we just do not want them? When our desired
relationships to our physical offspring are threatened, I would
have to answer yes.

<P>
   After 87 years of alternating exuberance and disappointment, and
a decade following a famous conclave of physicists at which the key
to success seemed to be within reach, the world's first
superconducting power line is about to become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   A superconducting line is one that will conduct huge electrical
currents with far less resistance than that of a line made of metal
wire, and which therefore conserves energy.
</P>
<P>
   The first large-capacity superconducting line, to begin
operation by mid-2000 in Detroit, will be only 400 feet long. But
it will use only 250 pounds of a new kind of superconducting wire
to carry as much current as the 18,000 pounds of copper wire the
line will replace.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the line will demonstrate the practicability of
large-scale superconducting power transmission and will be the
first of many such lines. In announcing a contract providing for
federal support for the project, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
predicted two weeks ago that power lines like this one, exploiting
the special properties of ``high-temperature superconductors,''
could eventually save the nation $6 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit is that the electricity industry could sharply
reduce the pollution created by generating plants.
</P>
<P>
   Lengths of the same superconducting cable up to 50 yards long
have already been successfully tested, said Dr. Paul Grant, an
expert in superconductivity at the Electric Power Research
Institute in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The new power line will be built by a consortium that includes
the American Superconductor Co. of Westborough, Mass., which will
supply superconducting wire; Pirelli Cables and Systems of Milan,
Italy, which will assemble the wire into a power line; the Lotepro
Corp. of Valhalla, N.Y., which will supply refrigeration equipment
to keep liquid nitrogen circulating through the line, and the
Electric Power Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the line, intended to serve an urban redevelopment
project in Detroit, is estimated to be $5.5 million, $2.75 million
of which will be paid by the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Superconductivity was discovered in 1911 by a Dutch physicist,
Haike Kamerlingh Onnes, when he used liquid helium at a temperature
of minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit to chill metallic mercury. He found
that at that temperature mercury loses all resistance to electric
current.
</P>
<P>
   The physics of superconductivity is complex, and despite the
success of at least one theory, some questions remain. In general,
a superconductor undergoes changes when sufficiently cooled that
affect its ``conduction electrons,'' the normally free electrons
that wander through a metal and can carry an electric current.
</P>
<P>
   In the simplest type of superconductivity, these electrons
condense into pairs correlated with each other; the result is a
kind of electronic fluid that conducts electricity without
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Many metals were found to become superconductors when chilled
with liquid helium, but liquid helium is too expensive and
difficult to keep cold to be a practical coolant for large-scale
superconducting power transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, inventors have envisioned giant superconducting
storage rings that could provide huge amounts of power
instantaneously for city power grids, or to power military beam
weapons for use against ballistic missiles. Visionaries also
sketched designs for magnetically levitated trains riding on fields
generated by superconducting magnets.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the possibilities, the one that beckoned most
seductively was the dream of a superconducting power line _ one
that could reduce transmission losses to practically zero, saving
huge amounts of otherwise wasted energy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1911, several superconducting alloys, especially those
based on the metal niobium, have found applications in
superconducting magnets used for clinical diagnosis and in machines
that accelerate subnuclear particles for scientific investigations
of the nature of matter.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes for building a superconducting power line remained
unfulfilled. The main problem was that liquid helium is expensive
and has to be constantly cooled by powerful refrigerators as it
boils away.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers wished for some material that would become
superconductive at much higher temperatures than that of liquid
helium, perhaps even room temperature, or at least at the
temperature of liquid nitrogen, which is minus 320 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had all but given up hope of finding such a
substance, but in 1986, two physicists working at IBM's Zurich
Research Laboratory in Switzerland, Dr. Georg Bednorz and Dr. K.
Alex Muller, made a momentous discovery, for which they were
awarded a Nobel Prize a year later.
</P>
<P>
   They found that a new class of compounds called copper-oxide
perovskites (incorporating thin layers of copper and oxygen atoms)
became superconductive at temperatures well above that of liquid
nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of their discovery, scores of other scientists
turned up independent evidence of high-temperature
superconductivity, and on the night of March 18, 1987, physicists
packed a New York City hotel for a conference later dubbed the
``Woodstock of Physics.'' At the meeting, scientists presented 51
reports of new superconductivity experiments, and riotous optimism
dominated the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But experimenters soon realized that copper oxide perovskites
had a long way to go before they could be used for transmitting
large electric currents. In some formulations, large currents
destroyed superconductivity. It was also found that many
high-temperature superconductors were so brittle that they could
not be bent or fabricated into wire without breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem was ``creep.'' In high-temperature
superconductors, the current they carry induces a magnetic field
outside them. This field then penetrates the superconductor as a
lattice of ``vortex lines'' that define the superconductor's
electronic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   As long as these lattices remain fixed in place (or ``pinned,''
as scientists call it), superconductivity is maintained. But if the
lattices creep out of place, superconductivity ceases.
</P>
<P>
   Solving these problems took theoretical and experimental
research that spanned a decade after the 1986 ``Woodstock.'' But as
the euphoria faded, real progress ensued.
</P>
<P>
   American Superconductor drew technology from many sources,
acquiring dozens of patents and licenses that finally enabled the
company to produce a superconducting material suitable for a power
line.
</P>
<P>
   John Howe, a vice president of the company, identified the
superconductor it is using for the Detroit line as BSCCO-2223, a
finely powdered mixture of bismuth, strontium, calcium and copper
oxide, to which a dash of lead is added. (The numbers in the
formula denote the proportions of the elements in the compound.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We buy the powders commercially, mix them, pack them into
silver tubes, and then extrude the tubes through dies to make
microfilaments containing the superconductor,'' Howe said. ``Then
we bundle the filaments into wires, which we send to Pirelli for
fabrication into cables.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirelli company winds the wires helically around a channel
in which the cold liquid nigrogen flows, and then encases the
superconducting wire with layers of thermal and electrical
insulation. For the Detroit project, Pirelli expects to manufacture
the line in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting line does not eliminate electrical resistance
completely, Howe said. Where one fiber is in contact with another,
the superconductive electric current is interrupted. It must take
the form of ordinary current as it passes through the silver
cladding enclosing the BSCCO (pronounced ``bisco'') superconductor,
since the silver cladding is not a superconductor. Still, he said,
the capacity of the line will be three times as large as that of a
copper line.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the present four-inch-diameter copper power lines
connecting a key transformer station with the distribution grid in
Detroit will be replaced by three superconducting lines chilled
with liquid nitrogen circulating through the cable cores.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of this, Howe said, is that dispersing the
waste heat produced by a power line is a much less serious problem
for a superconducting line than for a conventional copper line.
This means that trenches dug for new lines can be narrower than
those for ordinary conductors, and this will reduce the right of
way utility companies must acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Each superconducting four-inch cable will carry 2,400 amps of
current at 2,400 volts.
</P>
<P>
   Grant of the Electric Power Research Institute, who spent most
of his career at IBM as a solid-state physicist, said that it might
be a long time before such lines were used over long distances. But
superconductors can greatly reduce power bottlenecks within
congested cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A major use that may come soon will be in transformers, Grant
predicted. A superconducting transformer will contain no oil to
catch fire or spill causing toxic pollution, and would be a boon
for utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, optimism pervades the community of scientists and
engineers working on applications of superconductivity.
</P>
<P>
   The contract to build the new Detroit power line, Richardson
said, opens ``the gateway to the electricity superhighway of the
future'' that will ``transform the power delivery systems of the
world.''

EARLY CLUES TO THE ELECTION NIGHT TREND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Tuesday, Nov. 3, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Face it, it's going to be a long night for the
politically crazed. But for normal people with jobs to get to,
there's still a way to get a sense of the election results without
joining the junkies after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   On television, the trick is to take the right clues from the
statewide races where the polls close first, and from a
representative sampling of usually under-covered House races. It is
more than possible to get the drift before the big ones out here
check in after 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, is my cheat sheet:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; 6 O'CLOCK &QC; 
 &LR;  _Kentucky is traditionally a decent barometer of national trends,
but this year it is an off-year gem. The Senate seat opened by
Democrat Wendell Ford's retirement is must-carry for each party and
is a very tight race between two congressmen, one a GOP Hall of
Fame pitcher (Jim Bunning), the other an early 1960s captain of one
of Adolph Rupp's famous UK basketball teams (Scotty Baesler).
</P>
<P>
   And that race has opened up two of the country's closest 32
incumbent-less House races, for Bunning's 4th District seat in the
east and Baesler's 6th District in central Kentucky. In addition,
the 3d District, which includes Louisville, presents a good example
(in Republican Anne Northrup) of an incumbent who should win but
who has been pressed. If you watch on cable, House results are
constantly scrolled across the bottom of your TV.
</P>
<P>
   _Indiana is almost as good, with three House seats likely to
provide quick clues to the national trend. In the
Indianapolis-centered 10th District, Democratic freshman Julia
Carson is like Northrup _ favored but pressed.
</P>
<P>
   But to the south, along the Ohio River are two much closer
races. In the southwestern 8th, New Right Republican John
Hostettler is again in a tight one. And right next door in the 9th,
from which veteran Democrat Lee Hamilton is retiring, the race is
also close and one the GOP badly needs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; 7 O'CLOCK &QC; 
 &LR;  _The clues at this hour will be about the Deep South. In Florida,
Jeb Bush is favored to be elected governor on his second try.
Barring a gigantic upset, the real issue here is how quickly the
networks call it, and how close Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay
makes it, an early hint about the intensity of Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   _Georgia is another state where the GOP has a decent shot at
picking up a governor's office. But here the race between
businessman Guy Millner and legislative leader Roy Barnes has been
very close and polluted by race-baiting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; 7:30 P.M. &QC; 
 &LR;  _North Carolina ia a doozie this year. Not only is the critical
Senate fight between GOP Senator Lauch Faircloth and wealthy lawyer
John Edwards a nail-biter, but three of the mercurial state's 12
House districts (all currently Democratic) are in play as well.
Faircloth's campaign will provide a clue to sentiment about the
president because he has used a ``Clinton Clone'' motif to tar his
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2d District around Raleigh, freshman Bob Etheridge has an
anti-Clinton-advertising opponent; and Representative Mel Watt, who
is on the Judiciary Committee, has been pushed in the 12th to
Etheridge's west. Perhaps the Republicans best chance at a pickup
is in the textile-oriented 8th, from which 12-termer Bill Hefner is
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   _Ohio will also provide early clues. In the governor's race,
former Democratic Attorney General Lee Fisher has trailed Bob Taft
all fall, but he has hung around. The result and the margin will
hint at Democratic turnout because this race has seen a major
investment of labor union resources on Fisher's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Two House races here are also critical. In the 1st District
around Cincinnati, a Gingrich Revolutionary, Representative Steve
Chabot, has had to work to keep a seat that has a large percentage
of potential black voters. And in the 6th to the southeast,
Democratic Representative Ted Strickland is having another close
race, this time with Lieutenant Governor Nancy Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AFTER 8 O'CLOCK &QC; 
 &LR;  This is when the deluge starts. On TV, the key Senate and
governor races are easy to follow, but the House races are tougher.
If you follow on cable, some order is possible by watching for
results in the following 12 races:
</P>
<P>
   _Nonstunners. As with Representatives Northrup and Carson above,
look for the numbers on two Democrats: Frank Pallone Jr. in New
Jersey's 6th District and Jerry Costello in Illinois' rural 12th;
and two Republicans: freshman Heather Wilson in New Mexico's 1st
and Dick Baker in Louisiana's Baton Rouge-based 6th.
</P>
<P>
   _Weak Incumbents. Two embattled Democrats' fates will be
revealing: Jay Johnson out of Wisconsin's 8th District and Lane
Evans downstate in Illinois' 17th District. The same goes for two
Republicans: Bill Redmond in New Mexico's 3d and Vince Snowbarger
in Kansas's 3d District.
</P>
<P>
   _Open Seats. These provide the best chances for party shifts,
and here are four critical ones: the fights for Colorado's 2d
District, from which Democrat David Scaggs is retiring; eastern
Pennsylvania's 15th, which is losing a rare pro-impeachment
Democrat, Paul McHale; Idaho's 2d District, which Republican Mike
Crapo is leaving for the Senate; and Mississippi's 4th, where GOP
Representative Mike Parker is moving on for a possible run for
governor next year.
</P>
<P>
   _Impeachment. Those much-publicized anti-Clinton TV ads were
spread around more than two dozen House districts in the final
days. If I had to pick one place to gauge their impact early, it
would be the 5th District in up-country South Carolina, represented
by a veteran Democrat, John Spratt.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are 24 House races referred to here. If you hit
the hay before midnight and the GOP hasn't won 15 of them, it's in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So enjoy.

 KING OF BINGE EATERS  
 RETURN OF THE KILLER TREES  
 SOUPING UP LIGHTNING  

</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   One of the obstacles to studying regulatory biology is that most
animals are just too well-mannered to be good subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation of many metabolic processes is linked to the
intake of food, and since most animals (including humans) eat
relatively small meals fairly often, demand on these processes
varies only modestly. Better for research would be a creature that
gorges itself between lengthy fasts.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Burmese python, perhaps the ultimate binge eater,
which can subsist for up to a year on one meal _ a large mammal
that it swallows whole. Two researchers at UCLA, writing in the
journal Nature, argue that these snakes (particularly juveniles,
which fancy more manageable rats or mice come mealtime) make ideal
subjects for study because their regulatory responses are so
extreme.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the scientists say, a young python's post-meal
metabolic rate (measured by oxygen consumption) reaches a peak 44
times the pre-meal level. But a dog, the mammal with the highest
known rate increase, has a peak only twice the fasting level.
</P>
<P>
   A python's kidneys grow to twice normal size during digestion;
the kidneys of most mammals show little enlargement. And a snake's
stomach juices go from a pH of 7 (neutral) to 1 (highly acidic)
within a day and stay that way for a week.
</P>
<P>
   All those swings make for easier experimentation. And juvenile
pythons offer other advantages, the researchers note, not the least
of which is that because they eat so rarely, feeding and cleaning
up after them is a snap.
</P>
<P>
   A decade or so ago, Democrats had fun with Ronald Reagan's
remarks supposedly linking trees to pollution. But, in fact,
scientists have long thought trees could contribute to the creation
of organic aerosols, airborne particles that are responsible for
cloud formation and that in some conditions can be hazardous to
health.
</P>
<P>
   Solid evidence of a tree-aerosol link has been lacking, however,
until now. Researchers from the University of Crete in Greece have
shown how some hydrocarbons emitted by eucalyptus trees are
oxidized by sunlight into organic acids, which in turn condense
into aerosols.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has ever been downwind of a eucalyptus grove
knows, the trees are quite fragrant, emitting vaporous compounds,
including some hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   Using air samples collected from a 65-foot tower in a eucalyptus
forest in Portugal, the researchers found an abundance of tiny
aerosols, known as Aitken nuclei, that could only have been
produced locally.
</P>
<P>
   They also found that the main components of the aerosols were
two forms of an organic acid that were created by the oxidation of
the eucalyptus hydrocarbons. And they showed that the concentration
of the compounds was highest in the afternoons, as photo-oxidation
took place.
</P>
<P>
   So while a forest is not exactly a polluter, by contributing to
cloud formation it may be a climate-creator.
</P>
<P>
   One of the other things that forests do is occasionally burn up.
And weather experts in this country have found that smoke from
forest fires can change lightning's electrical characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Vast fires in southern Mexico last spring produced smoke that
carried into the central United States. The researchers studied
lightning flashes then and found a far higher percentage than
normal had a positive, as opposed to negative, charge.
</P>
<P>
   What difference does polarity make? Although all lightning bolts
pack enough of a wallop to kill anyone unlucky enough to be in the
way, lightning with a positive electrical charge generally has a
higher peak current. The current also lingers longer, which can
cause more forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in a recent issue of Science,
speculate that the smoke aerosols may alter the size of droplets
within a thundercloud, and that can affect how an electrical charge
develops.

`DOTCOMS' GIVE WOLFE EARLY BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe's new novel, ``A Man in Full,'' won't be on bookstore
shelves until Nov. 6, but it is already a marketing phenomenon,
racking up thousands of advance orders on the ``dotcoms,'' the
book-selling Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   And publishing industry watchers predict that with a 1.2-million
copy launch, it will debut at No. 1 on the first-possible New York
Times best-seller list _ probably that of Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it will be No. 1,'' said Daisy Maryles, executive
editor of Publisher's Weekly, the trade magazine. ``People wait for
a Tom Wolfe. He doesn't write every year.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the unreleased ``A Man in Full'' was No. 2 in
sales at Amazon.com, the Seattle-based virtual bookstore, edged out
only by the latest Oprah Winfry book club selection, ``Midwives,''
by Vermonter Chris Bohjalian.
</P>
<P>
   While Amazon.com refuses to give out sales figures on individual
titles, public relations director Bill Curry said ``it's not
unusual to see a book go to No. 1 on our bestseller list before the
book is in the stores.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Amazon.com sales are being rung up without heavy
promotion _ other than the 40 percent discount it gives to all the
``selected featured titles,'' shipping not included. On Friday,
Curry noted, the Wolfe book was not being promoted on either of its
high-profile sites, its Homepage or its Daily Scoop.
</P>
<P>
   But, Curry added, the hourly updating of its sales ranking acts
like an instant bestseller list, letting readers know ``what's
going on in the world right now, not last week or a month ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly heavy advance sales have been registered on Amazon.com
for other blockbuster novels earlier this year _ John Grisham's
``Street Lawyer,'' Tom Clancy's ``Rainbow Six,'' and Stephen King's
``Bag of Bones.''
</P>
<P>
   As one indication of the widespread early interest in ``A Man in
Full,'' publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux has moved the
publication date up from Nov. 12 to Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things broke faster than they thought,'' said Maryles
_ among them the novel being chosen as a finalist for the 1998
National Book Awards, a Time magazine cover story for its Nov. 2
issue, and jump-the-gun reviews in nationally circulated papers
such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In the industry, a 1.2 million-copy launch is big, but not
monumental. This year, Grisham's ``Street Lawyer'' had a 2.8
million first printing, Clancy's ``Rainbow Six'' 2 million, and
King's ``Bag of Bones'' 1.31 million.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of all the buzz and hype is a 742-page novel _ the
kind that reviewers will inevitably call ``sprawling'' _ set in
Atlanta. It involves an aging real estate developer facing the loss
of his 28,000-acre plantation when his business ventures go sour.
Just as Wolfe's 1987 bestseller, ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' was
set in motion by a racial incident, ``A Man in Full'' takes off
when a local black football hero is accused of raping the daughter
of a prominent white businessman.
</P>
<P>
   The National Book Award nomination came as a surprise to many
editors and reviewers because review copies did not become
available until several days after the finalists were announced
Oct. 14. The aggressive prepublication marketing of ``A Man in
Full'' is feeding off the nomination, as well as the Time cover.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's ``book detail page'' notice states that the book
``is not yet available. You may still order this title. We will
ship it when it is released by the publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Brown, vice president of marketing at Farrar, Straus,
said that under its agreements with distributors, ``all the dotcoms
will begin fulfilling their advance orders on the same day we let
the bookstores put it on sale.''

   Sharon McCormack of White Salmon, Wash., loved windsurfing the
Columbia River Gorge, but she had a problem on the big jumps: Her
contact lenses washed out. ``Or I got dust under a lens,'' she
said. ``That's incredibly painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCormack solved the problem by having laser surgery to
correct her nearsightedness. More than 400,000 laser vision
procedures will be done this year, industry sources say, most of
them for nearsightedness, or myopia, like Ms. McCormack's. But next
year, farsighted surfers and others may be having laser surgery,
too.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Food and Drug
Administration recommended approval of a laser to treat
farsightedness, or hyperopia.
</P>
<P>
   Final approval by the agency is expected by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that Americans will be treated for farsightedness
with lasers next year,'' said Dr. Scott MacRae, associate professor
of ophthalmology at the Casey Eye Institute at the Oregon Health
Sciences University in Portland. MacRae has also served on the FDA
Ophthalmic Devices Panel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two lasers used to treat myopia and myopia with astigmatism
are approved by the federal agency. The basic procedures,
photorefractive keratotomy (PRK) and laser in-situ keratomileusis
(Lasik), remove tiny bits of the cornea to flatten it so light
focuses more precisely on the retina. PRK shapes the cornea's
surface; Lasik, a mid-corneal method, vaporizes or ablates the
middle of the cornea rather than the front to improve focus.
</P>
<P>
   Farsightedness, however, is more difficult to correct, MacRae
said. In the new procedure, a laser will be used to sculpture the
area in the periphery of the cornea, in effect, making the center
steeper and bringing the focus from behind the retina to the
retina.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're doing for the nearsighted is a crewcut to the
cornea,'' MacRae said. ``For the farsighted, you have the trickier
job of steepening the cornea.''
</P>
<P>
   A variation of farsightedness that the new procedures will not
treat is presbyopia, the gradual, age-related condition of suddenly
fuzzy print and the necessity of reading glasses. ``About the time
you turn 40, the eyes start to lose their capability to focus
sharply for near vision,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Weaver, director of the
Clinical Care Center at the American Optometric Association in St.
Louis. ``These new laser procedures won't affect presbyopia,
because the condition is not due to the cornea. It comes about as
the lens loses its ability to accommodate or focus sharply for near
vision, a loss of elasticity that is inevitable as we age.''
</P>
<P>
   The new laser methods to treat farsightedness are expected to
cost at least $4,000 and probably will not be covered by most
insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver cautions that any laser treatment should be approached
thoughtfully. ``PRK and Lasik for myopia have been very
successful,'' he said. ``People are usually quite happy with the
outcomes, unlike older surgeries like radial keratotomy.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful a procedure, though, risks remain.
``Surgeons doing Lasik actually slice off the front surface of the
eye, flip it back, do the laser procedure, and then return the flap
to its place,'' Weaver said. ``There's always the small possibility
that the flap may become dislodged. You have to weigh the risk
against how much you want to get rid of your glasses or contact
lenses.''

HOT AND COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. It seems that women are more sensitive to temperature changes
than men. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sensitivity to temperature is much more complicated than a
simple Mars-Venus split, physiologists say. The reaction depends on
many factors, like exercise, previous conditioning, diseases and
any other tinkering with the complex system of signals to and from
the hypothalamus that sets the body's temperature controls.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors suspect psychological factors make a difference,
but it is difficult to separate psychological reactions based on
strong aversion to heat or cold from physiological responses. It is
also possible that women do not dress as warmly.
</P>
<P>
   But some male-female physiological differences may be
significant in this area. Women tend to have more subcutaneous body
fat than men, making them more likely to have a hard time
dissipating body heat when temperatures rise. But women may do
better than men as a room cools, because fat holds heat.
</P>
<P>
   Larger animals have a smaller surface area relative to their
volume than smaller animals, so they can stand colder temperatures
with less heat loss. Men as a group are larger than women, although
the size difference may not be enough to cause different reactions
to temperature changes.
</P>
<P>
   Some conditions, including an overactive thyroid, which is more
common in women, can also cause hypersensitivity to heat. &QL;

   Brandy Norwood _ known professionally simply as Brandy _ is a
one-girl entertainment conglomerate: Star of UPN's hit sitcom
``Moesha,'' star of the recently released album ``Never Say
Never,'' co-star of ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,''
opening Nov. 13. And, believe it or not, she's still only 19.
Brandy talks with New York-based free-lance writer Ian Spelling
about the new film, co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt, why it took her
four years to follow up her multiplatinum debut album ``Brandy''
and why she's having trouble finding a boyfriend. (slugged:

<P>
   The most remarkable thing about NBC's new sitcom, ``Will &AMP;
Grace,'' is not that it's been a ratings hit in a year when most
new shows have collapsed, or even that it's holding its own against
formidable competition from ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Monday Night
Football.'' It's that there's been virtually no controversy over a
show whose two main characters _ roommates, no less _ are a
straight woman and a gay man. Stars Eric McCormack and Debra
Messing talk with Canadian TV Guide editor-in-chief Christopher
Loudon about the series, why they think viewers have accepted the
gay Will when they resisted a lesbian character on last year's
``Ellen,'' when and if the show will explore such dicey topics as
dating and gay sex, and why they feel the show can best serve the
gay community by being funny. (slugged:

   Don't call her ``big-boned.'' Don't call her ``amply

her size is her talent? Fresh from winning an Emmy for her role in
``The Practice'' and already on multiplex screens in Todd Solondz's
controversial ``Happiness,'' Manheim talks with Chicago-based
free-lance writer Cindy Pearlman about the new movie, the series,
her Emmy win, the diet-pills episode that almost killed her and
why, at 37, she's finally comfortable with who and what she is.

   Bebe Neuwirth has two Emmy Awards from ``Cheers'' and a Tony
apiece for ``Sweet Charity'' and ``Chicago,'' but all anyone wants
to ask her about is a scene in Woody Allen's new film,
``Celebrity,'' opening nationwide Nov. 20, in which she utilizes a
banana in giving Judy Davis a lesson in oral-sex technique.
Neuwirth talks with Hollywood-based free-lance writers Jeanne Wolf
and Shep Morgan about the new film, her memories of ``Cheers,'' how
she enjoyed working with the idiosyncratic Allen and why she
herself is both comfortable and uncomfortable with her own fame.

THE SAME BRANDY IN THREE DIFFERENT BOTTLES

 Includes a color slide of Brandy with Jennifer Love Hewitt in a
scene from ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's all about self-expression for Brandy Norwood.
 &HT;    ``I feel that I'm definitely expressing myself when I sing,''
says the multitalented 19-year-old, who uses the single name Brandy
professionally. ``With acting, I'm not really expressing myself _
I'm expressing myself through another character. Singing is all me.
It's all about the way I feel about life.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, she says, ``If somebody put a gun to my head and
said I could only sing or act, I'd act. First of all, I could play
a singer, and second I could do the soundtracks for my movies.''
 &HT;    She may express herself as a singer, and she does have a new hit
album, ``Never Say Never,'' but Brandy has a lot more to offer.
Last year, she co-starred with Whitney Houston and Whoopi Goldberg
in a high-rated television-film version of Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein's
``Cinderella,'' and she's a household name as the star of the
popular television show, ``Moesha.''
 &HT;    Rounding out the triple-threat lineup is a movie career. Her
first feature, ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' slashes
into theaters nationwide on Nov. 13.
 &HT;    No one will confuse ``I Still Know'' with the lighthearted fun
of ``Moesha,'' or for that matter with ``Cinderella.'' Brandy's
character, Karla, and her college roommate Julie (Jennifer Love
Hewitt) get chased around the Bahamas by the same killer fisherman
who tried to take a hook to Julie in ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``It was very different from anything else I'd done, because
there was a lot of physical work I had to do,'' Brandy says by
cellular phone from Los Angeles. ``Karla's a kickboxer, and I had
to have this tough-girl attitude, and I also had to have this sexy,
sassy type of image that I'm not used to.
 &HT;    ``I'm more used to being like Moesha or Cinderella or Brandy,''
she says. ``Karla is a really different kind of girl. If I met a
girl like her, I'd want to be her friend because she's so cool.
She's not corny, but she's down to earth. She loves her best friend
and she protects her.''
 &HT;    On the set, Brandy and Hewitt hit it off, which makes perfect
sense. They're both young and beautiful, they're both
actress/singers with hit television shows and they both know the
ups and downs of life as a teen idol.
 &HT;    ``When Love and I meet up, we're always goofing around,'' Brandy
says. ``Once or twice we talked about the pressures of having to be
role models. People look up to us and expect us to be such good
girls, so squeaky clean, and sometimes we want to be able to make
mistakes.''
 &HT;    With ``I Still Know'' ready for release, it's back to ``Moesha''
for Brandy. The sitcom, now in its fourth season, is the fledging
UPN network's highest-rated series.
 &HT;    ``Everybody's getting along, having a good time,'' Brandy says.
``I'm really happy that I'm still doing TV, because at one point I
wanted to just go on and sing.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to do the show until the writers can't come up with
anything else,'' she says cheerfully. ``I don't want to put a time
limit on it, because I just might get what I ask for, and I might
not want that.
 &HT;    ``I change my mind every other week,'' she adds, ``so it's
better if I just keep working and do it until they can't write for
Moesha anymore.''
 &HT;    Beyond the film and the series, there's ``Never Say Never,'' an
Atlantic Records release that is her first album since 1994's
multiplatinum disk, ``Brandy.'' Released in June, ``Never''
features the hit single ``The Boy Is Mine,'' a duet with her fellow
single-named pop sensation, Monica.
 &HT;    She let four years pass between albums, Brandy says, for the
simplest and oldest of reasons: fear of the sophomore jinx.
 &HT;    ``I was so used to acting and everybody was so used to seeing me
on TV that I was scared to come back out with a new album,'' she
says.
 &HT;    ``Everybody says that the second album is what really counts,''
she adds. ``You can have one hit album, but when you come back you
will not do as well as you did the first time. So that's the test,
the second album.
 &HT;    ``To come back so strong, to have people like Monica and Mase
work on it with me, to have producers like Rodney Jerkins and David
Foster, to have the record company behind me, was great,'' the
young star says. ``So I'm blessed.''
 &HT;    When ``Moesha'' finishes production for the season, probably in
April, Brandy hopes to squeeze in a short concert tour in support
of ``Never Say Never.'' She's already at work on ``Double
Platinum,'' a television movie whose mother-daughter storyline
pairs two generations of pop stardom: Diana Ross and Brandy. And
then there's the seemingly inevitable ``I Still Know III,''
assuming that the current sequel merit another follow-up and should
a script meet with all the right approvals.
 &HT;    Away from the glare of the spotlight, Brandy lives with her
parents in Los Angeles. She hangs out with friends whenever
possible and, since ending a relationship with Boyz II Men singer
Wanya Morris, has kept her eyes open for boyfriend prospects.
 &HT;    ``Do you have anybody you could hook me up with?'' she asks
playfully.
 &HT;    She's kidding, but it's a complicated subject. A 19-year-old
with her own television show, movie deal and record contract can't
just mingle at a party. It's one of a great many teen-age things
that Brandy has had to deal with.
 &HT;    ``I really don't feel like I've missed anything,'' she says.
``Sometimes my social life gets a little crammed and I can't do it
like I want to do it. But it doesn't matter, because I bring my
social life into what I do, into whatever I'm working on.
 &HT;    ``I hated junior high school and high school, because nobody
liked me,'' she adds. ``So I'm glad something took me out of that.
I didn't think those days would ever end. I thought I'd go through
the torture, get out of high school, go to college and all of that.
 &HT;    ``But I always had the dream that I was going to be something,
that I'd be someone.''
 &HT;    If millions of albums sold, starring roles in television shows
and feature films, and countless adoring fans a somebody make,
Brandy has definitely accomplished that goal.
 &HT;    ``I'm somebody people look up to,'' she says. ``That's a key
thing, that I'm appreciated.
 &HT;    ``I feel that people appreciate me and really take what I do
seriously,'' the actress says. ``That's why I take what I do so
seriously _ I know there are a lot of people depending on me and
counting on me to do the right thing.
 &HT;    ``I want to do this for a long time,'' Brandy says. ``Then
again, I want to have a family. I'll have to take a break, do that
and come back.
 &HT;    ``I want to come in and out of this business, if the business
will let me.''

 Includes a color slide of Debra Messing and Eric McCormack in a
scene from ``Will &AMP; Grace.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The revolution was indeed televised, but hardly anyone noticed.
</P>
<P>
   This past September, NBC launched ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' an
unorthodox sitcom about two best friends/roommates who happen to be
a gay man and a straight woman _ and nobody raised an eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   No advertiser boycotts, no hassles with network censors, no
fire-and-brimstone condemnation from fundamentalist preachers.
Nothing but rave reviews and millions of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the show's initial success _ it's already crushed
one Monday-night competitor, ``The Brian Benben Show,'' and is
holding its own against formidable opponents ``Ally McBeal'' and
``Monday Night Football'' _ producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick
remain caught in a dilemma: If it's perceived that they're
soft-pedaling their character's gayness, gay advocates will scream
foul. If the show becomes preachy or overtly political, its
hard-won audience might flip back to ``Ally'' or football.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest episode in a decades-old debate: Is television's
responsibility simply to entertain or also to inform and educate?
</P>
<P>
   Eric McCormack, the Toronto-born actor who plays Will _ and who,
for the record, is straight _ thinks the answer is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why push the envelope if it's going to put you off the air in
six episodes?'' he says. ``It makes no sense. Our producers very
much want the show to be around for a long time. They want the gay
audience to love it, they want the straight audience to love it,
they want the old and the young to love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody asks, `When are we going to see two men kiss? When
are we going to see two men in bed?' And the answer is, when it's
time. Not time for the network, but time for Will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that's bothered me in all of the critical
reaction was how people responded to Will having just ended a
relationship as `convenient' _ like the writers were hiding behind
it,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is about Will and Grace. So of course it's
convenient,'' the actor says. ``It's actually brilliant _ a
brilliant way to explore this friendship for a while and get them
to the point where the audience is saying, `Gee, I want them to
both start dating nice people _ when are they both gonna find a
nice fella?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually we will break barriers,'' he promises, ``and we
will surprise people. But we're not going to do it overnight,
because I don't think anybody wants that immediately. They want to
love the characters first.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuddled next to McCormack on his dressing-room couch, co-star
Debra Messing nods in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the smartest way to launch the show,'' she says. ``You
can't root for the characters until you know them, and it was so
clever to have both of us out of relationships, so the audience
could fall in love with our friendship and make an investment in
these characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, accusations continue to fly that the series is ducking
the hard ones. Will is a successful, self-employed lawyer, so
there's little risk of workplace discrimination. And to date the
show has been populated only with characters who embrace Will's
lifestyle _ he hasn't had to deal with homophobia or aggressively
defend his way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, anything the audience might perceive as
stereotypically gay behavior has been deflected onto Will's best
friend, Jack (Sean Hayes), who's much more the standard ``flaming''
gay.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack doesn't see Jack as an evasion, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stereotype is dangerous when it stands alone, when it is the
only example of what's shown, when the gay community is represented
solely by one character who's limp-wristed and lisping,'' he says.
``But by having a Will, we earn a Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of flamboyant characters like Jack in the gay
community,'' he adds. ``They're not ashamed of themselves, nor
should they be. But if that's the only thing you see, the rest of
the community says, `There's more to us than that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tendency to think of all gay people as Jacks,'' the
actor says. ``If gay people are also like Will, well, then it could
be your brother or your dad or your son. That's something very
scary to the average person, that a really terrific lawyer and a
really terrific friend could also be gay. And those people need to
learn that they shouldn't be so scared.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main point, McCormack says _ wary of the controversy
that enveloped ABC's ``Ellen'' last year after the title character
``came out'' as a lesbian and the series became heavily gay-themed
_ is that ``Will &AMP; Grace'' will continue to stress entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it will be is a show with lots of good-looking guys,'' he
says with a laugh, ``because all four of the main characters want
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And it really is a four-person show, despite its two-person
title. McCormack and Messing already have a relaxed, innately
humorous chemistry, and Hayes has flashed Emmy potential with his
unbridled yet poignantly sympathetic portrayal of Jack. The series'
fourth star, Megan Mullavy as Grace's well-connected but hopelessly
inept assistant Karen, is emerging as the best scene-stealer since
``Cybill's'' Christine Baranski.
</P>
<P>
   Most valuable of all, McCormack says, is the creative guidance
of Kohan and Mutchnick, who rival ``Seinfeld's'' Larry David and
Jerry Seinfeld in their ability to craft a quartet of characters
who are as believable as they are lovable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max and David are the voices of these characters,'' McCormack
says. ``Recently someone asked Max what qualified the two of them
to write this show, and he said, `Well, I'm a gay man, and Dave's a
straight woman.'''
</P>
<P>
   Messing laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there wasn't one gay person on the creative staff, I'd be
concerned,'' McCormack adds. ``But there's Max, who's gay, and
David, who's not. Together they really are Will and Grace. They've
created this landmark television relationship that's so new and so
rich and ground-breaking _ but funny first.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the two of them around, I know I don't have to question a
single thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The series has already started to take ``baby steps'' toward
dealing more directly with gay issues, McCormack adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Halloween episode,'' he says, ``Will's biggest client,
Harlan, asks Will and Grace to baby-sit his two children without a
second thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we filmed it,'' the actor says, ``I didn't think anything
of it. Then afterward Max said to me, `Do you know what an
important statement this is? That a conservative Texan would
automatically trust a gay man with his kids?'
</P>
<P>
   ``So we may not be sending out powerful political messages, but
you can't dismiss what we're doing as fluff, either.''
</P>
<P>
   For Messing, the show's impact has already been proven _ not by
big ratings, but by a single piece of fan mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most moving thing that's happened so far,'' the actress
says, ``is that I got a letter from this 18-year-old guy in
Arizona, who said, `I just came out three months ago, and my
mother's pretty OK with it, but my best friend won't speak to me
anymore, and I really wish I had a Grace in my life.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That, to me, was truly amazing. That's really great.''

CAMRYN MANHEIM: THE NEXT BIG THING, AND PROUD OF IT

 Includes a color slide of Camryn Manheim in a scene from ``The
Practice.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rosie O'Donnell isn't noted for subtlety.
 &HT;    The day after Camryn Manheim won a Best Supporting Actress Emmy
for her role on ABC's ``The Practice,'' a bouquet of flowers from
the morning maven arrived in Manheim's dressing room.
 &HT;    ``Rosie wrote, `Fat Girls Rule!''' Manheim whoops.
 &HT;    In this case, bigger is better, and Manheim doesn't mind talking
about it. She doesn't call herself ``big-boned'' or ``amply
proportioned'' or any other euphemism _ but what else would you
expect from a woman who once wrote and starred in a one-woman show
called ``Wake Up! I'm Fat''?
 &HT;    Manheim is the anti-Ally McBeal, and she's reveling in it.
During an interview in her dressing room she gets a call from her
publicist, announcing that People wants her for an upcoming cover.
 &HT;    ``All right!'' Manheim screams into the receiver. ``This is just
so cool!''
 &HT;    Television's new big star is even on the big screen nowadays,
appearing in Todd Solondz's controversial new film ``Happiness'' as
an enigmatic loner.
 &HT;    ``It's really the darkest role I've ever done,'' she says, ``but
I loved the script. Todd is a brilliant director, and I thought it
would be fun to explore someone who is really messed up.''
 &HT;    When she won the Emmy, the 37-year-old dedicated her award to
``all the fat girls out there.'' And she wasn't kidding.
 &HT;    ``I am the girl who was told she would never make it in
Hollywood,'' she says, her voice cracking. ``I was told that there
was no place for fat girls.''
 &HT;    Manheim laughs.
 &HT;    ``I guess it's a good thing that I've always been someone who
can't accept no for an answer,'' she says.
 &HT;    Believe it or not, Manheim says, she didn't get teased as a
child. And why should she? She was a thin little girl, she says.
Popular. Accepted. Happy. It was her sister who was overweight.
 &HT;    ``When I was 13, we swapped,'' she says. ``She got thin and I
got fat.''
 &HT;    The catalyst was the family's move to Los Angeles, she says.
 &HT;    ``I overate because we moved from the East Coast to California,
where people shopped for groceries in bikinis,'' she says. ``It was
all about being skinny in L.A. That freaked me out. I think to
prevent having to show off my body, I built up my own defense
system.''
 &HT;    Her parents weren't supportive, she admits.
 &HT;    ``They claimed it was for my own benefit,'' she recalls. ``They
didn't want my life to be hard. But it wounded me greatly to think
I wasn't lovable just the way I was. It became a cruel circle of
`We love you _ lose weight,' and me saying, `If you love me, leave
me alone.'''
 &HT;    High school was a nightmare, the actress adds.
 &HT;    ``Every teen girl magazine told me my body was not desirable and
it was ugly,'' Manheim says. ``At age 37, the fact that I have any
self-worth is a miracle.''
 &HT;    She tried to lose weight many times, but always failed.
 &HT;    ``The only diet program that ever worked for me was
amphetamines,'' she adds. ``I lost about 20 pounds very quickly.''
 &HT;    She also almost overdosed on the pills.
 &HT;    ``Finally I said, `Enough is enough,''' she recalls. ``I wasn't
going to risk my health to wear size-eight jeans. It just wasn't
worth the cost.
 &HT;    ``I figured I had two choices when it came to Hollywood,''
Manheim says. ``I could conform and be the standard of beauty, or I
could do some real soul-searching and say, `Love yourself and your
talent, no matter what size you are.'''
 &HT;    In Hollywood she has experienced size discrimination, she says,
but she doesn't have horror stories.
 &HT;    ``Once I would get a part, it wouldn't be a case of makeup
artists talking about hiding my double chin,'' she says. ``I'm a
big girl. I am what I am. There is no way to hide it.
 &HT;    ``If a movie or TV show wants me, then they get all of me. I
have nothing to hide.''
 &HT;    Working days as an interpreter for the deaf, Manheim began
making the rounds to audition, and began to snag an occasional
television role.
 &HT;    ``I spent the early part of my acting career playing the best
friend of the pretty girl, because casting agents decided I was
sexually undesirable at this weight, but I was also
non-threatening,'' she says. ``I think the line I've uttered more
than anyone else in this business is, `Really? Then what
happened?'''
 &HT;    She got away from best-friend roles in a short stint on ``All My
Children.''
 &HT;    ``I was the prison warden,'' she says. ``I was always made up to
look about 10 years older and matronly. Drab clothes, no makeup. I
was told that I was lucky to get these roles.''
 &HT;    Finally the lack of opportunities for major parts led Manheim to
write ``Wake Up! I'm Fat,'' the hit Off-Broadway show which she is
now expanding into a book. In turn, the show led to an audition for
``The Practice,'' and a surprise.
 &HT;    Attorney Ellenor Frutt isn't a best-friend role, the actress
found. She wears makeup, dresses beautifully and even has a sex
life.
 &HT;    ``That was a real breakthrough,'' Manheim says. ``For years, in
Hollywood no one wanted to see a big woman kiss somebody. The
attitude was that big women aren't sexy and men don't love them.
I'm trying my best to destroy that myth.''
 &HT;    Which leads to her biggest ambition for Ellenor.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to sleep with Dylan McDermott's character on the
show,'' she says with a devilish smile. ``Hell, he has slept with
everyone else in that law office. I figure I'm next.
 &HT;    ``I'd also love to have a serious, passionate love affair with a
sex symbol in a film,'' she says. ``That would be ground-breaking.
I wish Hollywood would think about me with Tom Cruise or Kevin
Costner. I think real women would especially be jazzed to see it.''
 &HT;    In real life the tabloids have linked Manheim with actor/dancer
Gregory Hines, with whom she is co-starring in an independent film
called ``The Tick Code,'' but she won't comment. She'd rather talk
about motorcycling.
 &HT;    ``There is just something so liberating about getting on your
bike and hitting the open road,'' Manheim says. ``You have the wind
in your hair and your cares seem to dissolve. Motorcycles are my
favorite thing in the world.''
 &HT;    When she heard she'd been nominated for an Emmy, she turned to
her Harley to settle down.
 &HT;    ``I cried like a baby when I heard the news,'' she recalls. ``To
calm myself down, I went for a ride.''
 &HT;    And the ride hasn't stopped since. On Emmy night, she could
hardly believe she'd won.
 &HT;    ``My date had to nudge me and say, `It's you,''' she says,
laughing. ``It just didn't seem right. It seemed like it was a
mistake.''
 &HT;    Since then a flood of offers has come in, including movies,
television shows and commercials. Don't look for her to turn up
hawking Slim Fact, however.
 &HT;    ``I will not sell out and hawk some diet product. I will not be
a hypocrite,'' she insists. ``I'm healthy _ I get checkups. I see
no reason to lose weight to conform to society's standard of
beauty.''
 &HT;    The only thing she wants now is one more award.
 &HT;    ``I have a dream where I go up to accept my Oscar and someone in
the audience stops me for a moment,'' she says. ``I say to her,
`Oh, my beautiful dress? I got it at Lane Bryant.'''

BEBE NEUWIRTH'S LATEST BRUSH WITH GENIUS

 Includes a black-and-white slide of Bebe Neuwirth with Judy Davis
in a scene from ``Celebrity.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Bebe Neuwirth is a star of stage and screen _ she won a 1996
Tony Award as a singing murderess in ``Chicago'' and a couple of
Emmys as Dr. Lilith Sternin on ``Cheers.'' She's worked with some
of the biggest names in show business, from Bob Fosse and Michael
Bennett in the 1970s to Woody Allen in the 1990s.
 &HT;    But all anyone asks her about nowadays is that banana.
 &HT;    In Allen's new film ``Celebrity,'' opening nationwide on Nov.
20, Neuwirth plays a prostitute who, in her most noteworthy scene,
teaches a well-bred divorcee (Judy Davis) how to perform oral sex
using ... well, a tree-grown prop.
 &HT;    ``When we first shot it we used fake bananas,'' she recalls,
``but that just didn't seem to work, so we eventually went for the
real thing. I mean, real bananas.''
 &HT;    The scene may seem risque, but Neuwirth says she never hesitated
to take the role.
 &HT;    ``I'm a big fan of Woody Allen,'' she says. ``It read funny on
the page, two women standing there with bananas in their mouths. I
completely trusted Woody to fit it brilliantly into the movie, and
I think he did, because he has a great sense of comic timing.''
 &HT;    After seven years on ``Cheers,'' Neuwirth knows something about
comic timing.
 &HT;    ``You can't think it's funny when you're doing it,'' she says.
``Whether it's dry humor or slapstick, it has to be completely
truthful and real. So I didn't find it hard to keep a straight face
with a banana in my mouth.
 &HT;    ``Thank goodness I didn't laugh,'' she adds, ``because it could
have easily become obscene instead of just outrageous. As it is, I
think it turned out hysterical but not raunchy.''
 &HT;    Actors line up to work with the highly respected Allen, but many
are also disconcerted by his reluctance to let them see the full
script or, for that matter, to give them detailed direction on a
given character or scene. Neuwirth has no complaints, however.
 &HT;    ``I thought he was very specific,'' she says. ``I've worked with
directors who talk in these theoretical concepts and then put you
in front of the camera and you're thinking, `What in the hell did
they mean?' I felt I always knew exactly what Woody wanted from me,
and he made me feel like I could give it to him.
 &HT;    ``I know some people are disturbed that Woody hardly ever gives
them the whole script,'' she adds with a chuckle, ``but it didn't
bother me. I was perfectly happy just getting my scenes, and I
didn't worry about how they were going to fit into the film.''
 &HT;    Neuwirth, a self-described ``nice Jewish girl from New Jersey,''
grew up in Princeton as the daughter of a mathematician and a
painter. After seeing a performance of ``The Nutcracker'' while
still in elementary school, she set her heart on being a ballerina.
 &HT;    By her teens, Broadway had replaced the ballet stage in her
dreams, inspired by a trip to New York to see a performance of
``Pippin,'' directed by Fosse, the innovative choreographer. At 19
she won an understudy role in a touring company of ``A Chorus
Line,'' and a year later she was dancing in the New York
production, staged by Bennett.
 &HT;    ``I like to perform _ I've been on stage since I was 7, and I
think of the theater as my home,'' she says. ``More than anything,
I love to dance on stage.
 &HT;    ``But I sort of feel like the vaudevillian I played in
`Chicago,''' she adds. ``You want me to dance? I'll dance. You want
me to sing? I'll sing. You want me to act? I'll act. Performing is
what keeps me going.''
 &HT;    After ``A Chorus Line,'' Neuwirth starred in two shows for her
idol, Fosse: ``Dancin''' (1982) and a revival of ``Sweet Charity''
(1985), for which she won the first of her two Tonys.
 &HT;    ``I started out working with geniuses,'' she says. ``I didn't
realize it until later when, all of sudden, I was being directed by
people who weren't geniuses. I went, `Wait a minute! This is
getting tough.'
 &HT;    ``But it made me work harder to develop my craft,'' the actress
says. ``I guess, in a way, I was sort of compensating for their
lack of brilliance.''
 &HT;    Neuwirth feels that working with Woody Allen put her back in
touch with genius.
 &HT;    ``It's a quality that's hard to define,'' she says. ``They have
a clarity of vision and the ability to make it happen with a
certain creative spark. Also, every creative detail gets addressed,
nothing is sloughed over. In the end, it becomes their particular
take on the truth.''
 &HT;    In ``Celebrity,'' Allen takes on a subject that every performer
has some ideas about _ the pluses and minuses of fame.
 &HT;    ``I've never thought of myself as a celebrity,'' Neuwirth says.
``However, I can't deny that I have some notoriety from Broadway
and television, and it's not all bad _ sometimes, a little
recognition can be quite good.
 &HT;    ``But in the film Woody shows the effect on two very different
people,'' she says. ``Kenneth Branagh plays a guy who's desperately
trying to claw his way into the limelight and ends up a failure.
His ex-wife, played by Judy Davis, becomes a celebrity almost by
accident _ her fame is just luck. I think that's fascinating and
thought-provoking.
 &HT;    ``Actually, I think Bob Fosse's perspective on fame in `Chicago'
was equally on the money,'' Neuwirth adds. ``Bob was a great
romantic, but also a great cynic. When he made `Chicago' into a
musical in 1975, I think it was his answer to the Watergate
hearings. You know, his take was, `It's all a circus, kid, a
three-ring circus.' It's a very telling send-up of celebrity.''
 &HT;    Audience awareness of the current round of Washington scandals
may lend an extra zip to Neuwirth's banana scene _ which was shot
long before Monica Lewinsky was a household name _ but Neuwirth
would rather it just went away.
 &HT;    ``People may find more to laugh at when they watch that scene,''
she says, ``but I find everything that's gone on with the
revelations of the president's sex life disgusting. I'm totally
disgusted. I try not even to think about it.
 &HT;    ``Woody Allen's movies become classics, but what happened
between Clinton and Lewinsky will be forgotten.''
 &HT;    If Neuwirth is remembered by future generations, chances are it
will be as Lilith in reruns of ``Cheers.''
 &HT;    ``I just hope people will look at me on their TV and say, `Wow,
she was funny, she did a good job. I think she's a pretty good
actress,''' she says. ``I think `Cheers' was a great showcase for
me, and I don't have a regret about doing it. I certainly was never
worried about getting typecast as a psychiatrist!''
 &HT;    Whatever may be said about her role in ``Celebrity'' or future
endeavors, Neuwirth won't be listening. She avoids reviews, and
hesitates even to do interviews.
 &HT;    ``I'm always uncomfortable with the fact that what someone else
may write might not reflect what I'm trying to say,'' she says.
``Anytime you give an interview, you're giving people permission to
make judgments about you. That's a very difficult and vulnerable
position to be in. I find it nerve-wracking.
 &HT;    ``I'm really a very sensitive person,'' Neuwirth continues.
``I've learned not to read anything that's written about me,
because I don't want to lose that sensitivity.
 &HT;    ``I don't think it's a particularly good thing to build up an
armor as to how you're portrayed. That's not healthy. It can chip
away at your compassion.''

THE E-LANCER EATS A BAGELWICH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 8)  
 (Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How are new words created? What's the logic behind neologisms?
How can you, working at home, coin your own words for fun and
profit?
</P>
<P>
   Here is how you can amaze your friends and dismay your
derogators by displaying your hidden ingenuity. The secret: knowing
your combining forms.
</P>
<P>
   Take  &UR; -ware &LR; . This started out in the Sanskrit  &UR; vasna &LR; ,
``price,'' and came to mean, in English, things of value _
``goods.'' We used this combining form for articles made of clay
( &UR; earthenware &LR; ) or a range of tools ( &UR; hardware &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1960, as computers came on the scene, we had the need
for a word to describe the programming needed to go with the
hardware. Coinage:  &UR; software &LR; , the opposite of ``hard'' with the
combining form  &UR; -ware &LR; . That was only the beginning: If a company
promises new software and doesn't meet its deadline, the nonproduct
is derided as  &UR; vaporware &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in a harangue against gloom-and-doom economists
wringing their hands about a global crisis, I had the need for a
name for what ailed them. What's the combining form for an ailment?
Often it's  &UR; -itis &LR; , as in  &UR; sinusitis &LR; . So I blazed away at those
afflicted with  &UR; global crisis-itis &LR; . Strictly a nonce coinage, but
it fit the moment's vituperative need.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring 1998 issue of American Speech, A Quarterly of
Linguistic Usage, Adrienne Lehrer of the University of Arizona has
an article about ``Scapes, Holics and Thons: The Semantics of
English Combining Forms.'' She describes how ``source words'' like
 &UR; Watergate &LR;  get splintered, with a portion becoming a combining
form, from Carter's  &UR; Billygate &LR;  to Reagan's  &UR; Irangate &LR;  to Clinton's
 &UR; Monicagate &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In the same way  &UR; alcoholic &LR;  spawned  &UR; workaholic &LR;  and
 &UR; chocoholic &LR; , as  &UR; -holic &LR;  became a combining form meaning ``hooked
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a familiar word like  &UR; sandwich &LR; , a culinary creation named
after the fourth Earl of Sandwich in 1762. Say you are a bagel
baker and you want to use your product instead of bread to purvey
smoked salmon and cream cheese. You put up a sign:  &UR; bagelwich &LR; .
Everyone instantly knows you are pushing a sandwich made on a
bagel.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a Francophile competitor puts up his own
sign,  &UR; croissantwich &LR; , and your customers desert you, mouths fixed
for croissants stuffed with the filling of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Same with  &UR; hamburger &LR; , originally chopped meat enjoyed by
residents of Hamburg, Germany. Using the  &UR; -burger &LR;  combining form,
we come up with  &UR; cheeseburger &LR;  and now  &UR; veggieburger &LR; , with a score
of variations in between. You get the meaning instantly with no
explanation needed, even if you've never seen or heard the word
before.
</P>
<P>
   Quick: What is a  &UR; turkeyfurter &LR; ? (It could be wurst: Would you
like to wash one down with a  &UR; vodkatini &LR; ? You need no help to make
the leap to these neologisms based on  &UR; frankfurter &LR;  and  &UR; martini &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jargonauts &LR;  (a play on  &UR; Argonauts &LR;  and an example of the
 &UR; -nauts &LR;  combiner used by  &UR; Reaganauts &LR; ) like to use  &UR; -speak &LR;  as
their combiner. The source word is George Orwell's  &UR; newspeak &LR; , and
it spawned everything from my  &UR; Haigspeak &LR;  (Al Haig's ``Snakecheck
that'' and shades-of-gray  &UR; nuancal &LR; ) to the San Fernando Valley
girls'  &UR; Valspeak &LR;  (``grody to the max'').
</P>
<P>
   Let's leave behind the  &UR; -holics &LR;  and  &UR; -thons &LR; . (Just as a
 &UR; television marathon &LR;  blends to  &UR; telethon &LR; , an unending stream of
faxes becomes a  &UR; faxathon &LR; .) We can also skip the  &UR; -scapes &LR; .
( &UR; Landscape &LR; , the source word, led to coinages of  &UR; seascape &LR; ,
 &UR; moonscape &LR; ,  &UR; cityscape &LR;  and  &UR; Xeriscape &LR; , ``parks created with
little need for water.'')
</P>
<P>
   Turn to the fifth letter of the Roman alphabet for the combining
form now most in vogue: I've been keeping a fair weather eye on the
letter  &UR; E &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``More of us will work as  &UR; e-lancers &LR; ,'' said Snigdha Prakash,
an NPR reporter, in the course of an interview, defining the term
as ``free agents who are electronically linked to other soloists
for specific projects, and move on when the work is done.'' These
are the unaffiliated employed (``drifters,'' we used to call them),
and the term is a rhyming play on  &UR; freelancer &LR; , originally a
mercenary soldier of the Middle Ages, now often a middle-aged
soloist.
</P>
<P>
   When  &UR; electronic mail &LR; , coined in 1977, was shortened five years
later to  &UR; e-mail &LR; , it became the combining form of the Information
Age, muscling aside its competition on the prefix menu,  &UR; cyber- &LR; 
(from the Greek  &UR; kybernan &LR; , ``to govern'').
</P>
<P>
   Now we have  &UR; e-text &LR;  published in an  &UR; e-zine &LR;  (often shortened
and pronounced ``zeen''). You can buy an airline  &UR; e-ticket &LR;  with
 &UR; e-money &LR;  or  &UR; e-bucks &LR;  (terms that have bankrupted  &UR; cybercash &LR; ),
unless you want to use  &UR; e-credit &LR; , a form of Internet dealing known
as  &UR; e-commerce &LR;  or  &UR; e-tailing &LR; . That last is a play on  &UR; retailing &LR; 
and, as in  &UR; e-lancer &LR; , the letter  &UR; E &LR;  does not stand only for
``electronic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wayne Glowka, an editor of the Among the New Words section
of American Speech, reports that  &UR; e-gifts &LR;  of  &UR; e-bouquets &LR;  are
often given by members of the  &UR; e-generation &LR; . (Want to subscribe?
Send $35 to Duke University Press, Box 90660, Durham, N.C.
27708-0660. Sorry, I don't know how to do it electronically.)
</P>
<P>
   All of this, plus generations of new terms as yet uncoined, will
be sneered at as  &UR; e-speak &LR; , a product _ just think of it _ of two
combining forms, which I have just coined this instant unless some
 &UR; e-reader &LR;  of my  &UR; e-text &LR;  beat me to it.
</P>
<P>
   NOBODY'S PERFECT
</P>
<P>
   In a smirking swipe at the use of ``what  &UR; is &LR;  is'' by the only
president we have, a language maven noted that  &UR; has there been &LR;  was
in the past perfect tense.
</P>
<P>
   As Lise Nazarenko, a lecturer in English at the University of
Vienna, noted: `` &UR; Has there been &LR;  is not in the  &UR; past &LR;  perfect
tense, but rather in the  &UR; present &LR;  perfect tense. Past perfect
would be  &UR; had there been &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Perfect &LR; , in its most familiar sense, means ``flawless''; in an
earlier sense, it meant ``complete.'' That sense of ``finished'' is
what we use in grammar: a verb form expressing an action that is
complete at the time of speaking or at the time spoken of. And
since  &UR; has &LR;  is present and  &UR; had &LR;  is past, `` &UR; has &LR;  there been'' is,
as the entire Gotcha! Gang has gleefully pointed out, in the
 &UR; present perfect &LR;  tense.

EVER ELUSIVE, PRIVACY SLIPS FROM GRASP OF PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On my desk at the hospital sits a computer terminal I use to
check my patients' blood tests and X-ray results. I could also,
were I so inclined, use it to browse through the blood tests and
X-rays of thousands of complete strangers, tracking biopsy results,
guessing at life expectancies and generally shattering every known
code of medical privacy and confidentiality to smithereens without
ever leaving my chair.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that no activity could tempt me less is actually not
very important. My very ordinary access code and password into an
ordinary hospital computer network are just one more indication
that medical privacy as we once understood it has become a thing of
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, medical records were almost as sacrosanct as
the body itself, as carefully shielded by the medical chart as the
body's various bulges are shielded by clothes. Generally, only
people permitted to breach one defense and see you in a state of
undress could breach the other and read through your medical
records.
</P>
<P>
   Now, your personal medical history has acquired a frenetic life
of its own. It zooms by fax and modem farther and farther away from
your person, far from your medical chart and your medical
caretakers, far from anyone likely to recognize your face or greet
you by name, let alone rejoice at your good health or grieve at
news of illness.
</P>
<P>
   It routinely lands on the desks of insurers, but sometimes
wanders even farther afield. Last winter, a national chain of
drugstores was caught selling names of customers with specific
illnesses to pharmaceutical companies for use in targeted drug
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the federal government contemplated assigning every
citizen an electronic code to summarize his or her medical health,
much as a credit report summarizes financial health, and presumably
just as easy for interested parties to inspect.
</P>
<P>
   The drugstores hastily called off their deal at the first sign
of public outrage, and the government said it has shelved its plans
until legislation to protect patients' privacy is enacted. But many
experts glumly predict that privacy legislation will only lock the
barn door after a long-departed horse. The computer on my desk says
they are probably right.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one consolation in this chilly new world of
exposed medical records: Objective violations of medical privacy
and our subjective experience of them are often two quite different
things.
</P>
<P>
   True privacy, that all-important cloak that allows a person to
proceed with dignity through the many indignities of illness, is a
remarkably complex and elusive entity, a real will-o'-the-wisp,
often found where least expected and almost impossible to
legislate.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the long, slow revolution in hospital design that has
filled our hospitals with two- and four-bed semiprivate rooms in
place of large open wards that once routinely housed all but the
wealthiest patients.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was an obvious violation of privacy to abolish, it
was one of those big, noisy wards, lined with dozens of beds
separated only by the occasional curtain. The head nurse at the
front desk could see every detail of every patient's hospital
course _ and so could every patient's 35 roommates, all their
visitors, and the workers who mopped the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that privacy is not so easy to create or bisect
_ the semiprivacy we have today is often less than none at all. In
a two-bed room, each roommate is the other's only universe. There
is no avoiding the other's illness, visitors, night terrors or idle
ears.
</P>
<P>
   A survey taken in Britain two years ago found that more than
three times as many patients in a large ward felt they could have a
private conversation with their doctors than patients in smaller
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The patrons of stores with large communal dressing rooms know
this paradox well: Trying on a bathing suit in a room with 30
strangers similarly engaged is a far more private experience than
sharing a dressing room for two would be.
</P>
<P>
   One of my patients was placed in a sunny four-bed room several
years ago to recover from pneumonia. His roommates were pleasant,
quiet and solicitous; even their visitors were kind to him. For the
next two weeks, I would visit him and find an empty bed.
</P>
<P>
   The congenial roommates would point me to the noisy, crowded
lounge at the end of the hall where my patient was spending his
days, happily anonymous. ``No privacy back there,'' he would
explain, hoisting up his shirt to be examined.
</P>
<P>
   As our medical records fly hither and yon, legislation may
ultimately help protect us from incurring financial harm from their
travels. But for that terrible feeling of being naked in front of
millions of curious spectators, the only remedy may be to remember
that most of the millions are not all that curious _ and that most
of them now are naked themselves.

   NEW YORK _ Sometime in mid-December, Timmy and Dan, two
silverback male gorillas, and their respective troops will move
into new quarters at the Bronx Zoo, in an environment designed by
scientists and animal experts to resemble a central African rain
forest, the animals' natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The new six-acre area of outdoor and indoor habitat, called
Congo Gorilla Forest, is scheduled to open to the public in June,
after the animals have time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The habitats for the animals are very large and very heavily
vegetated, so they are as close to a rain forest as we can get in
New York,'' said Lee Emkhe, the Congo project manager. ``We had a
conflicting desire to give the animals freedom of movement yet see
them face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he said, was to plan the habitats so the animals
wanted to linger near the viewing areas, and, more importantly, to
coax natural behavior from them, using a mixture of creative
landscaping, exhibit architecture and some clever, hidden
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of begging for food or exhibiting other older zoo
behavior, the animals will do what they do in nature, which is
foraging for food and interacting with members of their social
groups,'' Emkhe explained.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple decades, many zoos have expanded their
naturalistic habitats and all but abandoned animal cages. But Emkhe
said the Congo habitat would go further on several fronts,
especially in showing the animals as part of a whole ecosystem,
instead of simply on an outdoor grassy plain.
</P>
<P>
   The designers are also using a dense and detailed mix of plants,
waterfalls and synthetic mudbanks and native trees.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of Congo forest will be the two families of Western
lowland gorillas, which will be joined by okapis, red river hogs,
mandrills, birds, fish, reptiles, bugs and several species of
monkeys, including guenon, colobus and pygmy.
</P>
<P>
   To help keep the animals in public view, the primate areas will
use hidden feeders to disperse treats like seeds or fruit. In the
mandrill habitat, a hopper inside a fake tree will be filled in the
morning with sunflower seeds, which will be released at random
times during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the mandrills, they'll be digging at the base of
this fallen tree,'' Emkhe said. ``That is exactly what they do in
the wild _ they spend hours picking through leaf litter and rotted
logs.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, planners have drawn from research on animal behavior
in the wild and lessons learned in zoos. Gorillas tend to prefer
flat ground, so the landscape in one habitat slopes away from the
viewing areas and up a hill. Tangles of artificial vines will be
available for play. There is also plenty of room and vegetation for
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The indoor gorilla spaces _ one 900 square feet, the other 1,100
_ will have high ceilings and be filled with ledges, ropes, nets,
ladders and hay (for nesting). The interior areas will be plainly
finished, explained Emkhe, but more than adequate for the gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be able to climb, they want to be able to hide,
they want to be able to swing,'' he said. ``They don't need the
space to look like a pretend rain forest that most of them have
never seen. All but Timmy, the oldest gorilla at the zoo, are
captive-born gorillas.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came to choosing vegetation for the outdoor habitats,
designers had to be particularly creative. ``You don't want to show
these animals in open pastures,'' said Rob Halpern, the curator of
horticulture at the Wildlife Conservation Society, the zoo's parent
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge, he said, lies in finding a way to keep the
animals from eating the exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Again, designers relied on wild and captive behavioral
observations. For okapis, a zebra-size animal that is related to
the giraffe, the habitat was lushly planted because Society field
researchers have found that the okapis prefer dense growth. But the
staff had to plant trees that okapis do not eat, in this case
catalpa and bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the gorilla habitats include barberry, which is too
thorny to eat, and horseradish, which tastes bad. Trees and plants
have to resemble rain forest vegetation but be hardy enough to grow
in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, zoo officials said, the habitat is about
conservation education. ``The features in the gorilla habitat are
for their mental and behavioral health, but visitors should
experience gorillas being gorillas and not sculpture or pets,''
Halpern said. ``We want to get people involved in nature so they
want to protect it.''

   Q: Should pediatricians charge patients for telephone advice? _
John O'Neil
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians should re-evaluate the expertise dispensed by
phone. In the old system, that expense was bundled in with other
charges, a hidden charge in fee for service. Now we are in an
insurance environment where that is impossible and are essentially
giving away expertise. The doctor-patient relationship has changed.
In the old days, the people who called in the middle of the night
were with me for long periods. Now you get a call at 1 a.m. saying
my kid just woke up and is crying. Those patients are usually only
with you for a year or two, because insurance plans change so much.
The insurance companies are going around saying, ``We provide
24-hour care.'' What they provide is us. _ Dr. Kurt Metzl,
Professor, University of Missouri-Kansas City; pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   I'm very sympathetic, but I do not think it would work. It is
impractical, it is bad marketing and it potentially could be
harmful for patients who depend on it. It is true, the practice of
medicine today is no longer one of long-running relationships with
families. However, the danger here is that you want to encourage
people to call so you can make the decision of whether what you are
listening to is potentially serious. You do not want to put a
roadblock in the way of those calls, and money is always a
roadblock. Secondly, you offer this service as a way of encouraging
patients to use your services. The more you can convince patients
that you care, the more successful the pediatric practice will be.
</P>
<P>
   _Dr. Edwin J. Saltzman, Lecturer at University of Miami School
of Medicine; retired pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Teens Nix Heels &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Heels are out, athletic shoes are in, at least among teen-age
girls. And orthopedic researchers believe that this trend may
explain why young women have fewer foot problems than their older
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 672 girls ages 10 to 18 conducted by Dr. Carol Frey,
director of the Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Center at Los Angeles
Orthopedic Hospital, found that 68 percent wore sneakers or
athletic shoes most often and only 4 percent wore heels. Only 13
percent complained of foot pain and 9 percent reported foot
deformities, compared with 80 percent and 76 percent reported by
women ages 20 to 60 in a previous study. Both problems, said Dr.
Frey, are associated with shoes that fit poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers' daughters will have fewer foot disorders than
their mothers later on in life if they continue to wear comfortable
shoes that fit the foot properly,'' Dr. Frey said. ``Bunions,
hammertoes, corns, calluses _ all of these are secondary to narrow,
ill-fitting shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most teen-age girls have not had to shove their feet
into uncomfortable shoes for hours on end to comply with workplace
dress standards, which may help explain their problem-free feet.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frey said that if the girls followed in the footsteps of
older women and chose heels, foot problems would follow. ``It takes
decades of wearing heels to get deformities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the girls switch to the ill-fitting styles, over time,''
she added, ``they will also be subject to foot deformities.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; That's Reality &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a busy drugstore in midtown Manhattan last week,
where a display case boasted 29 different types of condom, one
brand was conspicuously absent from the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you sell Reality?'' a customer asked uncomfortably, and
watched as a sales clerk extracted a box of three from the depths
of a low shelf well hidden behind the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Reality, available in the United States since 1993, is the first
and only ``female condom'' on the market.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in the words of its manufacturer, ``a soft, loose-fitting
plastic pouch that lines the vagina.''
</P>
<P>
   A flexible ring holds the inner, closed end in place against a
woman's cervix, and another, larger ring, which protrudes from her
body, forms the outer opening.
</P>
<P>
   Generously lubricated by the manufacturer, the whole thing is
quite wet and slippery.
</P>
<P>
   In America, the female condom never really caught on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not popular,'' said Kris Kim, a spokeswoman for
Planned Parenthood of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kim said that although a few women like the condom, birth
control counselors report that many clients are put off by its
looks, by squeamishness about inserting it, by irritation from the
rings and by its reputed tendency to squeak. Those who do use it
complain that they have trouble finding it in drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the most recent year for which data were available,
only 12,000 of the 38.7 million American women who used birth
control said the female condom was their primary method, according
to the National Survey of Family Growth, conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But Reality is finding an important niche overseas. Like the
male condom, it protects against sexually transmitted diseases,
including AIDS. But the female condom is the only means of
protection that a woman can fully control.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, it has been embraced by the U.N. AIDS programs
and other international groups, which have been helping to provide
millions of female condoms to Zimbabwe, South Africa, Uganda and
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is manufactured by Female Health Co., in Chicago, a
small firm without much of an advertising budget, according to O.B.
Parrish, the company's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   But he said sales, most of them overseas, had more than doubled
in the past year, to 7.4 million by the end of September from 3.3
million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of on the threshold of commercializing,'' Parrish
said. ``One of the things we feel good about is that this product
actually saves some lives.''
</P>
<P>
   _Denise Grady
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Is Finding Fitness Just a Blade Away? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An infomercial for Bodyblade, a 4-foot by 1.75-inch blade with a
rubber hand grip at the center, hit the airways earlier this year,
its makers hoping to follow in the lucrative footsteps of fitness
products like ab rollers and butt blasters. The infomercial, which
claimed that Bodyblade offered ``a complete and total body workout
in as little as six minutes a day,'' enticed fitness buffs to snap
up 100,000 of the $99 gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Council on Exercise, a watchdog for the fitness
industry, disputed Bodyblade's claims. A product review, published
in ACE Fitness Matters, states that performing the suggested Super
Six routine _ a set of six, one-minute exercises _ offers little
fitness benefit. The review, conducted by biomechanists at
California State University, Northridge, said the limited movement
required for most of the exercises did little to improve
flexibility or strength and that no exercise device could bring
about significant weight loss or increases in cardiovascular
endurance if used for only six minutes a day. The reviewers also
said that using Bodyblade regularly might result in overuse
injuries of the shoulders and wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Council reviewers addressed their comments to infomercial
claims; they did not test the product, which requires users to grip
the center of the oblong object with one or both hands and wave it
back and forth to create resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Hymanson, the inventor of Bodyblade and president of its
distribution company, said council reviewers misinterpreted the
video. ``We never say that using the blade for six minutes will
help you lose weight or increase endurance,'' he said, ``We clearly
state it will help you strengthen, tone and sculpt your muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cotton, the council's chief exercise physiologist,
disagreed and said that lifting weights is a more natural way to
strengthen muscles than the pulsating action of the blade.

LEARNING PILATES, ONE STRETCH AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(mk) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is called Pilates, and I had been hearing about it
for some time but dismissed it as a faddish '90s workout. It fit
the mold perfectly: It had the requisite exotic name (pronounced
puh-LAH-tees), you had to go to a gym to do it, and celebrities
hailed it as a miracle workout that managed, with perfect '90s
perversity, to give shapely women the bodies of 12-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
   Pilates, I had heard, involved archaic equipment with names like
``the reformer'' and ``the barrel,'' but that was about all I knew
when I arrived at TriBeCa Bodyworks, a Pilates studio on Duane
Street, determined to see if my bias was well-founded. A model-thin
woman blew by me, a single line of sweat dripping down her radiant
cheek. Great. I hated the place already.
</P>
<P>
   Alycea Baylis-Ungaro, the owner of the studio, had instructed me
to bring loose clothing and to wear socks. No sneakers were
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Showing me to the changing room, she whispered, ``Even men do
Pilates. We get a lot of them.'' It is true. During my workouts at
least one-third were men. Besides, there is, as I soon learned,
nothing feminine about Pilates.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise method was invented by a man, Joseph Pilates, a
boxer and physical therapist from Germany. Obsessed with body
conditioning, he developed the framework for Pilates while serving
as a nurse during World War I. So that patients could exercise in
bed, he redesigned a hospital bed and developed simple exercises.
Modern Pilates apparatus relies on the use of springs to provide
resistance, much like weights, but easier on the body. He opened
the first Pilates Studio in the United States in New York City in
1926.
</P>
<P>
   A workout developed that long ago, when athletes smoked and
tennis players wore long pants? Still, I signed up for three
one-hour Pilates sessions. The first, Alycea said, would just be
introductory. For $65, she would lead me through the fundamental
exercises. Later sessions would get more intense, Alycea promised,
at $55 a session. A bargain! I could not quite believe I was
handing over this much money to exercise. I am a reasonable person.
I live near a park. I own a pair of sneakers. Why not just put them
on and run around the park?
</P>
<P>
   The reason became clearer with each exercise. Alycea took me to
the reformer, a long, low, bedlike apparatus with a flat, padded
carriage that slid back and forth the length of the bed. It made a
dentist's chair look friendly. Alycea had me lie face up on the
carriage, with my knees bent and my feet on a raised steel bar at
the end of the apparatus. I was to straighten my legs as I pulled
in my stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The carriage, which is set on three long springs, was difficult
to slide out, then snapped back against the end of the apparatus
with a loud ``Bang!'' that echoed through the studio. Heads turned.
Alycea did not look pleased. The next time, I was told, do it
smoothly, no banging. And I was told to stop arching my back.
Pilates exercises are designed to protect and strengthen the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more distance you put between your belly button and your
spine, the more pressure you put on your back,'' Alycea said.
</P>
<P>
   By changing the position of my feet on the steel bar and
pushing, I worked different muscle groups in my legs while working
my stomach muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real New York workout because it's really efficient,''
Alycea said. ``You have to use all your muscles at once.'' And you
get it all in a neat and snappy 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   We moved on to more complex movements, my least favorite being
the ``hundreds.'' Lying face up on the reformer, I had to raise my
feet six inches, suck in my stomach, squeeze my buttocks together
and, holding a stirrup set on springs in each hand, keep my arms at
my sides and bounce them up and down, 100 times. With so many
details to focus on, you hardly feel the pain.
</P>
<P>
   I was beginning to understand why Pilates called his workout
contrology. For every exercise that focuses on strengthening
muscle, another stretches the body and encourages balance. And each
movement _ whether a derivative of the sit up with legs jutting in
the air, or lying flat and pulling on leather harnesses attached to
springs _ involves stabilizing the core of the body, the torso and
buttocks, while moving the arms or legs. (This is the part that
appeals to women: The movements are small and repetitions are
short, so you tone muscle without bulking up.)
</P>
<P>
   After about a half hour on the reformer, Alycea introduced me to
``the Cadillac,'' which looked a lot like a gurney with harnesses
and pulleys. After more stomach exercises, including sit ups and
leg lifts, Alycea had me lie on my back and put my feet into the
harnesses. With my feet above my head and my back raised off of the
mat, I was hung like a side of beef. Then, using my stomach
muscles, I had to pull my body down to the mat against the
resistance of the springs, curling my spine, vertebra by vertebra.
It felt as if I was stretching every bone in my back. But there was
no pain. Instead, I felt stress ebbing until it was gone. I could
have done it all day.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the best part. Alycea had me sit up and stretch
to touch my toes while she pushed and rubbed my back. I was
forgetting about the $65.
</P>
<P>
   I left my first session with my stomach muscles dazed and
confused, but I was still troubled that I had not broken a sweat.
But when I arrived for my second session, Alycea reminded me that
the reformer workout did not get longer, it got faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's where the aerobics come in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And did they ever. I was more relaxed with the machines and my
movements became smoother and faster. But when I slowed down, I
heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   At most Pilates gyms, you do individual sessions with a personal
trainer to learn the movements _ there are more than 500 _ until
you get up to pace. After about 30 sessions, you can advance to
what is called a duet _ two people with a trainer _ then to groups
of three and four.
</P>
<P>
   I had never employed a personal trainer, but I found that having
one by my side was surprisingly comforting. I liked having someone
there to coddle me while I suffered through the workout. Besides,
it is far too easy and tempting to cheat with Pilates.
</P>
<P>
   What is extraordinary about Pilates is its broad appeal. Some
professional dancers do it to maintain flexibility and stay fit
without adding excess stress to their bodies. And unlike running or
aerobics, Pilates is good for the elderly, people with injuries,
and even pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do it right up to delivery,'' Alycea said.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, Pilates was a revelation. I had not realized how
tight my muscles had become working in an office, slouching over a
computer keyboard. By the third session, I was a convert. I was
getting the aerobic workout I wanted while regaining some of the
flexibility I had lost.
</P>
<P>
   But if I start to get that 12-year-old boy look, I just may have
to ease off. For a while, anyway.

FASHION DESIGNERS AIM TO HAVE WOMEN BARING MORE THAN THEIR SOULS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hip-riding skirts, bare bellies and carpenter pants
are just a few of the things to look forward to next spring.
</P>
<P>
   That's what designers here are showing this week as they present
spring '99 collections to retailers and fashion media.
</P>
<P>
   Why designers assume that women want to bare more than their
souls when daylight hours lengthen and trees turn green is
something of a mystery. Don't these creative people know that women
need coverage when they go to work, drive a carpool or volunteer
for a favorite cause?
</P>
<P>
   Even Carolina Herrera, who can usually be counted on for
tasteful clothing, seems to have lost her bearings. Her latest line
focuses on hip-hanging skirts and simple shell or tank tops that
never quite connect, leaving flashes of bare skin.
</P>
<P>
   It's cute on models with very flat, nicely tanned tummies. Women
of a certain age, however, might pause or pass.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera's leather tops in pale pink or lilac were pretty. But
are they practical? She is also fond of fish-tail skirts _ skirts
that forced models into mincing steps.
</P>
<P>
   Another trademark of her collection is a cowl neckline draping
either the front or back of a dress. When that collar is lined with
a contrasting satin _ lavender on a dove-gray dress, for example _
it's stunning.
</P>
<P>
   For several seasons now, designers have focused on late-day
apparel, from cocktail dresses to ballgowns. Dresses, suits,
sportswear and other everyday styles are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Han Feng, a designer who emigrated from China 13 years ago, does
create some sporty looking apparel _ pants and jackets in gingham,
for example. But the gingham pattern is on silk taffeta, making it
impractical for daily wear.
</P>
<P>
   She showed her collection informally in a dingy building on West
39th Street. Against the patched plaster walls and peeled paint
floors, her ethereal silks looked very fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Han Feng is known for her textures. For spring '99, that means
pleats so small they look like a ribbed fabric, or silk chiffon
embroidered with elastic thread for a puckered texture. She
frequently mixes fabrics _ a bias-cut dress with a satin top and
matte jersey skirt, for example. ``Women can wear bras with
these,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Bras are a scarce commodity in this garment district. The many
halter tops being shown often leave sides of the chest with very
little coverage. Or, tops are simply so sheer, they show all. And
models never wear bras on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the clothes being shown are accessory-free except for
shoes _ shoes that seem to be giving models nothing but trouble.
High-heeled mules _ that means only the toes are covered, there's
no ``back'' to the shoe _ tangled with fish-tail skirts at Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   At the Susan Lazar show, models wore slippers by Jacques Levine
that resembled those old-fashioned leather wedgies by Daniel Green.
The footwear reduced some to shuffling down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   This is actually the second showing of spring '99 fashions. A
few designers presented their wares in mid-September, so they could
show before the unveilings in Milan, Paris and London. (American
designers are sometimes accused of copying the Europeans and they
wanted to prove that isn't so.)
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next February, New York designers will show their fall
collections together, about six weeks earlier than usual.

   Many historians have long held it unthinkable, but new DNA
evidence suggests it is almost certain that Thomas Jefferson, that
icon of American idealism, fathered at least one child with his
slave, Sally Hemings, even as he opposed ``race mixing'' and
believed blacks to be inferior.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic test results released last week strongly support
persistent but often-dismissed rumors that the third US president
had a long-lasting liaison with Hemings, during which six children
were born, of whom four lived to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the DNA evidence ``seems to seal the case'' that
Jefferson fathered the mulatto slave's last child, Eston Hemings
Jefferson, born in 1808 during the last year of his second term as
president.
</P>
<P>
   If so, their liaison likely endured for at least 20 years, if it
began, as Hemings's son Madison said in an 1827 newspaper
interview, in 1788 when Jefferson and Hemings were in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said that Jefferson appears not to have been the
father of Hemings's first child, born in 1790, Thomas Woodson
(whose name comes from a later owner). But the evidence could not
rule out Jefferson's paternity, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation of the 196-year-old rumor is the most dramatic
application so far of new DNA methods that use the Y, or male,
chromosome to trace male lineages. The Jefferson project, headed by
Dr. Eugene Foster, a retired pathologist at the University of
Virginia in Charlottesville, Va., compared tell-tale patterns on
the Y chromosome of present-day descendants of the Jefferson family
with those of descendants of Thomas Woodson and of Eston Hemings
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   The results were published by the scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Foster, the report is authored by two British
genetic specialists, M.A. Jobling of the University of Leicester
and C. Tyler-Smith of the University of Oxford, and others.
</P>
<P>
   The testing was undertaken in an effort to settle the debate
over the most potent character issue involving Jefferson, an
enigmatic and extraordinarily private president.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Gordon-Reed, a black law professor at New York
University Law School and author of the 1997 book, ``Thomas
Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,'' has argued
that traditional, mainly white Jefferson historians dismissed the
rumor and ignored the evidence of black oral history on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a powerful incentive to turn aside anything to
suggest that the story might be true,'' Gordon-Reed said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some also believed that Jefferson ``was too cerebral to be
interested in sex,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Those historians include Mount Holyoke College professor Joseph
Ellis, who was quoted earlier this year as saying, ``I believe his
deepest sensual urges were directed at buildings, rather than at
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon-Reed called the findings ``quite gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that no matter what was said in my book it would never
be resolved based on what was (previously) known,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as a number of revisionist scholars emphasize
the disconcerting racist beliefs and other weaknesses of Jefferson,
a slave owner who declared in the Declaration of Independence that
``all men are created equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Historian Ellis and geneticist Eric Lander at the Whitehead
Institute in Cambridge, Mass. coauthored a commentary accompanying
the report in Nature. They said the new revelation adds ``a
dimension of hypocrisy'' and ``only deepens the paradoxes'' in
Jefferson's life.
</P>
<P>
   While never freeing the bulk of his slaves, Jefferson freed the
children of Sally Hemings, two informally by helping them escape
and the the other two formally. Eston, in particular, was said to
closely resemble Jefferson, contributing to the rumor of the
president's paternity, but this was countered by others who
attributed parentage to one or the other of two Jefferson nephews.
</P>
<P>
   For the testing project, Foster gathered blood samples from 19
men, including several descendants of Jefferson's paternal uncle,
as Jefferson himself had no surviving sons.
</P>
<P>
   The testing found that a specific pattern of genetic markers on
the Y chromosome of those Jeffersonian descendants exactly matched
the marker pattern on the Y chromosome carried by a male descendant
of Eston Hemings Jefferson. The genetic fingerprint is rare, the
scientists said, leaving only about a 1 percent probability that
they matched by chance.
</P>
<P>
   All males carry a Y chromosome that has been passed down through
their father's lineage, changing little from one generation to
another. (The two X chromosomes of a female, by contrast, can be
shuffled between paternal and maternal lineages). However, only in
the past two years have scientists found enough variable genetic
markers on the Y chromosome to match a distinctive pattern with a
particular male lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, who was born in 1743, married in 1772, but his wife,
Martha, died in 1782 after bearing six children. Only two of them,
both girls, survived to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1774, Sally Hemings, who was Martha's half-sister, came to
Jefferson as property bequeathed to him. She was one of about 150
slaves kept by Jefferson at Monticello, his estate outside
Charlottesville. Sally was described by a slave, Isaac Jefferson,
as ``mighty near white ... very handsome, long straight hair down
her back.''
</P>
<P>
   The affair is said to have begun when Jefferson, serving as
ambassador to France, brought Hemings to Paris in 1787 to care for
his daughter. Madison Hemings said specifically that his mother
became Jefferson's concubine at that time. Sally Hemings returned
with him to Monticello in 1789, and records show that Jefferson was
at Monticello during the times when all the children would have
been conceived.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor of their affair first became public when a former
Jefferson ally who turned against him publicized it in a newspaper
article in 1802, but the report was deemed politically motivated
and untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rumor persisted. In 1974, historian Fawn M. Brodie was
the first modern writer to give strong credence to the affair. Her
best-selling book, ``Jefferson: An Intimate History,'' stirred a
controversy that has lasted until now.
</P>
<P>
   Lander, the Whitehead Institute geneticist, pointed out that the
one child known from the DNA findings to be Jefferson's was born in
1808 _ six years after he had been accused of the liaison with his
slave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inconceivable that he didn't have a relationship before''
the damning newspaper article ``and then started one after'' it had
been published, said Lander.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson-Hemings question has been a popular topic for the
past few years among tourists visiting Monticello, and the guides
who lead tours around the historic site ``range from true believers
to absolute deniers,'' said Cinder Stanton, senior research
historian at Monticello. ``There's no party line,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   As for herself, Stanton, who has studied Jefferson's life for 30
years while at Monticello, said her position has recently changed.
Initially skeptical that he would engage in such an exploitative
relationship with a slave, Stanton said she became more or less
persuaded following a recent oral history project that involved
interviews with 20 descendants of Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing that story over and over again moved me from thinking
it was improbable to thinking it was probable,'' she said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lander and Ellis note that the DNA findings reveal nothing about
the character of the relationship, whether it was ``a tale of lust
and rape'' or mutual affection or ``something in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon-Reed, the NYU law school historian, said, ``I came away
feeling that we have no way of knowing, except that they had
children together over a 20-year period and they were named after
people who were important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Eston, for example, was named for Jefferson's favorite cousin,
Thomas Eston Randolph; Madison, in honor of Dolley Madison, wife of
President James Madison; Beverley (a son) and Harriet for members
of the Randolph family to whom Jefferson was related.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Allgor, assistant professor of history at Simmons
College agrees. If the affair were mainly about power and lust, she
says, ``Jefferson could have moved on'' to other, younger women.
</P>
<P>
   Allgor believes that the impact of the report will be felt
widely, ``because it was so easy for so long to think of Jefferson
not as a human being but an embodiment of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the new understanding that Jefferson's
descendants include people who are white, black, and intermediate
in color ``challenges our racial categories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what an American family looks like _ not dark people
down in the small house and white, First Family of Virginia people
up in the big house,'' Allgor said. ``An American family looks like
everybody.''

SPENDING BILL: MONSTER TO DEVOUR THE ENVIRONMENT  

</HEADLINE>
  (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
 &HT;     
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY    
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 40-pound, 4,000-page Omnibus Appropriations Bill (HR 4328)
had lots of room to hide anti-environmental riders. And it did.
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., called the bill an `elephantine
monstrosity` that hadn't been read in its entirety by anyone in
Congress. Now, it's the law. And the monstrosity walks.
</P>
<P>
   The 105th Congress, which just adjourned, takes the prize for
having the worst environmental record of any recent Congress. It
even beat the rape-and-scrape record of the 104th Congress. The
104th Congress passed 30 anti-environmental laws, the 105th topped
that with 44.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming at the red zone on the cough meter: The omnibus spending
bill prohibits the Department of Transportation from updating
standards for allowable air pollution from automobile and other
vehicles. Another rider on the bill discourages ride sharing and
car pooling, which have been effective in reducing air pollution in
urban areas. Three other provisions grant a highway project in
Alabama a total waiver from environmental review, and allow a New
York highway project and a California toll road project to
continue, no matter how harmful their environmental impacts.
</P>
<P>
   Bottoming out on the ignorance meter: In 1993, President Clinton
launched an initiative designed to show how the conservation of
natural resources helps local economies, and conversely, to show
the real cost of environmental degradation. The omnibus bill
prohibits the Economic and Statistics Administration and the
Department of Census from continuing these studies. Congress would
rather not know the real cost of rape-and-scrape politics and
doesn't want the public to know, either.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist of irony, this same bill directs the Office of
Management and Budget to do a cost-vs.-benefits analysis of federal
regulations and programs. Conservation groups see this as a way to
attack environmental measures.
</P>
<P>
   Paybacks to various industries for campaign contributions: Hard
rock mining reform is once again delayed by HR 4328. In addition,
the bill delays when the Oil Valuation Rule will go into effect _
saving the oil and gas industries nearly $66 million in royalty
payments. A hunk of that money would go to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The bill delays the phase-out of the pesticide methyl bromide
until the year 2005. Methyl bromide destroys stratospheric ozone
with a vengeance. More adults and children will be put at risk for
skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The omnibus bill allows the Bureau of Land Management to
re-authorize grazing permits without any environmental review.
</P>
<P>
   And the bill more than doubles the logging on 2.5 million acres
of national forest land in California's Sierra Nevada ecosystem,
including significant old-growth trees. Taxpayers will be billed
for more than 100 miles of logging roads through the area.
</P>
<P>
   The bill subsidizes more logging in the Tongass National Forest
in Alaska. And HR 4328 would sell trees in the national forests to
pay for so-called stewardship contracts with private companies to
restore national forests in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   A valuable hardwood forest in Tennessee and Kentucky called the
Land Between the Lakes will be taken from the Tennessee Valley
Authority and given to the U.S. Forest Service. The forest had been
set aside for educational purposes as well as habitat for migratory
birds. The bill creates incentives to log the 170,000-acre forest.
</P>
<P>
   The bill removes several land parcels that are within a
federally protected area, the Coastal Barrier Resources System
along the Florida coast, for private real estate development. The
fragile coastal barrier system was set aside in recognition of its
important ecology. The area is used by loggerhead and green sea
turtles and the endangered piping plover for nesting. Further, HR
4328 covers any houses and buildings on those hurricane-prone
parcels with federal insurance _ paid for by U.S. taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   And the bill allows a single senator to block funding aimed at
promoting policies in developing countries that are environmentally
sound and protect the climate. The provision could be used to
renege on the Kyoto climate protocols and the 1992 Rio Earth Summit
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's paybacks, big time.
</P>
<P>
   But those provisions aren't the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   HR 4328 prohibits the Department of the Interior from purchasing
any more land in Alaska, unless the secretary of the interior seeks
to exchange public land for the private land desired. This slows
down the process of acquiring parcels in that state's national
parks.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also removes funding for strategic planning in the
national forests under Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources
Planning Act.
</P>
<P>
   And the spending bill prohibits the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service from using federal funds to reintroduce the grizzly bear
into the Selway-Bitterroot ecosystem. Reintroduction is seen by
many wildlife organizations as vital to grizzly bear recovery in
the lower 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   This monster legislation was clumped together haphazardly and
zapped into life. And now the people have to live with it _ as it
clomps through our forests and over our lands like an enraged
Cyclops.

 &HT;    IRISH PEACE PROCESS STALLS OVER DISARMAMENT OF IRA
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Northern Ireland peace process showed signs of
stalling Monday in the aftermath of an weekend shooting death in
north Belfast and a deepening stalemate over disarming paramilitary
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Bertie Ahern, the prime minister of the Republic of Ireland,
arrived in Belfast Monday seeking to spur progress toward
disarmament. It was not clear by the end of the day if he had made
much progress.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came on the day an important deadline in the
process was missed because of the impasse over weapons
decommissioning. The new Northern Ireland assembly was scheduled to
have its cabinet in place by Saturday to begin assuming control
over most of the province's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the protracted dispute over disarming has prevented the
appointment of key government ministers from Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant leaders have refused to allow the appointment of
cabinet ministers from Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, until progress is made toward disarmament. The IRA
has declared a cease-fire in its decades-old war to force Britain
to relinquish control over Northern Ireland, but the predominantly
Catholic group still maintains a huge stockpile of weapons and
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, an advocate of Northern Ireland remaining a part
of Britain and the assembly's first minister, insists that the IRA
surrender its weapons before Sinn Fein can be allowed to assume its
cabinet positions.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinn Fein says the Good Friday agreement mediated by the
United States does not require disarming before the cabinet is
formed. Sinn Fein also says it cannot persuade the IRA to give up
its weapons until its members are seated in the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern is searching for a compromise in the cabinet issue. He
also is trying to create a North-South Ministerial Council, which
would boost the Irish Republic's influence in the north. Some
Protestant leaders want Ahern to pressure Sinn Fein into getting
the IRA to begin turning in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings Monday on the surface were unpromising, with the
leaders of the two sides trading verbal jabs between sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor said Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams was ``becoming a joke'' because of his assertion that
the Good Friday accord does not require IRA disarmament as a
condition to Sinn Fein's participation in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time Mr. Adams begins to deliver on his side of the
agreement,'' he said, adding that the requirement is explicit in
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Adams accused Trimble of pursuing a ``deliberate, go-slow''
policy and was unjustified in excluding Sinn Fein members from the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most of attention has been given to disarming the
IRA, Saturday's killing has been attributed to a small Protestant
paramilitary group, the Red Hand Defenders.
</P>
<P>
   The group has claimed responsibility for killing Brian Service.
The 35-year-old construction worker was shot in the head several
times in a Catholic area of North Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   While there are fears that the killing could spark reprisals,
Adams pledged to use his influence to urge the IRA not to break its
15-month cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, who shared this year's Nobel Peace Prize with
Trimble, called the rift over scrapping arms a ``silly
distraction'' standing in the way of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decommissioning is a silly distraction ... on the part of
those who are raising it,'' Hume, who was on a private visit to
Denmark, told Reuters News Service. He further noted that the April
peace agreement committed all sides to total disarmament within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to leave the past behind and build a new
future together. If we are going to draw up our past, all we are
doing is preserving the problem,'' said Hume, leader of Northern
Ireland's biggest Catholic party. ``A huge majority of people want
the agreement fully implemented as soon as possible and that is
what we should all be doing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. _ Standing in his study, a waltz playing in the
background, Bill Patrick reached into an old green duffel bag,
pulled out a garden sprayer and pointed out an inconspicuous detail
at its tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives it a lot more zip,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pumping the sprayer vigorously four or five times, he produced a
large cloud of fine particles that hung in the air like fog. He
smiled approvingly. His mock attack with deadly germs had gone
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if I were a terrorist and had a liquid product, I'd choose
this sprayer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How serious is the threat?
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares the hell out of me,'' replied Patrick, 72, a
cheerful man who seems haunted by dark visions. ``It's just a
matter of time. It's not if. It's when.''
</P>
<P>
   In ways obvious and otherwise, the United States is fast
becoming better prepared to defend itself against the menace of
biological terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   And the thanks, in part, go to Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, he worked for the federal government in secret
laboratories behind barbed wire, helping to harness germs for war,
overseeing ranks of scientists and engineers. He himself holds
three secret patents and shares two others.
</P>
<P>
   After President Richard Nixon ended the offensive program,
Patrick turned his efforts to finding ways to ward off biological
attacks from armies and terrorists, foreign or domestic.
</P>
<P>
   In the deserts of Iraq, working as an inspector for the United
Nations, he helped shatter the wall of deception around Saddam
Hussein's germ warfare program, which had secretly grown enough
pestilential microbes to kill everyone on Earth several times over.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick has now gone public. Quietly, he has mounted a personal
campaign to educate senior government officials, policy experts and
ordinary citizens about the risks of germ terrorism and how to
combat it. To do so, he gives talks, writes books and grants
interviews, opening a window on the once-secret world of germ
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   This man of dark expertise, a father of two, lives in a
comfortable home atop a wooded hill here, surrounded by classical
music, his wife, Virginia, and a small dog named Billy the Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick loves black humor, and his business card proudly bears a
skull and crossbones while his consulting firm's stationery is
topped with an image of the grim reaper.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes to shock guests with displays of simulated
biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to get people's reaction,'' he said with a
mischievous look as he pushed forward a handful of glass vials.
</P>
<P>
   Just two pounds of such germs, he said, ``can go a long, long
way in terms of hell and havoc.''
</P>
<P>
   William Capers Patrick III was born on July 24, 1926. The only
child of a produce broker, he grew up in Furman, S.C., a town of
150 people. He wanted to be an astronomer. But Army service in the
World War II showed him the near miracle of penicillin, just coming
into wide use.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he went to college eager to cure diseases and aid
the new field of antibiotic medicine. He received a bachelor's
degree in biology from the University of South Carolina in 1948
and, a year later, a master's degree in microbiology from the
University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   While working for a company in Indiana that made the new wonder
drugs, he got a call from an old teacher who had gone to work on
secret federal projects. The mentor encouraged Patrick to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You'll find this the most interesting work in the
world,''' Patrick recalled, adding that it was ``hard to turn down
your professor.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, after getting a top-secret clearance, Patrick began
working for the Army at Fort Detrick, in Frederick, Md. The base
was the heart of the government's secret mission to prepare for
biological combat, and work there was expanding rapidly as the
conflict in Korea escalated.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of growing communist power, Patrick excelled and quickly
became a team leader, dazzling supervisors with an array of
achievements, including methods he developed to grow lethal germs
and freeze-dry them for dispersal.
</P>
<P>
   By 1965, he was head of ``product development,'' leading about
80 scientists, engineers and technicians who worked to turn
bacteria, fungi, viruses and microbial toxins into ``products''
meant to kill and incapacitate people in gruesome ways.
</P>
<P>
   When the military secretly tested the deadly germs in remote
locales, Patrick was often the senior Fort Detrick official
present. For example, in 1968, he was among those watching as jets
spread germs over barges, anchored at sea a thousand miles
southwest of Hawaii. The barges were packed with hundreds of rhesus
monkeys and guinea pigs, half of which died.
</P>
<P>
   The American public knew nothing of such tests. But people did
know that Fort Detrick was germ central for the military, so
antiwar protesters of the era often marched outside its gates.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd turn their back on you,'' Patrick recalled. ``But we
thought we were doing the patriotic thing because we were risking
life and limb.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, three of his colleagues were accidentally exposed to
germ agents and later died. Patrick himself came down with Q fever,
a disease meant to immobilize enemy troops with fevers, headaches,
chills and coughing.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1969, Nixon abruptly ended the program.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics said he did so to foster an image as a peacemaker.
Federal experts later attributed the act to pragmatism. Germ
weapons, they said, were judged superfluous for a state already
heavily armed with conventional, chemical and nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick spent the next few years dismissing people and
dismantling the laboratories and plants he had helped build. ``We
flooded the market with all these microbiologists, chemists,
physicists,'' he recalled. ``It was a real bad time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, at Washington's urging, most nations renounced germ
warfare as immoral and repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Detrick went from ``black to white,'' Patrick said.
Switching hats himself, he went to work there developing germ
defenses at the newly established U.S. Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But the switch was difficult. He retired from the agency in
1986, at 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world,'' Patrick said. ``Defense studies are
so much more complicated. It takes 18 months to develop a
weapons-grade agent and 10 more years to develop a good vaccine
against it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was offensively oriented,'' he conceded. ``And that's my
expertise today.''
</P>
<P>
   As history would have it, his dark knowledge became increasingly
valuable to the federal authorities in the 1980s and 1990s as germ
threats and attacks grew in number.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Patrick helped the Federal Bureau of Investigation
prove that followers of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in Oregon had
poisoned salad bars with salmonella in an effort to keep voters
away in a local election. More than 750 people fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, as the United States and its allies prepared to force
Iraqi invaders from Kuwait, he helped evaluate the risk of a germ
attack. Responding to such advice, the American military began a
crash program to vaccinate troops against deadly anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, at a secluded spot around Washington, Patrick debriefed
the Russian defector known as Ken Alibek, who said that Moscow had
secretly produced hundreds of tons of anthrax, smallpox and plague
germs, ready to spur Armageddon despite having signed a treaty
banning such arms.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick interrogated him for the Central Intelligence Agency,
testing his credibility. ``We got right down to it,'' he recalled.
``I won't say we fell in love, but we gained an immediate respect
for one another.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Patrick joined a U.N. team to investigate a factory
complex in Iraq spread across seven miles of desert. His
observations there helped show that microbe driers ostensibly for
making herbicides were actually meant to produce deadly germs in
large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   The next year was a turning point. The Iraqis admitted, finally,
to having undertaken a vast effort to prepare for biological war.
The same year, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo released nerve gas
in Tokyo subways, killing a dozen people and injuring thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick aided the American authorities in tracking the cult,
helping to discover a series of failed germ attacks and learning
that the biological assaults were meant to kill millions. A cultist
later testified that the sect had even attacked two American naval
bases near Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In his efforts to raise public awareness about biological
terrorism, Patrick has taken many routes, some more visible than
others.
</P>
<P>
   He quietly advised Richard Preston, author of ``The Cobra
Event'' (Random House, 1997), a novel about a germ terrorist's
attack on New York City. The book so alarmed President Clinton that
he had his intelligence experts assess its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick himself is a co-author of ``Jane's Chem-Bio Handbook''
(Jane's Information Group, 1998), an antiterrorism guide for health
professionals. It discusses germ agents, how terrorists might
spread them and how to avoid, diagnose and treat illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to reports in the lay press, municipal water supplies
are very difficult to contaminate,'' he wrote, explaining that
``dilution and diffusion factors as well as chlorination'' weaken
such assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick's voice is authoritative and at times contentious on
different kinds of germ defenses.
</P>
<P>
   He is critical of vaccines, despite a Clinton administration
push to stockpile them for crises. A smart adversary, he holds,
will usually be able to find a way around immunizations, most
readily by choosing a different germ or by modifying an old one.
</P>
<P>
   As a first line of defense, Patrick urges tightening controls on
legitimate germ commerce _ an inconspicuous trade that has helped
scientists study and crush diseases around the globe. But American
germ banks have also inadvertently delivered noxious microbes to
hostile armies and domestic terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have better controls,'' Patrick said. ``We've got
to make it a penalty for these cultures to get out.'' Washington is
starting to limit germ sales in the United States, but no parallel
effort yet exists among the world's 1,000 or so other microbe
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick also criticizes lax security at airports and major
government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He loves to perform his own impromptu tests by dragging bags
filled with germ paraphernalia through checkpoints at places like
the Pentagon, the State Department and Washington's Dulles
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbing his old green duffel bag, he displayed its jumble of
sprayers, glass vials, plastic bags and simulated agents _ a
witch's brew of biological malice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's ever stopped me,'' he said, shaking his head.
``Nobody's ever stopped and asked, `What's all this stuff?'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Patrick's most novel enthusiasm centers on strengthening
major government buildings and even individual homes against germ
attack by adjusting their air flow. He has strongly urged private
and federal officials to adopt such measures, which are said to be
planned for New York City's $15 million crisis control center.
</P>
<P>
   His idea, which he calls positive pressure, is to bolster
ventilation systems so a gentle breeze blows outward through a
building whenever a door or window is opened. In theory, this wind
would keep the structure safe from dangerous germs by automatically
sweeping them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so simple,'' Patrick said. ``As bad as biological warfare
is, this is an effective way of keeping things under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said he had no guilt about his long labors to develop
germ weapons, only a sense of foreboding. Terrorist attacks with
germs are inevitable, he said. The government is taking a number of
prudent safeguards and in no way is exaggerating the threat, so far
as he can tell.
</P>
<P>
   The big uncertainty, Patrick added, is how severe the attacks
will be and whether the United States has the wherewithal to
protect itself adequately and defuse the potential harm and mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   It must try to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any other option,'' he said.

NEW HOPE FOR LOSERS IN THE BATTLE TO STAY AWAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Pa., Canada)   (The Science Times)  
(mk) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is midafternoon on the eastern coast of a chronically
sleep-deprived nation and if you listen carefully, you can hear the
whoosh of cappuccino makers and the ripping open of No-Doz boxes
and the yawns of night-shift workers and the sighs of pilots as
they check their watches to see how much longer they must keep
their aircraft aloft.
</P>
<P>
   They are the sounds of the struggle to stay awake, a major
enterprise in a country that long ago exchanged the effortless
biological cycle of sleep and waking for the tyranny of electric
lights, job-plus-kids living, graveyard shifts and packages that
absolutely, positively have to be there overnight.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of workplace accidents in the United States are
caused by human error, studies show, many of them the result of a
failure of alertness at critical times. Jet-lag sufferers,
all-night workers, the elderly and the multitude of Americans with
disorders like sleep apnea and narcolepsy wage a continual battle
against excessive daytime sleepiness. And staying awake supports a
multibillion-dollar industry that serves up a variety of
stimulants, legal and illegal, and sleep promoters, offering hope
that a good night's sleep will bring alertness the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the search for artificial compounds to enhance wakefulness
is a chronicle of limited success. Caffeine, for all its appeal, is
not especially potent, and in high doses can be unpleasant, causing
irritability, tremor and excessive urination.
</P>
<P>
   Amphetamines, the wonder drugs of the 1950s and '60s, quickly
opened a Pandora's box of side effects and abuse. The drugs keep
people awake, but they also produce euphoria and the jitters,
revving up the central nervous system and causing the heart rate
and blood pressure to jump. And once the effects wear off, users
soon crave more of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of lawsuits, drug companies gave up trying to improve
alertness, and for 20 years have devoted most of their efforts to
developing new sleep-promoting drugs, seeking to maximize high
quality sleep while minimizing day-after hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   But that may soon change. By Dec. 31, the Food and Drug
Administration is to decide whether a new compound called modafinil
can be marketed as a treatment for excessive sleepiness associated
with narcolepsy, a severe sleep disorder that afflicts about one in
1,000 Americans. Approval of the drug would also open the door to
``off-label'' use, allowing doctors to prescribe it for other
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   If modafinil goes on the market, many sleep scientists believe,
it could usher in a new era of wakefulness compounds and help
researchers unlock the mysteries of sleep and waking. But at the
same time, the arrival of the drug will raise profound questions
about how, as a society, Americans choose to cope with their
perpetual lack of sleep and their constant campaign to stay awake.
</P>
<P>
   Modafinil, to be sold under the trade name Provigil, is licensed
to Cephalon Inc., a small pharmaceutical company in West Chester,
Pa. Since its discovery by French scientists in the late 1970s, the
compound has stirred interest among sleep researchers because it
appears to work entirely differently from other alertness drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first drug in history to selectively promote
wakefulness in a way analogous to how the brain normally wakes
up,'' said Dr. Dale Edgar, associate professor of psychiatry and
behavioral science at Stanford University, who conducted
preclinical trials of Provigil for Cephalon and has done other
animal studies of the drug financed by the Air Force Office of
Research. ``Modafinil is certainly not a real substitute for
getting sleep. That would be a misuse of this drug. But I
personally believe it has great promise for a much wider range of
sleep disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   In human trials, modafinil appears more effective than caffeine
without causing the anxiety, euphoria and cardiovascular effects of
amphetamines. Four years of on-the-market experience in France,
where the drug is sold as Mododial, and clinical trials financed by
Cephalon in this country have revealed few side effects. The most
common complaints are mild headache and slight nausea, and these
are infrequent. Preliminary studies suggest that modafinil is
nonaddictive and that it does not induce tolerance in users.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jed Black, director of Stanford University's Sleep Disorders
Clinic and a participant in the clinical trials, said subjects
taking the drug reported feeling ``naturally alert, like they'd
taken a good nap and felt good.'' And modafinil does not seem to
touch off rebound sleepiness _ the ``crash'' familiar to
amphetamine users _ after it is discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds too good to be true, it could turn out to be.
More than a few promising drugs have shown serious problems once
they became widely prescribed. The diet drugs Fen-phen, withdrawn
from the market after patients developed heart valve problems, are
a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have the drug out there, and you've got to see
what it does,'' said Dr. Philip Smith, director of the Johns
Hopkins University Sleep Disorders Center, who was not involved in
the Provigil trials. ``It would really mean something to have a
medication that can stimulate the brain and keep it awake without
juicing the whole system. The proof is in the pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials of new drugs are typically small (558 patients
at 39 sleep disorder clinics around the country took part in two
trials of Provigil), and the studies are almost always financed by
the drug company that wants to market the compound, a fact that
some experts believe limits the usefulness of the research. And
while France has four years of experience with Mododial,
prescription of the drug there is tightly controlled, and its users
have been limited to patients suffering from narcolepsy or from
idiopathic hypersomnia, another relatively rare sleep disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions about modafinil remain to be answered. Scientists
do not know, for example, how long the drug can keep people awake,
and they are only beginning to discover its effects on judgment,
reaction time and other aspects of cognitive and physical
performance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In one study, by Dr. Ross Pigeau, Dr. Joseph Baranski and their
colleagues at the Canadian Defense and Civil Institute of
Environmental Medicine, 41 military reservists were deprived of
sleep for 64 hours, given modafinil, an amphetamine or a dummy
medication and were required to perform a repeated series of
cognitive tasks. Those subjects on modafinil and amphetamines
performed significantly better than those given a placebo. But the
modafinil group, while experiencing fewer side effects than the
amphetamine group, was also more likely to be overconfident,
overestimating abilities after performance declined _ a problem
that, if it proved common, could severely limit the drug's use in
the general population.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest unanswered question about modafinil, however, is:
How does it work? Central nervous system stimulants like
amphetamines achieve their effects by increasing levels of chemical
messengers in areas of the brain associated with arousal, and also
with pleasure and locomotor activity. In particular, amphetamines
act on a brain chemical called dopamine, which scientists believe
is responsible for the euphoria the drugs produce and also their
potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Modafinil, in contrast, does not appear to affect dopamine, or
if it does, it does so only very weakly. Nor does the drug seem to
target other neurotransmitters _ adrenaline and serotonin, for
example _ affected by amphetamines. Caffeine blocks the action of
the chemical substance adenosine, which scientists believe promotes
sleep. But modafinil, studies have found, seems indifferent to
adenosine as well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, work by Dr. Michel Jouvet, a French sleep researcher,
and his colleagues suggests that modafinil increases cellular
activity in an area of the brain adjacent to the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, or SCN, the body's circadian clock. And this fits nicely
with scientists' best guess as to how the brain maintains
wakefulness, a theory developed by Edgar of Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   According to Edgar's theory, the sleep-wake cycle represents a
battle between oppositional forces: the SCN, on the one hand, and
the pressure to sleep on the other. The SCN, through communication
with other brain areas, acts like an alarm ringing throughout the
day to fight back sleepiness and maintain wakefulness. In the
morning, when sleep pressure for humans is low, the SCN does not
need to work very hard to keep a person awake. But as the day goes
on, sleep pressure builds, and the bell rings louder and louder to
fight off fatigue. At night, the clock's output diminishes, the
clock stops ringing and the built-up sleep pressure rushes in,
swooping the tired day warrior into the Land of Nod.
</P>
<P>
   Modafinil, Edgar and others believe, may act by somehow invoking
the clock's natural alerting mechanism, keeping the alarm
``ringing'' well beyond the time when it normally shuts off. And if
this is the case, modafinil and other drugs like it would offer the
possibility of literally doing away with sleep, fooling the body
into staying ``naturally'' awake for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Would such a drug be a cure for shift workers and jet lagged
travelers and overworked mothers with bills to pay and reports to
file? Who would be permitted to take it? Police officers? Soldiers?
Airplane pilots? These are questions, says Dr. David Dinges, chief
of the Division of Sleep and Chronobiology in psychiatry at the
University of Pennsylvania, that society will have to address
sooner or later, as the new generation of wake-promoting drugs
emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on an inexorable march to uncovering the biology of
wakefulness and manipulating it,'' Dinges said. Modafinil may not
live up to expectations. ``But when such a drug does arrive, it
will change the world. Is it OK for us to become a nation that
doesn't sleep? Until we know what sleep is for, and why it is so
overwhelming, we're not going to be able to say it's OK to find a
substitute for it.''

49ERS LOSS NOT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ It was the obvious question, and Tim McDonald
gave what seems to be the obvious answer. The San Francisco 49ers
are squat for their last five against the Green Bay Packers, so
what's the grand truth to be gleaned?
</P>
<P>
   ``That we'd better not lose six in a row,'' he said with a
helpless smile.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he is raising the bar yet again before this
nagging problem the 49ers have with the Packers officially becomes,
in Steve Young's words, ``a thing.'' As though five in a row is not
a trend worth worrying about. Which, of course, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 36-22 beating, though, seemed somehow different than
the other four _ somehow not as comprehensive or explanatory of the
way things are in the NFC. Yes, the result was pretty clear, and
yes the 49ers' trouble spots (pass defense and pass protection)
were as troublesome and spotty as ever, and they even can be found
guilty of blowing their own comeback. And yes, there are still
those nagging whispers that the 49ers have gone a long time without
beating a team of consequence in a meaningful game.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there are lots of reasons to think the 49ers
have betrayed themselves as a game but obvious runner-up yet again.
</P>
<P>
   That, though, depends largely on how you feel about the Packers'
own Super Bowl chances. And Minnesota's, for that matter. Indeed,
unlike the other four losses to Green Bay, which made the Packers
the best team in the NFC by definition, this one only helped muddy
the waters for the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota lost at Tampa, thereby stripping the Vikings of their
air of dazzling intrigue. The Packers beat the 49ers with
convincing numbers and ancillary bruising. Atlanta, strangely
enough, won again. The conference is not better defined by the
events of the weekend, but more obscured. In such a case, it might
well be that even if the 49ers really cannot beat the Packers,
there is no guarantee that they will face them in the postseason
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, you like your cataclysmic defeats to explain much
more. Instead, this one pointed out the 49ers' recurring flaws, and
displayed a new one, rather than elevated the Packers to
untouchability.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the secondary remain obvious, even in the
absence of team scapegoat Antonio Langham. The Packers scored three
times on one-play drives, twice on cornerback Marquez Pope's side
of the field _ once, on Antonio Freeman's 80-yard catch on the
game's first play, when the zone help behind him didn't
materialize, and a second, Robert Brooks' 30-yarder, when his
touchy back restricted his motion.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the offensive line were even more obvious.
Young was sacked a ridiculous nine times _ early and late, when the
49ers needed big plays to match Green Bay's. Right tackle Derrick
Deese had a dreadful time with the resurgent Reggie White, left
tackle Jamie Brown was repeatedly overwhelmed by Vonnie Holliday,
and center Chris Dalman injured his knee again.
</P>
<P>
   Most evident, though, was San Francisco's inability to score
quickly, or even to gain yardage with intentionally bold strokes.
J.J. Stokes dropped (or had stripped from him) one apparent
touchdown, and couldn't keep his feet in bounds on another. Their
biggest gains came (in chronological order) on an 18-yard scramble
by Young, a quick look-in to Jerry Rice that he turned into a
12-yard score, a play action pass off a fake reverse to Garrison
Hearst than went for 20, a 30-yard touchdown run by Hearst and a
dumpoff to Terry Kirby that he turned into a 25-yard gainer by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, on the other hand, scored three times on one-play
drives, ``and you can't do that against a good team and ever expect
to win,'' McDonald lamented. The Packers had all the lightning,
which is what the 49ers have always claimed as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it like we didn't make enough big plays,'' Young said.
``When we scored, we were doing it with pretty long, steady drives.
But we didn't get the 60-yard slant we usually get, the big
game-breaker, and we needed a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Steve Mariucci looked almost shell-shocked in
post-game interviews, and some people thought he might have teared
up after the game. The other 49ers, though, seemed remarkably calm
about this latest Packer win. Perhaps that is only because their
season didn't end. They did not come into this game as the obvious
conference favorite, nor did they come in with their entire year's
work at risk. For a team both burdened and energized by their own
history, they did not take overt note of any such disaster attached
to this loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, that's what people are talking about,'' Young
said about the can't-beat-the-Pack tag the 49ers must continue to
wear, ``but for the players, we have to take it like, OK, let's go
win the rest of them, let's go 14-2. That's what you do in
football.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what you do when you have a fallback position,
which the 49ers have for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, well after the game, Young, who normally wears his
emotions on his sleeve after losses of this depth and breadth,
looked at the gaggle of reporters still standing around him and
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about something else,'' he said playfully. ``C'mon,
anybody wanna fight?''
</P>
<P>
   Now either he knows something we don't, or we think something he
doesn't. Either way, it was not the response of a man who thinks
five losses in a row to a fellow championship contender explains
the natural order of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Now six, on the other hand ...

   GUN-LOCK _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Shares of Saf T Lok, a small
gun-lock manufacturer based in West Palm Beach, had fallen to a
dismal 37 cents a share in late September of last year. The company
had lost $733,790 in the first nine months of the year on
disappointing sales, according to filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and was facing delisting by the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Then President Clinton stepped into the Rose Garden on
Thursday, Oct. 9, 1997, with eight major gun manufacturers. He
extracted their pledge to put locks on every gun sold, launching
Saf T Lok's second life. In two days, Saf T Lok's share price
soared 11-fold. In four days, it cut a financing deal that assured
its place on Nasdaq and gave it capital for the future. It was the
company's highest point. Before and since, Saf T Lok, 10 years old
next year, has stumbled. An in-depth story. (Pounds, Palm Beach

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Earlier in the century, East Lake was
the home course of the legendary Bobby Jones. Three years ago, the
course and club buildings were brought back to their former
splendor through the efforts of Atlanta developer and
philanthropist Tom Cousins. With the wealthy again enjoying the
course, just 10 minutes east of downtown, ``East Lake'' is now
emblazed on cotton golf shirts selling for $100. But for decades,
the East Lake name also conjured up images that had nothing to do
with clipped greens and Bermuda roughs. Crime, violence, drug
dealing and despair overshadowed the leafy beauty of the old
neighborhood. (Geewax, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (k, f) MOVED.

   THE-MECHANIC _ ATLANTA _ I recently attended a public hearing
held by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. The turnout
was small _ a handful of auto industry representatives and state
bureaucrats. We in the auto repair industry weren't required to be
there. We didn't go because the subject matter was especially
spectacular. The agenda item we had come to hear and object to was
the extension of the $200 waiver limit for vehicles failing the
metro Atlanta area's emission test _ and continuing to contribute
to the deterioration of Atlanta's air quality. The waiver limit
means cars that fail the state's emission test can be granted a
waiver _ and permission to get new tags for two years _ if the
owner spends at least $200 fixing the car and it shows some
improvement. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

France lead me to believe that entering the mind of a Gallic
software designer would be like walking into a carnival funhouse

<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ Every time I download a new version of Netscape
Communicator or Microsoft Internet Explorer _ the two most popular
programs for browsing the World Wide Web _ I am reminded of a
multi-function of a Swiss Army knife. The competition has gotten so
heated between the two Web browsers that each tries hard to outdo
the other by loading in new features. There are so many I truly
can't remember what all of them do. And since I don't use them, I
never get reminded. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   TECH-MEDIA _ Parents don't much care for it, but that hasn't
stopped ``Quake'' from being a hit with male children of all ages.
Now the third version of the gory shoot-'em-up is set for release,

   MAC-REPORT _ ATLANTA _ No question about it. The iMac is one
sharp-looking computer. But is it a good buy? I'd argue not. A
better investment would be any of Apple Computer's G3 desktop
models. Now, before you start flaming me with e-mail charges of
betrayal, let me explain. I consider the iMac a good, if not great,

THE LEGACY OF JOHN GLENN'S MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;

WHITE in Kansas City at (800) 444-0267 or (816) 822-8448, or fax

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    John Glenn's historic journey into orbit at the age of 77 has
returned some of the luster to a space program sorely in need of a
little excitement. Thirty-six years after becoming the first
American to orbit the earth, Glenn is doing it again: he will
boldly go where no septuagenarian has gone before.
 &HT;    The mission has clearly raised NASA's profile at a time when it
needs to foster public support for projects like the International
Space Station.
 &HT;    Critics have taken notice, describing Glenn's flight on the
space shuttle Discovery as an obvious publicity ploy. But both
Glenn and the space agency insist that his participation in the
mission will yield scientific benefits that could improve our
understanding of the aging process.
 &HT;    The ``aging studies'' planned for the mission are actually a
series of tests that will examine how Glenn's body responds to the
rigors of space flight. Multiple organ systems will be analyzed --
evaluating everything from the electrical activity of his heart to
the status of his immune system -- to see if an ``old'' body reacts
differently than a younger one.
 &HT;    If Glenn's body shows a distinctive response, scientists hope to
discover clues that could shed light on how the body ages.
 &HT;    ``We would need to ask why aging has changed the response
pattern,'' explains Dr. Ronald White, associate director of the
National Space Biomedical Research Institute. Additional studies
would then have to be performed to explore this question.
 &HT;    But even if Glenn reacts differently than younger astronauts, no
reliable conclusions can be drawn from a study sample consisting of
only one person. White acknowledges this limitation, but he notes
that there are other approaches we could take to learn about the
aging process. This is because space travel seems to mimic the
aging process in some unexpected ways.
 &HT;    For reasons that remain unclear, space travel induces a series
of ailments surprisingly similar to some of the classic problems of
old age. For instance, both astronauts and the elderly often
experience impaired motor coordination, sleep disturbances and the
loss of muscle mass and bone. Both groups also tend to experience
problems with balance and impaired immune function.
 &HT;    As White points out, these parallels could prove useful in
helping us understand the mysteries of aging. By searching for the
cause of the problems seen in astronauts, we might learn more about
similar problems faced by the geriatric population.
 &HT;    And if the underlying mechanism for these changes is similar in
both groups, then space could serve as a unique ``laboratory'' for
the study of aging -- in effect, a space lab would accelerate
certain age-related changes, making them easier to study.
 &HT;    Though space travelers and the elderly seem to share certain
physical characteristics, there is one key difference between the
two groups: the astronauts appear to recover fully on their return
to earth. This difference might be exploited to our advantage as
well.
 &HT;    By studying how astronauts recover after space travel, we might
learn how to help the elderly recover in a similar fashion. Of
course, all of this depends on a direct link between
``age-related'' and ``space-related'' physical problems -- if the
problems of the elderly turned out to be significantly different
from the problems seen in astronauts, then space research would
probably be of limited value to the aging population.
 &HT;    This is why the aging studies planned for the Discovery flight
may yield little useful information for older Americans. Moreover,
strictly speaking, they aren't really ``aging studies'' -- they're
simply a series of tests on a single 77-year-old man to see how his
body reacts to the extraterrestrial environment. While we may learn
something about the effects of space flight on John Glenn, it seems
unlikely that we'll learn much about the aging process itself.
 &HT;    So is the Discovery mission a publicity maneuver or a geriatric
research expedition?
 &HT;    It's probably a little of both. NASA certainly has gained
enormous publicity from Glenn's participation, and his research
will probably tell us more about the elderly in space than the
elderly on the ground.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, as White observes, ``The senator has been able to
inspire hope in the elderly that they can still do extraordinary
things.''
 &HT;    In the end, this may be the most important legacy of the
Discovery mission. At the very least, Glenn's journey into space
will inspire an aging population with the knowledge that it's never
too late to do the impossible, and that the definition of ``growing
old'' is fluid indeed.

THE LEGACY OF JOHN GLENN'S MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    John Glenn's historic journey into orbit at the age of 77 has
returned some of the luster to a space program sorely in need of a
little excitement. Thirty-six years after becoming the first
American to orbit the earth, Glenn is doing it again: he will
boldly go where no septuagenarian has gone before.
 &HT;    The mission has clearly raised NASA's profile at a time when it
needs to foster public support for projects like the International
Space Station.
 &HT;    Critics have taken notice, describing Glenn's flight on the
space shuttle Discovery as an obvious publicity ploy. But both
Glenn and the space agency insist that his participation in the
mission will yield scientific benefits that could improve our
understanding of the aging process.
 &HT;    The ``aging studies'' planned for the mission are actually a
series of tests that will examine how Glenn's body responds to the
rigors of space flight. Multiple organ systems will be analyzed --
evaluating everything from the electrical activity of his heart to
the status of his immune system -- to see if an ``old'' body reacts
differently than a younger one.
 &HT;    If Glenn's body shows a distinctive response, scientists hope to
discover clues that could shed light on how the body ages.
 &HT;    ``We would need to ask why aging has changed the response
pattern,'' explains Dr. Ronald White, associate director of the
National Space Biomedical Research Institute. Additional studies
would then have to be performed to explore this question.
 &HT;    But even if Glenn reacts differently than younger astronauts, no
reliable conclusions can be drawn from a study sample consisting of
only one person. White acknowledges this limitation, but he notes
that there are other approaches we could take to learn about the
aging process. This is because space travel seems to mimic the
aging process in some unexpected ways.
 &HT;    For reasons that remain unclear, space travel induces a series
of ailments surprisingly similar to some of the classic problems of
old age. For instance, both astronauts and the elderly often
experience impaired motor coordination, sleep disturbances and the
loss of muscle mass and bone. Both groups also tend to experience
problems with balance and impaired immune function.
 &HT;    As White points out, these parallels could prove useful in
helping us understand the mysteries of aging. By searching for the
cause of the problems seen in astronauts, we might learn more about
similar problems faced by the geriatric population.
 &HT;    And if the underlying mechanism for these changes is similar in
both groups, then space could serve as a unique ``laboratory'' for
the study of aging -- in effect, a space lab would accelerate
certain age-related changes, making them easier to study.
 &HT;    Though space travelers and the elderly seem to share certain
physical characteristics, there is one key difference between the
two groups: the astronauts appear to recover fully on their return
to earth. This difference might be exploited to our advantage as
well.
 &HT;    By studying how astronauts recover after space travel, we might
learn how to help the elderly recover in a similar fashion. Of
course, all of this depends on a direct link between
``age-related'' and ``space-related'' physical problems -- if the
problems of the elderly turned out to be significantly different
from the problems seen in astronauts, then space research would
probably be of limited value to the aging population.
 &HT;    This is why the aging studies planned for the Discovery flight
may yield little useful information for older Americans. Moreover,
strictly speaking, they aren't really ``aging studies'' -- they're
simply a series of tests on a single 77-year-old man to see how his
body reacts to the extraterrestrial environment. While we may learn
something about the effects of space flight on John Glenn, it seems
unlikely that we'll learn much about the aging process itself.
 &HT;    So is the Discovery mission a publicity maneuver or a geriatric
research expedition?
 &HT;    It's probably a little of both. NASA certainly has gained
enormous publicity from Glenn's participation, and his research
will probably tell us more about the elderly in space than the
elderly on the ground.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, as White observes, ``The senator has been able to
inspire hope in the elderly that they can still do extraordinary
things.''
 &HT;    In the end, this may be the most important legacy of the
Discovery mission. At the very least, Glenn's journey into space
will inspire an aging population with the knowledge that it's never
too late to do the impossible, and that the definition of ``growing
old'' is fluid indeed.

AN ARIZONA RANCH THAT SATISFIES LOPERS AND TENDERFEET ALIKE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sun., Nov. 8)  
 (fb) 
By NANCY SHARKEY c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Galloping through the Sonoran desert, we were
all horse hoofs and dust, stirring fragrant creosote and mesquite
as we pulled up at the edge of a cool cottonwood grove in Coronado
National Forest to admire the green Rincon Mountains in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   High on horseback was a painless way to tour the Arizona desert,
with horsehide rather than our shins facing down the cactus
needles. Our horses easily scaled rugged hills, giving us stunning
views of saguaro rising like telephone poles from the desert scrub.
On our visit in mid-June, crowns of daisylike blossoms topped the
stubby limbs of the saguaro, and other cactus varieties blossomed
too, the remnants of a lushly dramatic spring after El Nino's
rains.
</P>
<P>
   My husband, Joe, and I were staying at Tanque Verde Ranch
outside Tucson, which offers good horses, hearty ranch food,
comfortable rooms and majestic scenery. Thirty minutes from the
center of the city, the ranch abuts Saguaro National Park and the
national forest and, with the Park Service, maintains a large
network of good riding trails. In addition to several trail rides
every day, the ranch gives daily lessons in horsemanship _ both
brief and more extensive lessons on Western-style walking, trotting
and loping, or cantering.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch's 75 rooms are arranged in 18 pink stucco buildings,
secluded amid plots of carefully tended cactus and mesquite. A long
hacienda with wide veranda is the main house, with a
timber-ceilinged dining room that opens onto a large outdoor pool
with a cascading waterfall. Next to it are a fitness center with
indoor pool, sauna and five tennis courts, one with lights. It was
a relief to discover that the bungalows did not have televisions.
Children have a well-organized supervised all-day camp that keeps
them separate from their parents. And, as it turned out, my husband
and I ended up on separate tracks during large parts of our four
days. While I was out loping through the countryside, he was back
at the ranch playing tennis or sunning by the pool.
</P>
<P>
   This is because guests are divided into two groups: lopers and
nonlopers _ that is, those who prove steady on a loping, or
running, horse, and those who either are unsteady or cannot get
their horse to run. Wranglers give a test. I passed; he did not.
</P>
<P>
   My husband has been on dozens of trail rides, but he didn't have
the kind of experience that enables a rider to get a horse into a
gallop on a blazing hot day when it would rather be munching hay in
the shade.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangler said Joe needed to ``communicate with the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't communicate with the dead,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in its information for visitors the resort makes the
wranglers' role clear: Their judgment is final on all matters.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangler was matter-of-fact. To us five women and to one
man, he said, ``You passed.''
</P>
<P>
   To the four others, he said, ``You can all come back for another
lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe decided not to. Instead, he and I agreed that we would take
a daily walking ride each afternoon together, and I would go on the
loping rides alone at 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. He was a good sport,
partly because he knew how much I was looking forward to riding
again after several years out of the saddle (as it turns out he has
since become a pretty good rider himself).
</P>
<P>
   Experienced riders quickly discover the ranch's inner sanctum _
a world of strong, responsive horses, small riding parties and good
gallops through dusty washes of the Gila River system. For other
guests, the walking rides turned out to be satisfyingly strenuous
climbs in the mountains, and among other activities are hikes with
a naturalist, mountain biking, fishing (for catfish), tennis and
swimming. Several others were spending their week hiking and
mountain biking.
</P>
<P>
   That the ranch can provide two parallel experiences is not
surprising, given its history. Founded in 1868 by a Mexican
cattleman, who called it La Cebadilla after the wild barley along
the river, the ranch soon became a place for both horsemen and
greenhorns. Like many Western ranchers of the era, the owners
quickly discovered that Easterners were willing to pay large sums
of money to play cowboy. They changed the name to Tanque Verde _
green tank, or pool _ because they thought it more appealing for
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Tanque Verde sold off its cattle business in the
late '50s, the owners still graze 300 head of cattle. During our
stay, every spare hand went up into the national forest to help
drive the herd to greener summer pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The line of demarcation between wrangler and resort is the
mesquite fence of the corral and the ranch's spacious tack house.
As one approaches, the horses stir, a few running the others off.
All the storied Western breeds and coats are there _ paints and
appaloosas, bay and chestnut quarterhorses, registered mustang
ponies and even a saddle mule.
</P>
<P>
   We visited during the off-season, when the resort was only about
half full, a bonus because we had no trouble getting our favorite
horses for every ride. Despite warnings about desert summers, the
weather was fine, with highs in the 90's, sunny and dry days, and
evenings in the 60's, perfect for tennis under the lights. Later,
snuggled on lounge chairs under blankets, we looked at stars that
seemed light-years closer than they did at home.
</P>
<P>
   Meals were a highlight _ plenty of good food and communal tables
with funny, smart dining companions. After dinner, naturalists
presented slide shows on insects, caves and gems.
</P>
<P>
   Our small but well-planned room, with a stone corner fireplace
and enough tile to suggest a Spanish influence, had a tiled bath,
refrigerator and shady porch to escape the sun. The room was one of
four in a casita overlooking a lush grass lawn, kept alive by a
small underground sprinkler. An opportunistic desert wren had
harvested dry tendrils to build herself a nest in the gnarls of a
cholla cactus. Cement paths, illuminated by walkway lights, seemed
precariously placed on the desert floor. Prickly pear and saguaro,
barrel cactus and ocotillo were set among mesquite trees and
creosote bushes, all carefully labeled with botanical signs.
</P>
<P>
   Our first dinner was the twice-weekly steak-fry in the
cottonwood grove, a Texas-sized affair prepared on a cinder-block
barbecue the size of a railroad car. Red gingham covered the picnic
tables, weighted with kerosene lanterns, and a guitar-playing
cowboy with a microphone sang standards like ``Red River Valley''
and ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds.'' He even yodeled, much to the
amusement of several small boys there with their families.
</P>
<P>
   What looked like 100 pounds of New York strip steaks sizzled
over the mesquite fire, along with a few chicken breasts and a
couple of hamburgers. Ranch beans, corn on the cob and home fries
laced with peppers and onions filled vats heating on another part
of the grill. There was also a buffet table of crudites, pickles
and fruit, but the traffic went to the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Early next morning in the lodge, where we gathered for coffee
before our ride, a petite woman from London traveling alone
confessed that she'd had two steaks. ``Haven't eaten it for two
years,'' she said, explaining, ``mad cow disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Still on Eastern time, we were up and ready for the Sunday
breakfast ride at 6:45. Since we had not yet taken the loping test,
we went on the walking ride. The three lopers mounted first, as I
looked on enviously. Then the wranglers sized us up and picked our
horses. Trail horses are often sour, stubbornly following the horse
ahead and resisting the rider, so I was pleased that mine seemed
immediately responsive and game.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Up and down rocky hills, we took the long way to a spot called
the Old Homestead, the peak of hill where ruins of a stone house
overlook the ranch and, beyond it, the entire Tucson valley. The
wranglers tied up the horses, and we gathered on tree stumps and
picnic tables as the ranch owner, Bob Cote, fixed blueberry
pancakes on a mesquite-fed grill with big, flat cast-iron griddles.
Spread out on another grill were big pans of ranch eggs, bacon,
sausages, home fries and biscuits, and homemade guava jelly.
</P>
<P>
   The children arrived separately, on their own ponies, with their
own counselors. They ride in the morning, take horsemanship lessons
in their own ring, go swimming and have their own naturalist walks.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the lodge, where tankards of lemonade and ice water
attract a steady flow of guests, I saw two teen-age boys we'd met
at breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going mountain biking?'' one asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, nature walk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we did that yesterday. We saw a rattlesnake and a king
snake. The rest was a girl talking about cactus and flowers. You
might like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature walk, led by an anthropologist named Vivian
MacKinnon, gave us a good sense of how the Indians survived in the
desert. They harvested century plants, which look like aloe on
steroids, for fibers and natural needle and thread (the Spanish
figured out how to ferment them for tequila); they ground mesquite
seeds into flour, and ate pea pods from paloverde, wild barley,
range hackberries and buds and fruit from cholla and prickly pear.
</P>
<P>
   Having noticed how the horses managed to avoid brushing against
cactus, we asked if this was true of other Sonoran creatures.
Vivian said this was mostly the case, though accidents do happen.
Some get careless, she said, ``and every so often you'll see a bird
that has accidentally crucified itself on a cactus.''
</P>
<P>
   She showed us an area called the bird ramada, which has various
feeders and a bench for watchers. Two resident rattlesnakes set up
housekeeping underneath the feeders, waiting for prey to drop from
the sky. In this desert climate, death seems so much a part of the
landscape that there is no warning for bird enthusiasts. Vivian
said that rattlesnakes had got a bad rap in movies. They're not
likely to attack unless you step or ``accidentally sit on one.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a near-miss the day before, she told us. A guest
triumphantly spotted one of the snakes poking its head languidly
out of its dirt hole. The woman fell to her knees and poked her
finger within inches of the snake's nose. ``Here he is!'' she
shouted. Horrified, Vivian pulled the woman's arm back.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian, who has an infectious joy about her job, ended the tour
at the cottonwood grove with a snack made entirely of ingredients
ancient people would have used _ mesquite flour, corn meal, honey,
prickly pear fruit _ though we doubted they would combine them, as
she had, to make thumb-print cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, I decided to attend a few more horsemanship classes,
mostly to ride better Western style. Until this trip, I had mostly
ridden English. Classes are limited to 12, but on this day, there
was only one other person in class.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangler, Shawn Armstrong, asked us to move around the ring
so he could assess us. My horse picked up a comfortable jog.
</P>
<P>
   Then Shawn had us lope. We both rode to one end of the spacious
ring and took turns, as though we were coming out of a chute. I
felt a little awkward.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn told me to relax. My legs, used to English style, were too
tight on the horse. He lengthened my stirrups until my feet just
barely touched them. Then he told me to loosen the reins.
</P>
<P>
   They were already very loose, but I let them out even more.
``Now go back and do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   We set off, legs loose, reins flying. It felt free, and the
horse responded, running evenly. I turned and did it again.
</P>
<P>
   I was grinning madly. I couldn't wait to get out on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If You Go &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tanque Verde Ranch, &UR;  &LR; at 14301 East Speedway, Tucson, Ariz.
85748, (520) 296-6275, fax (520) 721-9426, has a range of
accommodations, from a small standard room to a suite overlooking
the mountains. (Rates vary by season and room size: singles $200 to
$310; doubles $235 to $380.) Most rooms have fireplaces and
porches.
</P>
<P>
   Prices include unlimited riding, meals, lessons, nature walks
and all activities. At the twice-weekly steak-fry, beer ($2.25 to
$3), wine ($3.50) and mixed drinks ($2.75) are sold at a cash bar.
Otherwise, beer and wine are served on a cash basis at meals.
</P>
<P>
   For guests staying four nights or more, the ranch provides free
transportation from Tucson airport, about half an hour away. We
enjoyed the freedom of having a rental car to go into town for such
odds and ends as picking up the morning paper.
</P>
<P>
   The high season is January through April, when the days are warm
and sunny, the nights cool. During this time, and over
Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter holidays, the ranch does not
guarantee a horse for every rider; horses are assigned first-come,
first-served. While we had plenty of activities in June, the ranch
is more crowded in the high season, and has a more structured
program, adding a tennis pro, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Long-sleeved shirts help protect from sun and mesquite
scratches, and riding boots or sturdy shoes with heels are strongly
recommended. The ranch makes helmets available, though given the
heat on our visit, most riders wore straw cowboy hats.

   WASHINGTON _ Thomas Jefferson's place in American history is
secure, no matter what his sex life was.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me on this. We may be momentarily distracted from his
inspired leadership shaping our democratic principles, but we'll
get back to it eventually.
</P>
<P>
   The public is in a short-term uproar over the scientific finding
that our third president, the revered visionary who drafted the
Declaration of Independence, fathered at least one child with his
slave Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the great Jefferson was made of mortal clay after
all. But that's okay. He still earned his reputation 200 years ago
as a heroic figure to whom we all owe the freedoms we now take for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   The awesome Jefferson monument on Washington's Tidal Basin will
remain, as will his face on Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians are having a tough time with this revelation,
forced to revise their automatic rejection of circumstantial
evidence that long suggested a lengthy affair between the widowed
Jefferson and Hemings, an illegitimate child of his father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Hemings was his late wife Martha's half-sister and may have
resembled her. She was Jefferson's daughter's companion and lived
in his household. At the age of 14, she accompanied his daughter to
France, where he was U.S. minister. She was pregnant when she
returned with the family at 17. She bore seven children at
Monticello, all during periods of Jefferson's presence there.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates of a four-decade Jefferson monkhood clearly did
not know their man. In retrospect it is odd that they were
convinced a genius of such voracious intellectual appetites would
not have physical ones as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some angry conspiracy-minded political commentators
profess to see sinister implications in the timing of the expose,
coming at the onset of impeachment proceedings against President
Clinton over his own illicit affair.
</P>
<P>
   Since the DNA match between descendants of Hemings and
Jefferson's uncle is reported in this week's issue of the British
journal Nature, however, there seems no basis to claim it as all a
liberal pro-Clinton plot. The research has been in the works the
past two years. No matter when the news broke, it would coincide
with some Clinton sex problem.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' concern is that Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky will now be dismissed as normal presidential behavior, not
a rare and impeachable offense. Jefferson, after all, also
dismissed reports about his secret relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Jefferson had no choice because miscegenation was
illegal, even though widely practiced by Southern slave-owners. He
was re-elected in a landslide despite the Hemings rumors of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ellis, a noted Jeffersonian scholar, says, ``The dominant
effect of this news will be to make Clinton's sins seem less
aberrant and more palatable.''
</P>
<P>
   What a stretch. Clinton's place in history is not secure, unlike
Jefferson's. And Clinton is a married man, unlike Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Clinton write the Declaration of Independence, make the
Louisiana purchase, found the University of Virginia or collect a
personal library so exceptional that it became the nucleus of the
Library of Congress. Clinton gets no pass on Jefferson's
200-year-old coattails.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever history is re-examined, however, actions taken in a
long-ago context can be misinterpreted in the light of modern
sensibilities. The early analyses point out that Jefferson owned
600 slaves during his lifetime, held a ``great aversion'' to racial
mixing and could make a scholarly defense of human equality while
ignoring the reality around him.
</P>
<P>
   This is not fair to Jefferson. He, like George Washington and
other plantation owners who kept slaves, was a product of a time
when the Southern agrarian economy was largely dependent on slave
labor. Jefferson also suffered from the typical white male view of
the era that women were intellectually inferior.
</P>
<P>
   In writings collected in ``The Jeffersonian Cyclopedia,'' he
repeatedly agonizes over slavery, despairing that it would never be
abolished in his lifetime but hoping that it would be ended in the
future. And he tried to do what he could about it.
</P>
<P>
   As Virginia's governor in 1778, he pushed through the state
legislature a measure to outlaw the importing of slaves into the
state. ``This stopped the increase of evil ... leaving to future
efforts its final eradication,'' he wrote in his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   In 1784, as chairman of a congressional committee planning the
governance of the new western territories, he pushed for a ban on
slavery in the pioneering states. The measure lost by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The love of justice and the love of country plead equally the
cause of these people (slaves),'' Jefferson wrote in 1814, during
his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But his notions of female intelligence were deplorable, if
commonplace. ``Our good ladies, I trust, have been too wise to
wrinkle their foreheads with politics,'' he wrote to a friend.
``They are contented to soothe and calm the minds of their husbands
returning ruffled from political debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Nobody's perfect, even Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what President John Kennedy said is still true. Toasting
Spanish cellist Pablo Casals at a glamorous White House dinner,
Kennedy joked, ``This is the most brilliant assemblage here since
Thomas Jefferson dined alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was the closest thing to a Renaissance man ever to
occupy the White House, a philosophical and practical genius who
was adept at the violin, architectural design, gardening, the
culinary arts, Greek and Latin, diplomacy and political policy. He
even introduced ice cream to America.
</P>
<P>
   Historians who are having trouble adapting the human Jefferson
to their idealized version may resent the demythification of
important historical figures and events. But history is not static,
any more than life itself.

WILD BLUE YONDER  (JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES    
 c. 1998 Sarasota Herald Tribune    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I read in the paper that the FAA is recommending that pilots not
take Viagra within six hours of flying.
</P>
<P>
   I, personally, was not aware that Viagra abuse was a problem
among airline pilots, but now that I know, it is just another good
reason to take a bus when I take my next scheduled vacation to
Paducah, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Airline travel is stressful enough without having sex-crazed
pilots chasing the flight attendants up and down the aisles,
scaring the babies and possibly upsetting the beverage cart.
</P>
<P>
   I like my airline pilots to be calm and composed, sort of like
astronaut Alan Shepard was when he asked Mission Control for
permission to pee in his space suit.
</P>
<P>
   When the airplane suddenly drops 3,000 feet and we, the
passengers, are plastered to the ceiling along with the peanut
snacks, in-flight magazines and 50 tons of carry-on luggage
everyone crammed beneath their seats, I want the pilot to come on
the intercom, yawn once or twice and then drawl something about
us-all possibly encountering some turbulence though he's fixin' to
fly around it but just to be on the safe side and not agitate those
pencil-necked geeks in Washington, he's going to leave that li'l
old seat belt light on, but it's nothing to worry about, just as
that smoke pouring out of the starboard engine is nothing to worry
about, either. Enjoy your flight.
</P>
<P>
   Thats the kind of pilot I want, not a pilot who comes on the
intercom with ``(Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' blaring in the
background, shouting, ``Hey, everybody! Guess what! I'm flying the
airplane naked!''
</P>
<P>
   I want a pilot whose clothing tastes run to jeans, plaid shirts
and, if possible, suspenders.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want some aging frat boy with a bad toup and several
pounds of gold chains dangling from his neck.
</P>
<P>
   I want a pilot who concentrates on the altimeter, air speed
gauge and all the rest of those little lights and switches up
there, even if he hasn't the faintest idea what they do.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want a pilot who's flipping through Penthouse magazine
while we slam into the side of a mountain at 600 mph.
</P>
<P>
   I want a pilot who worries about crosswinds, airport traffic and
maybe the drunk back in coach who mistook a laptop computer for a
urinal.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want a pilot who's worried about beating Wilt
Chamberlain's record. (And I don't mean points per game.)
</P>
<P>
   If a pilot is gulping fistsful of Viagra when he's supposed to
be going through the preflight checklist, you've got to wonder if
his head is really in the game.
</P>
<P>
   To his clouded way of thinking, an emergency at 35,000 feet is
running out of body oil, not a short in the electrical system.
</P>
<P>
   The other danger, aside from the fact that a naked pilot may get
something caught in the landing gear, is that Viagra users
sometimes have difficulty distinguishing the colors blue and green,
the same colors used in runway lights and cockpit instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Although I am not versed in the finer points of aeronautics, it
occurs to me that the sky is blue and the earth is green and that
these are two things a pilot should never, ever get confused.
</P>
<P>
   While I am not suggesting that a pilot should drink heavily
before taking to the air, even a nervous passenger with four
martinis under his belt can usually distinguish between sky and
ground, assuming he is awake.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, of course, would come if he had swallowed a
couple of Viagras with his gin, which is yet another reason why bus
travel is the way to go.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Blustery winds from the northwest circulating around nearly
stationary low pressure over New Brunswick will deliver very chilly
air to the Northeast on Tuesday. Afternoon temperatures will be far
below seasonal averages. Clouds will be abundant over northern New
England, where mountain flurries and valley sprinkles will occur.
There will be several hours of sunshine near the southern New
England coast.
</P>
<P>
   As the chilly air seeps south of the Mason-Dixon line, low
pressure in the western Carolinas will send a wedge of mild, moist
air northward. As the warm air glides up and over the expanding
dome of cool air, the result will be areas of rain and drizzle over
the middle Atlantic states. The heaviest rain will likely occur
across southern Virginia, where up to one-half inch of rain may
fall. Farther south, patchy thundershowers will precede an
associated cold front traversing the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Moist winds from the east will prevail from the Ohio valley to
the southern Plains states, sponsoring an expansive area of low
clouds with embedded pockets of light rain and drizzle. Over the
western Plains, showers will be greater in number as the east winds
are forced to ascend the sloping terrain. Cold air will change the
rain to snow across western Nebraska. Snow will also fall in the
higher elevations of the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of Pacific air will invade the Northwestern states.
Showers will develop near the coast and press inland. Snow will be
confined to the highest elevation of the northern Cascades.
Meanwhile, sinking air currents will prompt abundant sunshine over
the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Rare Ice Storm
</P>
<P>
   Freezing rain glazed McGrath, Alaska, for much of Sunday night,
an unusually long ice storm for this town nestled in the western
interior of the state. Moreover, by 4 a.m. on Monday, nearly a
third of an inch of rain had been measured, all of it freezing on
contact with the ground and other cold objects. This is an
unusually high total of freezing rain at McGrath, given the town's
great distance from moisture in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.
With regard to both duration and amount of freezing rain, such an
ice storm is expected to occur in McGrath only once in every ten to
twenty years.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is called Pilates, and I had been hearing about it
for some time but dismissed it as a faddish '90s workout. It fit
the mold perfectly: It had the requisite exotic name (pronounced
puh-LAH-tees), you had to go to a gym to do it, and celebrities
hailed it as a miracle workout that managed, with perfect '90s
perversity, to give shapely women the bodies of 12-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
   Pilates, I had heard, involved archaic equipment with names like
``the reformer'' and ``the barrel,'' but that was about all I knew
when I arrived at TriBeCa Bodyworks, a Pilates studio on Duane
Street, determined to see if my bias was well-founded. A model-thin
woman blew by me, a single line of sweat dripping down her radiant
cheek. Great. I hated the place already.
</P>
<P>
   Alycea Baylis-Ungaro, the owner of the studio, had instructed me
to bring loose clothing and to wear socks. No sneakers were
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Showing me to the changing room, she whispered, ``Even men do
Pilates. We get a lot of them.'' It is true. During my workouts at
least one-third were men. Besides, there is, as I soon learned,
nothing feminine about Pilates.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise method was invented by a man, Joseph Pilates, a
boxer and physical therapist from Germany. Obsessed with body
conditioning, he developed the framework for Pilates while serving
as a nurse during World War I. So that patients could exercise in
bed, he redesigned a hospital bed and developed simple exercises.
Modern Pilates apparatus relies on the use of springs to provide
resistance, much like weights, but easier on the body. He opened
the first Pilates Studio in the United States in New York City in
1926.
</P>
<P>
   A workout developed that long ago, when athletes smoked and
tennis players wore long pants? Still, I signed up for three
one-hour Pilates sessions. The first, Alycea said, would just be
introductory. For $65, she would lead me through the fundamental
exercises. Later sessions would get more intense, Alycea promised,
at $55 a session. A bargain! I could not quite believe I was
handing over this much money to exercise. I am a reasonable person.
I live near a park. I own a pair of sneakers. Why not just put them
on and run around the park?
</P>
<P>
   The reason became clearer with each exercise. Alycea took me to
the reformer, a long, low, bedlike apparatus with a flat, padded
carriage that slid back and forth the length of the bed. It made a
dentist's chair look friendly. Alycea had me lie face up on the
carriage, with my knees bent and my feet on a raised steel bar at
the end of the apparatus. I was to straighten my legs as I pulled
in my stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The carriage, which is set on three long springs, was difficult
to slide out, then snapped back against the end of the apparatus
with a loud ``Bang!'' that echoed through the studio. Heads turned.
Alycea did not look pleased. The next time, I was told, do it
smoothly, no banging. And I was told to stop arching my back.
Pilates exercises are designed to protect and strengthen the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more distance you put between your belly button and your
spine, the more pressure you put on your back,'' Alycea said.
</P>
<P>
   By changing the position of my feet on the steel bar and
pushing, I worked different muscle groups in my legs while working
my stomach muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real New York workout because it's really efficient,''
Alycea said. ``You have to use all your muscles at once.'' And you
get it all in a neat and snappy 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   We moved on to more complex movements, my least favorite being
the ``hundreds.'' Lying face up on the reformer, I had to raise my
feet six inches, suck in my stomach, squeeze my buttocks together
and, holding a stirrup set on springs in each hand, keep my arms at
my sides and bounce them up and down, 100 times. With so many
details to focus on, you hardly feel the pain.
</P>
<P>
   I was beginning to understand why Pilates called his workout
contrology. For every exercise that focuses on strengthening
muscle, another stretches the body and encourages balance. And each
movement _ whether a derivative of the sit up with legs jutting in
the air, or lying flat and pulling on leather harnesses attached to
springs _ involves stabilizing the core of the body, the torso and
buttocks, while moving the arms or legs. (This is the part that
appeals to women: The movements are small and repetitions are
short, so you tone muscle without bulking up.)
</P>
<P>
   After about a half hour on the reformer, Alycea introduced me to
``the Cadillac,'' which looked a lot like a gurney with harnesses
and pulleys. After more stomach exercises, including sit ups and
leg lifts, Alycea had me lie on my back and put my feet into the
harnesses. With my feet above my head and my back raised off of the
mat, I was hung like a side of beef. Then, using my stomach
muscles, I had to pull my body down to the mat against the
resistance of the springs, curling my spine, vertebra by vertebra.
It felt as if I was stretching every bone in my back. But there was
no pain. Instead, I felt stress ebbing until it was gone. I could
have done it all day.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the best part. Alycea had me sit up and stretch
to touch my toes while she pushed and rubbed my back. I was
forgetting about the $65.
</P>
<P>
   I left my first session with my stomach muscles dazed and
confused, but I was still troubled that I had not broken a sweat.
But when I arrived for my second session, Alycea reminded me that
the reformer workout did not get longer, it got faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's where the aerobics come in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And did they ever. I was more relaxed with the machines and my
movements became smoother and faster. But when I slowed down, I
heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   At most Pilates gyms, you do individual sessions with a personal
trainer to learn the movements _ there are more than 500 _ until
you get up to pace. After about 30 sessions, you can advance to
what is called a duet _ two people with a trainer _ then to groups
of three and four.
</P>
<P>
   I had never employed a personal trainer, but I found that having
one by my side was surprisingly comforting. I liked having someone
there to coddle me while I suffered through the workout. Besides,
it is far too easy and tempting to cheat with Pilates.
</P>
<P>
   What is extraordinary about Pilates is its broad appeal. Some
professional dancers do it to maintain flexibility and stay fit
without adding excess stress to their bodies. And unlike running or
aerobics, Pilates is good for the elderly, people with injuries,
and even pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do it right up to delivery,'' Alycea said.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, Pilates was a revelation. I had not realized how
tight my muscles had become working in an office, slouching over a
computer keyboard. By the third session, I was a convert. I was
getting the aerobic workout I wanted while regaining some of the
flexibility I had lost.
</P>
<P>
   But if I start to get that 12-year-old boy look, I just may have
to ease off. For a while, anyway.

 CRUISING IRISH WATERS  
 LAYOVER IN HONG KONG  
 WATTS TOWERS  
 
 (af)  
 By PAUL FREIREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Several years ago I read about the charter of boats on rivers
in Ireland. One route went from Dublin west; the other went from
northeast to southwest, near the River Shannon. Can you provide
details? _ Leo J. Jordan, Wanaque, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. The route that runs west of Dublin is the Grand Canal, a
commercial link to Shannon plied for many years by horse-drawn
barges. These days vacationers are found on the route, which runs
basically east-west, as well as on its spurs, which run pretty much
north (as far as Beleek) and south (to St. Mullin).
</P>
<P>
   There are three tiers of prices for boat rentals. In 1998, the
highest rates were in effect from July 4 to Aug. 21 and the lowest
rates from before April 24 and after Sept. 12. The vessels have two
to nine berths. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to navigate the 81 miles of the Grand Canal, which
has 36 locks, a good spot to start is Tullamore, an hour's train
ride from Dublin. Vessels suited for the Grand Canal are top-heavy
and cannot be taken into lakes, but they can, for instance, travel
down the Barrow Navigation, a spur of the canal. On the way, one
can stop at Kilkenny and see Kilkenny Castle, parts of which date
from the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
   The route you mention near the River Shannon is probably the
Shannon-Erne Link. It was reopened in 1994 after more than a
century of disuse, having yielded to the steam train. It runs for
37 miles from Ballyconnell to Leitrim and has 16 locks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on going very far in a single day. On the Grand
Canal, the Barrow Navigation and the Shannon-Erne Waterway, for
example, the speed limit is less than 4 mph. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the 1998 range of rates for a four-berth vessel for a
week, calculated at 66 pence to the dollar. The 1999 rates have not
been set yet. &QL;

   Q. We will be arriving in Hong Kong at 5:55 a.m. on the way to
Hanoi at 5:25 p.m. the same day. Are there ``day rooms'' at the
airport where one may shower and sleep after a long flight? _
Richard G. Topazian, Farmington, Conn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Depending on your stamina and interests, you can catch not
only 40 winks but also a tour of Hong Kong during your half day
there.
</P>
<P>
   All the hotels listed here have a 6 p.m. checkout for day rooms
and all tack on 13 percent for government tax and service charge.
Rates are calculated at $7.80 (Hong Kong) to the United States
dollar. Here, in the order of check-in time, are some
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   6 a.m. The Regal Kowloon, 71 Mody Road, Tsimshatsui East,
Kowloon; (852) 2722-1818, fax (852) 2369-6950. Rate: $51.60.
</P>
<P>
   6 a.m. The Windsor, 39-43A Kimberley Road, Tsimshatsui, Kowloon;
(852) 2739-5665, fax (852) 2311-5101. Rate: $55.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m. The Prince, Hong Kong, Harbour City, Canton Road,
Tsimshatsui, Kowloon; (852) 2113-1888, fax (852) 2113-0066. Rate:
$126. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Noon. Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers, 20 Nathan Road,
Tsimshatsui, Kowloon; (852) 2369-1111, fax (852) 2739-8707. Rate:
$161.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another option may be the Regal Airport Hotel, which expects
to open next month and to charge $78 to $116. Information: (800)
222-8888.
</P>
<P>
   The ride from the airport into town on a train known as the
Airport Express takes 25 minutes. Assuming round trip and same-day
return, the fare is $19 to Hong Kong Station and $17 to Kowloon. A
taxi costs about $45 to the Central district on Hong Kong Island
and $37 to Kowloon. Travel time is about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of a city tour appeals, take the Airport Express to
Kowloon Station, where you can catch the Transit Bus Tour. For
$15.50, you get to and from the airport and also to the Wong Sai
Sin Taoist Temple, Hong Kong's largest temple; the Kowloon Walled
City Park, and the New World Center, a shopping mall in
Tsimshatsui.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't get off _ and you can do so at any stop _ the tour
takes 90 minutes; if you get off, say, at the temple, you should _
given the bus schedule _ allot three hours. The charge includes a
guidebook and a taped commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm interested in seeing Simon Rodia's Watts Towers in Los
Angeles but understand they are only open to group tours. _ Ann
Clothier, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, you don't have to be part of a group to see the
towers, which are now being restored. And actually, they won't
reopen until midyear 2000, according to Virginia Kazor, historic
site curator for the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the towers, which rise as high as 99 feet and
are a National Historic Site, can be seen from the adjoining Watts
Towers Arts Center _ although there is scaffolding at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The towers consist of nine major sculptures of structural steel
and were built between 1921 and 1954 by Simon Rodia, a tile setter
and construction worker who once lived on the site. Embedded in the
sculptures are bits of glass from such sources as 7-Up and milk of
magnesia bottles as well as seashells, rocks, ceramic tile and
pottery.
</P>
<P>
   The art center, which sponsors classes, exhibitions and
lectures, is at 1727 East 107th Street. The hours are Tuesday to
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 4 p.m. For
information, call (213) 847-4646.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best way to get there is to drive, taking the
Wilmington Avenue exit off the Anderson Freeway or the Century
Boulevard exit off the Harbor Freeway. Parking at the center is
free.

ANATOMY OF A DEAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In July, a researcher in the Travel section came up with a
question. Sabena was offering a restricted ticket for a round trip
to Brussels for $904, which qualified as the best price on that
route.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said Sabena also had a package trip, with hotel, for
$830. How can this be, he asked.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good question. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to find out why and how an airline undercuts its
own best fare with a weekend package came up again Oct. 14, when
Sabena sent out word of a Thanksgiving package. This was priced at
$750 a couple _ that is, $375 a person _ for a round trip to
Brussels nonstop from Kennedy Airport in New York, or from Newark,
Boston, Chicago or Atlanta, plus a double room for two nights in
the Brussels Hilton, including breakfasts, hotel service charges,
taxes and United States and Belgian departure fees and taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only 350 of these were offered, the airline said: 50 seats on
each of five flights, one for each city, plus 50 seats on an
additional flight from New York and on one from Atlanta, both
operated by Delta. They were all sold in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the best Sabena fare offer for a restricted
round-trip ticket _ just the ticket _ was $616 a person. With taxes
and fees, this would come to about $672, with variations for the
exchange rate. For two, that would come to $1,364. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are substantial differences. The regular $672
nonrefundable ticket, available for use Nov. 1 to Dec. 10, permits
travel Mondays to Thursdays, requires a seven-day stay and must be
purchased 21 days in advance. Traveler's choice on the weeks and
length of stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Thanksgiving package is locked in: it requires leaving for
Brussels on Thanksgiving night, Nov. 26, and returning Sunday, Nov.
29. No changes or longer stays are possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travac, a New York agency that sells consolidator, or wholesale,
tickets for Sabena, offered a price of $486, taxes included, for a
Monday-Thursday round-trip ticket to Brussels and back to New York.
Last-minute purchase is possible. As usual with consolidator
tickets, this is less than Sabena's own quotation, but still above
the package price. So the question remains: How come? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The central reality of the Thanksgiving fare is that November
and February are the slowest months for travel to Brussels.
``November is too early for Christmas shopping,'' said Nico Zenner,
Sabena's deputy general manager for North and South America. ``In
February the weather is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenner said all airlines serving Europe experienced these
slumps. It is certainly true that Europe fares drop sharply in
November. British Airways has a $288 round trip to London between
Nov. 25 and Dec. 1; Iberia has a $298 fare to anywhere in Spain
valid to Dec. 10. Both of these are bookable as late as 72 hours
ahead; neither price includes taxes of about $50. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for Sabena, Zenner said: ``We could drop the fare, but
everyone competing with us would match it. And we can't compete in
advertising. So we decided two years ago that we needed to add some
values to our fare and get some exposure for Belgium and for us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By exposure, he meant publicity, and in this the line goes over
the top periodically. Lucille Hoshabjian, speaking for Sabena, said
that two years ago an Atlanta radio show rushed the news onto the
air. Listeners called in furious because the package had already
sold out: a travel agent had discovered it in the computer
reservations system before the starting gun.
</P>
<P>
   Another weekend was added. Now, she says, people start calling
in summer to see if the package will be offered again.
</P>
<P>
   While aiming at the two slow months, Zenner said that Brussels
had an added factor in that it was not a weekend city. Business
travel is heavy, he said, but on weekends hoteliers are looking at
vacancies. Tourism officials call this situation ``empty seats,
empty sheets.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Sabena felt it would find receptive ears for plans to bring
in customers for weekends. ``They are basically like us,'' Zenner
said. ``Just as we have to fly the airplane and buy the fuel
whether the seats are empty or not, they've got to keep a hotel
running whether they have guests or not.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Do the hotels provide free rooms in hope guests will at least
buy a meal, rent a video, make a few phone calls, order room
service, buy a souvenir?
</P>
<P>
   Zenner emphasized, ``We do pay something,'' although he said the
line's agreement with the hotels precluded his saying what the
airline pays for its 175 rooms. Well then, he was asked, Does the
airline lose money on the transportation part of the $375-a-person
package?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, he said. ``In the summer, when fares are high, we
get a lot,'' he said. ``In November, not much.'' Referring to an
Airbus 340 carrying 290 passengers, he said: ``We know from
historic patterns that if 150 seats are likely to be empty, we
might as well sell 50 of them in packages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot say we lose money on selling that package.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Thanksgiving package is not being offered
from Cincinnati. The weekend is selling too well there, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving is a clear choice for a promotional fare. ``It's
already a long weekend,'' Zenner said, ``so people don't have to
give up a vacation day to go to Europe, and they get two whole days
on the ground and two nights. In addition, we have a lot of regular
eastbound traffic on Friday _ business people want to get home to
Europe for the weekend.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airlines do not make decisions on super-cheap packages until
they see how regular business is for that weekend. The hotels also
have to assess their space. The specials are supposed to appear in
the travel agents' computer systems at the same time advertisements
appear and notices are sent to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Alert travelers check with the lines and ask travel agents to
keep a lookout for special packages. Sabena is candid about the
small number of seats at the promotional price; the other airlines
are probably offering a similar proportion of their seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Sabena began its Thanksgiving project three years ago, it
got the Belgian government tourist office to underwrite dinners for
the packages. There are no more free dinners, although the tourist
office still helps. The hotels contribute breakfasts; they are not
usually included with the rooms, Zenner said. Transfers to and from
the airport are not included because Brussels has an airport train
that costs $7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back to July: The package in the high season that costs less
than the regular fare is built on the same model, but less extreme.
The $850 package, without taxes, was a Eurostay: a round trip from
several cities with two nights in a hotel, travel permitted Monday
to Thursday, a maximum stay of three months, and other
restrictions. This package is still offered. It cost $599 a person
in the shoulder season and on Nov. 1 went to $369, $425 with
taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sabena is getting its desired exposure for its packages and the
fare is rising. This year's $750-a-couple package was $599 in 1997.
If success continues, the gap may close. And if you don't stay in
the hotel, does Sabena take your return ticket away? No. You can
pay what you like, stay where you like.

LABOR'S VOICE WILL BE HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before the votes are counted in Tuesday's elections, it is
apparent that organized labor's role in many of these contests is
likely to influence the fate of some candidates on either side of
labor's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, a key ballot referendum this past June in
California called Proposition 226, which was sponsored by
conservative Republicans and aimed at weakening labor's political
strengthy by making it virtually impossible for organized labor in
the state to participate in any election.
</P>
<P>
   But because labor was able to explain the referendum and its
true intent to workers across the state, the referendum went down
to a surprising defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the referendum crushed, it helped the Democratic
candidate for governor, Gray Davis, who had labor's support, to
upset his millionaire Democratic opponent in the June primary,
Davis is currently leading in his bid to become California's next
governor. If Davis wins Tuesday, the Democrats will have one of
their own at the state's helm during the presidential election in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Other important labor issues that will be impacted by the
outcome of Tuesday's national elections include the GOP's effort to
do away with overtime after working 40 hours in a week, and the
party's offorts to further erode the powers of the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration. If the GOP wins more seats in
Congress, these anti-labor issues could prevail.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, there's no doubt that organized labor has
played an influential role in the gubernatorial race. The
Democratic candidate, Atty. Gen. Scott Harshbarger, made it clear
early on that he wanted labor's support. He won the endorsement of
the 400,000-member state AFL-CIO and 30 large individual unions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he wins or loses Tuesday, Harshbarger, as well as his
GOP opponent Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci, know that a key reason why
the race has been as close as it has been in the weeks leading up
to this election was largely due to labor's active support of
Harshbarger's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts congressional elections, labor's support
was the key reason that two Democrats defeated two GOP incumbents
in the 1996 election. Tuesday, these two Democrats -- John Tierney
(6th District) and James McGovern (3rd District) --are currently
leading their GOP opponents largely because of labor's support.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a test of labor's strength in these elections can be
measured by the response from candidates on the other side of
labor's support. For example, the national GOP campaign committee
last week released a political ad which suggested that Tierney
voted with the ``corrupt'' Teamsters ``union bosses,'' on the
government financing of the Teamsters election.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, what Tierney voted for was what both Democrats and
Republicans supported when the government paid for the Teamsters
elections two years ago. In essence, it appears to be a last-minute
desparate GOP strategy that is so misleading that all but one local
television station has refused to run this ad.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the carelessness of this GOP ad is apparent since the
overall attack on the Teamsters includes &UR;  &LR; by inference a local that
backs the GOP gubernatorial candidate, Paul Cellucci. Another
Teamster local which was credited with exposing the campaign
violations in last year's Teamsters elections is supporting
Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Also in this year's Democratic primaries, more labor-endorsed
candidates won than lost, including Lt. Gov. candidate Warren
Tolman, Norfolk District Attorney candidate William Keating, and
several state senatorial and state representative races across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kathy Casavant, Massachusetts AFL-CIO
Secretary-Treasurer, the first woman to hold this labor post, said
it best: ``Without labor's presence in the election process, it is
hard to say whether the candidates would have paid as close
attention to important issues such as education and health care and
economic security that affects the three million folks who work and
live in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, after Tuesday's votes are tallied, there will be
political anaylsts who will give their perspective on whether labor
won or lost overall in this election.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike candidates who may not have fared well and decide to
disappear from the political arena, organized labor, as they have
already vowed, will be back at work on Wednesday, looking toward
the next election.

SUPREME COURT TO EXAMINE PART OF ESPY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to consider
reinstating the conviction of Sun-Diamond Growers of California on
charges the cooperative of nut and fruit growers gave $5,900 in
illegal gifts to former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it would hear independent counsel Donald C.
Smaltz's argument that the cooperative could be convicted even
without proof the gifts were intended to influence Espy's official
acts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Pleasanton-based company was convicted of giving
illegal gifts to Espy, including tickets to the 1993 U.S. Open
tennis tournament, luggage and a crystal bowl. The cooperative was
fined $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, the court told jurors that prosecutors did not
have to prove that the gifts led Espy to grant the cooperative
favors. Instead, the jurors were told they could convict
Sun-Diamond if the company gave things of value to Espy merely to
``keep him happy,'' even if the company did not intend the gifts to
relate in any way to an official act.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled the jury wrongly convicted Sun-Diamond,
saying that prosecutors did need to prove that the gifts were
intended to influence Espy's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz is asking the Supreme Court to overturn that decision and
rule that prosecutors are not required to prove that Espy did
anything in return for the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Monday, Espy began the second month of his trial on 38
corruption charges. Espy, a former Mississippi congressman who
headed the Agriculture Department from January 1993 until December
1994, is accused of accepting gifts from people and businesses he
was supposed to be regulating as agriculture secretary and then
attempting to cover up his actions when authorities began an
investigation. Those businesses included Sun-Diamond and Tyson Food
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Espy has pleaded innocent to all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law permits a public official to receive gifts out of
friendship and goodwill, so long as they aren't meant as a reward
for past or future acts.
</P>
<P>
   Espy's federal corruption case is the culmination of Smaltz's
four-year, $17.4 million investigation of the secretary and
companies, lobbyists, friends and family associated with Espy's
tenure as agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Douglas, a former vice president of Sun-Diamond, spent a
fourth day on the witness stand Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew I worked for Sun-Diamond,'' Douglas said of his old
friend Espy. But Espy still wanted Douglas' advice as he moved into
the top Agriculture Department job, and did not seem bothered by
the possibility their relationship could seem inappropriate,
Douglas testified.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said he promised his friend he wouldn't put him in an
ethically awkward position by lobbying him on issues of specific
interest to Sun-Diamond, but the two did talk about more general
issues affecting Sun-Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not give any favoritism to Sun-Diamond,'' Douglas
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Douglas testified that Espy asked him to lie to the
FBI as the investigation began in 1994. It was the most direct
allegation of wrongdoing since testimony began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas, who admitted to a variety of crimes under
questioning by Smaltz, also said prosecutors badgered him into
cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a possibility of four separate trials, nearly 60 years in
prison and with legal bills of about $100,000, Douglas pleaded
guilty in a related case and became Smaltz's ``puppet,'' he said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they wanted Mike, and by giving them Mike I could get
off the hook,'' Douglas testified.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Espy's former chief of staff, Ronald H.
Blackley, was sentenced to a 27-month prison term for lying about
$22,000 he received from two Mississippi individuals who obtained
large government farming subsidies.

N.H. NEWSPAPERS SWAP BLOWS OVER CANDIDATE'S LINK TO GAY CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p, a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just one week before Election Day, The (Manchester) Union Leader
dropped a bombshell _ or what some would call a stink bomb _ into
the middle of a hard-fought New Hampshire state Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing its reputation as the Granite State's bastion of
conservatism, the Oct. 27 Union Leader ran a story linking
Democratic candidate Rick Trombly to a gay club that holds monthly
``leather nights.'' A day later, a Union Leader editorial claimed
Trombly's sexual identity wasn't the relevant issue. But it implied
that he did not have the ``sound moral and family values'' for
public office and emphasized the point by sprinkling in such
phrases as ``rubber orgy'' and ``quaint homosexual fetishes.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether The Union Leader will influence today's
state Senate voting. But in outing Trombly _ a respected former
House Democratic leader challenging a Republican incumbent _ it has
brought accusations of an ideological smear, resurrected the
chronic journalistic dilemma about the relevance of a public
figure's private life, and triggered a newspaper war between The
Union Leader and the Concord Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bilious spirit of (the late &UR;  &LR; publisher) William Loeb still
haunts the newsroom of The Union Leader,'' declared an indignant
Oct. 29 Monitor editorial. ``The paper's scurvy attack on Senate
candidate Rick Trombly was a reminder of its bad old days _ and
fresh cause for shame, not satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after The Union Leader story, Trombly
asked voters to ``reject gutter politics.'' In some quarters, the
episode seemed to exemplify The Union Leader's take-no-prisoners
approach to politics. With Democratic governor Jeanne Shaheen
favored to win reelection, there is speculation that Democrats
could make inroads into the GOP's 15-9 edge in the state Senate.
Trombly is widely viewed as having launched a serious challenge to
Republican Amy Patenaude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had done polling to show this as a winnable race,'' says a
Democratic Party spokesman, Jon Paone. ``There's no level The Union
Leader will not sink to to push its political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they ... try to throw their weight around in the
political arena,'' says Clark Hubbard, a University of New
Hampshire political science professor, noting that demographic
changes are moderating the state's conservative politics and
reducing the ranks of ``Union &UR;  &LR; Leader stalwarts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think if this was a candidate who shared The
Union Leader's political philosphy, they would not have done
this,'' says Concord Monitor editor Mike Pride.
</P>
<P>
   Union Leader editor Joseph McQuade rejects charges that his
paper dredged up dirt on Trombly to bury a political foe. ``In the
immortal words of Dave Puddy from `Seinfeld,''' he says, ```That's
bogus, man.''' The Union Leader's Oct. 27 story was generated when
the paper discovered Trombly's home phone number on the gay club's
Web site and found a source who said Trombly is the group's
president, before later recanting. Trombly told the paper that he
is a lawyer for the club, but not a member. And he said his sexual
identity is not relevant to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found in the public interest the nature of this club and
the nature of Mr. Trombly's relationship to it,'' says McQuade.
``The guy is running for fairly high public office in the state of
New Hampshire. ... I'd feel the same if this was swinging singles
of the heterosexual variety.''
</P>
<P>
   While declining to criticize The Union Leader, New Hampshire
Republican Party chairman Steve Duprey calls Trombly a friend and
says ``his sexuality isn't an issue. ... Absent some clear and
compelling connection (with his public duties), someone's private
life should be just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the state's media has kept The Union Leader's story at
arm's length. According to the Associated Press bureau chief for
northern New England, Larry Laughlin, the wire service initially
picked up the story because ``it couldn't be ignored.'' But it has
run nothing in recent days ``in view of the fact that it was a
highly inflammatory story that was coming out shortly before an
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The (Nashua, N.H.) Telegraph briefly mentioned the controversy
in a political column Nov. 1. But editor George Geers says the
Trombly race is not in the paper's circulation area and ``there was
a sense it was a cheap shot by The Union Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to us to be a questionable story,'' adds Thomas
Kearney, executive editor of The Keene (N.H.) Sentinel. ``It's just
another example of the chute news organizations have been sliding
down for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than The Union Leader, the one outlet to hop on the
controversy was the considerably more liberal Monitor. On Oct. 28,
it reacted to The Union Leader's story with a piece highlighting
Trombly's accusations of ``gutter politics.'' It ran a story
explaining why the Monitor, which had also received a tip about
Trombly and the Minotaurs, declined to pursue that lead. And in
addition to its scathing anti-Union Leader editorial, the Monitor
published two Sunday columns critical of its rival's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   One, authored by Pride, said The Union Leader had ``crossed the
line into character assassination in its effort to defeat Rick
Trombly.'' When asked why it had given so much ink to a story it
found so vile, Pride replied that ``once a story is out there, no
matter what the source, you're better off writing as thoughtfully
and comprehensively as you can about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some observers think the rivalry between The Union Leader
and the Monitor helped fan the flames of a story that the has not
drawn much public interest. Telegraph editor Geers says the ``two
newspapers created a news event that surpasses what the event was
about.'' Adds Duprey: ``In most of these cat fights, whether you
get 'em between candidates or newspapers, no one comes out smelling
like a rose.''

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER CLINTON VIOLATED AIR FORCE MAJOR'S
RIGHT AGAINST DOUBLE JEOPARDY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide if the
constitutional rights of an Air Force major infected with the AIDS
virus were violated when President Clinton tried to drum him out of
the military following his court-martial in Texas for having
unprotected sex in violation of orders from a superior officer.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also will hear Houston-based Compaq Computer
Corp.'s defense of a court's order that a patent be awarded to the
company, despite the federal government's objection. In addition,
the high court will decide whether an agricultural cooperative
violated federal anti-bribery law when it gave then-Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy tickets to sporting events, treated him to
meals and bought him gifts.
</P>
<P>
   In the military case, James T. Goldsmith argues that Clinton
violated the major's constitutional right against ``double
jeopardy,'' being punished twice for the same offense, when the
president tried to discharge him for the same acts that led a
military court at Lackland Air Force Base to imprison him and
withhold his pay. Goldsmith also says Clinton has no constitutional
authority to throw him out of the military because the law
permitting presidential discharge took effect after his
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, appealing a lower court decision in
Goldsmith's favor, tells the high court that the constitutional
prohibition on double jeopardy does not apply because a military
discharge is not a second punishment but an administrative action.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth Waxman, the president's chief lawyer
before the justices, added that a military discharge is not a
criminal proceeding. Therefore, the constitutional prohibition on
using new criminal laws to punish old acts does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   After Goldsmith was diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, his superior officer ordered him to inform sexual partners of
his illness and to use condoms during intercourse to prevent
spreading the disease. However, Goldsmith later had unprotected sex
with two women without telling them he was HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   He was court-martialed and sentenced on March 4, 1994, for
willfully disobeying his superior officer's order and for two
counts of assault with a means likely to produce death or grievous
bodily harm. Goldsmith was sentenced to six years in the U.S.
Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and $2,500 was
ordered to be withheld from his pay each month for the six years.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law enacted Feb. 10, 1996, enables the president to
discharge military officers who have been court-martialed and
sentenced to more than six months in prison. When Clinton moved to
discharge him in December 1996, Goldsmith appealed to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruled the president's effort to discharge
Goldsmith was an unconstitutional second punishment for the same
offenses. The court also ruled that Clinton was barred from
removing Goldsmith from the military based on the 1996 law because
it was enacted after the major had committed his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Compaq case, the company urges the justices to uphold the
U.S. Court for the Federal Circuit's decision ordering the
government to issue a patent for a high-tech method of improving
security in computer systems. The U.S. government argues that the
court violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to defer
to the U.S. Patent Office's expertise in determining what
inventions are worthy of patents.
</P>
<P>
   The bribery case involves independent counsel Donald Smaltz's
effort to reinstate the graft conviction of Sun-Diamond Growers of
California, which the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.,
found had illegally treated Espy to 1993 U.S. Open Tennis
Tournament tickets, $2,427 worth of luggage, $665 in meals and $524
for a framed print and a crystal bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
overturned the conviction, ruling that the anti-bribery law
requires that gifts be given to a government official not merely
because of his position but because of a specific act he has or
will perform as a result of receiving the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has not decided when it will hear the cases.
The justices are expected to render their decisions by July. &QL;

ARTISTS GET RUSH ORDER FOR 8 NEW REMBRANDTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIREMY, France _ The preferred way of filming the lives of great
painters, it seems, is to focus on their lives and ignore their
paintings. This at least may explain why movie directors keep
returning to van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Modigliani and Rembrandt
and avoiding the more prosaic careers of, say, Monet, Mondrian and
Magritte. Alcoholism, madness and tragedy are evidently easier to
portray on screen than mere genius.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another good reason for them to favor life over
art. Museums and private collectors are unwilling to lend classic
masterpieces to film productions. And with 20th-century paintings,
to which copyright rules still apply, estates frequently prohibit
the use of even reproductions or copies, as was the case with
Merchant-Ivory's ``Surviving Picasso'' and John Maybury's ``Love Is
the Devil,'' his new bio-pic about Francis Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   It is in hope of breaking this pattern, then, that Charles
Matton has chosen a novel approach in ``Rembrandt van Rijn,'' the
new French-language movie that he has just begun shooting in the
Warner Brothers Studios at Bottrop in Germany for release next
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to give the 17th-century Dutch master's paintings a
central role in his film, Matton commissioned two French artists,
Serge Clement and Marina Kamena, to paint no fewer than eight
Rembrandts.
</P>
<P>
   Matton, 66, himself better known in France as a painter and
sculptor than as a director, had an additional brainstorm. He
wanted Rembrandt's portraits (and two self-portraits) to be copied
but with the faces altered to resemble those of his actors: Klaus
Maria Brandauer as Rembrandt; Johanna Tersteege as the artist's
wife, Saskia; Romane Bohringer as his maid cum mistress Hendrickje
Stoffels; Jean Rochefort as Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, who presides over
``The Anatomy Lesson,'' and Marie-Claude Mestral as Anna Wijmer,
mother of Amsterdam's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Matton did not want the portraits to look so much like
his actors that they lost the aura of the originals. ``I wanted
them halfway between Rembrandt and the actors,'' he explained.
``But I wanted to retain the mood of Rembrandt. This is possible
because in portraiture, everything that emphasizes resemblance
undermines the quality of the portrait. Even Rembrandt's
self-portraits are not identical.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, with most of these ersatz Rembrandts in hand, the
director can show the canvas while Brandauer's Rembrandt pretends
to be painting his subjects (with transparent varnish). Matton, who
wrote the screenplay with his wife, Sylvie, can also let the camera
dwell on the copied portraits since they, too, have the texture and
reflective light of real oils.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Clement, 65, and his wife, Ms. Kamena, 53, the
challenge of copying, and changing, Rembrandt has proven humbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of being given a magisterial lesson in
painting,'' Clement explained in an interview in his studio in this
tiny village, 60 miles south of Paris. ``Rembrandt was really the
first to make the most of painting in oil. He could paint ugly
things and make them beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The two artists faced a further problem that did not worry
Rembrandt: They were expected to complete eight paintings, and show
four others at an early stage, in just two months. So there was no
question of starting from scratch; their priority was to introduce
a subtle though clear resemblance to the movie's actors. They
decided to work on life-size color photographs of the eight
paintings glued to canvas. But they also had to develop their own
special techniques for this bizarre adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in each case was to cover the original face with
gesso, thus acquiring a base on which to paint. Then, using thin
oil paint and acrylic, they copied the face of the actor from a
photograph taken in the correct pose. At this point, the
resemblance was total. Next, having covered this image with a
transparent gel, they put aside the photograph of the actor and
turned instead to a photograph of the original painting, working in
thick oil to create a hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they applied a glazing to capture Rembrandt's
luminosity. The paint used at the final stages was similar to that
available to Rembrandt.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, they had to treat other areas of the painting to
cover evidence of the photograph. In some cases, they also
recovered important details of the paintings that were somehow lost
in the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Dr. Tulp, you can't see his feet,'' said Ms. Kamena,
whose assignments included ``The Anatomy Lesson.'' ``So we had to
repaint them in the same way: an isolating layer of varnish, a
transparent texture and then oil.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Night Watch,'' which is too large to transport and
will be painted in the movie studio in Germany, Clement must take
account of the fact that Rembrandt added Saskia to the
near-complete painting after he discovered she was dying. Since
Matton wants to show this before and after, Clement will first
paint Saskia, or Ms. Tersteege, then cover her with varnish and add
the legs and uniform of one of the night watchmen in gouache, all
to be washed off for the later scene.
</P>
<P>
   Clement also had something of a revelation when he added Ms.
Bohringer to Rembrandt's 1654 painting of Hendrickje Stoffels as
``Bathsheba Holding King David's Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rembrandt cheated,'' he said with a laugh. ``No, I don't like
that word. Rembrandt was a rearranger. When I asked Romane
Bohringer to bow her head and keep her shoulders in Hendrickje's
position, she couldn't. Rembrandt turned her face forward but not
her shoulders. He was looking for effect, not accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Matton further wanted Clement to emphasize Hendrickje's
pregnancy, which he did by increasing the swell of her stomach and
making her breasts rounder. ``Romane's hair ends sharply on her
forehead,'' Clement said. ``That had to go. She is also a brunette
and we made her blonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kamena explained: ``These are not Rembrandts, not even false
Rembrandts. They're simply illusions because cinema is illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   On one point, though, Matton is eager to keep things real: He
will not show Brandauer's Rembrandt painting a portrait from start
to finish. ``We know the results of Rembrandt's work, but we do not
know how he painted,'' he said. ``We don't know if he worked from
sketches, if he started on the top or the bottom, on the left or
the right, with the background or the foreground. So we have to be
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   As a painter, Matton has also had no hesitation in discouraging
Brandauer from overacting his role before the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that a painter is like the conductor of an
orchestra, using big, sweeping, romantic, impulsive gestures,'' he
noted. ``He is not. Painting is above all contemplative. The
violence on the canvas is cerebral, not physical.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, painters will have the last word in this $12
million movie in more ways than one. ``Charles Matton says that the
makeup people should copy what we have done in the portraits,''
Clement said with undisguised satisfaction. ``So it goes full
circle. We make the paintings look like the actors, then the actors
are made to look like the paintings. Ah, the games of illusion.''

<P>
   There were other issues, such as agriculture. Truman, a former
farmer, needed little prompting. In Dexter, Iowa, that September,
Truman told farmers that the Republicans had ``stuck a pitchfork in
the farmer's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman had hit his stride. On Oct. 30, when he delivered an
especially emotional speech in St. Louis, he set his prepared text
aside.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late, many correspondents believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 16 years of Democratic rule of the White House, the
voters want a change,'' Duke Shoop, a Star and Times Washington
correspondent, wrote on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Elmo Roper, meanwhile, had stopped making surveys in
September. (break here)President confident (begin text here)At dawn
on Nov. 3, 1948, Truman arrived at the Hotel Muehlebach, his Kansas
City, Mo., campaign headquarters, knowing he had won.
</P>
<P>
   His escape to the Elms, however mysterious, did have precedent.
Sixteen years earlier, disappointed that he had not been Boss Tom
Pendergast's choice for governor, Truman also had booked a room at
the resort.
</P>
<P>
   First to shake his hand at the Muehlebach was Kansas City lawyer
Lyman Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was utterly unchanged,'' said Field.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's serenity in the face of apparent defeat had impressed
many. Elsey's own glimpse of it occurred in mid-October, as the
Truman train crossed Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president asked me to write down a list of the states,''
Elsey said. ``He knew the number of electoral votes that went with
each, and he predicted how each state would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were through he said, `What's the total?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You've got 340.' Actually, he was overconfident,
because he only got 303. But he was absolutely convinced he was
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the civil rights issue, Truman carried all 13 of the
country's biggest cities. He also won five farm states that
Franklin Roosevelt had lost in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's upset was stunning in part because polls had convinced
many people that he had no chance. Publications like the Chicago
Tribune, which published an early election edition bearing the
headline ``Dewey Defeats Truman,'' depended upon old advance polls
instead of the exit polls that are common today, said Frank
Mitchell, a University of Southern California historian.
</P>
<P>
   But another factor contributing to the general amazement,
Mitchell said, was ``a campaign of deliberate bias on the part of
the news media.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially brazen, Mitchell said recently from Santa Monica,
Calif., was the Time-Life-Fortune empire of Henry Luce.
</P>
<P>
   The ``acres of empty seats'' that Life had described in Omaha,
for instance, didn't explain how about 160,000 city residents had
seen Truman during a parade earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   And since Time magazine carried such clout with the Washington
press corps, many correspondents discounted the large crowds Truman
continued to attract, Mitchell added.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Kelly can vouch for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them told me, `They like him, but they are not going to
vote for him,' '' said Kelly. ``Just the blindness of the press was
interesting. They didn't see what was going on right in front of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman was handed the ``Dewey Defeats Truman'' edition of the
Chicago Tribune during a train stop in St. Louis two days after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   He held up the newspaper for photographers, and smiled. (break
here)Country rebounded (begin text here)In retrospect, the election
should not have surprised anyone, argues Herb Parmet, author of a
recent George Bush biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy had been restored by 1948,'' said Parmet of
Hillsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truman also had the support of people early in the Cold War in
how he responded promptly to the Berlin blockade. All things being
equal, you've got a president who had the country back in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the glory of 1948 was ephemeral.''
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War, plus Truman's break with Gen. Douglas MacArthur,
later diminished the president's status. Truman didn't run for
re-election in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Truman's 1948 campaign has left its legacy. The term
``whistlestop'' has entered the language as the definition of a
hard-hitting grass-roots campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republican nominee Bush invoked Truman in 1988 when he was 17
points behind Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, Parmet said. Bush
won.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Bush invoked Truman again. But Democratic
challenger Bill Clinton praised him, too. Bush, it soon was
learned, had not voted for Truman in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what's so screwy,'' political comedian Mark Russell later
sang, ``he voted for Dewey.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1948 election ultimately emphasized the importance of
voting. Days after the election, Kelly spoke at Boston University,
where he had taken a job as a journalism professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people came up to me and said, `I voted for Truman but I
didn't think anybody else did,' &UR; '' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was substituting that day for pollster Elmo Roper, who was
to have delivered a speech titled ``Why Dewey Won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently he had gotten ill,'' Kelly said. (30)

LABOR'S VOICE WILL BE HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before the votes are counted in Tuesday's elections, it is
apparent that organized labor's role in many of these contests is
likely to influence the fate of some candidates on either side of
labor's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, a key ballot referendum this past June in
California called Proposition 226, which was sponsored by
conservative Republicans and aimed at weakening labor's political
strengthy by making it virtually impossible for organized labor in
the state to participate in any election.
</P>
<P>
   But because labor was able to explain the referendum and its
true intent to workers across the state, the referendum went down
to a surprising defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the referendum crushed, it helped the Democratic
candidate for governor, Gray Davis, who had labor's support, to
upset his millionaire Democratic opponent in the June primary,
Davis is currently leading in his bid to become California's next
governor. If Davis wins Tuesday, the Democrats will have one of
their own at the state's helm during the presidential election in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Other important labor issues that will be impacted by the
outcome of Tuesday's national elections include the GOP's effort to
do away with overtime after working 40 hours in a week, and the
party's offorts to further erode the powers of the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration. If the GOP wins more seats in
Congress, these anti-labor issues could prevail.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, there's no doubt that organized labor has
played an influential role in the gubernatorial race. The
Democratic candidate, Atty. Gen. Scott Harshbarger, made it clear
early on that he wanted labor's support. He won the endorsement of
the 400,000-member state AFL-CIO and 30 large individual unions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he wins or loses Tuesday, Harshbarger, as well as his
GOP opponent Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci, know that a key reason why
the race has been as close as it has been in the weeks leading up
to this election was largely due to labor's active support of
Harshbarger's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts congressional elections, labor's support
was the key reason that two Democrats defeated two GOP incumbents
in the 1996 election. Tuesday, these two Democrats -- John Tierney
(6th District) and James McGovern (3rd District) --are currently
leading their GOP opponents largely because of labor's support.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a test of labor's strength in these elections can be
measured by the response from candidates on the other side of
labor's support. For example, the national GOP campaign committee
last week released a political ad which suggested that Tierney
voted with the ``corrupt'' Teamsters ``union bosses,'' on the
government financing of the Teamsters election.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, what Tierney voted for was what both Democrats and
Republicans supported when the government paid for the Teamsters
elections two years ago. In essence, it appears to be a last-minute
desparate GOP strategy that is so misleading that all but one local
television station has refused to run this ad.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the carelessness of this GOP ad is apparent since the
overall attack on the Teamsters includes &UR;  &LR; by inference a local that
backs the GOP gubernatorial candidate, Paul Cellucci. Another
Teamster local which was credited with exposing the campaign
violations in last year's Teamsters elections is supporting
Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Also in this year's Democratic primaries, more labor-endorsed
candidates won than lost, including Lt. Gov. candidate Warren
Tolman, Norfolk District Attorney candidate William Keating, and
several state senatorial and state representative races across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kathy Casavant, Massachusetts AFL-CIO
Secretary-Treasurer, the first woman to hold this labor post, said
it best: ``Without labor's presence in the election process, it is
hard to say whether the candidates would have paid as close
attention to important issues such as education and health care and
economic security that affects the three million folks who work and
live in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, after Tuesday's votes are tallied, there will be
political anaylsts who will give their perspective on whether labor
won or lost overall in this election.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike candidates who may not have fared well and decide to
disappear from the political arena, organized labor, as they have
already vowed, will be back at work on Wednesday, looking toward
the next election.

PINOCHET'S FATE ATTRACTS SPECIAL INTEREST AMONG SOME KC AREA
RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, MO.) _ ... (break here)`War for survival' (begin
text here)After Pinochet took power, Cruz continued distributing
opposition pamphlets, with help from the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning on his way to work, Cruz saw how Santiago had
changed. Bodies were piled on the streets, riddled with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz believes soldiers left them to intimidate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep never came easily. The rustle of leaves on the sidewalk,
car doors slamming, reminded Cruz that the secret police could take
him away at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 4, 1974, Cruz and his wife, Alicia, awoke after midnight
to the sound of doors flying open. In the shadows, Cruz saw a dozen
soldiers pointing rifles at his head.
</P>
<P>
   They bound him with wire, threw him into the back of a truck and
covered him with straw. His captors drove him to a prison a few
blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was over,'' Cruz recalled. ``I thought that I
didn't deserve death but if they thought I did, then I'd have to
accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times each day, guards demanded information about Cruz's
colleagues. He refused each time, prompting them to shake his body
with electricity or pummel his head.
</P>
<P>
   At least four agencies shared in the torturing. The way Cruz
remembers it, they had a rivalry to see who was the bloodiest.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, he survived. At one point, he was thrown into a cell
with a veterinarian. Cruz's head was one big wound. The skin on the
veterinarian's wrists had been nearly scraped away. The vet advised
that they urinate on each other's wounds _ the only way to
sterilize them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day was our own little war for survival,'' Cruz said.
``We thought that if we could survive the torture, that meant we
were winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was transferred to the Puchuncavi concentration camp. He
was released and made his way to Kansas City in April 1977 with
help from the same agency that brought Ramirez over.
</P>
<P>
   The memories from the camp remain vivid.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, a Spanish priest was held in a nearby cell. For
three days, the man was beaten after refusing to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak because it is against my beliefs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, he repeated the reply.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Cruz learned that the priest had promised his colleagues
he would hold out for at least three days. That way, they'd have
time to move to safety. On the fourth day, the priest spoke. Two
hours later, he died.
</P>
<P>
   His phrase still echoes in Cruz's mind:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak because it is against my beliefs.'' (break
here)`We should never forget' (begin text here)Luis Ramirez was
waiting at Kansas City's airport when Cruz's family arrived. Jewish
Family &AMP; Children Services, a Kansas City agency, had sponsored
both families.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz couldn't remember Ramirez's name, but he hadn't forgotten
his face from Puchuncavi. Ramirez was standing in the terminal with
a small Chilean flag and a sign that read, in Spanish: ``Welcome to
Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant a lot to me to see him there,'' Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   Life has changed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, 61, and Ramirez, 52, live in comfortable homes just miles
apart. They don't shudder when a car drives by anymore. A knock on
the door means welcoming a friend, not fearing an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   But their experiences have taken their toll. Because of the
torture, Silvia Ramirez cannot have children. Both families left
relatives behind.
</P>
<P>
   They look on sadly as Chile wrestles with Pinochet's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Pinochet supporters say bringing the general to justice
will only cause instability. His following remains strong and many
credit Pinochet with fighting communism and strengthening the
economy. The Chilean government has resisted Pinochet's extradition
and trial. Chilean natives in Kansas City have not reached a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez says he understands why some want to forget the past so
the nation can heal. But he cannot agree, especially when he sees
history repeating itself in Bosnia and other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can forget that I was tortured. I can forget that there were
nights when I would lie awake, not knowing if I was going to
live,'' Ramirez said. ``I can forget that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But somebody is responsible for that. This isn't a Chilean
problem, it's a problem for humanity,'' he said. ``If they permit
butchers like this to be free, then there is a possibility that
this will continue to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that we need to forget,'' he added, ``but there are
some things that we should never forget.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I changed careers and will soon graduate
from a technical school. On my resume, the career counselor said to
emphasize my recent training, list only a few of my previous jobs
in general terms, and write a statement saying that I am energetic,
a team player and so forth. She said the details can be provided
when I fill out an application blank. How does this sound to you?
B.L. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It sounds like the career counselor is missing a few
details. By definition, a resume provides a summary of your work
experience, not just an overview of recent education, a few
selected jobs and a self-serving statement that could easily be
interpreted as wishful thinking. Besides, a well-written chronology
of your previous jobs and responsibilities is a far more credible
indicator of your energy and team orientation.
</P>
<P>
   When employers see vague resumes, the typical interpretation is
that important information is being intentionally withheld. The
typical result is that the resume ends up in the ``thanks, but no
thanks'' pile. So much for that opportunity to fill in the details
on the application blank.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to keep in mind that a resume is a sales tool
that should entice the reader to get in touch with you. A clear,
thorough and professional-looking resume can do just that. You are
making a productive career change, and this is no time to be
shortchanged by a counterproductive resume.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a teacher at a small, nonprofit school. The director
hired her daughter five years ago and treats her with great
favoritism. Some very good teachers have been fired or not hired
back because the daughter has a problem getting along with them.
What can those of us who have walked on eggs around this daughter
do to change this situation? The board of the school has many
parents who see the problem and want to fix it. M.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: If the board members are aware of a serious problem but have
taken no action to deal with it, then they are a serious problem,
too. Either they do not know or do not want to know what is going
on, or they are aware of what is happening and either cannot or
will not do anything about it. In any of these cases, the board is
acting in the role of follower rather than leader. And by doing so,
they are condoning the questionable practices that are forcing so
many people to walk on eggs.
</P>
<P>
   To attempt to unscramble this mess, you and your fellow teachers
as a group should meet initially with the favored daughter and, if
necessary, with the director to discuss the situation and see if
there is a basis to resolve it among yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   If you are still forced to do the egg-walk, you and your
colleagues should meet with the board. Give it specific examples of
the practices that are undermining the school's mission and
objectives, along with some suggestions to correct the matter. If
nothing changes after you have spoken to the board, then accept the
fact that the board has spoken. It is up to you to decide what to
do with what you have heard.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I did an excellent job on a project and I expected some
appreciation from my manager. When I met with him afterward, all he
did was complain about minor matters that had nothing to do with
the project. This was upsetting, but I didn't say anything at the
time. Now I want to discuss it. How should I do it? J.E.
</P>
<P>
   A: While the issue of how to do this is important, the issue of
when to do it is even more important. The best time to have this
type of discussion is as close to the incident as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, since the incident is still bothering you, there
are some key pointers to remember. First, it is easy to make the
mistake of directly telling your manager that you would have
appreciated some thanks for your excellent work. This type of
approach can easily elicit a degrading comment about your being
overly needy or a few hollow words of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   A better strategy is to meet with him and ask for some feedback
on your project. If you did an excellent job, this is a way to get
some meaningful thanks without having to beg. And if your manager
felt that your work was not so excellent, this approach allows him
to give you some guidance to improve your performance in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it is best to approach him with questions rather
than answers. By doing so, you are more likely to generate
solutions rather than problems.

   The year 2000 will draw almost half a million visitors to the
small Bavarian village of Oberammergau for the Passion Play, which
will be performed from May to October. Every 10 years, the
production, which begins with Christ's arrival in Jerusalem and
ends with the Resurrection and Transfiguration, is held outdoors in
the Alpine village. This production faithfully follows a tradition
of more than 350 years, though the play itself has been revised in
recent years to eliminate anti-Semitic stereotypes. In 1633, the
town elders vowed to perform the Passion if God spared the village
from a plague.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, choir and orchestra will be made up of more than 2,000
of the village's 5,200 residents. The costumes, set design and
organization are also exclusively in the hands of residents who
have either been born in Oberammergau or have lived there at least
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The play takes place in the outdoor village theater, which has
sheltered seating for about 4,700 people. Although the stage is
uncovered, performances are not postponed for rain. Each
performance is scheduled to start between 9 and 9:30 a.m. and end
at approximately 5:30 p.m., with a three-hour lunch break. Tickets
are $65 and $97; $211 and $340 with one night's stay; $262 and $482
for two nights (including a booking fee). Pre-booked tickets are
expected to be sold out by early 1999.

   Coming to a Hotel Near You: Golden Door
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, the Golden Door Spa started toning the bodies
of affluent women in Southern California and went on to become a
top name in luxury health and fitness. Now, the spa is doing the
stretching. It was recently acquired by Grand Bay Hotels and
Resorts _ operated by Patriot American Hospitality _ which plans to
open a Golden Door Spa for both men and women in each of its
resorts and hotels. It starts with Las Casitas Village in Puerto
Rico on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Bay expects to open another Golden Door this winter in the
new Grand Bay Hotel, Toronto. Grand Bay is also planning hotels
with Golden Doors in Philadelphia, Chicago and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Door's founder, Deborah Szekely, based her spa on the
Honjin inns of Japan, stressing personalized service and
therapeutic treatments like massage and baths. The spa, in
Escondido, Calif., became known for its healthful cuisine and
weeklong fitness programs limited to 39 guests _ women only, except
for two sessions a year.
</P>
<P>
   At Las Casitas Village, the 25,000-square-foot spa will be open
to men and women. It has 24 treatment rooms, a movement studio,
exercise classes, a fitness-assessment area and a tearoom. The spa
is free for Las Casitas guests, but there will be charges for such
treatments as aromatherapy massages ($95 for 50 minutes), an
anti-oxidant pineapple polish ($99 for 50 minutes, $150 for 80
minutes) and an ambrosia facial ($99 and $150).
</P>
<P>
   The resort, which opens in mid-November after a month's delay
caused partly by Hurricane Georges, has 90 one-, two- and
three-bedroom casitas with full kitchens and balconies on a
300-foot bluff in Fajardo, on Puerto Rico's northeast coast.
Nightly rates range from $435 to $2,290.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Bay's existing properties, which will also get Golden
Doors, are the Grand Bay Hotel Coconut Grove, Miami; The Boulders,
Carefree, Ariz.; the Lodge at Ventana Canyon, Tucson, Ariz.; the
Peaks, Telluride, Colo.; and Carmel Valley Ranch, Carmel, Calif.

   Armor, Wooden Horses at Tower of London
</P>
<P>
   The White Tower, the part of the Tower of London complex
containing the Royal Armories' collection of armor and armaments of
Britain's kings and queens, will reopen Friday following a
three-year renovation. For the first time in 30 years, the White
Tower will now be devoted exclusively to the display of the
collection historically connected to the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Nine galleries on the four floors of the 90-foot White Tower
have been designed to help visitors understand the tower's history,
dating back to 1080 when William the Conqueror started work on the
fortress.
</P>
<P>
   An introduction gallery will use computer imagery to show how
the White Tower has changed in design and function over the
centuries. Besides having been a royal palace, a prison for royalty
and the aristocracy (including Anne Boleyn and Sir Walter Raleigh)
and the place where both ceremonial and practical armor and
weaponry were kept, the tower housed the Royal Observatory in 1675
and was a repository for gunpowder in the 17th century. In
addition, the chapel was periodically used to store state records.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Armories' collection of Tudor and Stuart armor, in
another gallery, includes Charles I's gilt armor as well as highly
decorated pieces made for various princes.
</P>
<P>
   Other exhibits include Henry VIII's tournament armor, and
weapons and instruments of torture including an executioner's axe
and the block used at the last public beheading in 1747.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display are 12 life-size 17th-century wooden horses not
seen since the end of the 19th century. Known as The Line of Kings,
the exhibit shows surviving pieces depicting the good monarchs of
England that were carved by some of the country's finest craftsmen
including Grinling Gibbons, England's great 17th-century
woodcarver, whose work is currently on exhibition at the Victoria
and Albert until Jan 24.
</P>
<P>
   The museum will be included in the Tower complex admission,
which is $16.25; children under 16, $10.75. Information: (800)

   Treasures From Ancient Edo in Washington
</P>
<P>
   Japan, 1615-1868: For the first time in centuries, the country
was united under the Tokugawa shoguns, who governed during a period
of unprecedented peace and prosperity from their new capital, Edo,
which grew into the world's largest city in the 18th century and is
now Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Art flourished, too. Now nearly 300 painted scrolls, screens,
costumes, ceremonial armor, sculpture, ceramics, lacquerware and
woodblock prints from this rich period, drawn from 75 public and
private Japanese collections, will be on view from Sunday to Feb.
15 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. ``Edo: Art in
Japan 1615-1868'' is the first comprehensive survey in the United
States of Edo period art. Many pieces are National Treasures that
have never before left Japan. Some are sensitive to light, and will
be rotated, between Jan. 6 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   To establish the tone of high style and buoyant spirits
characteristic of Edo art, the exhibition will open with a display
of gold lacquerware, embroidered and painted kimonos and a section
of colorful gold-leaf screens that define the period's esthetics.
One screen, Sakai Hoitsu's ``Spring and Autumn Maples,'' has never
before been exhibited, even in Japan. Next come samurai rooms,
showing the peaceful arts created for the warrior class; a work
section, with images of urban and rural occupations; a religion
area, with works illustrating Buddhist and Shinto beliefs; a travel
and landscape area, focusing on paintings of beautiful sites, and
entertainment galleries, with works depicting fashionable actors,
sumo wrestlers and geisha as well as bold costumes.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the picture of daily life during the Edo period, the
National Gallery has scheduled a free performing-arts festival in
and around the museum throughout November. Festival dancers will
perform a lion dance, firemen-acrobats will present a traditional
fire-safety ceremony, and actors will explain Kabuki and other
traditional performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery, Fourth Street and Constitution Avenue,
N.W., is open daily. Admission is free, but passes for the
exhibition will be required on weekends, holidays, the Friday after
Thanksgiving and the week following Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Advance passes can be obtained at the National Gallery (no fee)
or at Ticketmaster locations ($2 per pass). Passes may be obtained
from Ticketmaster, (800) 551-7328, outside the Washington area, for
$2.75 per pass and $1.25 per order. A limited number of same-day
passes will be available at the Gallery's East Building on a
first-come, first-served basis; (202) 737-4215 or www.nga.gov.

HARRY TRUMAN'S ELECTION IN 1948 AN INSPIRATION TO UNDERDOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ Harry Truman needed
a diversion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, 1948 _ Election Day _ he waited in his Independence
home while a motorcycle roared out of his driveway, heading west on
Van Horn Road to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   A car followed.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters climbed into their own cars, gave chase and...got
lost. The motorcyclist was Mike Westwood, an Independence police
officer who later served as Truman's personal bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike wasn't going anywhere,'' said Sue Gentry, longtime
journalist with The Examiner in Independence, Mo. ``Mike knew that
part of town well, so he lost the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he was doing that, Mr. Truman slipped out the back door,
crossed somebody's back yard and got into a car parked on Maple
Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman spent the night at the Elms resort in Excelsior Springs,
Mo. He apparently wanted to face alone the humiliating defeat that
everyone had been predicting for months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by early next morning Truman had defeated Republican nominee
Thomas Dewey, and much of the nation's press was revealed to have
been lost for months.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 50 years later, the upset endures in American culture as
a cautionary tale for overconfident candidates, as well as an
inspiration for any underdog.
</P>
<P>
   These days Truman is considered one of America's greatest
presidents, and Van Horn Road is called Truman Road.
</P>
<P>
   But it all began badly. (break here)Early errors instructive
(begin text here)In the spring of 1948, Truman's approval rating
had slipped to 36 percent. ``Truman Should Quit,'' read the cover
headline on the New Republic of April 5. Even the president's
renomination was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic Party strategists wanted Dwight Eisenhower, who
declined. To help cinch the renomination, Truman scheduled a June
``non-political'' train trip out west.
</P>
<P>
   Bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   In Omaha, Neb., the president spoke to a nearly empty
auditorium. A photograph of the ``acres of empty seats'' later
appeared in Life magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In Carey, Idaho, Truman helped dedicate an airfield that he
thought had been named after a local war hero. In fact, it had been
named for a local girl who had died in a civilian plane accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trip had not been well-planned,'' George Elsey, then a
Truman assistant, said recently from Washington. ``There were many
gaffes and blunders.''
</P>
<P>
   One result was a new Truman research division. The low-profile
team of writers was sequestered in spartan accommodations near
Washington's Dupont Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a row of beds in a big open space,'' said Frank
Kelly, a former Kansas City Star and Times reporter who served four
months with the group. ``It was like a monastery.''
</P>
<P>
   In offices nearby, the researchers converted complex topics into
handy briefs. These files came along on the ``whistlestop''
railroad campaign that Truman decided to undertake after he was
safely renominated that summer.
</P>
<P>
   The writers also compiled details on the many smaller cities
Truman would visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the Truman campaign was an enormous national campaign,
it was also extremely local,'' Kelly said recently from Santa
Barbara, Calif. ``Everywhere he went, audiences were surprised what
the president knew about their town.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman would address a particular campaign issue, but only one,
at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never repeat himself in the course of a day,'' said
Elsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporters on the train _ never knowing what Truman was going
to be talking about but knowing it would be a red hot issue _ would
scramble back to the press car after every speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, over the course of the day, flowing over the wires would
be this series of stories on Truman for the afternoon and evening
papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewey, as Elsey remembers it, addressed only elevated themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke beautifully, but he would talk in platitudes,'' Elsey
said. ``Some reporters on the Dewey train later told me they would
never leave the press car while Dewey spoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman discussed Dewey not at all. Instead, he ripped the
Republican-controlled ``do nothing'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked to call the GOP the party of `grand old
platitudes,' &UR; '' said Ken Hechler, a former Truman special assistant
who is now West Virginia's secretary of state. ``Sometimes he would
ratchet it up and talk about `gluttons of privilege.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Between hammering away at Republicans at every stop, Truman
greeted local politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Clymer, who later became the Jackson County (Mo.) Circuit
Court's first African-American judge, recalls being photographed on
Truman's railroad car with other black Democratic Party officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very cordial to us,'' said Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights, Clymer knew, had become a defining issue after
liberals forced a progressive plank onto the Democratic Party's
platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was to Truman's ultimate advantage,'' said Hechler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It not only energized Democrats who had been tepid toward him,
but it also ensured the loyalty of black voters, who saw that the
party was not in the control of the segregationists.''

PINOCHET'S FATE ATTRACTS SPECIAL INTEREST AMONG SOME KC AREA
RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, MO.) _ Marco Cruz and Luis Ramirez shared a dream.
Both men _ one a construction worker, the other an educator _
wanted social justice for Chile.
</P>
<P>
   They shared a nightmare, too.
</P>
<P>
   Both were tortured in the 1970s for opposing the dictatorship of
Augusto Pinochet. Cruz was dragged from his bedroom at gunpoint,
Ramirez was hauled out of his classroom.
</P>
<P>
   For months, both men were beaten, shocked with electricity and
threatened with death. They crossed paths in the Puchuncavi
concentration camp, near the town of Quintero, in 1976. They
arrived in Kansas City, Mo., months later.
</P>
<P>
   Their hopes for justice were raised this month when Pinochet was
arrested in Britain on Oct. 16 and charged with genocide, torture
and terrorism. But last week, a British court ruled that Pinochet
had diplomatic immunity. Prosecutors will present an appeal this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights officials estimate that about 3,000 people died
during Pinochet's 17-year reign. Amnesty International says ``the
human rights violations _ which include thousands of cases of
torture, extrajudicial execution and `disappearances' _ constitute
crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on those days, Cruz closes his eyes and speaks
softly. He is angry, but his voice does not rise. He describes
guards mocking their captives. He recounts the pleas for mercy that
torturers ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all that, how does Pinochet have the right to ask for
mercy on humanitarian grounds?'' wonders Cruz, who lives in Kansas
City, Mo. ``It's not just for what happened to us. It's not just
the killing, not just the disappearances. It's the suffering of an
entire country for 17 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz said Pinochet killed more than his loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   He killed a nation's hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1970 and the new president, Salvador Allende,
entered office with promises of creating a socialist utopia. Cruz
and Ramirez, strangers at the time, took the ideals to heart. Both
campaigned for Allende.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the nation's elite and military eyed the changes
nervously. So did the Nixon White House. Some thought the
starry-eyed Allende, who professed himself a Marxist, would land
Chile in the Soviet camp.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz had followed his father into the construction business. He
hoped Allende would improve not just salaries but working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez designed the curriculum for the Chilean equivalent of a
community college. He hoped Allende would expand education to all.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 22, 1973, both men learned that Pinochet had led a
bloody coup, backed by the CIA, that left Allende dead and the
nation in military hands. Soldiers were filling the streets. On
opposite sides of the capital city of Santiago, they eyed the
future uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go from being a free man with hope to a man living in
fear, seeing who's watching you, who's passing in front of your
house,'' said Ramirez, who lives in Prairie Village, Kan. ``Just
like that, our lives changed.''
(break here)`Do what it takes to live' (begin text here)The coup
instantly made targets of Ramirez and his wife, Silvia. Ramirez had
been part of Allende's educational bureaucracy and a union
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramirezes moved from Santiago and started teaching at a high
school in a small town. They worked quietly there for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in March 1975, some men came to Ramirez's
classroom door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to talk to you,'' a voice intoned.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked students rushed next door to tell Silvia Ramirez her
husband was being taken away. She looked out just in time to see
it.
</P>
<P>
   Someone apparently had revealed Luis Ramirez's name during
torture. Soldiers brought him to a vacant country mansion called
Villa Grimaldi, where prisoners were kept in metal closets to the
sound of constant screaming.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Ramirez was stunned to see that two of his captors were
former students. The young men, through pained eyes, recognized
their teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The men taught Ramirez a different sort of lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They taught me how to survive a torture, how to stay alive,''
Ramirez said. ``I learned that you have to do what it takes to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   They told him which torturers were incompetent. And they advised
Ramirez to be a sissy. Scream once the electrical shocks start. The
more unfazed you seem, the more the guards will increase the
voltage.
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Ramirez also was tortured. While Luis Ramirez was
confined, she protested with other spouses, a movement that drew
international attention. In May 1976, under pressure from the
United States, Chile freed Ramirez and other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was taken directly from the Puchuncavi concentration
camp to the airport. An old black-and-white photo shows his blank
stare as he climbed the stairs into the jet. A government agent
followed.
</P>
<P>
   The family ended up in Kansas City when a local social-service
agency sponsored their trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to rebuild the lives we had,'' Silvia
Ramirez said. (MORE)

VOTERS LEARN LITTLE FROM BIG SPENDERS IN CALIFORNIA RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When state Republican Party Chairman Michael
Schroeder heard about a new initiative that would ban bilingual
education in public schools, he implored its authors to keep the
potentially divisive issue off this year's. They complied.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren trailing
Democratic Lt. Gov. Gray Davis in the polls, the GOP might look
fondly to the days of wedge-issue politics.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Pete Wilson _ who is barred bar law from seeking
a third term _ sensed the mood of middle-class white voters in
1994, and successfully rode Proposition 187, the anti-immigration
initiative, to a huge second-term victory over Democrat Kathleen
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, in contrast, Lungren and Davis are left to
fight over nothing but the tired ghosts of their own pasts, with no
controversial ballot initiative shadowing the race. The result has
been one of the most conventional gubernatorial campaigns in recent
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Lungren, each with a long history of public service,
presented a campaign between a moderate and a conservative, between
the status quo and change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In comparison to past elections, there are no hugely divisive
propositions on the ballot,'' said Ann Crigler, director of the
Jesse Unruh School of Politics at the University of Southern
California. ``And at this point, we're in kind of a period of
recouping our sense of normalcy, or at least trying not to
antagonize groups.''
</P>
<P>
   When the bills are finally counted, the four major candidates
for California governor are expected to have spent a record $110
million on the campaign this year, mostly on television
advertising. What did voters learn about financier Al Checchi and
Rep. Jane Harman, who challenged Davis in the Democratic primary,
and Lungren?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, according to analysts and partisan observers.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Checchi's 90-page ``Checchi Plan'' and a few largely
ignored policy addresses from Davis and Lungren, voters have
received more of a history lesson than a blueprint for change in
the most diverse, most populous, richest and, in some ways, most
troubled state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not one issue on the ballot drowning out what the
candidates were trying to say, and it presented a unique
opportunity to talk about the future of this state into the next
millennium,'' said Mark Petracca, a political scientist at the
University of California at Irvine. ``And yet it didn't happen.
This was a real missed opportunity by both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps because of the times, Californians got a race from
the 20th century, not for the 21st. Voters believe _ by a margin of
2-to-1 _ that the state is headed in the right direction, according
to a poll by the San Francisco-based Public Policy Institute of
California. An even larger number _ 73 percent _ told pollsters
they expected the state's economy to either stay the same or get
better.
</P>
<P>
   Without a wedge issue, a faltering economy or runaway crime,
Lungren took his campaign to the days when then-Gov. Jerry Brown
was denounced as too liberal and Republican governors began a reign
that lasted another 16 years. Although Lungren was seeking to
continue Republican rule, he became the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren returned Californians to a time when the liberal
moonbeam governor jetted to Africa with rock stars and left people
like Davis, his former chief of staff, in charge. He invoked the
spirit of Ronald Reagan and then ridiculed Brown, former state
Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Bird and liberal state lawmaker
Tom Hayden.
</P>
<P>
   After all that energy spent attacking Jerry Brown, Lungren must
have flinched when he read a recent Los Angeles Times poll showing
voters thought more highly of Brown, now the mayor-elect of
Oakland, than they did of him.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren kept looking backward. His campaign theme alleged that
Davis was not tough enough in supporting the state's ``three
strikes'' law _ an issue from three years ago. Lungren also
questions Davis' commitment to the death penalty, which the Supreme
Court made legal again more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren rode that horse from June to November, but voters ended
up thinking both candidates would handle crime in about the same
tough manner.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Davis' campaign was vintage Wilson. Davis became the
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   He took one look at the polls and discovered what voters wanted
to hear about _ education. He attacked his opponent with wedge
issues of his own _ abortion and assault weapons. He stayed on
message, and didn't get into specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Garry South, the Davis campaign manager, said when voters are
asked in focus groups and polls which candidate has the most
experience to be governor, they picked Davis by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an election,'' South said, ``that I think by and large
is going to benefit incumbents. And even though this is an open
seat, Gray Davis is the closest thing you have to an incumbent in
this election.''

`ARMADILLO': A SECRET GYPSY WITH BAD LUCK BUT A SLIM CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Publication notes are at the end of the review)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The talented and prolific William Boyd has written half a dozen
good novels already, most of them set in exotic locales where
Europeans struggle with the exigencies of foreignness.
</P>
<P>
   His new novel, ``Armadillo,'' is set in London, which is a shift
for him. But the storytelling talents that marked Boyd's earlier
books are fully in evidence in this entertaining novel, which gives
us one of the more likable, lost and perplexed central characters
yet to appear in his oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   The character this time is Lorimer Black, who works successfully
as a loss adjuster for an insurance company, a loss adjuster being
a kind of investigator who makes sure that insurance claims are
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Lorimer has ``ink dark hair and a serious-looking, fine-featured
but pallid face,'' an exotic look that is a clue to another
identity that he keeps carefully concealed. His birth name is
Milomre Blocj. He is known as Milo to his Gypsy family, which runs
a car service and bears roughly the same relationship to Lorimer as
a hack driver would to an Oxford don.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd loves to pit all-too-human characters against perverse bad
fortune, giving them enough slack to try to redeem themselves, and
this is what happens to Lorimer, a kind of secret foreigner amid
the British.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously, Lorimer is caught up in a puzzling intrigue at
GGH Ltd., the company where he works. He comes to be suspected of
disloyalty by his boss, a man named Hogg in good Dickensian fashion
who is a menacing and paranoid version of the character played by
Edward G. Robinson in the movie ``Double Indemnity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorimer is also beset with the problem of a new company director
named Torquil Helvoir-Jayne, a figure with all the charm of a pit
bull without the pit bull's loyalty or courage.
</P>
<P>
   On the periphery of Lorimer's professional world is a beautiful
actress named Flavia Malinverno, unhappily married to a juggler
named Gilbert from whom he tries to steal her away. Then there is
Lorimer's family, including an older brother, three older sisters,
a mother and a grandmother, most of whom lean on him, the worldly
success of the family, for loans and emotional support.
</P>
<P>
   Lorimer is oddly disconnected from the British world he has made
his own, while his family members seem just disconnected, period.
When his mother calls one day to tell him that his father has died,
she rushes to say: ``Sorry to bother you, darling. Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ingredients: Lorimer collects ancient warriors' helmets,
the helmets seeming _ though this is vague _ to emblemize the
armadillo of Boyd's title. He buys flowers from a shopkeeper named
Marlobe, a furious, profane man who dreams of carrying out mass
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lorimer is an insomniac and goes to a clinic called the
Institute of Lucid Dreams, where he is treated by a psychologist
named Alan Kenbarry. The doctor tells him: ``The lucid dream is, in
a way, a vision of a perfect life ... You want to enter that
perfect world where everything can be controlled ... Rid yourself
of that desire and deep slumber will return.''
</P>
<P>
   This panorama of eccentrics and knaves takes on a kaleidoscopic,
almost manic quality in ``Armadillo,'' which seems to have been
written by a profane 1990s version of S.J. Perelman. But Boyd's
zany, exaggerated characters are endowed by their author with a
gift for the kind of spicy dialogue that keeps them entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   In one episode Lorimer goes to a weekend party at the country
house of Torquil Helvoir-Jayne, brilliantly, acidly fashioned by
Boyd into a stunning satire of British manners, a circus of
individual solipsism, conjugal aggression and generalized deceit,
the country weekend from hell.
</P>
<P>
   Hapless but intelligent, Lorimer watches as his world goes to
pieces. A brilliant coup that he scores in his work as a loss
adjuster goes awry, so that not only are the authors of a false
insurance claim murderously angry at him but so, for some
inexplicable reason, is his boss, Hogg.
</P>
<P>
   He begins to receive death threats. Somebody torches his car.
His pursuit of Flavia Malinverno runs aground both because of her
elusiveness and her husband's menacing jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Lorimer does not, any more than Kafka's K, understand why his
world is being torn apart, though he does know that for the most
part his world is made up of bluster and hypocrisy. At one point he
watches Hogg, who has just dismissed him, stride off ``with his
burly bosun's swagger'' and accept a cheroot from the chairman of
the company. The image captures the undercurrent of moral brutality
of Lorimer's world.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of redemption comes in the end for Lorimer, though it is
a confused and ambiguous one. He tries to puzzle out exactly what
went wrong, but neither he nor the reader ever understands exactly
what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the very end, just when Lorimer seems to have won the
heart of Flavia, matters remain uncertain. The lesson seems to
involve the untrustworthiness of others and the overall
precariousness of a world where the moral order appears as images
in a fun house mirror. &QL;

MELLENCAMP REMAINS A VOICE OF A VANISHED ERA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BY FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Fashion is dead, the supermodels thing is over,
and there are no more rock stars. I hope you enjoyed it 'cause it's
all gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, the only person complaining about it seems to be
heartland rocker John Mellencamp, who spoke those words the other
day.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he's still plugging away. Mellencamp's self-titled
new album, his first for Columbia Records after 22 years with
PolyGram, reveals a return to the rootsy, guitar-driven rock that
made him famous after a techno-enhanced detour two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock 'n' roll isn't the music that matters anymore,''
Mellencamp, 47, said. ``It's just another genre today. When I was a
kid, rock music examined the country, reported the condition the
nation was in, told us who we were, told us everything. Those days
are over. The boomers have grown up and they're a passive audience.
The record stores we all flocked to are in bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly true that rock has lost ground to sales leaders
like rap and pop over the last five years. In this week's top 10,
for example, seven songs are rap or r&AMP;b-derived.
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp says this cheerfully, his positive, accepting
attitude also reflected in the new record, which was strongly
influenced by a series of changes in his life _ his happy marriage
to his wife, Elaine, with whom he's raising two young sons; the
physical, emotional and spiritual rehabilitation from a heart
attack that forced an abrupt end to a relentless rock 'n' roll
lifestyle; the softening of a grinding tour schedule; and the
dissolution of his long relationship with his former label.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, when PolyGram signed me, it was a case of,
`We don't care if we don't make money on the first few records,'''
the Seymour, Ind.-born Mellencamp said. ``That thinking is extinct
now. If a label doesn't make money on an act right away, they're
gone. If I came along today, I doubt I'd be signed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp's run on the charts began with 1982's ``American
Fool.'' In addition to his 36 gold, platinum and multiplatinum
awards from 1982-97, he has been nominated for 11 Grammys and
racked up seven top 10 albums and 10 top 10 singles with titles
like ``Pink Houses,'' ``Small Town,'' ``R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.,''
``Hurts So Good'' and ``Jack &AMP; Diane.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Mellencamp supporters such as Bryon Jordan, a
29-year-old software engineer from Columbus, Ohio, insist the
singer-songwriter's best days are far from behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``John still has something to say,'' says Jordan, who runs a
Mellencamp mailing list on the Internet for roughly 800 members
around the world. ``If he didn't, I don't think he'd bother putting
out music, since he could probably do anything he wants at this
point. He's still very important to the fans who've remained with
him all these years. Almost the entire `Human Wheels' album still
amazes me today, five years after it came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock radio veteran Jim Ladd says ``Your Life Is Now,'' the first
single from Mellencamp's new record, ``is one of the best things
he's ever written. I love it. It's really a great song.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladd, heard locally at 6 p.m. on KLOS-FM (95.5), said Mellencamp
continues to be relevant in today's music scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has a lot to say,'' the DJ said.
</P>
<P>
   Long a fixture in the nation's stadiums, the former John Cougar
won't tour behind the new album until next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that's really the best time to go out,'' Mellencamp
explained. ``I enjoy performing outdoors the most. I spent so many
years in the arenas doing 120 shows a year. I may go back sometime,
but these days I prefer the venues where the suns shines and you're
not in some cavernous gymnasium with lockers and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp continues to pursue his hobby as a painter.
``Mellencamp: Painting and Reflections,'' a book showcasing 75 of
his works, has just been published by HarperCollins. Profits are
earmarked for music education in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good cause,'' Mellencamp said from his home in
Bloomington, Ind. ``How can kids learn anything about music if
they're not exposed to it?''
</P>
<P>
   Equally, how can a new generation know anything about Mellencamp
if he's not on radio or MTV? The singer-painter isn't optimistic
about the state of the music business in late '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``To these kids, I'm Dean Martin,'' he said. ``You're going to
see groups come and go like Matchbox 20 until there's another
generation that's energetic and motivated enough to change the
world like we did. I defy you to tell me the last time someone in
their 40s raced to a record store because they just had to have a
certain record. It just doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp takes a dig at the politics of today's youth on the
new album's hard-rocking ``Fruit Trader'': ``Ain't got no
morals/Ain't got no politics/Ain't got no particular point of
view/What I've got is plenty of time on my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   With luck, Mellencamp, too, will have plenty of time on his
hands. After suffering a major heart attack and close call with
death in late 1994, the singer spent a year recovering but refuses
to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was bulletproof for years,'' he said. ``When
something like that happens, it really messes with your head to
hear you've got coronary heart disease. But stop smoking? Let's not
get crazy here now.''

   NEW YORK _ I wonder how many of the parents who brought their
children to the New York City Opera's ``Cunning Little Vixen'' on
Sunday afternoon quite realized the burden being placed on innocent
eyes and ears. There were indeed the anthropomorphic pleasures of
Maurice Sendak's cuddly forest creatures and the fairy-tale whimsy
of the production's painted cutouts and backdrops. But Janacek's
opera, small in stature yet transcendent in tone, is anything but a
children's piece.
</P>
<P>
   This lovely, touching tribute to the remorselessness of nature
portrays as well as any art I know the impotence of human values in
the face of the regenerative process. The Forester, his family and
friends may kill the fox, skin the fox or capture the fox, but the
fox lives on in the cycle of life, death and rebirth. If the
Schoolmaster is lovelorn, the Priest drunk and Harasta on the
sexual prowl _ if as they grow old, they feebly assign significance
to their individual lives _ nature does not really seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   The sets by Neil Peter Jampolis and costumes by Steven Feldman,
both after Sendak's designs, threaten a cuteness that neither
Janacek nor Sendak will allow. The music has a protean loveliness,
with swimming, shifting surges of meter and color. There is an
underlying darkness to the artist's view that reminds us of
childhood's unpleasant mysteries as well as its simple pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   This is difficult music. George Manahan and his orchestra feel
the beauties strongly and manage the intricacies passably well.
Robin Blitch Wiper is a delight as Vixen Sharp-Ears, agile both of
voice and limb. Richard Paul Fink is a strong presence as the
Forester. John Avey (the Priest), Peter Kazaras (the Schoolmaster),
George Cordes (Harasta) and Kristen Garver (Terynka) represent the
human contingent. Abbie Furmanski (Golden Stripe), Joseph McKee
(the Badger), Kate Butler (the Dog), Valerie Bernhardt (the
Rooster) and Leslie McBride (the Hen) are among the voices
emanating from a host of animal and insect suits.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Corsaro, who directs, has an awful lot of bodies to fit
onto the City Opera's smallish stage; he is also dealing with many
child performers. Small clumsinesses seemed unavoidable. The
English translation by Robert T. Jones and Yveta Synek Graff is
clear enough, and there are surtitles (also in English) just to
make sure. Children ready for the unromantic aspects of life and
death should go. For thoughtful opera lovers, attendance is almost
obligatory.

 &HT;    Little known fashion designer starting to turn some heads
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although designer Susan Lazar is far from being a
household name. She does, however, have enough clout in the
industry to be among the designers staging lavish, spring/summer
'99 runway shows this week in massive tents at Bryant Park.
</P>
<P>
   In order to continue her progression toward fashion phenom, it
was important for Lazar to show a solid collection on Monday. And
solid it was. Besides restricting herself almost exclusively to
clothes in pale pastel, cream and gray shades, Lazar also rendered
almost all of her looks in solids.
</P>
<P>
   This continues a trend in bucking trends among designers
worldwide. When the first wave of New York designers showed their
warm-weather collections in September, it appeared as if floral
prints and bold colors would be requisite inclusions in stylish
womens' wardrobes. Since then, British, Italian, French and, now,
more New York designers have declared that that ain't necessarily
so.
</P>
<P>
   The only prints Lazar showed were subtle ones: some of her
chiffon, ribbon strap sundresses and sleeveless tops were in
marbelized shades of lime green and fuscia. Mainly, she focused on
clothes in form-fitting silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   Her skirt and dress hems grazed the knees. And she showed pants
in both wide-leg and ankle-hugging styles. Tops were cropped to
expose a bit of tummy, and her beltless pants swiveled on the hips.
</P>
<P>
   Every designer has tried to create revealing clothes, and Lazar
did her part by cutting ovular vents into the sides of tops and
making dresses with deep, plunging armholes.
</P>
<P>
   When the shapely, athletic-looking Lazar emerged from backstage
to accept applause wearing hip-hugging slacks and a skintight
sweater, it was immediately apparent that she's someone who
identifies with women who are proud of their bodies and appreciate
simplistic clothes that show off their physiques.
</P>
<P>
   In the show staged immediately after Lazar's, Carolina Herrera
showed a bevy of beautiful, body-conscious looks as well. She too
showed hippy, beltless slacks, clingy dresses and tops that flashed
a bit of navel.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of lavender lining peeked out from folds of her wrap-style
skirts and dresses. And she deftly combined colors like
bronze-and-fuscia or beige-and-lilac in sweater-skirt ensembles.
Most striking of all were Herrera's leather halters, jackets,
dresses and shirts shaded pink, baby blue and lilac.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera also had serious fun with her eveningwear styles.
Relying on variations on the tuxedo to convey the formal concept,
she cut the satin-lapeled jackets to look like jackets with the
sleeves rolled to the bicep, or paired them with slinky skirts. Her
ballgowns were tweeked as well: her wrapped satin skirts had
slouchy pockets and were worn with clubby, embroidered T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera didn't come far enough down the runway to show what kind
of shape her 50-something body's in. The rousing applause she
received after her show came by virtue of her body of work.

 &HT;    `Expectations' from society shouldn't dictate a girl's choices
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The square in Dahlonega, Georgia seemed as good a place as any
to bring it up. Sunday was sunny and beautiful, but life is not
always blue skies. It is a grim business, and it was time they knew
it.
</P>
<P>
   Our daughter Alex and I had gone to Dahlonega for the day with
friends, who don't wish to be dragged into this nasty dispute but
look upon it with bemused wonder. He is a writer and translator,
she an engineer, and their daughter is a schoolmate of Alex's.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive up, Alex, Negin and I played time-killing games in
the back seat, with Negin's mother joining in from the sidelines
when the pickings seemed easy. I enjoy games in which you take a
word _ ``Elizabeth,'' for example _ and find in it as many other
words as you can. Both girls are 8 years old, and I dispatched them
with impressive ease.
</P>
<P>
   They fared somewhat better in the number games, which is why, as
we sat eating ice cream cones on the square, I decided the subject
could be put off no longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex,'' I said, ``what do you want to be when you grow up?'' I
might have added, ``You haven't much more time, you know.'' But she
knows that when my tone takes on a certain gravity, we are into one
of my Life Is Serious lectures again.
</P>
<P>
   Both had ordered cones of mint chocolate chip, one with a squirt
of whipped cream on top. Licking pensively, Alex said: ``I'm going
to be either a teacher or a dancer. Haven't decided. But when we're
finished here, can we ride the ponies?''
</P>
<P>
   I was greatly troubled, of course. What father wouldn't be?
</P>
<P>
   Her friend hadn't even given it that much thought. ``I don't
know,'' Negin said, insouciant in the way only a child is allowed
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Already 8 years old and neither girl had any apparent interest
in soil mechanics _ a field in which women are severely
``underpresented'' _ or chemical engineering or physics. Very sad.
</P>
<P>
   I mention all this because of a column I wrote two weeks ago
about an ad campaign sponsored by the Women's College Coalition.
The ads call on parents to interest their daughters in science and
technology at an early age _ while they're still in the crib, for
all one knows. The implied point of the ads is clear: Women are not
proportionally represented in certain fields. Therefore, they are
being held back (maybe even oppressed!). It is the only possible
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The ads were less than explicit about exactly who was holding
them back, but a stream of e-mails from readers (some of them, I
should say) has cleared up all confusion. ``Society'' is holding
them back. Given a free choice, girls would go into engineering and
the sciences in the same numbers as boys. If only they had that
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of the column, in so many words, was that maybe girls
aren't as interested as we think they must be. Nature and nurture
obviously interpenetrate, and none of us is equipped to say where
the one leaves off and the other takes over. But try telling some
people that.
</P>
<P>
   From Southern Polytechnic State University (a school I had never
heard of) came the quite remarkable ruminations of someone named A.
Bowdoin Van Riper. Best that we let this gentlemen speak in his own
words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminism, from Mary Wollstonecraft on down, has always been
about opportunity. Arguing that girls today have as much
`opportunity' to study science and technology as boys do is as
specious as arguing that, in the Jim Crow era, Southern blacks had
as much `opportunity' to vote as Southern whites.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a contention that requires no response. And it's a
good thing: What could one say?
</P>
<P>
   But something sticks in my mind. The mother of Alex's friend was
telling me later, ``You know, when Negin said she didn't know what
she wanted to be when she grew up, that made me feel good. I'm glad
she doesn't.'' I hadn't thought about it in that way, but here was
an accomplished woman saying she was happy to see her daughter a
child still. There was time for her to enjoy many things, and find
out which way her heart pulled her.
</P>
<P>
   What is contemptible is the idea that she _ or any child _ must
conform to someone else's expectations. ``I am a female in a
traditionally white male profession (forestry),'' Kate Robie wrote
me, ``and I am weary of the notion that something is `wrong'
because the demographics of our profession don't match the
demographics of society.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reader, the greater problem is the images of
``successful'' women we get from advertising and popular culture _
``hip, stylish and sexy rather than bright and capable.'' No
argument, although parallel images of boys are also propagated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing,'' as Robie says, ``is that we do away
with institutional barriers to women and minorities. If we are
barrier-free and certain groups are still under-represented, well,
gee, I guess different people like different things. So what?''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the square in Dahlonega, under the bluest sky of the
fall, it was hard to imagine why some people worry about the things
they do. Maybe their lives really are that grim.

 &HT;    Updike: Wolfe's novel `not literature'
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this week's issue of The New Yorker ($3), one literary
heavyweight _ John Updike _ weighs in on another _ Tom Wolfe _
declaring ``A Man in Full'' to be ``entertainment, not
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 years ago, Updike writes, ``Wolfe chastised his
writing contemporaries with ignoring most of the American reality,
the brawling socioeconomic and power-crazed vastness of it,
concerning themselves instead with trivial introspective exercises.
`A Man in Full' is a brave, flamboyant effort to practice what he
preached.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel surrounds the reader like the modern equivalent of the
Cyclorama, Updike says, with detailed descriptions of Atlanta,
Oakland, Calif., and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much local information, so many well-lighted settings, so
much news do not quite knit into a novel powered by the human
spirit as it gropes and struggles for focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Updike praises Wolfe's muscular prose and ambitious scope, but
concludes that the novel, like ``a movie desperate to recoup its
bankers' investment,'' tries too hard to please us.
</P>
<P>
   Updike's review is entertaining enough, but in this issue
there's more great writing for the literary-minded. In an
insightful essay on the books Ernest Hemingway never wanted us to
read, Joan Didion questions the decision to publish an unfinished
novel next year _ a novel that the author obviously thought was not
ready for publication. And Michael Knight has written a delightful
short story about a blonde, parrots and football in Elbow, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   X MARKS THE SPOT: Editors are constantly looking for ways to
repackage their magazines to appeal to different target groups.
That's why the November issue of Men's Health ($2.95) has different
cover lines for subscribers and newsstand customers. Newsstand
issues featured a cover line that reads, ``Put More X in Your
Sex,'' while the cover sent to subscribers and advertisers reads,
``Natural sex boosters'' and ``No more backaches.'' Editor Michael
Lafavore, who wrote the cover lines, explains that newsstand buyers
tend to be younger and more impulsive. The article, by the way, is
about herbal supplements that may help your sex drive.
</P>
<P>
   FOUNDING FATHER: Speaking of sex, if you're interested in more
details about Thomas Jefferson's intimate life, take a look at U.S.
News &AMP; World Report ($2.95). The magazine, which revealed the DNA
results indicating Jefferson fathered several children by his slave
Sally Hemings, includes a detailed account of how professor Eugene
A. Foster conducted his research.
</P>
<P>
   ALANIS AGAIN: Three years after her smash hit album, ``Jagged
Little Pill,'' Alanis Morissette is back with a new album and a new
look: nude. Entertainment Weekly ($2.95) talks with the 24-year-old
rock star about her CD and her controversial video. Also of note:
The cast of ``The Big Chill'' tells all on the 15th anniversary of
the film.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEWSWEEKLIES: Time's ($2.95) first installment of a
multipart series on corporate welfare offers some startling facts
for the average American. While Congress has reduced welfare for
individuals and families, big business continues to cash in to the
tune of $125 billion a year. This costs every working adult the
equivalent of two weekly paychecks a year. According to Time
reporters Donald Barlett and James B. Steele, ``It has turned
politicians into bribery specialists and smart business people into
con artists.'' Elsewhere, Time reports that the supermodel is dead,
replaced by anonymous, gangly teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek ($2.95) lists the tech cities that are challenging
Silicon Valley. Among the hottest: Austin, Texas; Boise, Idaho; and
Tel Aviv, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   NEW LOOK: The content is as conservative as ever, but National
Review ($3.50) has a new ``reader-friendly'' design. Featured on
the cover of the Nov. 9 issue is a series of articles on what went
wrong with the global market, and an insightful handicapping of
Republican presidential hopefuls.

POP REVIEW: MITCHELL AND DYLAN AMONG FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bob Dylan is at that stage of cuddly sainthood that
Jerry Garcia reached in the 1980s: When he's having fun, the
audience is having fun. Dylan looked modestly happy as he surveyed
the Madison Square Garden audience through his deeply sunken eyes
on Sunday night, and he talked to the crowd a little more than
usual. He dug extensively into his lead-guitar playing, his recent
ploy to change his group sound, and he danced gingerly, with
self-conscious awkwardness, like an eccentric grandfather doing his
impression of Chuck Berry to entertain children.
</P>
<P>
   It was a well-received performance, but uninspired. Dylan's
greatest-hits set, part of a short double-feature tour that pairs
him with Joni Mitchell, too often had the innocuous groove of a
Grateful Dead sound-alike band. You know you're in a pretty bland
zone when the mentioning of New York City in a lyric (as Dylan did
in ``Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues'') supplies the set's greatest
crowd thrill.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of three clearly enunciated songs _ his new
``Love Sick''; a Charles Aznavour ballad, ``The Times We Have
Known,'' and a truly rehydrated version of ``Blowin' in the Wind''
that marked the set's best moment _ Dylan's delivery was
characteristically bizarre. He ran together several lines in single
breath, came close to rapping at times, and generally sounded as if
he could be singing in any language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually play these songs all by myself,'' he said, as he
introduced the Aznavour. ``But I feel all by myself now.'' If only
he could have better projected that feeling.
</P>
<P>
   His latest album, ``Time Out of Mind'' (Columbia), uses a band
that hangs several sizes too loose on him; the album portrays him
effectively as a solitary, grief-wasted figure. Here, still with
his castaway's croak and wheeze, he played the gregarious rocker,
and it undermined his peculiar eminence. Besides providing a
clunky, punky counterweight to the second guitarist Larry
Campbell's session-musician proficiency, Dylan's amateur
lead-guitar playing just tried one's patience.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchell satisfied the full range of her audience, playing
what was mostly a fan's set with tremendous communicative clarity.
She began with ``Big Yellow Taxi,'' which Janet Jackson bowdlerized
last year for her own hit. Ms. Mitchell's encore was a revamped
``Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   But between those warhorses, she performed some of her loveliest
lesser-known work: ``Hejira,'' ``Amelia,'' ``Harry's House,'' ``Don
Juan's Reckless Daughter,'' ``The Magdalene Laundries.'' The songs
emphasized Ms. Mitchell's brilliance with harmony. What one
remembers most in her performances is the total arrangement, with
her voice as the most important instrument.
</P>
<P>
   She was pushed by her rhythm section _ drummer Brian Blade,
whose fills gave minute attention to the curves of the work, and
bassist Larry Klein _ as well a steel-guitar player and a trumpeter
who mostly got out of the way of her harmony and lent the music
lush surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle was Ms. Mitchell with her guitar, which she
sometimes just strummed but more often played orchestrally, letting
bass notes ring over her teasing of idiosyncratically tuned
strings.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the performance lit up familiar strengths, but what
audiences have learned recently is how good a jazz singer Ms.
Mitchell can be. Putting down her guitar and lighting a cigarette,
she turned to a plainer style to sing ``Comes Love,'' made famous
by Billie Holiday. Without the sudden rushes of phrasing and Ms.
Mitchell's signature chords wrapped around it, the song made the
most of her natural voice, its bright, cutting vowels and its new
depths, a gift of age. It took her into a completely new context.

   NEW YORK _ Knitwear is an indispensable component of a
fall-winter wardrobe, especially this season when sportswear rules.
A sweater and skirt or pants make a basic outfit, but there's no
need to settle for a basic pullover when you can make a more
striking statement with a knit top.
</P>
<P>
   Cable-stitched sweaters include a tunic by Clan Douglas ($395 at
Nordstrom) and a hooded cardigan by Sonja Nuttal ($440 at Barneys
New York). Barneys also has cardigans: a popcorn stitch by We Wool
($595); a notch collar by Irie ($425), and a zip front with a small
collar by Future Ozbek ($420).
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom also has Missoni's distinctive-patterned knits in a
long slim jacket ($895); a sleeveless dress ($760), and a pullover
($440) with a large coordinating stole ($660).
</P>
<P>
   Besides sweaters, Saks Fifth Avenue has knitted accessories,
including cashmere gloves ($40); berets by Patricia Underwood
($125), and flame-stitch handbags by Missoni ($620).

MORRISETTE'S `SUPPOSED' CD GETS MIGHTY PERSONAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 1/2 STARS 
By BY FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No matter how bad things get, you can always
console yourself with the fact that at least you're not one of
Alanis Morissette's ex-lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Because this time, the patron saint of female anger is naming
names.
</P>
<P>
   On her new album, ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' _ how's
that for a nifty title, kids? _ lyrics are therapy, and Alanis is
back on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   This is one wordy record. Apparently written under the influence
of the complete works of Hermann Hesse, ``Autobiography of a Yogi''
and ``I'm OK, You're OK,'' plus other examples of Goa beach reading
circa 1974, the disc does go on a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Lines like, ``Just the other day my sweet daughter I was driving
past 203 I walked up the stairs in my mind's eye/I remember how
they would creak loudly,'' seem more like rambling diary jottings
than pop lyrics, partly because there are so few, if any, rhymes
here.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, though, ``Infatuation Junkie'' is a winner. Once
again working with co-producer Glen Ballard at his Encino home
studio, Morissette pulls out the stops in some impressive vocal
performances, particularly on the album's first single and video,
``Thank U,'' as well as ``Baba,'' ``Are You Still Mad,'' ``Can't
Not'' and ``Would Not Come.''
</P>
<P>
   The tunes are definitely there, matching the fresh appeal of the
best-selling ``Jagged Little Pill,'' while radio will have plenty
to choose from among these 17 tracks, generally built by Ballard
from the ground up with genuine pop savvy.
</P>
<P>
   And while you could say Morissette has mellowed a bit since the
raw rage of her breakthrough single, ``You Oughta Know,'' she
remembers what those guys from the past have done to her.
</P>
<P>
   Just be thankful you're not Matthew, Jonathan, Terrance, Marcus,
Lou (all named in ``Unsent'') or the fellas in ``Are You Still
Mad'' and ``Sympathetic Character.''

HOLOCAUST MEMOIR IN DOUBT: SWISS RECORDS CONTRADICT TALE OF
CHILDHOOD HORROR
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By DOREEN CARVAJAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until Binjamin Wilkomirski's truth came into conflict with his
own legal identity, the slim memoir of his Jewish childhood in the
concentration camps of Poland was hailed as a ``small
masterpiece,'' a searing sketch of death and horror _ rats
rummaging among corpses, starving babies sucking fingers to the
bone, a dying mother's last glimpse of her son.
</P>
<P>
   International Jewish groups showered the 155-page memoir,
``Fragments,'' with endorsements and prizes: the National Jewish
Book Award in the United States, the Prix Memoire de la Shoah in
France and the Jewish Quarterly Literary Prize in Britain. The U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum sent the first-time author and Swiss
musician on a six-city fund-raising tour last fall. The book was
translated into more than a dozen languages, an achievement
considered the biggest global success for a Swiss book since
``Heidi.''
</P>
<P>
   But the shards of Wilkomirski's ``knife-sharp'' memories had
more edge than any of his publishers or backers envisioned. His
identity is now in doubt and his publishers are in the awkward
position of insisting that they believe that he is a Latvian Jew
who survived the Holocaust. This despite legal records identifying
him as the son of a Swiss woman and indicating he was born two
years later than indicated in the subtitle of the original German
edition of the book.
</P>
<P>
   While some publishers plead for a reprieve or an ``editorial
habeas corpus'' for the author, the international debate about the
authenticity of the memoir has exposed the tensions between art and
commerce. Nonfiction, for example, sells better than fiction with
an author who plays the role of promoter and poster child, and the
prestige of endorsements give such books almost invincible
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fragments'' was first published in Germany in 1995, but it was
not until this summer that questions were raised publicly about
Wilkomirski's bleak memories of childhood, dating from 1939 to
1948. Wilkomirski's literary version is that he was a Latvian Jew
whose earliest memories are of the beating death of his father in
the winter in Riga, followed by fragmented images of imprisonment
at the age of 3 or 4 in Majdanek in Poland and a second
concentration camp that he never identifies. These scenes,
described in a child's unflinching voice, were recovered through
therapy, Wilkomirski says, and he has participated in seminars in
Europe describing the techniques.
</P>
<P>
   But the counterimage of Wilkomirski's life is far more mundane.
The one that has emerged from legal records and Swiss news reports
is that he is Swiss, was born in February 1941 in Biel to an
unmarried Protestant woman, Yvonne Grosjean, and was later adopted
by an upper-middle-class Zurich couple, all of whom are now dead.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript was circulated by a respected and prominent
literary agent in Switzerland to publishers, including a Jewish
imprint of a well-known German publisher, Suhrkamp Verlag. The
American publisher, Schocken Books, an imprint of Random House,
relied in turn on the judgment of the German publisher. Suhrkamp
did do some checking with experts and asked for further
verification, which resulted in an afterword in the book that noted
contradictions between Wilkomirksi's memories and legal records.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got his declaration where he is clarifying his
position,'' said Thomas Sparr, an editor at Suhrkamp, who noted
that his company accepted Wilkomirski's explanation that he could
not find his original birth records and that he had doubts about
the reliability of his adoption records. ``Why shouldn't we trust
our authors? The book was published three years ago, and I did not
get any hint that it was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Other publishers also trusted Wilkomirski's sincerity and were
impressed by his prose, which was so plain and powerful that The
New York Times included the memoir on its list of notable books for
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not private investigative agencies, nor finally can
every publisher vet every manuscript and every author on an
adversarial basis. It's unthinkable. It would be a travesty of the
relationship with the author,'' said Carol Janeway, Wilkomirski's
U.S. editor and translator, who called the memoir ``remarkable
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Another Swiss author decided to take on the role of detective
after he was commissioned to write a profile of Wilkomirski, who
had become something of a Swiss celebrity and was the subject of
two film documentaries. Daniel Ganzfried, the author and himself
the son of a Holocaust survivor, started gathering information that
he called troubling and inconsistent. For example, he said, he
listened to Wilkomirksi's taped remarks in a seminar on his form of
``interdisciplinary therapy,'' in which he denied that he was
adopted. In a long interview with Wilkomirski, he said the author
told him he was circumcised, which the author's ex-wife and his
girlfriend later denied to Ganzfried.
</P>
<P>
   Ganzfried said he asked the author whether he had a prison
tattoo. He said Wilkomirski told him that he lacked one because he
had been part of a medical experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one film, he claimed to have lived in Switzerland only from
1948, and he describes all these scenes after the war,'' said
Ganzfried. ``Then I found in the local school files of Zurich that
he attended first grade in April 1947. I found a picture of him in
the summer of 1946 in the garden of his adoptive parents from a
photo book of his relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he started searching local government offices and
found Wilkomirski's adoption records. The 1941 birth date conflicts
with the prominent subtitle of the book, which appeared in most
foreign versions: ``Fragments: A Childhood 1939-1948.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters from officials in Biel and Zurich verified the
information. And Wilkomirski's former lawyer, Rolf Sandberg,
confirmed that he had obtained records with similar information
after a request from the German publisher for more verification
before publication of the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I didn't doubt what his memory had to say,''
Sandberg said, ``but I had to leave it to them what to make of this
whole story. I could only say I have these documents and they prove
that he is the son of Ms. Grosjean, but you can say: `I don't trust
it. I know better.' And that is what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months before the book was first published, Suhrkamp
received a letter of warning from Hanno Helbling, an editor at a
Swiss newspaper, who said friends of Wilkomirski had told him that
the manuscript was fiction. ``They wrote me back that they had
examined the situation and they were sure that the thing was
authentic,'' said Helbling, who is retired and lives in Rome. ``The
publisher maintains his belief or he makes believe that the story
is authentic, but I think nobody believes it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all publishers of the book are still supporting
Wilkomirski's account, largely because of assurances from Suhrkamp.
So too are groups like the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and the
New York-based Jewish Book Council, which discussed its award for
the book at a recent board meeting and decided to take no action
and adopt a ``no comment'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkomirski has largely retreated from public view and did not
respond to requests for comment, although he has occasionally
issued statements in writing. ``I would like to answer you
thoroughly, but I must ask you to be so kind as having a little
patience,'' he said in a brief message by e-mail that promised a
response in three weeks. ``My health is in rather poor condition. I
am very weak and it takes me a lot of strength to answer questions,
which cannot be answered in only a few sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afterword of his book, he briefly addressed the record of
his 1941 birth by saying: ``This date has nothing to do with either
the history of this century or my personal history. I have now
taken legal steps to have this imposed identity annulled.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandberg, the lawyer who gathered the adoption records for the
author, said that Wilkomirski had not to his knowledge taken any
legal steps to challenge the records. ``At that time, he didn't do
it because he just said somehow it's not worthwhile and it's much
too expensive to do. It's very difficult, and if you don't have a
real necessity I don't know why you would do it because in the end
I don't think it would change much.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the annual Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany, which
brings together publishers from all over the world, Wilkomirski
sent a statement in German to all his publishers describing the
current climate of debate as a ``poisonous'' atmosphere of
``totalitarian judgment and criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkomirski acknowledged that the Swiss legal documents were not
fake but suggested that a third party ``who is no longer alive''
had manipulated and replaced the papers. He also criticized
Holocaust historians who had attacked his work, complaining that
they were not expert in research about children who survived that
period.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Deborah Dwork, the Clark University director of the
Center for Holocaust Studies. But he receives no support from
Dwork, who like other American historians expressed troubling
doubts about the book for several reasons, from a lack of dates and
specific names to a simple disbelief that a 3-or 4-year-old child
could have survived incarceration in two death camps because
children younger than 7 were usually steered to the crematoriums
unless they were twins used for experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If indeed these Swiss documents are accurate, if they are
authentic,'' Dwork said, ``then the onus now falls on Wilkomirski
to demonstrate why they are inaccurate. Until that time, I do not
accept `Fragments' as historically accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwork expressed sympathy for Wilkomirski, saying that she had
met him when both received an award from the Jewish Book Council.
He appeared, she said, to be a deeply scarred man, adding that she
does not blame him for the controversy because she thinks he
believes in his identity. It is the publishers that she takes to
task, saying they exploited him.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, the dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, said he considered it highly improbable that
such a young child could have survived two concentration camps
without an adult protector among the guards. ``I think what you see
is that when you wear the mantle of the survivor, there's a certain
amount of trust, and no one has the concern that a survivor would
make something up.''
</P>
<P>
   The author and Holocaust researcher Konnilyn Feig said that when
she read Wilkomirski's book two years ago, she marked in the
margins her impression that the text read as if he had not been
there. It lacked specific detail, she said, and was so vague
``anything that could have happened also could not have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   She said what troubled her most was that a case like this could
give Holocaust deniers ammunition. ``I think it's a shame that
people get awards; at least the fake Hitler diaries didn't get
awards. The sad thing is that whether it's true or not, this man
evidently got himself very integrated with all of the survivors.
And then if it is not true, he has done a terrible thing to
survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Many historians observed that the whole issue would never have
arisen if the book had simply been published as a novel, but the
title would have lost selling power without an author to bear
testimony as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, why didn't the German publisher release the book
as a novel, given some of the late warnings? Sparr, the Suhrkamp
editor, offered a simple explanation: ``The author is not declaring
it as fiction.''

HDTV WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE, BUT NOT JUST YET ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This revolution (ital)is(end ital) being
televised, but not too many people will see it, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   High-definition television, or HDTV _ the glitziest part of a
broader transformation called digital television _ officially kicks
off today in Los Angeles and nine other major U.S. cities. Whether
you know it or not, it will revolutionize your viewing habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you were up in the stands watching (the parade)
instead of at home wondering if that's a red or orange color on
that float,'' said Kathy Delk of North Hollywood as she watched a
broadcast of HDTV shots taken at this year's Rose Parade on the
sole high-definition television in Glendale's Circuit City store
last week.
</P>
<P>
   In its most glorious iteration, the 1080i format, HDTV will
bring extraordinarily sharp pictures to homes across the country,
far better than even the best television screens showing in the
long-used NTSC analog format.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you'll notice on a high-definition screen is its
shape. At a ratio of 16 by 9, it's much wider and flatter than the
4-by-3 ratio of the television you know _ and much closer to what
you'd see in a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Then the picture comes on, and the jaw drops. Where a standard
NTSC screen is made up of a collection of about 250,000 tiny
colored dots called pixels, the highest-resolution HDTV format will
show around 2 million pixels.
</P>
<P>
   On a regular television screen, you don't want to get too close,
because the image will break down, literally pixellate, into
virtually indecipherable dots and lines. On an HDTV screen, by
contrast, the picture looks good at 6 inches or at 40 feet.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on that Rose Bowl footage that Delk was watching,
you can pick out faces in the crowd of bystanders even though the
camera was mounted several stories up in a building across the
street. That's a New Year's resolution.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV also provides far better sound _ the high-quality,
three-dimensional audio you'd expect in a theater _ and the ability
to broadcast much other information _ including computer software,
stock quotes, sports statistics and even additional television
channels _ in the unused frequencies surrounding the main channel.
</P>
<P>
   MIXED SIGNALS &QL; 
Now for the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, you'll need to give up body parts
(i.e. an arm and a leg) to afford an HDTV-capable television.
That's assuming you can find one, because few models will be
available anywhere any time soon, and most of those of wall-sized
proportions. On top of that, there won't be much to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Guys store in Glendale has two televisions available
that can accept an HDTV signal, said manager Dan Kenny. The cheap
one costs about $4,000, the other $5,500, which is also what that
Panasonic 56-inch screen will cost across the street at Circuit
City.
</P>
<P>
   Both models are massive televisions, virtually armoire sized,
with lots of additional features, including the ability to take
analog TV signals and make them look four times better.
</P>
<P>
   That line-quadrupling circuit is important, too, because without
an additional $1,500 converter box, neither TV can pick up an HDTV
signal, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have real money, go to Dave's Video the Laser Place
in Studio City and pick up a 50-inch Pioneer gas-plasma television.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it'll cost you $22,000, but home theater manager Pete
Camacho said the screen is only 4 inches thick, weighs only 95
pounds and can be mounted on the wall like a picture. You can make
like Bill Gates, who reportedly has a number of sets with
ever-changing art images adorning the walls of his home, assuming
you have a spare billion or two like he does.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S THE HARDWARE &QL; 
Of course, even if you do have that money burning a hole in your
bank account, finding digital TV sets to buy will prove difficult
for at least the next few weeks. Valley-area electronics dealers
have virtually no televisions for sale that can display an HDTV
signal.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho's store only has the gas-plasma screen, though he should
have as many as 10 models of widely varying sizes by Thanksgiving,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny expects to have half a dozen models available within three
weeks, though his competitor across the street, Circuit City
general manager Marty Schaeffer, still doesn't know when his store
will get its HDTV screens.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get your new technological marvel home, there's an
additional question: what to watch. For now, the answer is not
much.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a few football and baseball games, ``The Wonderful
World of Disney'' and ``The Tonight Show,'' other movies and
educational programming in HDTV in the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   Creative people in Hollywood are still struggling to figure out
how to take advantage of it all. So far, little is ready for prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so certain that the powers that be are going to really
allow anything to be done that anyone's going to want,'' said West
Hollywood screenwriter Douglas Varchol, who is creating interactive
programming for a Dutch channel.
</P>
<P>
   Varchol's project includes extra computer-accessible information
about the invention of powered flight by the Wright Brothers _
likening them to Jungian proto-hackers _ as part of an episode in a
hugely successful European television program about key points in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing comes when you start doing it for a
series,'' Varchol said. ``You start weaving a texture out there
that's going to be unbelievably complex.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Film Institute and computer-chip maker Intel
sponsored a summerlong workshop that paired television production
people with computer-minded mentors to create ``enhanced
television'' shows, and get them on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are excited about the possibilities,'' said Maija
Beeton, AFI's Advanced Technology Program director. ``But I don't
think people understand what it is yet. It's an art form that's
being created.''
</P>
<P>
   PRICEY PROPOSITION &QL; 
Even the most ambitious networks aren't putting on much right now.
That's because the new technology requires them to spend millions
of dollars on equipment, with no ability to charge advertisers more
and with an audience that numbers in the dozens. That's a
crash-and-burn business model rivaled only by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're tucked behind one of the Southland's many hills,
where broadcast signals are lost in perpetual ``shadows,'' forget
about getting a digital cable TV signal.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies are squabbling with networks and the Federal
Communications Commission about whether they should be forced to
carry both the analog and digital signals of broadcasters on their
already crowded dials.
</P>
<P>
   That heavily politicized process still hasn't been worked out,
and its final resolution could cause problems for first-generation
HDTV sets, Schaeffer acknowledged. In the meantime, it's broadcast
or direct satellite for digital.
</P>
<P>
   And the biggest bombshell of all: In 2006, broadcasters are
supposed to turn off their analog transmitters, give up the extra
frequencies they were given by the Federal Communications
Commission and go all digital.
</P>
<P>
   That means you get to give up your old television, too, and go
all digital. That truly is revolutionary.

CURRENT TV SETS HEADED FOR OBSOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ You may not know it, but the television set you
watch tonight is obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it'll work fine for the next several years. But the Federal
Communications Commission wants to toss analog television sets _
the kind you've been watching for probably your entire life _ onto
the ash heap of history.
</P>
<P>
   To help force the issue, the FCC gave the television industry,
and TV watchers, eight years to go digital. In 2006, the FCC said
wants to turn off the transmitters sending signals that current TV
sets understand.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's a total fantasy,'' said Josh Bernoff, a principal
analyst for Forrester Research who follows digital television
issues. ``No one in the industry believes that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because most industry observers think that consumers,
people like you, aren't going to be rushing out to buy
astronomically expensive high-definition television sets any time
soon, especially when there isn't much to watch.
</P>
<P>
   It's something of a chicken-and-egg problem: HDTV prices won't
drop until consumers start buying lots of them. Consumers won't buy
lots of TVs until prices drop and there's lots of cool programming
to watch. Broadcasters won't create lots of cool programming until
there are lots of HDTVs in people's homes. See ya in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sony can get the cost of those receivers down where the
consumer can walk in and buy a set for $500,'' broadcasters will
create the high-definition programming that will draw more
customers in, said Dan Corsini, general manager and vice president
of KCAL-TV (Channel 9). &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LONG ROAD AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Some analyst see the problems facing HDTV as similar to the
difficulties that plagued color TV. First introduced in 1954, it
took until the '60s for both the technical and programming bugs to
be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff and the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association
both estimate that less than half the country will have digital TV
sets by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really think Congress can ask broadcasters to turn off
their signals when more than half the homes aren't digital, you're
pretty naive, Bernoff said. ``It's just a means of putting the
pressure on, that's all. The end of analog is more likely to be
2015.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, today's kickoff of the digital television age brings
some tempting hints of the era to come.
</P>
<P>
   Already, companies such as Thomson Consumer Electronics, which
owns RCA and the upscale ProScan lines, are making the transition.
Thomson just announced it will spend $20 million to convert its
picture tube plant in Indiana to digital production.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft is extremely interested in television's digital
revolution, according to company executives. Microsoft already owns
WebTV _ which inexpensively and simply allows Internet Web sites to
be displayed on a television set _ and has bundled a WebTV-like
video player in Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also wants to provide the software that will run the
coming generation of digital set-top converter boxes. Microsoft's
marketplace muscle and ability to create or buy genre-spanning
technologies may hasten digital
</P>
<P>
   TV's spread.
</P>
<P>
   MAGIC BOX?
</P>
<P>
   The set-top box, once just a simple device to get cable channels
to a television, may in fact become the entertainment center of the
future _ and both quickly and cheaply, Bernoff said.
</P>
<P>
   That machine _ probably costing as little as $150 by 2001 _
could not only bring in HDTV signals but also connect to the
Internet, the home computer and cable provider, play DVD movies and
games, and give access to ``ancillary and supplementary services''
the FCC envisioned in ordering the digital conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Those additional services would be tucked into the spare
bandwidth on broadcasters' frequency and could include such things
as extra channels, CD-quality audio, sports information, computer
software, phone directories, stock-market updates and interactive
educational materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, a broadcaster could transmit a news program
consisting of four separate SDTV programs for local news, national
news, weather and sports, while interrupting that programming with
a single high-definition TV commercial with embedded data about the
product,'' the FCC order says.
</P>
<P>
   The first network program to take advantage of these
possibilities will air next week on PBS, though it won't be shown
here because KCET's digital transmitter isn't running yet.
</P>
<P>
   PBS' Frank Lloyd Wright documentary isn't in high-definition,
but it will include several hundred megabytes of
computer-accessible information about his life and work, including
virtual walk-throughs of his most famous buildings, said PBS
spokeswoman Dara Goldberg. PBS hopes to use such an approach in
many of its programs in the hope that schools in particular will be
able to take advantage of the additional broadcast information to
flesh out students' understanding of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Sports and educational programs, both of which are
information-heavy, are perfect for such enhanced programming,
observers said. But the best stuff probably hasn't been imagined
yet. For that, stay tuned. &QL;

SCHROEDER MEETS BLAIR, PLEDGES NEW ERA OF COOPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In his first official trip abroad, Gerhard Schroeder,
the newly elected German chancellor, met with his political soul
mate, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and promised a new era of
cooperation between Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders engaged in a mutual admiration society at 10
Downing St. during talks on improving relations between their
governments, European integration, the introduction in January of a
single European currency, and the crises in Kosovo and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week before Remembrance Day, when Britons honor those who
were killed fighting Germans in the two world wars, Blair and
Schroeder were a study in harmony. Schroeder even refrained from
criticizing Britain's reluctance to participate in the launch of
the single currency. He diplomatically described Britain's
reservations about monetary union as a ``clever approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Schroeder faced the media in The Durbar Court on King
Charles Street, just a few hundred feet from where Winston
Churchill and his Cabinet plotted strategy to defeat the Nazis
during World War II. But if Churchill had nothing good to say about
Hitler, Blair had nothing bad to say about Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   The only hint of the historic hostilities between the two
countries was a red poppy that Blair wore on his lapel in honor of
British war veterans. Many Britons wear poppies in anticipation of
Remembrance Day.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the left-of-center leaders agreed that their biggest
challenge is to foster competitive, market-based economies while
providing a social welfare system for the less fortunate. They
announced the formation of a task force to recommend ``practical
policies'' to nurture the ``Third Way,'' the term used to describe
the increasing pragmatism of formerly ideological-driven leftist
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both men rose to power by moving their traditionally left-wing
parties toward the center to end lengthy conservative regimes. In
Blair's case, his Labor Party ended an 18-year reign by the
Conservatives, while Schroeder ousted Helmut Kohl, Europe's most
enduring leader, after 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders downplayed the significance when, in the first
days of his administration, Schroeder declined a Blair invitation
extended to him and French premier Lionel Jospin to visit Blair at
the Labor Party conference immediately after Schroeder's Social
Democrats won the German election in September. He visited France
instead, causing many to conclude that Schroeder was more concerned
about easing French fears about a weakened Franco-German
relationship than encouraging a closer Anglo-German axis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cooperation isn't aimed against anyone,'' said Schroeder.
Blair added, ``There's enough room for all sorts of relationships
in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men refused to be drawn into the controversy surrounding
the legal battle to extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet from London to Spain to face charges that he tortured and
killed political opponents during his 17-year regime.
</P>
<P>
   And they voiced strong support for American mediation efforts in
the Middle East and continued pressure on Iraq. Schroeder stressed
that forcing Iraq to comply with weapons monitoring was not ``about
a conflict between Iraq and the United States,'' but of
international concern.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl focused on building the Franco-German axis, in part because
he saw that the British were unenthusiastic about greater European
integration. In contrast, Schroeder's aides say he wants to help
Blair bring Britain deeper into the European Union so that London
can join Paris and Bonn in taking a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation between Germany and Britain ``is excellent,''
Schroeder insisted, ``but we can improve on that.''

LOCALS SLOW TO MAKE THE MOVE

   LOS ANGELES _ OK, so you've plunked down hard cash for a hot new
high-definition TV set, plugged it in, and now you're ready to
drink in gorgeous programming. Well, here's the bad news: There's
not much on right now, though the networks each seem to have picked
a different specialty to produce in high-definition format.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick rundown on what the various Los Angeles
affiliates and their networks plan to show in coming months in
HDTV:
</P>
<P>
   KCBS (Channel 2)/CBS network _ One episode of ``Chicago Hope,''
three NFL football games, including one playoff game Jan. 9 or 10.
No locally originated programming is planned for some time, but the
station began transmitting HDTV Thursday with the space shuttle
launch.
</P>
<P>
   KNBC (Channel 4)/NBC network _ Extensive programming plans,
including ``The Tonight Show'' five nights a week, beginning
sometime in the spring. Other announcements expected soon, probably
of movies and miniseries. Affiliate began digital broadcasting Oct.
24. No locally originated programming planned, but ``upconverting''
all its standard programming to digital in the 1080i format.
</P>
<P>
   KTLA (Channel 5)/WB network _ Began programming Thursday with
the space shuttle launch and related programming. The Rose Parade
and selected Dodger games are planned. No network programming plans
announced, though the WB already provides a digital,
standard-definition signal to affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   KABC (Channel 7)/ABC network _ All ``Wonderful World of Disney''
shows on Sundays and movies of the week on Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   KCAL (Channel 9) _ Will begin transmitting digitally by
Thanksgiving. But other than a translated analog signal, no
immediate plans for locally originated HDTV programming.
</P>
<P>
   KTTV (Channel 11)/Fox network _ Not scheduled to begin
broadcasting in high-definition format until May.
</P>
<P>
   KCOP (Channel 13)/UPN network _ No plans for locally originated
programming. No network programming plans announced, but UPN does
provide a digital signal to affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   KCET (Channel 28)/PBS network _ Readying for locally originated
programming, but transmitter won't be installed until spring. PBS
nationwide will have digital programming kickoff Nov. 9 with
``Chihuli Over Venice'' in HDTV. On Nov. 10 and 11, non-HDTV
documentary on Frank Lloyd Wright will be transmitted with several
hundred megabytes of enhanced digital content.

STATIONS BULK UP OPERATIONS FOR HDTV'S ARRIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ For all the havoc the high-definition television
conversion is creating for consumers, it's making at least as much
of a mess for the stations, networks and production companies that
create what we watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission started the digital
stampede last year when it ordered stations in Los Angeles and
other top 10 markets to begin broadcasting a high-definition TV
signal as well as their standard frequency.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline was next spring, but the FCC also made today a
``voluntary'' startup date for top 10 broadcasters, knowing
competition would do the rest.
</P>
<P>
   KNBC won the race to digital in Los Angeles, turning on its
transmitter on Oct. 24, but it had no sound and looked relatively
poor compared to succeeding stations, such as KTLA and KCBS, which
began HDTV broadcasting digitally in time for Thursday's space
shuttle launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are singularly focused on getting this product on the air
(today),'' said Preston Davis, the vice president for broadcast
operations and engineering for the ABC television network, which
will have Los Angeles' KABC among the dozen affiliates going
digital today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going through hell right now,'' said Frank Geraty, KTLA's
director of broadcast operations and engineering, a few days before
his station turned on its digital transmitter. ``I've got a
high-definition antenna flying in right now, and a tower crew
coming over from NBC when they get done there.''
</P>
<P>
   The stations and networks are spending millions of dollars each
to broadcast digitally. With that process well under way, they face
new challenges, such as how to produce a show.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV's amazing sharpness means there's no way to finesse chintzy
sets, bad makeup, heavily lined faces and inappropriate props,
while scenes have to be framed differently to reflect the screen's
wider aspect ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sets now have to get wider or the cameras have to get
closer,'' said John Gering, a senior partner at HOW International,
an architectural firm with most of the networks as regular clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sets designed for today's technology are designed for how
they're seen on air, and they're very low-budget,'' Gering said.
With HDTV, ``you can't cut corners on costs, so the set designs
have to look more permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   And making a show can take far longer, said John Lindauer, a
Venice-based TV director, whose crew needed more than three months
to finish an effects-laden, 2{-minute HDTV demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Though the results can be eye-popping, especially on a giant
screen, Lindauer said HDTV effects shots take four times longer to
create, complicating production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy for things to look cheap, because HDTV is so
immediate and so real.'' Lindauer said. ``We solved it the
old-fashioned way. We got a good art department and a good
(director of photography).''

`ZORA NEALE HURSTON': REDISCOVERING A WRITER THROUGH HER OWN
WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 (fb) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At first, the claims of the stooped over, clearly
down-and-out old woman in the bus station seem ludicrous. She sets
down her cheap suitcase and declares, ``I was the queen of the
Harlem Renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was. This is Elizabeth Van Dyke as the title character
in ``Zora Neale Hurston: A Theatrical Biography,'' Laurence
Holder's 1990 one-act play now in revival at the American Place
Theater. The production is both a disappointment and a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   When Van Dyke is reciting Hurston's words, she sometimes seems
on fire with feeling and the sheer joy of storytelling. In between,
narrating and acting out the outline of her character's life, she
is much less compelling. Her co-star in this two-actor production,
Joseph Edward, is appealing in multiple roles as all the men in
Hurston's life (including the poet Langston Hughes and the novelist
Richard Wright, who accused her of minstrelsy). But he, too, is at
his best when performing what seem to be Hughes' or Wright's own
words rather than the playwright's.
</P>
<P>
   The life story in question is a sad one. Hurston was a
preacher's daughter from Eatonville, Fla. (``the first town built
and governed by Negroes''), who left home at 14 to work as a maid
for an operetta troupe. With the money she earned, she attended
Howard University. Then it was on to Barnard College in New York,
where she found a Park Avenue patron (an arrangement that Hughes
compared to slavery) and became a prolific folklorist, novelist,
playwright and journalist in the 1920's, a particularly glorious
time for the arts in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   But she was a little too outspoken for some people's tastes,
perhaps ahead of her time in terms of Afrocentricity and black
pride, and her career foundered, as did her marriages. The final
straw was a false criminal accusation of the sexual abuse of a
child. Hurston died, forgotten, in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation of ``Zora Neale Hurston,'' directed by Wynn
Handman, is the overflowing talent of its subject. Devotees will
relish it; readers unfamiliar with her work are likely to be drawn
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Her tale about the balance of power between men and women, taken
from ``Mules and Men,'' a 1935 story collection, is folklore at its
most powerful. In it, Adam asks God for more strength than his
wife, ``so he could whoop her and make her mind.'' To even things
up, Eve asks God for certain keys: to the kitchen, to the bedroom,
to the cradle. Then the Devil, who made her do it, gives one more
piece of advice: ``Now don't go bragging about the keys.'' And from
there, things go downhill for the human race.
</P>
<P>
   Hurston was a wise woman.

CAPUANO SEES EIGHTH DISTRICT RACE AS WIDE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>

   BOSTON _ Looking for an alternative to the governor's race?
There's always the 8th Congressional District race, with a
Democrat, a Republican, an Independent, and a candidate from the
Socialist Workers Party on the ballot vying to succeed Joseph P.
Kennedy II.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so maybe it's not a barn-burner. Somerville Mayor Michael
Capuano, the Democratic nominee, is by most accounts nearly assured
a victory in one of the most heavily Democratic congressional
districts in the country. The real battle was back on Sept. 15,
when Capuano edged out nine other Democrats in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   But anything could happen. Capuano faces opposition from J.
Philip Hyde, a Republican who ran for the seat two years ago,
against Kennedy; Independent Anthony Schinella, who ran for Boston
City Council last year; and Andrea Morell.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who is an advocate of ``time-sizing,'' or paying people
for a 40-hour work week but having them work a 30-hour week,
coupled with better use of technology in the workplace, said he
garnered more votes in his 1996 race against Kennedy than Capuano
received in the Sept. 15 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen,'' Hyde said. ``I'm more Democratic than
the Democrat. Here we've got a machine Democrat against a reform
Republican. And I think black voters might be looking for an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Schinella said his candidacy was an effort to talk about
``issues a lot of people I know think are important,'' such as the
future of Social Security, NAFTA, military spending, campaign
finance reform, and corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how we're going to do. I think people might be
surprised, with the low turnout, and the Democratic nominee closing
up shop on Sept. 16,'' said Schinella. ``We've been actively
campaigning. For me, a victory would be anything over 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Schinella said he was disappointed by the lack of coverage of
the 8th District race after the Democratic primary. ``This is not
about viability,'' he said. ``A lot of people talk about opening up
the process, talking about issues. We ran that type of race from
day one, and we were ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Capuano is taking nothing for granted, though he
said ``if this isn't a safe Democratic seat, I don't know what is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we know we won with 25 percent. So we've been reaching
out, to all the people in the last race who couldn't vote for us.
We respect that. But it's my job to reach out to them and say, I
represent 100 percent of the people in this district,'' the
five-term Somerville mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano said the feedback has been good. ``In the primary, very
few people went out to vote against anybody. People went out to
vote for their candidates. That makes it easy to build bridges.
I've seen very little animosity. It's been very cordial.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he like to collect a certain number of votes to be sent to
Washington with a mandate? Capuano says no. ``I just want to get
one more vote than the other guy,'' he said. ``Unless I get 100
percent of the vote. That's one heck of a mandate.''

SPECIAL EFFECTS AT SEA AND ELSEWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been wondering how the vaunted special effects of
``Titanic'' were produced, Tuesday night's ``Nova'' should satisfy
your curiosity. As one of the assembled whizzes observes, ``The art
of visual effects is the art of what you can get away with.''
</P>
<P>
   And given the advent of supercomputers, movie makers these days
can get away with almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   The hour reminds us of Cecil B. DeMille's parting of the Red Sea
(a couple of slabs of Jell-O), the 18-inch-tall King Kong who
terrorized New York City and the three-foot-high flying house that
swirled through ``The Wizard of Oz.'' All relied on the brain to
process what the eye thought it saw.
</P>
<P>
   Most attention is given to ``Titanic,'' whose 11 Academy Awards
included one for best visual effects. There was the 700-foot model
of a ship that could not sail, and the 45-foot model that could.
</P>
<P>
   See how illusions of disaster were created by little ships
sitting in a bathtub while actors did their stuff on a studio set.
To the audience's eye, the movements look all of a piece.
</P>
<P>
   Using images shifted around by computer, an action movie like
``The X-Files'' agitated the screen with what seems to be an
exploding skyscraper. And ``Jurassic Park'' turned out dinosaurs
that seemed as real as the actors they swept past.
</P>
<P>
   What looked like hundreds of humans going down with the Titanic
were digital creations whose movements were performed by fewer than
20 live actors.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the narrator's promise of a totally computer-generated
cinema is within reach or much to be desired you can decide, but
unlike the usual secrets of magic tricks, these revelations of how
they fool us enhance the effects. It's a high-tech hour of show and
tell. &QL;
</P>
<P>

   Written by Bill Lattanzi and Susanne Simpson; Susanne Simpson,
senior producer; Bill Lattanzi, producer; Kelly Tyler, co-producer.
A Nova production by the WGBH/Boston Science Unit in association
with the BBC and Sveriges Television.
</P>
<P>
   Special effects also figure in Wednesday night's close-up of the
making of an award-winning episode of NBC's ``Homicide: Life on the
Street,'' known in the trade as ``the best show viewers aren't
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Titanic'' went in for big effects, ``Subway,'' which was
originally broadcast last December, met the squeezed-in challenges
of a 40-minute drama about a man trapped in a Baltimore subway car.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds less like a crowd-pleaser than a critic-pleaser,
such is the boast of the program, which is not known for equaling
the ratings of rivals like ABC's ``20/20'' and CBS's ``Nash
Bridges.'' Tuesday night's report probes the pressures of turning
out a series that is grittier than the usual commercial fare yet
has managed to survive for six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's a testy collaboration between corporate managers trying to
hold onto an audience, and producers, writers, directors and
photographers trying to stretch the limits of the police-drama
formula. Tuesday night's example suggests that all parties are
remarkably accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   This peek at how the elements of ``Subway'' were put together is
followed by the complete show that viewers saw when it was
originally broadcast, except that this time around they are spared
the commercials. &QL;

   BOSTON _ Deborah Eappen's lawyers could not put a price tag on
her son's life, though they tried, asking for ``several million
dollars'' from the au pair who killed him and listing cases where
juries had compensated parents for the deaths of their children.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a mother's aching words, included in court papers
filed in federal court Monday, that made it clear why the loss of
eight-month-old Matthew could not be quantified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattie will have no resume, no diploma, no trophies, no wife
and children, no science fair project,'' his mother wrote in a
five-page statement to US District Judge William G. Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him take his first steps, have his first day of
school. I miss what should have been. ... I miss that I never heard
Mattie say, `I love you, Mom.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sunil and Deborah Eappen have already won their wrongful death
suit against British au pair Louise Woodward by default, after
Woodward said she could not afford a lawyer to the fight the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing Monday in US District Court, the attorneys for the
Eappens _ Fredric L. Ellis, Edward D. Rapacki and Edward A.
Broderick of Boston and Edward C. Bassett Jr. of Worcester _ were
supposed to suggest how much money they believe Young should award
the couple. He is expected to rule by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's court filing does not seek a specific amount in
damages, it does estimate what Matthew could have been expected to
earn in his lifetime: between $1.18 million and $1.67 million. The
lower figure is based on his choosing a profession such as law,
engineering or accounting, the higher on joining his parents and
paternal grandfather in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, whatever damages Young ultimately awards the Eappens may
prove to be a hollow victory, since the judge has already noted
that Woodward appears to have no assets ``of any significant
size.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has already issued an order prohibiting Woodward from
spending any money she receives for selling her story, which she
and her family have insisted she does not intend to do. Meanwhile,
investigators here and abroad are probing expenditures from the
$500,000 legal defense fund set up in England to pay Woodward's
legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens have said they filed the wrongful death suit to
prevent Woodward from profiting from the death of Matthew. The
couple plans to donate any money they may get to a foundation
they've established to prevent child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In the court filing, the Eappens' lawyers also point to a
half-dozen jury verdicts this decade in wrongful death suits
involving children 10 or younger. In four of the cases, the
plaintiffs were awarded $2 million or more in compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a Superior Court jury in October 1990 awarded $2.75
million in compensatory damages to the parents of an 8-month-old
baby who was killed in a fall from a walker.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens' lawyers are seeking an equal amount in compensatory
and punitive damages, requesting ``several million dollars'' in
each category.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis has said that it is unclear whether any award would be
collectible in England but having a judge, rather than a jury,
determine damages may improve the chances because British judges
may view a judge's award more favorably.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 Woodward was convicted of second-degree
murder and sentenced to life in prison. Superior Court Judge Hiller
Zobel later reduced the charge to manslaughter and sentenced
Woodward to time already served, 279 days. She returned home to
England in June after the state Supreme Judicial Court upheld
Zobel's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Monday that the number of British
au pairs in the United States has fallen drastically in the wake of
Woodward's trial and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures provided by the newspaper from au pair
agencies here and in Britain, about 400 British au pairs will be
placed in homes in the United States this year, down from 1,500 in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies told the newspaper that many young British women are
fearful of applying for US positions because of the way Woodward
was treated by the American legal system.

MORRISETTE'S `SUPPOSED' CD GETS MIGHTY PERSONAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 1/2 STARS 
BY FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No matter how bad things get, you can always
console yourself with the fact that at least you're not one of
Alanis Morissette's ex-lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Because this time, the patron saint of female anger is naming
names.
</P>
<P>
   On her new album, ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' _ how's
that for a nifty title, kids? _ lyrics are therapy, and Alanis is
back on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   This is one wordy record. Apparently written under the influence
of the complete works of Hermann Hesse, ``Autobiography of a Yogi''
and ``I'm OK, You're OK,'' plus other examples of Goa beach reading
circa 1974, the disc does go on a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Lines like, ``Just the other day my sweet daughter I was driving
past 203 I walked up the stairs in my mind's eye/I remember how
they would creak loudly,'' seem more like rambling diary jottings
than pop lyrics, partly because there are so few, if any, rhymes
here.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, though, ``Infatuation Junkie'' is a winner. Once
again working with co-producer Glen Ballard at his Encino home
studio, Morissette pulls out the stops in some impressive vocal
performances, particularly on the album's first single and video,
``Thank U,'' as well as ``Baba,'' ``Are You Still Mad,'' ``Can't
Not'' and ``Would Not Come.''
</P>
<P>
   The tunes are definitely there, matching the fresh appeal of the
best-selling ``Jagged Little Pill,'' while radio will have plenty
to choose from among these 17 tracks, generally built by Ballard
from the ground up with genuine pop savvy.
</P>
<P>
   And while you could say Morissette has mellowed a bit since the
raw rage of her breakthrough single, ``You Oughta Know,'' she
remembers what those guys from the past have done to her.
</P>
<P>
   Just be thankful you're not Matthew, Jonathan, Terrance, Marcus,
Lou (all named in ``Unsent'') or the fellas in ``Are You Still
Mad'' and ``Sympathetic Character.''

TIDE OF TRAFFIC IN BEIJING TURNS AGAINST THE SELF-PROPELLED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Every day this city's wide boulevards are marred by a
million ugly battles between ``gas vehicles,'' as cars are called
in Chinese, and ``self-propelled vehicles'' _ a k a bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Although sturdy bicycles remain the primary transportation for
the vast majority of Beijingers, their powerful gas-guzzling
cousins have been multiplying rapidly, literally edging cyclists
off the road.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of cyclists who once dominated the streets have
long since been corralled into bike lanes, where they move like
slow-flowing rivers beside every road.
</P>
<P>
   But even these reserved lanes are not sacred anymore, their flow
constantly interrupted by impatient drivers darting in to avoid the
city's endless traffic jams, scattering cyclists to and fro. At
traffic circles and when crossing streets, the once reigning
cyclists haplessly pick their way across four lanes of buses and
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seemed jarring last week when the inevitable occurred:
To improve traffic flow, the Beijing city government for the first
time declared a street to be a ``no-bike'' zone, claiming its bike
lanes for cars.
</P>
<P>
   With little fanfare, the police planted signs at either end of a
short but notoriously gridlocked street called Xisidong Avenue,
bearing a black bicycle in a red circle slashed out by a red
diagonal line. They put up chalkboards explaining the ban.
</P>
<P>
   And the nondescript four-lane road _ home to restaurants, small
stores and (perhaps significantly) the local traffic police _ took
on historic significance: the site where China cast its vote with a
motorized future, and cast off the vehicle of the masses. More
streets are to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't heard about it until now, and it's a pain for me,''
Gao Xiaohui, 21, said as he pushed his only vehicle, a silver
mountain bike, along the sidewalk toward a movie theater, days
after the ban. ``But traffic was really bad here before _ there are
so many cars _ I guess it had to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in a city of more than 13 million people, where
bicycles outnumber the 1.2 million cars by well over 5-to-1, and on
a street where 6,000 bikes used to pass each hour at peak times,
the will of the people is not easily overcome. And, late last week,
it took a small army of police and government volunteers to enforce
the new rules, playing cat-and-mouse with the steady trickle of
bicyclists who sneaked in.
</P>
<P>
   At each end of the street, a government worker with an armband
and loudspeaker implored bike riders to get off and walk, or take
alternate routes. A uniformed policemen stood 15 yards back,
intercepting those who pedaled through and insisting they dismount.
</P>
<P>
   Thus caught, a number of cyclists like Ren Bo, a middle-aged lab
technician, obligingly pushed their bikes a few yards, looked over
a shoulder, and hopped back on _ only to be intercepted by the next
volunteer some 50 yards down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very inconvenient for me _ I'm in pain and on my way home
from the dentist,'' Ms. Ren said, displaying a smile lopsided by
novocaine as she half-walked, half-pedaled her way down the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they close more streets, I'll have to start finding new
routes,'' she said, again checking, then pedaling on.
</P>
<P>
   Store owners whose business has fallen off were less
philosophical about the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a waste of police manpower,'' said Lin Yinai,
manager of a small cluttered advertising design shop. ``I've had no
new clients all week. This is a city of bicycles. Customers won't
come to a place they can't ride to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Others opined that Xisidong Avenue was chosen as a testing
ground because it is a route favored by officials and the police,
who were often stuck for half an hour on the 1,000-foot-long
street. Now, the flow of traffic is much improved
</P>
<P>
   Though a number of cyclists were unhappy with the ban, their
discomfort certainly came more from the heart than the brain, since
there are parallel roads on either side of Xisidong Avenue that
still permit arcane self-propelled vehicles to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are mourning not the closing of a favorite route
home, but rather the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not too bad, you can always take another route,''
said A. Fanti, 20, manager of a nearby Muslim restaurant. He said
that until the ban he rode his sturdy black bike along Xisidong
Avenue every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``cars are the future.''

 &HT;    A RELUCTANT GATES COMES TO COURT _ ON TAPE
 &HT;    660&AMP;insert. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Appearing Monday in videotaped testimony as a
hostile government witness, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates
repeatedly denied knowing of key internal documents that seemingly
implicated him in the company's bid to use its Windows monopoly to
divide markets and crush competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Halting from time to time the showing of the tape, Justice
Department lead prosecutor David Boies contrasted Gates's memory
lapses and vague replies in his 20-hour August deposition with
sharply worded directives to key executives that ordered them to do
whatever it took for Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser to
dominate personal computer desktops.
</P>
<P>
   The constantly argumentative and frequently forgetful Gates
shown on a 10-foot courtroom screen bore scant resemblance to his
public image, that of an enthusiastic super-salesman with a $60
billion personal fortune who over 23 years saw Microsoft crowned as
king of the software jungle.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Gates, seated in a large leather chair and sipping
from a soft drink can, rocked back and forth whenever he was irked
by Boies's polite but insistent questions. By turns evasive and
defiant, Gates often would hesitate and scratch the back of his
head before giving a snappish reply.
</P>
<P>
   The hour-long excerpt played in the landmark antitrust case
focused largely on Gates's role in August 1997 in striking a broad
deal with Apple Computer, then on the financial ropes, as well as
on a key 1995 meeting between Microsoft and Netscape executives,
then and now fierce competitors in the browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors sought to use the Gates tape to buttress charges by
their next live witness, Apple senior vice president Avadis
Tevanian, who has accused Microsoft of using its dominance in
computer applications and operating systems to force Apple to dance
to Microsoft's tune.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyers spent much of the morning session in a bench
conference with U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in a
vain bid to keep the trust-busters from releasing the Gates
excerpts played in court to the nation's TV screens.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing the government's tactics, Microsoft lawyer William
Neukom, said: ``The government is resorting to an edited videotape
instead of actually calling Bill Gates as a witness. This is ...a
gimmick to get snippets in the headlines rather than get at the
facts pertinent to this lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft branded the playing of the tapes a personal attack on
Gates and an attempt to shift the focus from ``some very serious
hits over the last few weeks'' directed at the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly an attempt to sensationalize the case and
distract people's attention from the weakness of the government's
case,'' Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the exchanges in the deposition was one based on an
Aug. 21, 1997, memo that purportedly quoted Gates as giving
marching orders with respect to Apple's use of Microsoft browsing
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's top priority is for us to get the browser in the
October OS (operating system) release from Apple. We should do
whatever it takes to make this happen. If we are getting shut out,
we should escalate to Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The internal memo, based on ``conversations with billg last
nite(cq),'' also said: ``Bill was clear that his goal here is to
keep Apple and Sun (Microsystems, a Microsoft competitor,) split.
He doesn't care that much about being aligned with Apple, he just
wants them split from other potential allies.''
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Boies asked Gates: ``Do you recall conveying to
your executive staff in or about August of 1997 that your top
priority was to get Microsoft's browser in the October OS release
from Apple?''
</P>
<P>
   Gates: ``No, I don't recall that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, Boies asked Gates whether he recalled telling the same
key staffers that ``your whole goal with respect to Apple related
to (Sun's) Java's runtime (technology) was to keep Apple and Sun
split?
</P>
<P>
   Gates: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies also cited several e-mails in which Gates hears of threats
to halt work on an updated version of Microsoft's Office business
software for Macintosh computers unless Apple toed the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest
bargaining point we have, as doing so will do a great deal of harm
to Apple immediately. I also believe that Apple is taking this
threat pretty seriously,'' one Microsoft executive wrote to Gates
in a June 27, 1997, missive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another message to Gates, dated Feb. 13, 1998, said: ``Mac
Office is the perfect club to use on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Boies asked Gates whether he recalled being told about
the bargaining chip plan, Gates said evasively: ``Well, I know that
Apple would prefer that we have a more updated version of Mac
Office, that that would be a positive thing for them.''

   Typical of the exchanges in the deposition was one based on an
Aug. 21, 1997, memo that purportedly quoted Gates as giving
marching orders with respect to Apple's use of Microsoft browsing
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's top priority is for us to get the browser in the
October OS (operating system) release from Apple. We should do
whatever it takes to make this happen. If we are getting shut out,
we should escalate to Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The internal memo, based on ``conversations with billg last
nite(cq),'' also said: ``Bill was clear that his goal here is to
keep Apple and Sun (Microsystems, a Microsoft competitor,) split.
He doesn't care that much about being aligned with Apple, he just
wants them split from other potential allies.''
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Boies asked Gates: ``Do you recall conveying to
your executive staff in or about August of 1997 that your top
priority was to get Microsoft's browser in the October OS release
from Apple?''
</P>
<P>
   Gates: ``No, I don't recall that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, Boies asked Gates whether he recalled telling the same
key staffers that ``your whole goal with respect to Apple related
to (Sun's) Java's runtime (technology) was to keep Apple and Sun
split?
</P>
<P>
   Gates: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies also cited several e-mails in which Gates hears of threats
to halt work on an updated version of Microsoft's Office business
software for Macintosh computers unless Apple toed the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest
bargaining point we have, as doing so will do a great deal of harm
to Apple immediately. I also believe that Apple is taking this
threat pretty seriously,'' one Microsoft executive wrote to Gates
in a June 27, 1997, missive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another message to Gates, dated Feb. 13, 1998, said: ``Mac
Office is the perfect club to use on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Boies asked Gates whether he recalled being told about
the bargaining chip plan, Gates said evasively: ``Well, I know that
Apple would prefer that we have a more updated version of Mac
Office, that that would be a positive thing for them.''

   OTTAWA, Ill. _ Since casting a ballot for Harry Truman in 1948,
Harold Hiles, a World War II veteran, has always deemed it an honor
and a duty to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But on this Election Day, he is staying home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't want any part of it,'' said Hiles, 76, over a piece of
apple pie on Sunday morning, as church bells pealed in this small
Midwestern city. ``Clinton, Starr, the whole bunch of them. Who do
you believe anymore? Who can you respect? People are just losing
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the handicapping about the races between Democrats and
Republicans on Tuesday, there is little doubt what a majority of
Americans will effectively choose: none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   It is a virtual certainty that fewer than half of all eligible
voters will visit the polls on Tuesday; some political analysts say
the number could plummet to about one-third.
</P>
<P>
   While grousing about politicians is a time-honored American
tradition, would-have-been-voters say this campaign season has
wallowed in far more than the usual level of muck _ vicious
name-calling, transparent pandering and, of course, the lascivious
details about President Clinton's sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like politics are spinning out of control,''
said Jerry Hanck, a 60-year-old liquor salesman, who will sit out
the election. ``There are bad actors on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in this old river town 140 years ago that 10,000 people
turned out at Washington Square for the first debate between
Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, a discussion that focused on
constitutional principles and the most fundamental of human rights.
It does not escape notice here that the last national election of
the 20th Century seems to be driven by sound bites, attack ads and
sex talk that brings an embarrassed blush even to a crusty old Navy
man like Hiles.
</P>
<P>
   But gauging the sensibilities of voters, especially when it
comes to Clinton's affair with a former White House intern, is a
tricky business.
</P>
<P>
   Hiles, a retired factory-glass union member, would surely fall
in the approval column on the president's job rating. ``He's been a
wonderful president,'' Hiles said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Hiles said he will boycott the ballot box on Tuesday
largely because he disapproves of Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, and the president's failure to tell the whole
truth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sentiment that surfaced frequently among nonvoters,
mostly among Democrats. These were not people who intended to bolt
to the Republican side. They had simply become dispirited.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats just feel kind of embarrassed right now,'' said
Connie Jolley, 29, a restaurant manager. Ms. Jolley, who described
herself as ``a majorly Democratic'' voter in most years, plans to
go to the polls on Tuesday, but only to vote on a local referendum.
</P>
<P>
   She intends to skip the races for governor, Senate and the
House, saying that she could not bring herself to vote for the
Republicans, but did not believe the Democrats had earned her vote.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to voters, nonvoters are younger, less educated, have
lower incomes and tend to support Democratic candidates for the
House of Representatives, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, taken Oct. 26 to 28, found that 32 percent of
nonvoters are under age 30, compared with just 13 percent of
voters. Nearly two-thirds of nonvoters have never attended college,
whereas 43 percent of voters have not attended college. Forty
percent of nonvoters have households incomes of less than $30,000 a
year, compared to 24 percent of likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of preferences for the House of Representatives races,
49 percent of nonvoters favor Democratic candidates and 27 percent
favor Republicans. The likely voters, meanwhile, were evenly split
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Congressional District here, which sweeps north and
east across Illinois farmland to the industrial city of Joliet, has
swung between Democrats and Republicans. It last changed parties in
1994, when Jerry Weller, a Republican, took office. Weller is
widely expected to win re-election against his Democratic opponent,
Gary Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like, `What's the sense?''' said Mike Malles, a
33-year-old house painter, who skipped past the political news in
the Sunday newspaper, and read the movie reviews. ``The noise is
just too loud. There's so much hype. A lot of people just want to
pull back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudslinging and scandal are surely not the only things keeping
voters from the polls. Many people say they simply do not find
politics interesting enough to spend much time dwelling on the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   When Melissa Reynolds, a 19-year-old college student, asked,
``What are we voting for?'' she was not posing a rhetorical
question.
</P>
<P>
   She was unaware that Tuesday was Election Day. ``I don't get
into that stuff,'' said Miss Reynolds, who plans to become a
grammar school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy in relatively good shape, many Americans have
taken a fairly pacific view of political affairs, not motivated
enough to demand sharp change. Others simply see the actions of
political leaders as increasingly irrelevant to their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dedra Phillips, who works as a quality analyst for a cookie
company, said she was enjoying some prosperity these days. But she
said politicians should leave her alone. And she plans to do them
the same favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are good for me because I make them that way,'' said Ms.
Phillips, 28, who pushed a stroller that held her two young
children. ``It has nothing to do with politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Harden, a 33-year-old custodian, said she would stay away
from the polls as a gesture of protest against politicians who she
claimed operated on a different standard than ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they're better than the people who pay their
salaries,'' said Ms. Harden, as she walked through a parking lot to
the Wal-Mart store. ``The only time you ever see them is at parade
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Harnisch, a 47-year-old teacher at a corrections facility,
said she would skip the voting booth because politicians had
skipped the issues most relevant to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wasting time on this investigation _ censure him,
throw him out, let him go, whatever _ but let's get on with it,''
said Ms. Harnisch, who usually splits her ticket.
</P>
<P>
   She blamed Republicans for dwelling on the Starr investigation,
but said the president, by his example, ``has made it much harder
for the average person who wants to go out and do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, she said, she was annoyed by
politicians who dwell on ``hot-button'' issues like gun control and
abortion, while ignoring the complicated matters that come up in
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they talk about things that hit home _ medical
expenses, credit card debt, men who don't pay child support,'' said
Ms. Harnisch. ``I'm not voting because it just doesn't seem to get
through to them.''

`DEATH OF A SALESMAN': A DARK NEW PRODUCTION ILLUMINATES WILLY
LOMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The darkness is always waiting for Willy Loman. It
laps away at the edges of even his sunniest memories. It clouds his
vision to the point that he cannot trust himself to drive. It keeps
pulling him back, with gravitational force, whenever hopes, however
small, are rekindled. The darkness terrifies Willy. You can sense
that in the lost, panicked expression that abruptly takes over his
face. But there is never any doubt that he is going to surrender to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness is the primary element of the director Robert Falls'
exquisitely reimagined staging of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a
Salesman,'' which stars Brian Dennehy and Elizabeth Franz in the
performances of their careers and runs at the Goodman Theater here
through Nov. 7. The sad Brooklyn household in Miller's benchmark
study of an American loser seems more fragile than ever, and its
individual characters even lonelier.
</P>
<P>
   The production's set and lighting designers, Mark Wendland and
Michael Philippi respectively, have created a sense of engulfing
night that evokes William Styron's notion of emotional depression
as ``darkness visible.'' Many of the evening's individual scenes
are presented in wan pools of light that stake only tentative
claims against the blue-tinged shadows behind them. Moreover,
nothing seems fixed. Entire rooms glide into and out of focus,
creating sudden gulfs between people who an instant before were
standing side by side.
</P>
<P>
   When Dennehy's Willy famously declares that he is feeling ``kind
of temporary'' about himself, you understand him not as a
sympathetic outsider but as someone who sees what Willy sees.
Miller had once considered titling this, his greatest play,
``Inside His Head.'' Falls' production comes closer than any I have
witnessed in taking us into just that place.
</P>
<P>
   In February, it will have been 50 years since ``Death of a
Salesman'' first opened on Broadway, with its immortal cry for
attention for the failures in a country that worships success.
Though Miller's own reputation may have fluctuated in the
succeeding years, the place of ``Salesman'' as a dramatic
masterpiece has remained secure. Yet to return to it is always to
discover how much richer and bigger the play is than you remembered
it.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, to revisit ``Salesman,'' and particularly this
``Salesman,'' is to realize that the work doesn't match its popular
perception as a naturalistic social drama. As recent Miller
scholarship has suggested again and again, the play's images and
rhythms have the patterns of poetry, as well as that discipline's
reach for the small detail that sets off ever-widening echoes. Take
another look at the opening stage directions for the play, which
describe the setting as having the air of ``a dream rising out of
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has said that Willy is best understood as ``a figure in a
poem.'' In a notebook entry about ``Salesman,'' he wrote, ``Life is
formless. ... Its interconnections are concealed by lapses of time,
by events occurring in separated places, by the hiatus of memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The description might be a blueprint for Falls' interpretation.
The first words spoken in the play, those of Willy's wife, Linda
(Franz), calling her husband's name, are surreally amplified, as
though emerging from another dimension. This idea is underscored by
the framing of Ms. Franz in a dusky, diagonal shaft of light, while
Dennehy stands below her, salesman's sample case in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is of a sensation that sometimes surfaces in dreams,
of returning home and discovering you don't really know where you
are. Throughout the evening, Wendland's miraculously fluid settings
keep shifting. Your sense of something as basic as the location of
the Lomans' kitchen is consistently sabotaged. The only rules of
geography belong to the mind of Willy, a man for whom nothing feels
certain or fixed.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds forbiddingly abstract, rest assured that the
actors here keep you grounded in a heartbreaking emotional reality.
Those whose last exposure to Willy came with Dustin Hoffman's
memorably scrappy bantamweight of 1984 will be shocked at first by
the presence of Dennehy, a man of truly monumental proportions that
make Lee J. Cobb, who created the role, look puny. Yet it is clear
from the first instant that this Willy not only doesn't know his
own strength, he is also incapable of using it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The production plays hauntingly on the contrast between
Dennehy's imposing frame and the sad, scared gestures of a sickly
child. When Willy shields his face with his hands, palms outward,
during an argument with his son Biff (Kevin Anderson), the effect
is devastating in a way it wouldn't be with a physically slighter
actor. The image of a big man made small perfectly embodies the
argument for ``Salesman'' as a bona fide tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy's stunningly disciplined performance is also sure to set
off tremors in anyone who has known depression or lived with
someone who suffers from it. When Linda says, ``A terrible thing is
happening to him,'' it doesn't seem like hyperbole. Just watch how
he works himself up to a pitch of confident bluster and then
deflates in a single instant, as though forced to remember that
life has never kept its promises.
</P>
<P>
   Gestures of assurance turn into signs of defeat and
disorientation for Willy: an angrily raised fist is abruptly turned
toward his own face; a wagging finger is brought nervously to his
lips. Such moments match the governing rhythms of Falls'
production, in which every self-contained vignette, even those
showing Willy's memories of happier times, slides into sourness.
</P>
<P>
   In Franz's superb portrait of Linda, which finds the aggression
in a traditionally passive character, Willy's wife is the sole
defense against his slide into the abyss, a one-woman rescue squad
destined to fail. She keeps talking quietly to her husband, her
head nodding in gentle affirmation, in a litany of supportive
statements and domestic reminders, with startling glimmers of a
physicality that suggests a warm and enduring sexual relationship.
When she sings soothingly to him in bed at the end of the first
act, you realize that in effect that's what she's been doing all
along.
</P>
<P>
   You also see the raw fear in her eyes when Willie's mind starts
to wander. Linda's anger at the callousness of Willy's sons, Biff
and Happy (Ted Koch), isn't just the defensiveness of a loyal,
protective wife. There's the self-interest here, too, of a woman
staving off threats to the only world she knows.
</P>
<P>
   As Biff, Anderson brings extraordinary conviction to the idea of
a man struggling not to become his father and losing the battle.
(Though the actors look nothing alike, there are moments when
Dennehy's face seems to loom from beneath Anderson's.) This actor
is irritatingly unfocused when playing the football hero Biff of
the flashbacks. But he is so strong is his big confrontational
scenes with Dennehy that you forgive his weaknesses and even his
inappropriate folk-singer hair.
</P>
<P>
   Koch's Happy is just about perfect, a self-deluding, aging boy
who is fast reaching the twilight of his sexual attractiveness.
Howard Witt, as Willy's patient, wisecracking neighbor, nicely
blends his character's brusqueness and compassion. Allen Hamilton
is fine as the rich and pontificating Ben, Willy's Horatio
Alger-ish brother, and the subjective framework of this production
makes the character's symbolical weight seem less strained.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the smaller roles come close to cartoonishness, and,
in a play that flows so naturally between the real and the surreal,
the memory scenes have an unexpectedly awkward quality. For the
most part, Falls maintains a remarkable balance between poetic
abstraction and domestic specificity, but there are moments,
especially toward the end, where the staging could be tighter.
</P>
<P>
   These are small objections, however, about a production that
achieves something rare and splendid in the theater: an
interpretation that rejuvenates a familiar classic without ever
betraying its soul. Playgoers whose memories of ``Death of a
Salesman'' are tainted by the ennui of high school English classes
are sure to be shocked by the ways this version disturbs and stirs.
</P>
<P>
   The production, rumor has it, is bound for New York next year.
It is hard to imagine a better way to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of a play that, so unlike its hero, seems only to grow
larger with age.

AIKMAN WANTS TO PLAY FIVE MORE YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Once and for all, allow Troy Aikman to set the
record ``straight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the stuff about me supposedly being gay, and it's
tough to take,'' he says of the inaccurate-yet-persistent rumors
recycling in Metroplex comedy clubs and office cubicles. ``It
bothers me not only because it's not true, but it also goes against
my beliefs. You'd like to have a thick skin and let it roll off
you, but it's hurtful. I hate to have to defend myself on something
like that, but it's just plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   With his heterosexuality secure and his collarbone all but
healed, the Cowboys' silver-and-blue-chip quarterback was to make
his prime-time return Monday night as confident and as appreciative
as ever about his life, love and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tumultuous year in which he has endured a cancerous
mole, his parents' separation, a strained relationship with former
coach Barry Switzer, a fire in his new house and the cracked
clavicle, Aikman said he is determined to win a fourth Super Bowl,
inspired to play another five years and rejuvenated, in part, by
his recent status as a one-woman man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we're very steady,'' he said of his girlfriend.
``It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Said long-snapper and close friend Dale Hellestrae, ``He's as
happy as he's been in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fabulous is his health. Despite wearing extra ``channel''
cushioning in his left shoulder pad, Aikman and the 4-3 Cowboys
realize another awkward fall like the one Sept. 13 against the
Denver Broncos will likely end his season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is risk,'' said trainer Jim Maurer. ``But he's not going
to re-break it unless he falls on it the same way again. If that
happens, in all likelihood, he's done for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there will be fewer seven-step drops, rare rollouts and
strong suggestions to not kamikaze interception returners, there
are few concessions to the game plan. In typical rawhide-tough
fashion, Aikman said only ``subconsciously'' will he protect his
left arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I \Rsay anything\S it will be a general thing in passing,''
said coach Chan Gailey. ``He's been down this road before. He knows
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this isn't Troy's first rodeo. But what if it's
his last?
</P>
<P>
   Troy Kenneth Aikman _ the man owner Jerry Jones calls ``the most
important person in our organization'' _ is sneaking up on 32
years, 30,000 yards passing and 1,000 MRIs. A wide-ranging
appreciation of Aikman's career and a peak at his mental and
physical state as he returns onto the field and closer to Canton:
</P>
<P>
   The Injuries
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Frankensteinian scars, technicolor bruises and
cranky back, Aikman said his warranty is safe because the parts
aren't yet wearing out.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he wears more padding than John Glenn, sometimes walks
like Quasimoto and can't come close to touching his toes, but 252
career sacks behind an offensive line that used to be made up of
guys now waiting tables will do that. He still remembers his first
broken bone (left arm as a 10-year-old linebacker in Cerritos,
Calif.), almost all of the 40 stitches in his chin (''Now I've got
a turbo-strap'') and scratching his cornea by wearing his contacts
in the wrong eye during Super Bowl XXVIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day goes by that I'm not reminded I had back surgery,''
said Aikman, who underwent surgery to repair a herniated disk in
June 1993. ``Some mornings it's tight and just never loosens up.
It's the scariest because it's the only thing that won't fix
itself. Other than that, I feel pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that 11-sack mauling against the Eagles in '89, his leg
bending like an accordion against the Redskins in 1991 and that hit
by the Cardinals' Anthony Bell in '89 that sent blood spewing out
his left ear, Aikman said he feels good enough to play out this
contract (through 2001) and another.
</P>
<P>
   Before the collarbone, he had made 58 consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I feel as good as when I was in my 20s because
the hits have taken their toll,'' said Aikman. ``But I take much
better care of myself. I run four to five times a week, something I
never did early on. I used to think 10 \Rseasons\S was the magic
number, but I'm so encouraged by guys like John Elway, Dan Marino
and Warren Moon. They're still growing strong, and I've got six or
seven years on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Maurer: ``He's probably not as beaten up as you think.
There's nothing physically to limit him from playing another five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Style
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, a self-proclaimed ``grunt,'' is as slow as the last day
of school and as mobile as a mailbox. Few passers in NFL history,
however, have combined his zip and precision.
</P>
<P>
   A flop at the Improv, No. 8's 15-yard post is unchallenged and
he has the unique ability to consistently launch lasers through a
window as small as the drive-thru at Wendy's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our `oomph','' said receiver Michael Irvin. ``There's no
one who's ever played this game that I'd rather be catching balls
from. No one.''
</P>
<P>
   With piercing blue eyes, rugged good looks and a jerky-tough
mentality, the guy friends and teammates call ``8-ball,'' ``T-Roy''
or just ``Roy'' is as big (6-foot-4, 220 pounds) and precise
(third-most accurate passer in NFL history at 62 percent) as Big
Ben.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career playing with receivers who disappeared
faster than David Copperfield assistants, Aikman painted his
self-image and grabbed 42 Cowboys passing records by standing
patiently in the pocket and picking apart secondaries like a
vegetarian sorting through beef stew.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he needs is time \Rto throw,\S'' said Irvin. ``He's got
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maturity
</P>
<P>
   Like he has done since he was 2, Aikman still eats Lucky Charms
for breakfast. He has, however, done some serious growing up in his
10 years with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do quite the running around like we used to do, and
he's cut out the junk food,'' says long-time close friend Doug
Kline. ``He's grown up, but his ego hasn't. He's still a Mr.
Humble, but a darn strong, driven one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, he was a guy taking a swing at an obnoxious fan in
1989 and leaving the Pro Bowl at halftime in '92. Now, he has the
ability to overcome the loss of close friends and former teammates
like Kevin Gogan and Jay Novacek and who last off-season
optimistically dealt with seemingly negative news involving his
family, residence and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been anything but a tough year,'' he says. ``Each was an
isolated incident. Instead of feeling sorry for myself, I was able
to see the positives. Like the fact that no one was injured in the
fire and we caught the cancer early. There's been some tough things
to deal with, but football is still fun and exciting. It's a
different type of feeling without some of those guys around, but
I'm a different person now, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fish Bowl
</P>
<P>
   The Aikmaniacs are still out there, but the object of their
obsession has learned to play their game. He's prepared to sign
autographs anywhere, anytime. He doesn't like signing a guy's
receipt at the gas station or a woman's underwear at a restaurant,
but it comes with the territory of being the highest-paid player on
the world's most popular team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never be completely comfortable,'' said Aikman. ``But
there is a misconception that I can't leave my house, and that's
just not true. I'm not a prisoner of whatever celebrity I may
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman realizes the same popularity that pushes fans to approach
him has also produced more money than Sultan of Brunai, appearances
on everything from Oprah to ``People'''s list of the 50 Most
Beautiful, and the seven fireplaces in the new house he hopes to
move back into next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do look forward to the days when I can have a private
life,'' he said. ``But I also know I'll miss not playing. I talked
to Dan \RMarino\S and he told me that when you're done, you're
done. It's simple, but it really made me think and I'm trying to
soak things in a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Future
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's immediate sights are accomplishing something of
unprecedented biblical proportion: two resurrections.
</P>
<P>
   One from 1-15; the other from Switzerland. The first took a 1-15
disaster to three Super Bowls in four years earlier this decade.
This one is about rebuilding a winner and an image from a team that
plunged to 6-10 last year under Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be very disappointed if we don't get a fourth
Super Bowl,'' he said. ``Because we've got the core players to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he's done playing? Marriage? Kids? Ownership? For now
he's content with his down-to-earth girlfriend, who has no links to
Hollywood stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed playing too much to just walk away altogether,''
he said. ``I don't think I have the patience to coach, but I'd like
to be involved in some part of ownership. It could really be
rewarding if it's a meaningful position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legacy
</P>
<P>
   Three Super Bowls. Super Bowl MVP. 11-2 in the playoffs. 88-56
record as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a kid who practiced crossing his T's and A's because
he thought his baseball autograph would someday be worth something
and who took up football in the eighth grade only because his
Marlboro-Man tough dad, Ken, signed him up without asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it all ended today my career would be a success, yes,''
Aikman said. ``The Super Bowls are something to be proud of; I've
got the respect of my teammates and have pretty much established
myself. I don't dwell on the end because I'm not too worried about
it. It's not like I'm going to have to start selling shoes when
football is over.''

 &HT;    Calcavecchia looks for good things at Sarazen World OpenBy Glenn
Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga. _ There hasn't been a pin that he doesn't aim
for. There isn't a power fade in his bag that can't clear a fairway
bunker. There isn't a moment that Mark Calcavecchia spends on the
golf course when he isn't the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why there's only one major championship _ the 1989
British Open _ in his biographical sketch. Maybe it doesn't suit
his nature to be patient. If par is a good score, Calcavecchia
might find himself thinking, then maybe this isn't my kind of golf
course or tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to places where I feel good,'' Calcavecchia says. ``Maybe
that's why I wouldn't consider myself a U.S. Open specialist, by
any means. That's probably my least favorite tournament on the
planet. I disagree with what they try to do there, and that
probably hasn't helped my attitude going in there. I'm sure I'm
always going to play in it if I'm eligible, but if I wasn't, I
don't know if I'd even try to qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   The complete antithesis is this week's Sarazen World Open at the
Legends Course at Chateau Elan, an event that Calcavecchia clearly
enjoys nearly as much as his old bowling ball _ even more this year
after a forgettable 29th-place finish just down the road at the
Tour Championship. In five years of competing in the Sarazen,
Calcavecchia has earned enough to purchase a decent-sized Caribbean
island. The $360,000 Calcavecchia secured last year with a
three-shot win over England's Lee Westwood pushed his career total
to $593,525. Only two-time winner Frank Nobilo of New Zealand (
$741,500) has feasted more on Don Panoz's property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely been a good place for me,'' Calcavecchia said
about the Sarazen, which will fade away after this year, pushed off
the schedule by a 1999 World Golf Championship event. ``It's one of
those courses that the more you play it, the more comfortable you
are. Like, for instance, some of those little uphill holes. You've
got 135 yards, but it might be a 7-iron. It's tough to force
yourself to take enough club.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was no problem for Calcavecchia, whose week began
with an unreal 62 in unbelievably wretched weather. With his back
in spasm on Sunday, his 10-shot lead had evaporated to two. But
with a 40-foot birdie putt on the 18th, Calcavecchia secured the
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew one way or another I was going to finish,''
Calcavecchia said. ``Thank God I got off to a great start. I guess
that's what big leads are for.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia's 1998 season has mirrored last year's Sarazen, but
without the back pain. He built up a financial surplus in the
spring with a win at the Honda, a tie for fourth at Bay Hill and a
fourth at The Players Championship _ earning $604,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good three weeks, for sure; that's really been the
basis of my whole season,'' he said. ``If I had played bad those
three weeks, I'd really consider my season a complete disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia is disappointed about the demise of the Sarazen,
and not merely from a financial standpoint. From the start, he has
been one of the tournament's staunchest allies, giving it a
credibility boost and urging other PGA Tour stars to attend. He had
earned the chance to accept the trophy from the 96-year old Sarazen
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every year the tournament has seemed to get a little
more important,'' Calcavecchia said. ``I mean, it's the Gene
Sarazen World Open. I have always thought that's pretty neat.''

 &HT;    Mega-deal for two builders announced
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two of America's top 10 home builders are using
strategic acquisitions to boost earnings and market share in a
slowdown that both acknowledge has begun.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with industry observers, as long as debt does not
get out of hand in what analyst Steve Percoco of Lark Research
calls ``a spotty market.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Beazer Homes announced Monday its agreement to buy
Trafalgar House Property of Washington, D.C., from its Norwegian
owner for about $100 million. The transaction, expected to close in
December, gives Beazer entry into a blooming market and control of
the fourth-largest builder in northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal does not include Trafalgar's South Riding, a
planned community in Loudon, Va., Beazer will gain about 4,000 lots
in northern Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey, said David Weiss,
vice president and chief financial officer. It will also be able to
buy choice lots and build in South Riding, which is being sold
separately to a consortium of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Beazer will pay cash _ from its renegotiated revolving
credit line and from its own coffers _ for Trafalgar, the price was
discounted because the owner was motivated to sell, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Trafalgar's estimated revenue this year is $210 million on 1,000
homes sold.
</P>
<P>
   Beazer Homes' fiscal year ended in September, and results will
be released next week. However, through the first nine months, the
company reported $612 million in sales. The Trafalgar purchase will
take it to the billion-dollar range.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strategic opportunity for them that makes a lot of
sense,'' said Percoco. ``It broadens their base, (and does so) with
an established name and good reputation like Trafalgar's. . . . My
concern is not the strategy, it is the leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Beazer announced a far smaller acquisition,
Snow Construction, of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Columbia, Md.-based Ryland Group was
acquiring Regency Communities of Tampa, enhancing its market share
in a prime retirement market.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price and details were not divulged when the
company announced the acquisition Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the Beazer transaction in northern Virginia, Ryland's
purchase was designed to position the company to continue to do
business in a slowdown, said spokeswoman Anne Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fiscal year is the calendar year. During November and
December, Regency will add 90 closings to our balance sheet. It
will add 350 more in 1999. It will take our Florida division from
325 homes a year to 750 or 800 homes a year, making that one of our
largest divisions,'' Madison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regency builds in north Tampa,'' noted analyst Percoco, adding
territory to Ryland's existing Tampa base, ``and enables them to
save some money on overhead.''

 &HT;    Baylor hired as Braves batting coach as changes announced
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves formally announced the hiring of
hitting coach Don Baylor on Monday afternoon, but they hardly
stopped there. In a sweeping set of moves, almost all of the Braves
coaching staff was rearranged, as the organization seeks to
revitalize a component of the club that might have gone stale.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from Atlanta are hitting coach Clarence Jones, replaced by
Baylor after 11 seasons on the staff, and bench coach Jim
Beauchamp. Both have been offered minor league coaching positions.
Third-base coach Bobby Dews has been transferred to the bullpen in
a swap with bullpen coach Ned Yost, who takes Dews' spot in the
third-base box.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, former Brave second baseman Glenn Hubbard, most
recently a coach with the Class A Macon Braves, has been promoted
to become the first-base coach, and nine-year first base coach Pat
Corrales moves to the dugout to become Bobby Cox's bench coach.
Only pitching coach Leo Mazzone and strength and conditioning coach
Frank Fultz were unaffected by the moves.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions turned over what had been the most stable
coaching staff in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at it as an attempt to invigorate our environment and
freshen the spirit,'' said general manager John Schuerholz, who
informed Jones and Beauchamp of the changes in Monday meetings.
``Even though those guys did great jobs for us, sometimes there are
changes that are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz had said the day after the Braves were eliminated
from the NLCS that he did not foresee any staff changes, but he and
Cox already had started begun toying with ideas. Once Baylor became
available, the notion of revamping the whole staff gained momentum.
With the exception of Dews who was brought in after Jimy Williams
departed in 1996, Cox's staff had remained unchanged since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that longevity stemmed from Cox's loyalty to those
coaches, even while critics suggested the team was overdue for some
new, younger blood. Beauchamp is 59, Dews is 60 and Jones turns 57
on Saturday. Nevertheless, such wholesale change was not all Cox's
idea originally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who initiates it,'' Schuerholz said. ``It
matters that there's an agreement, which is what we have. Bobby and
I talked about it, and we thought it was the thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's charge is to sharpen an offense that just scored a
franchise record 826 runs last year (5.1 per game). He undoubtedly
will be the highest-paid coach in baseball next year, drawing
$600,000 from the Colorado Rockies for the final year of his
managerial contract.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, who was the 1995 National League manager of the year,
already had a reputation as a hitting coach. In two seasons with
Baylor overseeing Milwaukee's offense in 1990-91, the Brewers' team
average went from .259 to .271. In the 1992 season in St. Louis,
the Cardinals added seven points to their club average before
Baylor was hired away to manage the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Braves ranked in the top four in the league in
runs, homers (second with 215) and average (fourth at .272), the
club fought streakiness and inconsistency up and down the order.
The team struck out more than 1,000 times for the third year in a
row, after doing so just once in the previous 30 years. Baylor's
most interesting client should be Andruw Jones, who is still a few
strides short of offensive stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is we're going to have to work the pitchers and
not make outs early in the count,'' Baylor said from his California
home. ``Make the pitcher make the mistake and think about driving
in runs. That's the bottom line. You have extra runs to work with.
You have an excellent pitching staff, so the hitters will have do
their duty too hit the ball the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor will be reunited with two of his favorite ex-Rockies in
shortstop Walt Weiss and first baseman Andres Galarraga, whose
career Baylor revitalized beginning in St. Louis in 1992. Galarraga
posted eague-leading seasons in average (.370 in 1993), homers (47
in 1996) and RBIs (150 in 1996, 140 in 1997) in Colorado, the first
baseman thought he had strained his relationship with his former
manager by leaving for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never about personality between Cat and (me),'' Baylor
said. ``We had gone through so many different things to finally get
him hitting the way he is today. There were a lot of blood, sweat
and tears to get him straightened out. You hated to lose a player
like Andres off your club. He was a clubhouse leader. But our
relationship was never in jeopardy, on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, the staff newcomer, will be back in an Atlanta uniform
for the first time since 1987, his last of 10 seasons with the
Braves before he completed his playing career with Oakland in
1988-89. He rejoined the Braves organization the following year and
has since logged minor-league coaching stops in Bradenton, Macon
and Richmond.

`THE OLD SETTLER': AN OLDER WOMAN CHOOSES AN UNLIKELY LOVE OVER
LONELINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (Production notes at end of the review)  
 (fb) 
By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why do fools fall in love? ``The Old Settler,'' John
Henry Redwood's lonely-hearts comedy set in the Harlem of the early
1940's, addresses the question through a pair of romantic dunces:
an old fool, desperate for affection and eager to believe in anyone
who can supply it, and a younger one, unschooled in affairs of the
heart and a terrible judge of when they might be practical.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood plays matchmaker to these lovelorn naifs, prompting a
tender chain of events that inevitably teaches each of them
invaluable lessons. The older fool, Elizabeth Borny (played by
Leslie Uggams), an unmarried housemaid, is past her prime and thus
considered pitiable; the younger by more than two decades, Husband
Witherspoon (Godfrey L. Simmons Jr.), is a weak-willed rube fresh
from the rural South who nonetheless finds himself a prize to be
fought over.
</P>
<P>
   For this gentle comic equation to add up, for the story to have
any urgency, it's more important to understand the minuses in the
relationship than the pluses. What's poignant in ``The Old
Settler,'' which opened last week at Primary Stages, is that
community tyranny can propel a woman of Elizabeth's grace into the
arms of such a guileless suitor. The utter absurdity of their
romance has more to do with sociology than age; their courtship
must seem outrageous because it's an outrage that a substantial
person like Elizabeth would feel compelled to settle for only half
a mate.
</P>
<P>
   This was precisely the quality communicated by ``The Old
Settler'' the first time I saw it, at the McCarter Theater in
Princeton, N.J., in a charming production directed by Walter Dallas
with all the right overemphases. McCarter's Elizabeth and Husband
were a patently ridiculous pair; the Husband of Tico Wells was so
callow, so out of place in cosmopolitan, wartime Harlem, that your
heart instantly melted for the Elizabeth of Brenda Pressley, whose
vulnerability was so nakedly on display.
</P>
<P>
   While the new ``Old Settler'' retains the play's warm atmosphere
and humor, and can also count in its corner agile supporting
performances by Lynda Gravatt and Rosalyn Coleman, the Primary
Stages incarnation, directed by Harold Scott, renders it an
altogether slighter work. Not that it harbors any great claim to
profundity; the play owes more to Neil Simon than, for instance,
August Wilson. It's a pleasant, genteel comedy that aspires neither
to lyrical flight nor penetrating insight.
</P>
<P>
   But it is character-rich, and when played to the hilt, it can
seem more than the sum of its parts. And this is where the serious
disappointment creeps in. The couple at its core now is flavorless.
Simmons and Uggams are capable actors who nevertheless do not make
an interesting pair. Cast against type _ that is to say,
considerably more worldly (in his case) and glamorous (in hers)
than the characters they play _ the actors turn an odd coupling
into a fairly conventional liaison. The gap between them is not so
wide. The romance loses its asymmetry and thus its essence.
</P>
<P>
   The social milieu of Redwood's Harlem is the hierarchy of
domestics _``kitchen mechanics'' they call themselves _ who travel
to daily, or live in sporadically, the houses of white families.
The story unfolds in an apartment shared by two of them: Elizabeth
and her younger, tougher sister, Quilly (Gravatt), who take in
Husband as a boarder. He has come to New York after his mother's
death in pursuit of a hometown sweetheart, Lou Bessie (Coleman),
who left South Carolina for the brighter lights.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Bessie, played by the delightful Coleman with all the bite
and effervescence of overcarbonated ginger ale, has little use for
anything about Husband but his inheritance. So he turns for comfort
to the needy Elizabeth, who is scoffed at behind her back as ``an
old settler,'' a woman who has reached middle age with no
marriageable prospects. Over the protests of the mistrustful
Quilly, to whom Redwood awards all the choicest ripostes _ ``You
look like Uncle Ben before he started cookin' rice,'' she says to
Husband when he arrives home one night in a bright orange zoot suit
_ Elizabeth takes the dangerous plunge, consenting when he proposes
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's and Gravatt's steady hands notwithstanding, the
production is a bit of an anesthetic. It leaves you feeling
pain-free, when a little vicarious heartache is what you are after.
Scott's direction is stolid and his pacing leisurely, which proves
a skillful ploy only in a lovely scene in Act II in which Uggams,
sitting by the window in the designer Bob Phillips' realistic
rendering of Elizabeth's immaculate flat, waits silently in the
fading moonlight for Husband to return and take her away.
</P>
<P>
   The moment is one of Uggams' most fetching _ she also rises to
the occasion when called on to break into song _ but these are
isolated instances in a play that never delivers on its promise of
pathos, never raises goose bumps. ``I understand about eating alone
and being alone,'' the radiant Uggams declares, in a way that leads
you to think she's just saying that.

 &HT;    Sampras reminds tennis world of record year
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pete Sampras isn't one to seek out attention, but he made a good
point last week when he noted that his pursuit of a record
sixth-straight year finishing No. 1 on the ATP Tour computer is
getting surprisingly little attention worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   It escaped almost everyone's notice last year when Sampras tied
Jimmy Connors' record of five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Europe, it wasn't really talked about,'' said Sampras,
who is still ranked No. 1 but stands second in points this year
behind Marcelo Rios with just three weeks remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because it's one of the toughest things to
do in sports,'' Sampras said. ``There is no doubt about how hard it
is to stay on top in any sport, but to do it in an individual sport
for the majority of his career, it's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be comparing apples to orang

   WALDORF, Md. _ Christopher Thompson was a prime target for the
two older men roaming the St. Charles Towne Center mall Monday,
dressed in identical black uniforms. He was young. He looked fit.
He was in the mall in the middle of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play sports?'' Thompson was asked by way of introduction.
More importantly, Keith L. Dixon wondered, had Thompson ever
considered enlisting in the U.S. Navy?
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer Dixon and his fellow recruiter got little more
than a shrug from Thompson, 19, a response all too familiar these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting young men and women into the nation's all-volunteer
military has never been easy, but the military now faces a crisis
in recruiting that has been building for some time and, many
commanders fear, could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has just announced that the Army and the Navy have
each failed to reach their goals in signing up new recruits for the
fiscal year that just ended. It was the first time since the draft
ended in 1973 that the Navy had fallen short, and it did so
disastrously, enlisting 12 percent fewer recruits than its stated
goal of 55,300.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon attributes its recruiting difficulties to many
things. The economy is thriving. The unemployment rate is at its
lowest level since the days of the draft. Young people are more
likely than ever to go straight to college after graduating from
high school _ nearly 70 percent now, compared to less than half
just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But many officials believe the armed services face a deeper
problem and one more difficult to overcome: The military, simply
put, no longer looms very large in young people's lives and
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are into just having fun,'' said Thompson, who
recently moved to Maryland from Charlotte, N.C. ``And there's so
much fun to have.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharp draw down of personnel that followed the end of the
Cold War _ and the collapse of the nation's only overarching enemy
_ has left the military as small as it has been since right after
World War II. With 1.4 million soldiers, sailors, airmen and
marines on active duty, the military is 40 percent the size it was
at the peak of the Vietnam War in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   That has meant a steady decline in the number of veterans in the
population, and in the number of those the recruiters call
``influencers,'' the relatives, friends, teachers or others with
military service who often inspire young people to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's generation _ the teen-agers and 20-somethings born
after 1973 _ is the first whose fathers never had to face
conscription.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember, when I was a little kid growing up, all I
heard about was the military service of my parents,'' said Adm.
Barbara E. McGann, the Navy's two-star commander in charge of
recruiting. ``Both my parents served. And you do grow up hearing
these stories and being curious about what military service would
be all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean that's gone forever,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in recruiting has led to shortages of enlisted
personnel in the field, raising concerns in some quarters about
what is called the ``readiness'' of the armed forces to fight _ and
win _ a war.
</P>
<P>
   Since Navy recruits almost always go straight to sea after basic
training, the Navy's shortfall has contributed disproportionately
to shortages of enlisted sailors in the fleet. Navy ships, on
average, are now setting sail with only 90 percent of a full crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Army missed its goal to recruit 72,600 new soldiers overall
by only 1 percent, but it fell far shorter in enlisting recruits
for harder-to-fill specialities, including armor and artillery
crews.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force and Marines, both smaller forces with more
specialized appeals, met their recruiting goals for the last fiscal
year; the Air Force, though, met their goal only after speeding up
the starting dates of those who signed up but decided to wait to
enter the service.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is scrambling to address the shortfalls. The $1.1
billion that Congress approved for military ``readiness'' two weeks
ago included $113 million to help boost recruiting, including an
increase in enlistment bonuses for areas hit hardest by the
recruiting woes.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of recruiting has risen steadily. Without the infusion
of new money, it now costs, on average, $7,187 per recruit,
including advertising dollars, enlistment bonuses and money for
college. At the end of the Cold War in 1989, each recruit cost
$5,460, in dollars adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and the Army have hired new recruiters (700 and 600
more, respectively), and they have flooded television with new
advertising they hope will reach today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-October, the Army began broadcasting new commercials.
They replace the current gauzy testimonials of soldiers who say
they have made something of themselves with jolting ads that mix
staccato Nike-like images and pulsating music. ``Are you ready to
make real noise?'' one of them asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still `Be all that you can be,' but we took the
experience the Army can offer and packaged it in a more
contemporary fashion,'' said Lt. Col. James P. Sullivan, the Army's
chief of marketing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, the Navy will broadcast its first
``infomercial'' on cable, touting the rewards of Navy life in a
medium more often used to sell beauty products and financial
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation watches cable late into the evening,'' McGann
said.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral and other Pentagon officials express optimism that a
redoubled effort _ with new ads and more recruiters _ will fix any
serious recruiting problems before they endanger the services.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that recruiting will thrive only when more
chronic problems are addressed. In a memo sent to every Army
general on Oct. 7, the Army's Chief of Staff, Gen. Dennis J.
Reimer, warned that the perceived gap between civilian and military
pay and benefits and the high pace of Army operations would
continue to hurt recruiting until the situation is addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer's memo cited the lament of an Army recruiting sergeant in
Ohio, who summarized the problem like this: ``We are asking today's
youth to leave home, deploy at a moment's notice and give his life
for his country for the same pay as a fry cook.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes recruiters like Petty Officer Dixon more
important than ever. He works out of a small office in a boxy brick
building here in Waldorf, a small town about 25 miles southeast of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-year veteran, Dixon has spent the last two and a half
years trying to sell prospective recruits on the experience,
training and education that the Navy offers.
</P>
<P>
   He scours the high schools and recreation centers, but he also
improvises. He once left his business card in each sneaker in the
mall's shoe store and, surprising even himself, received a call
from a prospect, who a week later was on his way to the Great Lakes
Naval Training Center, the Navy's boot camp north of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, he has been the second best recruiter in
a region that stretches from northern Virginia to New Jersey, but
it was always a struggle, he said. A lot of kids simply do not
think the military has much to offer them; the ones that do often
have a close friend or relative who steers them toward service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real lack of interest,'' he said, cheerful
nonetheless, as he cruised the mall, which, he explained, is
crawling with prospects. ``And I see it get weaker and weaker every
year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the Navy is a victim of its own success.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other services, the Navy has increased the quality of
its recruits by requiring a high school diploma and above-average
scores on aptitude tests. The Navy also turns down anyone with
physical or mental defects, or a history of drug use. Those
standards, the Navy estimates, eliminate two-thirds of the pool;
more often than not those are the ones who volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who walk into the office have something
wrong with them,'' said Petty Officer Benny J. Granillo, a 10-year
veteran who works most days out of the Lexington Park office.
</P>
<P>
   That is why recruiters rely more on contacts they cultivate.
During their trip to the mall, for example, Dixon and Granillo each
went to the mall to check up on prospects, like Patricia
Overstreet, 19, who signed up to be a medical corpsman but wanted
to wait until after Christmas to start.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mall has a ban on soliciting, they approach prospects
like Thompson indirectly. In this case, they chatted a bit about
basketball and high school, learning along the way that Thompson
was waiting for his girlfriend to get off from her job at the
sporting goods store. Dixon invited him to join a pick-up
basketball game on Saturday. ``No strings attached,'' he said,
handing him a card.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Thompson, Dixon asked, ``Do you know what the
problem with that guy is?''
</P>
<P>
   He and Granillo answered in tandem, ``The girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be interested, but the girlfriend won't want him to
leave,'' Dixon explained. Then he made a note to himself to drop by
the store every now and then and see how the relationship was
going.

   Pop Art to China
</P>
<P>
   Pop Art goes to China beginning on Sunday, when the Smithsonian
Institution's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington opens ``Roy
Lichtenstein: Landscapes in the Chinese Style.'' The exhibition
includes six examples of the Chinese art that inspired
Lichtenstein. He used his signature dots to create craggy,
fog-shrouded mountains, winding rivers, lakes and even a seascape _
images that echo the classic subjects of Chinese landscapes. The
exhibition continues until Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Eiffel Tower remained closed Monday, the fourth day of a
strike by French workers demanding an increase in staff members.
The press office for the tower, where 35,000 visitors had been
expected over the All Saints Day holiday weekend and 8,000 on
Monday, declined to predict when the attraction would reopen.

   For 200 years, Caravaggio's masterpiece ``The Taking of Christ''
(1602) was considered missing. Then, in 1993, it was rediscovered
in Dublin in the dining room of a Jesuit community residence.
Cleaned and restored, the painting is on indefinite loan to the
National Gallery of Ireland. But from Feb. 1 through May 24, the
work will make its first appearance in the Western Hemisphere at
the McMullen Museum of Art at Boston College. It will be the
centerpiece of the exhibition ``Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and
the Baroque Image,'' which will introduce Americans to the
masterpiece and provide an interdisciplinary study of Italian
religious art from 1580 to 1680.

   Placido Domingo will become the artistic director and co-manager
of the Los Angeles Opera in 2000, while continuing as the artistic
director of the Washington Opera. Domingo, who is already the
artistic adviser and principal guest conductor for the Los Angeles
Opera, will replace Peter Hemmings, the company's general director,
who is to retire in June 2000. Domingo will share oversight of the
Los Angeles Opera with a manager to be named. ``Peter Hemmings did
a great job,'' Domingo said, ``and the company is inherently very
healthy. But now it is time to think of how to proceed into the
next millennium.'' Domingo said he would continue his singing and
conducting career. One of the Three Tenors, he is singing in the
Washington Opera's production of ``Fedora.''

NEBRASKA FAN TRACKS HEISMAN RACE ON HIS SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a touch of irony, the only known homemade Web site that
tracks the Heisman Trophy race this season belongs to a Nebraska
football fan.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wingert of Sioux City, Iowa, might be a diehard Cornhuskers
fan, but it doesn't seem to get in his way of ranking college
football's best players at his Heisman Watch page
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Pressbox/4188/heisman.html).
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it must pain Wingert to see Texas running back
Ricky Williams rank No. 1 among his top 15 selections. Williams,
after all, rushed for 150 yards to help the Longhorns hand
Wingert's favorite team a 20-16 home loss on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than stick a Hook 'em Horns sign in Wingert's face,
Longhorns fans should applaud him for seeing his online project
through. Outside of a few sites that tout their author's favorites,
the Heisman race is tracked rather poorly on the Internet, with
only the College Football Hall of Fame's official site
(collegefootball.org) and CBS SportsLine making anything out of it.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be pointed out that Wingert started his site in a
season in which no Cornhuskers player has been mentioned as a
legitimate candidate. (Wingert listed Nebraska quarterback Bobby
Newcombe as a preseason dark-horse candidate in a section on his
site, but let the guy be a Nebraska fan, for Pete's sake.)
</P>
<P>
   Wingert, who already has an impressive site devoted to the
Cornhuskers, started his Heisman section after discussing Heisman
hopefuls with some online friends. A search on the Net yielded only
big-media sites, ``so I decided I would start up my own,'' Wingert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wingert came up with an enterprising site.
</P>
<P>
   On his site, Wingert tinkers with the order of his top 15
players based on their weekly performances. He also has developed a
section for each player, a fans poll (he resets the results at the
first of each month to keep the voters honest), a message board and
a list of past Heisman winners. Most of the candidates also are
linked to official sites touting their candidacy for the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Wingert's effort on free GeoCities Web space rivals that of
resource-rich CBS SportsLine
(www.sportsline.com/u/football/college/heisman), which uses senior
writer Dennis Dodd's weekly analysis as its Heisman presence.
</P>
<P>
   When the Heisman is awarded next month, it's a good bet that
Wingert won't be at the Downtown Athletic Club in lower Manhattan
to witness the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame because Wingert does a first-class job on this
new media known as the Internet in promoting the Heisman Trophy.
 &LR; subheds:Say Ricky, you're so fine
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams leads other Heisman candidates in the number of
fan pages on the Web. A few of the known pages that follow
Williams:
</P>
<P>
   Ricky's Heisman Page
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Midfield/2640/GAR.HTM): Lots of

N.H. NEWSPAPERS SWAP BLOWS OVER CANDIDATE'S LINK TO GAY CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p, a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just one week before Election Day, The (Manchester) Union Leader
dropped a bombshell _ or what some would call a stink bomb _ into
the middle of a hard-fought New Hampshire state Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing its reputation as the Granite State's bastion of
conservatism, the Oct. 27 Union Leader ran a story linking
Democratic candidate Rick Trombly to a gay club that holds monthly
``leather nights.'' A day later, a Union Leader editorial claimed
Trombly's sexual identity wasn't the relevant issue. But it implied
that he did not have the ``sound moral and family values'' for
public office and emphasized the point by sprinkling in such
phrases as ``rubber orgy'' and ``quaint homosexual fetishes.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether The Union Leader will influence today's
state Senate voting. But in outing Trombly _ a respected former
House Democratic leader challenging a Republican incumbent _ it has
brought accusations of an ideological smear, resurrected the
chronic journalistic dilemma about the relevance of a public
figure's private life, and triggered a newspaper war between The
Union Leader and the Concord Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bilious spirit of (the late &UR;  &LR; publisher) William Loeb still
haunts the newsroom of The Union Leader,'' declared an indignant
Oct. 29 Monitor editorial. ``The paper's scurvy attack on Senate
candidate Rick Trombly was a reminder of its bad old days _ and
fresh cause for shame, not satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after The Union Leader story, Trombly
asked voters to ``reject gutter politics.'' In some quarters, the
episode seemed to exemplify The Union Leader's take-no-prisoners
approach to politics. With Democratic governor Jeanne Shaheen
favored to win reelection, there is speculation that Democrats
could make inroads into the GOP's 15-9 edge in the state Senate.
Trombly is widely viewed as having launched a serious challenge to
Republican Amy Patenaude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had done polling to show this as a winnable race,'' says a
Democratic Party spokesman, Jon Paone. ``There's no level The Union
Leader will not sink to to push its political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they ... try to throw their weight around in the
political arena,'' says Clark Hubbard, a University of New
Hampshire political science professor, noting that demographic
changes are moderating the state's conservative politics and
reducing the ranks of ``Union &UR;  &LR; Leader stalwarts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think if this was a candidate who shared The
Union Leader's political philosphy, they would not have done
this,'' says Concord Monitor editor Mike Pride.
</P>
<P>
   Union Leader editor Joseph McQuade rejects charges that his
paper dredged up dirt on Trombly to bury a political foe. ``In the
immortal words of Dave Puddy from `Seinfeld,''' he says, ```That's
bogus, man.''' The Union Leader's Oct. 27 story was generated when
the paper discovered Trombly's home phone number on the gay club's
Web site and found a source who said Trombly is the group's
president, before later recanting. Trombly told the paper that he
is a lawyer for the club, but not a member. And he said his sexual
identity is not relevant to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found in the public interest the nature of this club and
the nature of Mr. Trombly's relationship to it,'' says McQuade.
``The guy is running for fairly high public office in the state of
New Hampshire. ... I'd feel the same if this was swinging singles
of the heterosexual variety.''
</P>
<P>
   While declining to criticize The Union Leader, New Hampshire
Republican Party chairman Steve Duprey calls Trombly a friend and
says ``his sexuality isn't an issue. ... Absent some clear and
compelling connection (with his public duties), someone's private
life should be just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the state's media has kept The Union Leader's story at
arm's length. According to the Associated Press bureau chief for
northern New England, Larry Laughlin, the wire service initially
picked up the story because ``it couldn't be ignored.'' But it has
run nothing in recent days ``in view of the fact that it was a
highly inflammatory story that was coming out shortly before an
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The (Nashua, N.H.) Telegraph briefly mentioned the controversy
in a political column Nov. 1. But editor George Geers says the
Trombly race is not in the paper's circulation area and ``there was
a sense it was a cheap shot by The Union Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to us to be a questionable story,'' adds Thomas
Kearney, executive editor of The Keene (N.H.) Sentinel. ``It's just
another example of the chute news organizations have been sliding
down for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than The Union Leader, the one outlet to hop on the
controversy was the considerably more liberal Monitor. On Oct. 28,
it reacted to The Union Leader's story with a piece highlighting
Trombly's accusations of ``gutter politics.'' It ran a story
explaining why the Monitor, which had also received a tip about
Trombly and the Minotaurs, declined to pursue that lead. And in
addition to its scathing anti-Union Leader editorial, the Monitor
published two Sunday columns critical of its rival's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   One, authored by Pride, said The Union Leader had ``crossed the
line into character assassination in its effort to defeat Rick
Trombly.'' When asked why it had given so much ink to a story it
found so vile, Pride replied that ``once a story is out there, no
matter what the source, you're better off writing as thoughtfully
and comprehensively as you can about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some observers think the rivalry between The Union Leader
and the Monitor helped fan the flames of a story that the has not
drawn much public interest. Telegraph editor Geers says the ``two
newspapers created a news event that surpasses what the event was
about.'' Adds Duprey: ``In most of these cat fights, whether you
get 'em between candidates or newspapers, no one comes out smelling
like a rose.''

REPUBLICANS WANT VOTES TO SEND A MESSAGE ON CLINTON

<P>
   Over breakfast Monday at a diner in Santa Monica, Calif.,
Lorraine Hoover expressed the sentiment of many voters who are
poised to send the Republican-controlled Congress a message Tuesday
about the impeachment case against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republicans are wrong,'' said Hoover, a registered
Republican and retired junior high school English teacher from
Thayne, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover said she weighed the costly investigation into whether
Clinton and the former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky,
engaged in ``sex between two consenting adults'' when she recently
cast her absentee ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally vote the person,'' Hoover said. ``This time it was
straight ticket, a no-brainer. I thought if Republicans were voting
Democratic, that would send a message.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Clinton's impeachment case may hang in the balance
Tuesday, as tens of millions of voters head to the polls amid
varying degrees of disdain for Clinton's sex scandal and disgust
with the congressional response to it.
</P>
<P>
   Impeach the president, censure him, or rebuke an overreaching
Congress. By most accounts, the results of Tuesday's mid-term
congressional elections are likely to be interpreted by leaders on
Capitol Hill as a referendum on the historic impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If they had their way, scores of prospective voters across the
country said in recent days, they would send Clinton and the
Congress a common message: Stop the wrangling and move on.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews from Boston to San Francisco Bay, a small number
of voters called for Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I find him a despicable person, and he needs to be put
out,'' said Jack O'Connell, 49, a ``government worker'' and
registered Republican, of Apopka, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he plans to vote for a straight Republican ticket
in the hope congressional GOP leaders will make Clinton's
impeachment their top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But most shared the sentiments of Keith Howard, 24, of Norwood,
who said he wants Congress to drop the impeachment inquiry ``for
the best interest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard, waiting for a train at South Station after studying
downtown for a job in the travel industry, said he voted for Texas
billionaire Ross Perot in the last presidential election ``because
I didn't think he was a womanizer.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wants no more time wasted examining Clinton's alleged
womanizing. ``I'm not Hillary,'' Howard said, ``so I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others said they detest Clinton's personal failures, but
they praised his performance as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think he was a great president, but this whole thing
with Monica Lewinsky is just too cheap,'' said Mandy Samuels, 23, a
waitress and single mother from Maitland, Fla. ``He reminds me of
too many middle-aged guys who come on to me _ more than just
flirting, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   But Samuels said she is voting Democratic in her House and
Senate races because she wants to send the message that Clinton
should remain in office. ``He's been good for the country. What can
I say? I don't want my little girl to grow up in a country run by
gun nuts and religious fanatics, so Clinton's the man,'' Samuels
said.
</P>
<P>
   The refrain was similar among some voters interviewed in
Chicago. Dylan Lower, 20, a Kansas native and registered
Independent who is studying in Chicago, said he is more likely to
support Democrats because he believes the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, has searched overzealously for dirt on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the matter, period,'' Lower said. ``It's been
blown up into something bigger than it needs to have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Both apathy and disillusionment were abundant among eligible
voters across the country, an indication of what many analysts have
predicted will be an abysmal turnout. A large number of eligible
voters said they had not bothered registering to vote and many
others said they were too busy to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Among most of the non-voters, the general attitude was, why
bother, since it doesn't matter anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But many other eligible voters were plenty bothered by the
Republican push for the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I appreciate what Clinton did, but my senator
didn't tell him to go play around with Monica,'' said Martha
Graeber, a Seattle shipping manager who considers herself an
Independent. ``What I don't want is them harping on this. I want
them watching the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wresley Rush, a retired radio broadcaster from the San Francisco
Bay area, is a registered Republican who rarely votes Democratic.
``But I'd vote for Clinton at the drop of a coin because he's done
a great job,'' Rush said. ``I'm in his corner.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's supporting Democrats in part to prove it, including
voting for Senator Barbara Boxer, who is seen by many Republicans
as an extreme liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans hurt themselves tremendously by pursuing
this,'' said Rush. ``There's going to be a backlash against them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Siler, who said she tends to vote Democratic, said she
is not sure Democrats would run Congress any better than
Republicans have.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult time to decide how to vote,'' said Siler,
55, an administrative assistant for an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, which is solid Clinton country, the sex
scandal appears to have diminished support for him, and for
Democrats, not a whit. If anything, the Republican appetite for the
scandal has bolstered convictions in this liberal, heavily
Democratic region that the Republicans are preoccupied with
vengeful pettiness and must be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Leonard, who was arranging a paper turkey display in the
window of his pet shop in the Glen Park neighborhood on Sunday
afternoon, said the scandal indeed had affected the way he would
vote _ but not by provoking the anti-Democratic backlash predicted
by the Republicans. ``It's made me more positive than ever that
I've got to get the Republicans out of there,'' said Leonard, a
registered Democrat in his 50s. ``They're wasting my time and
money.''

SCELZI PUTS PEDAL TO METAL TO BREAK 326-MPH BARRIER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TERRY BLOUNT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Before the rain came Sunday to postpone the last two
rounds of the Matco Tools SuperNationals, Gary Scelzi stormed his
way into drag-racing history. All drag-racing fans have been
waiting and wondering when they would see the first 325-mph run.
</P>
<P>
   They are still waiting to see 325, but they aren't waiting any
longer to see 326 mph after Scelzi became the fastest drag racer
ever with consecutive record-setting runs at Houston Raceway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi was the first person to top 324 mph with a first-round
pass at 324.32 mph and a winning elapsed time of 4.544 seconds in
the Winston Top Fuel dragster. Later, in the second round, he
stunned the crowd again by blowing past 325 and posting an
astonishing 326.44-mph pass with a 4.530 ET.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have got to be kidding me,'' Scelzi said when told about
the 326-mph pass as he got out of the car. ``My God. The thing
popped up the front end, and it was flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi would not get a chance for a third consecutive record
pass. The rain arrived at 1:30 p.m. CST and caused an eight-hour
delay before NHRA officials had some of the Sportsman cars make
passes on the track. However, the cooler air and a slight mist made
conditions too hazardous to continue, so the decision was made to
postpone the remainder of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Fans got their money's worth in the first two rounds before it
started raining. Scelzi's two runs easily eclipsed the previous
record of 323.89 mph set by John Force last May in Englishtown,
N.J. But Force still can boast of having the fastest speed in a
Funny Car.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in speed this season has made 320-mph runs almost
commonplace. It was a little more than a year ago when Cory
McClenathan became the first driver to surpass 320 mph when he ran
a 321.77 mph at Ennis in the McDonald's dragster.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the speed record is nice, but Scelzi and McClenathan
have more important things on their minds these days. Scelzi leads
McClenathan by 73 points as the two drivers compete in the
next-to-last event of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to run out of rounds,'' said McClenathan, who
also advanced to the semifinals before the rain came. ``Gary's team
is so strong right now that it's hard to keep up. I would love to
be able to put that No. 1 on the car, but if not this year, we will
come back next year and try to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi virtually clinched his first championship here last
season (needing only to make a qualifying attempt in the last
event) as a Top Fuel rookie when he won the inaugural Matco Tools
SuperNationals. McClenathan finished No. 2 in the points for the
third time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for McClenathan for now is that he has won the
last two events this season _ Atlanta and Topeka _ that were
postponed because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Force moved two steps closer to his eighth Funny Car title by
winning his first two rounds Sunday, including a second-round
victory over teammate Tony Pedregon in the Selena-themed Syntec
Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   Force has a 90-point lead over Ron Capps, who also advanced to
the semifinals. If Force wins the event and sets a national record,
he can clinch the championship. &QL;

RESULTS WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON ISSUES, MANY FEEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By this time Wednesday, nearly all the winners will
be known in 34 Senate races, 435 House contests and elections for
governor in 36 states. What will not be clear is this: What should
all those politicians do with their new power?
</P>
<P>
   From Social Security to education and tax policy, advocates for
some of the most heated issues of the day say the 1998 election
will produce few clues, and certainly little consensus, about the
direction that voters want their elected leaders to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a missed opportunity, and I don't think the election
results will tell us anything,'' said Robert Bixby, policy director
for the Concord Coalition, which is trying to foster a national
discussion about the financially troubled Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits are calling it ``the Seinfeld election,'' an election
that, like the TV show, is essentially about nothing. ``There are
just no prevailing national issues this time,'' said Jennifer Duffy
of the Cook Political Report, who popularized the Seinfeld line.
</P>
<P>
   How should we fix Social Security? Should we raise the
retirement age? Give workers their own stock accounts? Use our
first-in-a-generation surplus to shore up the program? Few
candidates waded into these details, analysts say, so the election
will likely give little insight about solutions.
</P>
<P>
   With one-quarter of the world in recession, candidates might
have debated ways to make sure the US economy does not falter. But
few candidates talked about whether we can boost growth by changing
the tax code, or by spending our way out of a future slowdown, or
about other solutions. A proposal to give President Clinton ``fast
track'' powers to sign new trade treaties became a contentious
issue in Congress this session, but it barely registered with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had some honest policy discourse on those
issues...Neither party wants to discuss an economic slowdown when
everyone is trying to take credit for the surplus and our economic
success story so far,'' said Bruce Josten, executive vice president
at the US Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   With the single-rate ``flat tax'' a hot issue in the last
presidential race, candidates might have given a clue about whether
they would scrap the current tax code for something new. ``I
haven't heard of a single case where it's surfaced as an issue in
any race,'' said Dale Jorgenson, a Harvard University economist who
promotes taxing consumption instead of income.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of responding to a national theme, voters will head to
the polls Tuesday because of local personalities, local issues and,
in many cases, to register their opinion about whether to punish
President Clinton for lying about an extramarital affair. ``The
public isn't clamoring for Washington to embark on some big new
program or for the government to stop doing something,'' Josten
said. ``We are literally into the Tip O'Neil `All politics is
local' debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of candidates, for example, are talking about education.
But the issue in Massachusetts turns on expanded teacher testing,
as promoted in different forms by both major candidates for
governor, while in South Carolina the debate is whether to create a
state lottery to finance public education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to education, Democrats are talking about the need
to shore up Social Security and to give patients new powers when
fighting their health maintenance organizations for medical
coverage. But so are Republicans. ``Candidates will say they all
agree that something has to be done about HMOs, but we have
different ways of getting there. And no one really gets to the
details of what the different ways are,'' said Duffy of the Cook
report.
</P>
<P>
   That means that no matter which party comes out ahead Tuesday,
it will be hard to find a mandate for any policy changes, said
Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll. Teasing out a
mandate will be far harder than in 1994, when Republicans laid out
their platform in the Contract with America, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the results will be particularly hard, Newport said,
because a strong Democratic showing may have less to do with the
party's policy ideas than with the voters' distaste for how
Republicans have handled the impeachment process. Similarly, it
will be hard to know if voters chose Republicans in order to
support GOP programs or to help remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a national theme may have to do with the fact that
Americans are fairly happy these days. When the Gallup Organization
surveyed people this year on various aspects of their lives, such
as their income, safety from physical harm and prospects for the
future, people reported levels of satisfaction as high as any since
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, politicians are now polling so relentlessly that they
can form positions that conform to the public's view, Newport said.
``You look at all this -- that we are basically a happy nation,
that politicians are sensitive to our positions, and that the
public is not looking for dramatic change right now -- and it will
be hard to tease out an urgent message from whatever happens in the
election,'' Newport said.
</P>
<P>
   Some policy advocates say that a mid-term election is the wrong
forum for debating the details of national policy. ``A presidential
election is more appropriate,'' said Jorgenson, the Harvard
economist. ``Congressional elections are local in character.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health
consumer advocacy group, said that elections tend to turn on broad
themes, rather than on details. He said he was satisfied that a
large number of candidates backed the ``Patients Bill of Rights,''
which would give patients more powers when fighting HMOs for
medical care. It did not trouble him that in few races did the
candidates debate individual provisions, such as when HMOs must
cover emergency care or whether patients should have new rights to
sue insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it would be better if we had those details, but you
often can't get to that level of specificity in a campaign. I think
it's asking a little bit too much,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some advocates hoped that the elections this year would
have produced a greater number of nuanced, substantive debates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats rallied behind President Clinton's call to hire
100,000 new teachers, and Republicans also talked about reducing
class sizes. But some critics complained that few candidates talked
about how to train all those teachers, or about how to retain the
good teachers who commonly leave the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to have heard a candidate say, `Ladies and
gentlemen, no teacher in (Massachusetts) should ever have to teach
more than 80 children in a semester. How are we going to rearrange
the money now spent so that teachers have a class load that is at
least close to what is required for serious work?' '' said Ted
Sizer, a former Brown University guru on high school excellence who
now leads a charter school, with his wife, at what used to be Fort
Devens in Ayer, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But these questions get into the ``painful substance'' of
setting spending priorities. It is easier to lean instead on the
call for 100,000 new teachers, Sizer said.

N.Y. SENATOR RACE IN DEAD HEAT, POLLS SAY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton came to New York again Monday,
making her fourth appearance in the past month to rally Democrats
behind Charles Schumer's campaign to oust three-term incumbent
Republican Alfonse D'Amato from the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day before the vote in the closest, bitterest, and
most expensive contest in the country, both candidates scrambled to
solidify their bases _ Schumer and Mrs. Clinton speaking to a labor
union in Manhattan, and D'Amato joining Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
former mayor Edward Koch on a stroll through the Russian-immigrant
enclave of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Every poll paints the contest as a statistical dead heat, with
Schumer way ahead in the city, D'Amato somewhat ahead upstate, and
the two neck-and-neck in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, who are very popular here, have involved
themselves in this race with unusual intensity. Besides the first
lady's weekly visits, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
have each come to Schumer's side twice.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when five Democratic senators are in danger of losing
elections, Schumer, a congressman from Brooklyn for the past 18
years, is one of the few candidates who could unseat a Republican _
and the kingpin of New York's Republican Party, at that.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made only a veiled reference to her husband's
political scandals, saying that Republican victories in this
election would mean ``another year of partisanship'' instead of
dealing with social problems.
</P>
<P>
   The main mission of this trip _ and of the most recent trips by
the president and Gore _ appeared to be a get-out-the-vote cry
aimed mainly at the city's blacks, almost all of whom are Democrats
but few of whom vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we vote, we win,'' Schumer told more than 500 members of
the largely black local of the Service Employees International
Union, leading them in a chant of the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who was wildly applauded, exhorted the workers to
tell all their friends to vote. She acknowledged that often the
differences between candidates seem small, but added, ``You sure
can't say that this time,'' noting the gulf between the two on gun
control, public education, Medicare, and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   She also played on the gospel-like atmosphere of the rally,
saying, ``There are only two places where you are equal _ in church
before God, and in the voting booth.'' The crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
   New York Democrats have recently lost key races because minority
and working-class city dwellers turned out in low numbers. In the
1994 governor's race, residents of New York City, who made up 40
percent of the state's voting-age population, supplied just 28
percent of the vote. As a result, Democrat Mario Cuomo lost to
small-town upstate Republican George W. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Schumer flew to Albany and Buffalo, the upstate
cities with the largest pockets of Democratic support. D'Amato also
plowed through Long Island, the suburban area where the Republican
organization is strongest.
</P>
<P>
   In Brighton Beach, Koch and Giuliani, speaking on the street to
a few dozen people, mainly Russian Jews, pushed all the right
buttons, noting D'Amato's record in helping Israel, Soviet
immigrants, and the Jews who were attacked in the 1991 Crown
Heights race riot.
</P>
<P>
   The three politicians were joined by the mother of Yankel
Rosenbaum, the Talmudic scholar who was killed in that riot. She
said she flew all the way from Australia, where she now lives, to
help get out the vote for D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Jews, who make up 15 percent of New York's voters, could be a
deciding force in this election. D'Amato, who is Catholic but long
active in Jewish causes, won 40 percent of the Jewish vote in his
last election, a startlingly high number for a Republican. Schumer,
who is Jewish, has taken back much of that group, slicing its
support for D'Amato in half, according to one poll.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who also campaigned with Giuliani in the heavily Jewish
neighborhood of Borough Park on Sunday, must know that boosting his
share by a mere percentage point or two could put him over the top.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has taken a slight slide in the past couple weeks, first
after calling Schumer a ``putzhead,'' a Yiddish vulgarism, then
giving a shrill performance in two televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   He has scored most points in attacking Schumer's failure to show
up for many votes in the House this past year while out
campaigning. This tactic seemed to have some effect in Brighton
Beach. Simon Komissar, a neighborhood leader who came out to greet
D'Amato, said of the Democratic challenger, ``He's done little.''
Joseph Kruglach agreed: ``Sure, Schumer's Jewish, but that doesn't
mean anything. What matters is, he doesn't vote.''

MAKERS OF SURGICAL DEVICES IN STOCK DEAL VALUED AT $3.6 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Minn., Tenn.) (fb) 
By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a strategic shift, Medtronic Inc., the biggest
maker of heartbeat regulators, said Monday that it had agreed to
buy the Sofamor Danek Group for $3.6 billion in Medtronic stock.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic said the deal would double its stake in devices for
brain and spine surgery at a time when sales growth has slowed in
its core business in pacemakers and other devices that fine-tune
heart performance.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue of Sofamor Danek, which is based in Memphis, has been
growing four times as fast as sales of Medtronic, an older, much
bigger company that is based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic had already begun altering its thrust by hiring more
sales people to visit orthopedic spine surgeons and neurosurgeons.
The surgeons are Sofamor Danek's main customers.
</P>
<P>
   Sofamor Danek has about 40 percent of a $1-billion-a-year
surgical device market, which is growing 22 percent to 25 percent a
year, said E. Ronald Pickard, chairman and chief executive of
Sofamor. By contrast, sales of cardiovascular devices are growing
in ``the high single digits,'' said William W. George, chairman and
chief executive of Medtronic.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson will have about 20 percent of the spinal
implant market when it completes its recently announced acquisition
of DePuy Inc., said Rick Wise, an analyst at Bear Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Sofamor projects sales of $400 million this year, mainly in
hardware like rods and screws, which hold together damaged
vertebrae, and an imaging device for brain surgery. About 15
percent, or $400 million, of Medtronic's $2.6 billion sales are in
related businesses, including pain management devices and
electronic stimulators to treat tremors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sofamor Danek has a tremendous position in a field that will
complement what we were doing,'' George said. ``They have lots of
the same customers who we've worked with for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts hailed the deal, which valued Sofamor Danek at
$115 a share, or 13 percent above its closing price on Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange. On Monday, Sofamor Danek shares rose
$8.50, to $110.125. Medtronic shares rose $1.5625 cents, to
$66.5625, on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the price per share for Sofamor will be adjusted
if Medtronic shares trade below $56.97 or above $69.63 in the 15
days before Sofamor Danek shareholders meet to vote on the
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Kruger, an analyst in San Francisco at Nationsbanc
Montgomery Securities, said Sofamor Danek could add $40 million in
sales next year if it receives federal regulatory approval for a
new spinal implant device to relieve back pain. Analysts are
predicting approval early in 1999 for the device, which is called a
spinal cage.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an advisory committee of the Food and Drug
Administration sent Sofamor back to the drawing board to improve
the cage, which Kruger described as an ultra-strong metal column an
inch long and the diameter of a cigar. Similar devices are already
being sold by the Spinetech unit that was recently acquired by
Sulzer Medica, a unit of Sulzer Ltd. of Switzerland, and the
AcroMed unit that Johnson &AMP; Johnson is buying as part of DePuy Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a reshuffling trend in heart devices, the Guidant
Corp. recently agreed to buy a heart rhythm device business from
Sulzer Medica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medtronic and Sofamor Danek are an excellent fit,'' Wise of
Bear Stearns said. ``No other competitor has the unique portfolio
of electronic stimulation, surgical and spinal devices that the
combined companies will have.''
</P>
<P>
   Franz Tudor, an analyst at Oracle Partners, a health care
investment group, said the deal made sense. But he said the
opportunities for cost savings were limited because of little
overlap between the two companies in manufacturing, sales and
administration and research.
</P>
<P>
   A state court in Houston recently awarded $400,000 to plaintiffs
who claimed injuries from a screw made by Sofamor. Pickard said the
device was used in a way not recommended on the FDA-approved label.
He said Sofamor had disposed of more than 1,100 such lawsuits,
winning 50 summary judgments and paying less than $2,000 each in
some 40 cases. The company intends to defend 2,000 remaining cases
vigorously, he said.

N.H. NEWSPAPERS SWAP BLOWS OVER CANDIDATE'S LINK TO GAY CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p, a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just one week before Election Day, The (Manchester) Union Leader
dropped a bombshell _ or what some would call a stink bomb _ into
the middle of a hard-fought New Hampshire state Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing its reputation as the Granite State's bastion of
conservatism, the Oct. 27 Union Leader ran a story linking
Democratic candidate Rick Trombly to a gay club that holds monthly
``leather nights.'' A day later, a Union Leader editorial claimed
Trombly's sexual identity wasn't the relevant issue. But it implied
that he did not have the ``sound moral and family values'' for
public office and emphasized the point by sprinkling in such
phrases as ``rubber orgy'' and ``quaint homosexual fetishes.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether The Union Leader will influence today's
state Senate voting. But in outing Trombly _ a respected former
House Democratic leader challenging a Republican incumbent _ it has
brought accusations of an ideological smear, resurrected the
chronic journalistic dilemma about the relevance of a public
figure's private life, and triggered a newspaper war between The
Union Leader and the Concord Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bilious spirit of (the late &UR;  &LR; publisher) William Loeb still
haunts the newsroom of The Union Leader,'' declared an indignant
Oct. 29 Monitor editorial. ``The paper's scurvy attack on Senate
candidate Rick Trombly was a reminder of its bad old days _ and
fresh cause for shame, not satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after The Union Leader story, Trombly
asked voters to ``reject gutter politics.'' In some quarters, the
episode seemed to exemplify The Union Leader's take-no-prisoners
approach to politics. With Democratic governor Jeanne Shaheen
favored to win reelection, there is speculation that Democrats
could make inroads into the GOP's 15-9 edge in the state Senate.
Trombly is widely viewed as having launched a serious challenge to
Republican Amy Patenaude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had done polling to show this as a winnable race,'' says a
Democratic Party spokesman, Jon Paone. ``There's no level The Union
Leader will not sink to to push its political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they ... try to throw their weight around in the
political arena,'' says Clark Hubbard, a University of New
Hampshire political science professor, noting that demographic
changes are moderating the state's conservative politics and
reducing the ranks of ``Union &UR;  &LR; Leader stalwarts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think if this was a candidate who shared The
Union Leader's political philosphy, they would not have done
this,'' says Concord Monitor editor Mike Pride.
</P>
<P>
   Union Leader editor Joseph McQuade rejects charges that his
paper dredged up dirt on Trombly to bury a political foe. ``In the
immortal words of Dave Puddy from `Seinfeld,''' he says, ```That's
bogus, man.''' The Union Leader's Oct. 27 story was generated when
the paper discovered Trombly's home phone number on the gay club's
Web site and found a source who said Trombly is the group's
president, before later recanting. Trombly told the paper that he
is a lawyer for the club, but not a member. And he said his sexual
identity is not relevant to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found in the public interest the nature of this club and
the nature of Mr. Trombly's relationship to it,'' says McQuade.
``The guy is running for fairly high public office in the state of
New Hampshire. ... I'd feel the same if this was swinging singles
of the heterosexual variety.''
</P>
<P>
   While declining to criticize The Union Leader, New Hampshire
Republican Party chairman Steve Duprey calls Trombly a friend and
says ``his sexuality isn't an issue. ... Absent some clear and
compelling connection (with his public duties), someone's private
life should be just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the state's media has kept The Union Leader's story at
arm's length. According to the Associated Press bureau chief for
northern New England, Larry Laughlin, the wire service initially
picked up the story because ``it couldn't be ignored.'' But it has
run nothing in recent days ``in view of the fact that it was a
highly inflammatory story that was coming out shortly before an
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The (Nashua, N.H.) Telegraph briefly mentioned the controversy
in a political column Nov. 1. But editor George Geers says the
Trombly race is not in the paper's circulation area and ``there was
a sense it was a cheap shot by The Union Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to us to be a questionable story,'' adds Thomas
Kearney, executive editor of The Keene (N.H.) Sentinel. ``It's just
another example of the chute news organizations have been sliding
down for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than The Union Leader, the one outlet to hop on the
controversy was the considerably more liberal Monitor. On Oct. 28,
it reacted to The Union Leader's story with a piece highlighting
Trombly's accusations of ``gutter politics.'' It ran a story
explaining why the Monitor, which had also received a tip about
Trombly and the Minotaurs, declined to pursue that lead. And in
addition to its scathing anti-Union Leader editorial, the Monitor
published two Sunday columns critical of its rival's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   One, authored by Pride, said The Union Leader had ``crossed the
line into character assassination in its effort to defeat Rick
Trombly.'' When asked why it had given so much ink to a story it
found so vile, Pride replied that ``once a story is out there, no
matter what the source, you're better off writing as thoughtfully
and comprehensively as you can about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some observers think the rivalry between The Union Leader
and the Monitor helped fan the flames of a story that the has not
drawn much public interest. Telegraph editor Geers says the ``two
newspapers created a news event that surpasses what the event was
about.'' Adds Duprey: ``In most of these cat fights, whether you
get 'em between candidates or newspapers, no one comes out smelling
like a rose.''

STOCKS POST FOURTH DAY OF GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investor optimism continued to build Monday on promising
economic news, pushing stocks up 114.05 points during a fourth
consecutive day of gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose to 8706.15, close to the
8714 level reached on Aug. 18 in the days before the market's
slide. Even so, the market has some distance to go to match its
high for the year of 9337, reached in July.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the market's current optimism is sustainable in
uncertain times, money managers said, could depend in part on the
outcome of today's elections. If Republicans pick up enough seats
in the US House and Senate to interpret the results as a mandate to
go through with full impeachment proceedings, Wall Street's
optimism could quickly sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a very stubborn guy in the White House and he won't
go easily,'' said James Weiss, deputy head of equities and a
portfolio manager for State Street Research &AMP; Management in Boston.
A Republican victory would ``validate the concept of a leadership
vacuum which is very bad for the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What has been remarkable about the market's gains in recent days
has been the strength of small-company stocks, which were hammered
this fall by investors fleeing from risky holdings and wary about
returning despite the attractive prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small stocks had a strong day Monday,
adding 8.66 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 386.82. That is up
substantially from a 27-month low on Oct. 8 when the index fell to
310.28 after a dramatic selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq rose 1.67 percent, or 29.52 points,
to close at 1800.91. The Dow, in percentage terms, was up 1.33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think investors are starting to recognize the values
inherent in small-caps,'' said Jonathan Coleman, comanager of the
Janus Venture fund in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers said the market has risen in recent days because
of good economic news, including the government's report on Friday
that gross domestic product was much stronger in the summer quarter
than economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
   On the international front, they were encouraged by a decision
by Japanese regulators to take decisive action on the banking
debacle by closing the virtually insolvent Long-Term Credit Bank.
They also have see positive signs in the International Monetrary
Fund's plan to manage Brazil's debt problems and by evidence that
the Group of Seven industrial nations are serious about stabilizing
emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   But Cynthia Liu, senior international portfolio manager for
Charles Schwab Investment Management in San Francisco, believes the
market's &UR;  &LR;  move &UR;  &LR; upward is ``technical in nature.'' For stocks to
keep rising, ``more substantive actions in some of the problem
countries'' are required, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Laubscher senior vice president and market analyst in New
York for Tucker Anthony Inc., reads the market's recent strength as
an indication that the market is ``overbought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's gotten extended so we'll pull back probably for
several days,'' Laubscher predicted.

TEXAS' HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS ORGANIZATION REVERED, CRITICIZED (For

By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nine telephone lines blink insistently at the
new $4.45 million University Interscholastic League administrative
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Associate athletic director Cynthia Doyle cradles an ear to the
first of some 40 calls she'll take throughout the day. Another 50
or so e-mails await her attention.
</P>
<P>
   Each question begs an answer contained somewhere in the 236-page
UIL Contest Rules and Constitution. Approximately half of the Texas
public school students participate in at least one activity
governed by the UIL before they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, UIL. This is Cynthia Doyle.''
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . My husband is being transferred overseas with the Air
Force and my son will be moving in with his grandparents to finish
his senior year. Can he still play football?''
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . Why can't my daughter play in both of these all-star
softball games?''
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . My coach wants me to take Creatine to bulk up. I don't
know how I feel about it. Is there anything I can do without
getting kicked off the team?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually have someone on the phone, someone on hold and
someone in the hole,'' Doyle explained. ``Anybody has the right to
call this office and ask a question.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the UIL, the nation's largest high school activities
organization. It oversees 2.2 million student participants in 65
activities and 1,220 member schools, including 22 boys' and girls'
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the football playoffs two weeks away, is when the UIL
typically becomes the focal point of controversy. Charges of
wrongdoing by playoff-bound schools and other complaints pour into
the organization, which derives the bulk of its revenues from
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Sports also generate most of the attention and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very hard as a staff to promote academics and music
and all our fine arts,'' explained Bonnie Northcutt, director of
policy for the UIL. ``Still, the majority of questions come from
athletics because the whole country is focused on pro teams, sports
pages and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   And the 40 full-time employees of the UIL, despite being
perceived as everything from bumbling to tyrannical, represent one
of the most successful organizations of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some people that do not know how the UIL
works and have a misunderstanding of it,'' said James Hyden,
Arlington school district athletic director. ``The schools make the
rules here. (UIL Director) Bill Farney or (Athletic Director)
Charles Breithaupt will tell you, they are merely interpreting
rules that are set up by the schools.'' The schools rule The UIL's
administrative staff has two primary responsibilities: Conducting
state championship meets for the activities they govern, and
disseminating information about the rules and their
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   When students, parents, coaches or teachers break those rules,
it is the locally based district executive committees and
ultimately the Texas Education Agency-appointed State Executive
Council that administer the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that people may not be happy with the enforcement
of the rules or the impact of the rules,'' Farney said. ``We have
done surveys among the superintendents and the schools have said
overwhelmingly that they like the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The UIL staff _ specifically the 11-person athletic office _
becomes the flashpoint.
</P>
<P>
   When the UIL was created in 1913, it had only four rules for
participation: Students had to be under the age of 21; they had to
be United States citizens; they had to be representing the schools
that they attended; and they had to pass 2 1/2 ``solid courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Four simple eligibility rules have grown into six pages crammed
with sometimes confusing terminology that elicits the hundreds of
phone calls and questions Doyle fields every week.
</P>
<P>
   Today, students must meet 10 requirements to compete in all UIL
activities. They must not have changed schools strictly for the
purpose of participating in those activities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, athletes must meet requirements outlined in five
subsections, covering three pages of text, ranging from amateur
status to the parent-residence rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there is only one basic rule for all extracurricular
activities and that's no-pass, no-play,'' Farney explained. ``In
varsity athletics, there are a lot more rules involved. ... We just
don't have as many problems in the other areas because the
eligibility rules aren't as strenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools have stated over and over that the primary
foundation for athletics is the parent-residence rule, especially
in metropolitan areas, because without it, the schools believe one
program would be able to gather all the athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Northcutt had only to field one telephone call from a parent
offering to get a divorce so his child could play sports for
another school in another attendance zone to understand the truth
in Farney's words. Rule making, rule breaking Anyone _ parents,
teachers, players, accountants _ can come before the UIL seeking to
change the rules: The league has standing committees on athletics,
academics, music and policy that hold open meetings throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Those are filtered to the 28-member UIL Legislative Council _ 20
members of which are elected by school superintendents, while the
remaining eight are appointed by the council chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On the third Sunday in October, the council convenes to address
proposals brought by groups or individuals. Based on
recommendations from the standing committees, the council can
survey schools for input or vote to approve or reject proposals.
Approved rules are then forwarded to the State Board of Education
for implementation.
</P>
<P>
   What they create is a living document _ the UIL Constitution and
Contest Rules _ that changes as demands from parents, athletes and
schools change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a grass-roots organization _ we have to be as flexible
as the schools are,'' Breithaupt said. ``At one time we had some of
the strictest transfer rules in the country, but society has
changed so much over the past 20 years with respect to
demographics. We have a more mobile society, so our transfer rules
had to become more liberal. We had to create a waiver system, and
now we have waivers for every rule but one: No-pass, no-play.''
</P>
<P>
   The UIL athletic department must rely on the member schools to
abide by and enforce the rules, including those local school boards
have enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, a child may want to play sports but the travel
involved may violate their parole,'' Doyle said. ``That's not
really our jurisdiction. Usually people are just asking for
information on rules, but sometimes people will call, ask about a
rule and then say, `Now how do I get around that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like asking a police officer how to break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The UIL staffers are sometimes misunderstood, sometimes hated,
and even sometimes praised.
</P>
<P>
   They can take on a variety of problems and challenges, even
though their essential duty is simple and basic: make certain that
teams and individuals arrive at the state championships through
fair and equitable means: Abiding by the rules that those schools
have made.

EAPPENS SEEK `SEVERAL MILLIONS' FROM AU PAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Deborah Eappen's lawyers could not put a price tag on
her son's life, though they tried, asking for ``several million
dollars'' from the au pair who killed him and listing cases where
juries had compensated parents for the deaths of their children.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a mother's aching words, included in court papers
filed in federal court Monday, that made it clear why the loss of
eight-month-old Matthew could not be quantified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattie will have no resume, no diploma, no trophies, no wife
and children, no science fair project,'' his mother wrote in a
five-page statement to US District Judge William G. Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him take his first steps, have his first day of
school. I miss what should have been. ... I miss that I never heard
Mattie say, `I love you, Mom.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sunil and Deborah Eappen have already won their wrongful death
suit against British au pair Louise Woodward by default, after
Woodward said she could not afford a lawyer to the fight the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing Monday in US District Court, the attorneys for the
Eappens _ Fredric L. Ellis, Edward D. Rapacki and Edward A.
Broderick of Boston and Edward C. Bassett Jr. of Worcester _ were
supposed to suggest how much money they believe Young should award
the couple. He is expected to rule by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's court filing does not seek a specific amount in
damages, it does estimate what Matthew could have been expected to
earn in his lifetime: between $1.18 million and $1.67 million. The
lower figure is based on his choosing a profession such as law,
engineering or accounting, the higher on joining his parents and
paternal grandfather in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, whatever damages Young ultimately awards the Eappens may
prove to be a hollow victory, since the judge has already noted
that Woodward appears to have no assets ``of any significant
size.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has already issued an order prohibiting Woodward from
spending any money she receives for selling her story, which she
and her family have insisted she does not intend to do. Meanwhile,
investigators here and abroad are probing expenditures from the
$500,000 legal defense fund set up in England to pay Woodward's
legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens have said they filed the wrongful death suit to
prevent Woodward from profiting from the death of Matthew. The
couple plans to donate any money they may get to a foundation
they've established to prevent child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In the court filing, the Eappens' lawyers also point to a
half-dozen jury verdicts this decade in wrongful death suits
involving children 10 or younger. In four of the cases, the
plaintiffs were awarded $2 million or more in compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a Superior Court jury in October 1990 awarded $2.75
million in compensatory damages to the parents of an 8-month-old
baby who was killed in a fall from a walker.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens' lawyers are seeking an equal amount in compensatory
and punitive damages, requesting ``several million dollars'' in
each category.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis has said that it is unclear whether any award would be
collectible in England but having a judge, rather than a jury,
determine damages may improve the chances because British judges
may view a judge's award more favorably.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 Woodward was convicted of second-degree
murder and sentenced to life in prison. Superior Court Judge Hiller
Zobel later reduced the charge to manslaughter and sentenced
Woodward to time already served, 279 days. She returned home to
England in June after the state Supreme Judicial Court upheld
Zobel's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Monday that the number of British
au pairs in the United States has fallen drastically in the wake of
Woodward's trial and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures provided by the newspaper from au pair
agencies here and in Britain, about 400 British au pairs will be
placed in homes in the United States this year, down from 1,500 in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies told the newspaper that many young British women are
fearful of applying for US positions because of the way Woodward
was treated by the American legal system.

L.A. OPERA SIGNS TENOR AS ARTISTIC DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chalk up a few thousand more frequent-flier miles
for the opera world's busiest star.
</P>
<P>
   Placido Domingo, whose globe-hopping itinerary as tenor,
conductor and artistic administrator has made him one of the most
omnipresent operatic talents of modern times, will become Los
Angeles Opera's artistic director beginning in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo, 57, currently L.A. Opera's principal guest conductor
and artistic adviser, will assume principal responsibility for the
company's artistic decision-making from L.A. Opera general director
Peter Hemmings, who announced Monday that he will retire in June
2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that L.A. Opera eventually will be naming a new
managing director to oversee the company's financial and
administrative duties, which Hemmings also currently handles.
</P>
<P>
   A former administrator of the Scottish Opera, general manager of
the Australian Opera and managing director of the London Symphony
Orchestra, Hemmings has spent the better part of four decades in
arts administration. He was selected by the Music Center Opera
Association board in November 1984 to launch a Los Angeles opera
company.
</P>
<P>
   In his 16 years with the company, Hemmings presided over L.A.
Opera's formation in 1986 and its growth from a small regional
company to one of the half-dozen largest in the United States.
Since making its debut in 1986 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,
with Domingo playing the title role in Verdi's ``Otello,'' L.A.
Opera has steadily increased its subscriber base to 16,500.
</P>
<P>
   It now produces eight operas a year, for a total of 50
performances, on a budget of $19.5 million. While it has
concentrated on the standard repertory, it also has staged
lesser-known and new operas.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings said the biggest challenge facing L.A. Opera will arise
in 2002, when the Los Angeles Philharmonic moves from the Dorothy
Chandler across the street to the new 2,350-seat Walt Disney
Concert Hall. That will leave L.A. Opera as the Dorothy Chandler's
principal tenant, creating opportunities for additional programming
but also posing a need for more staff and ``a considerable
reshaping of the company,'' Hemmings said.
</P>
<P>
   Given his long association with L.A. Opera, Domingo's
appointment is not unexpected. One of opera's most respected and
accomplished performers, Domingo has sung more than 112 different
roles, more than any tenor in history. He also has become a
lucrative pop-culture property as one-third of the Three Tenors,
the all-star trio of aria-belters that includes Jose Carreras and
Luicano Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
   He has been associated with L.A. Opera since its inception in
1984, joining the Music Center Opera Association as a director. He
was later named artistic consultant upon Hemmings' appointment as
general director.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Domingo has diversified into conducting and
opera administration. Last September, to open L.A. Opera's 1997-98
season, he switched back and forth for three weeks between playing
the male lead in ``Fedora'' and conducting ``La Boheme.''
</P>
<P>
   He became music director of the Seville World's Fair in 1992,
then was appointed artistic director of the Washington Opera,
beginning with the 1996-97 season. By no means a ceremonial
appointment in that capacity, Domingo has been credited with using
his extensive connections to lure world-class talent, helping to
turn Washington Opera from a regional company into an international
one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given his existing obligations, L.A. Opera's board of
directors has had ``extensive'' discussions with Domingo about his
availability for the L.A. job, said Leonard I. Green, board
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   With his singing career ``coming to a close'' and two grown sons
living in Southern California, Domingo has personal as well as
professional incentives to become a hands-on presence in Los
Angeles, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that he wasn't willing to entertain an exclusive
relationship with L.A. Opera because he has a relationship with
Washington Opera, but I was fairly convinced _ and he's a fairly
straight-forward fellow, he's not given to obfuscation _ and he was
very direct in the way he intended to conduct his life.''

RENEWAL OF TWO-PARTY POLITICS AT STAKE IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Massachusetts citizens head to the polls Tuesday,
they may decide an issue that has scarcely been talked about:
Whether the state will take a small step toward a competitive
two-party system or slip further toward Democratic dominance.
</P>
<P>
   That question has been shrouded by the gubernatorial race, where
the Republican incumbent, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, appears to
be holding an election-eve lead, according to polls. But further
down the ballot, GOP prospects are not so sanguine, despite a
ticket as good as any the party has fielded in years.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Brad Bailey, the party's nominee for attorney
general, and Michael Duffy, its choice for auditor, are bright,
articulate, experienced candidates who have run impressive _ albeit
underfunded _ campaigns against opponents who have chosen to lie
low.
</P>
<P>
   In 6th District congressional candidate Peter Torkildsen, the
GOP boasts a candidate who has actually held the seat before. And
in the 3d District, state Senator Matthew J. Amorello of Grafton,
an experienced legislator, is making a run at US Representative
James P. McGovern, who as a first-termer is in an incumbent's most
vulnerable period.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a state where late-focusing voters tend to have an
underlying Democratic reflex, polls show all but Cellucci are
running uphill.
</P>
<P>
   On the legislative front, some party activists hope for a gain
of three to five seats. ``We're optimistic,'' said Marc DeCourcy,
executive director of the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend, other Republicans said it would be a
victory if their small band is not diminished even further. They
now hold 28 of the 160 House seats. On the Senate side, GOP leaders
hope to pick up one or two seats to add to their current seven in
the 40-member body, still far short of their numbers in 1991-92,
when they had 16 senators, two more than the 14 needed to uphold a
gubernatorial veto.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the GOP's biggest worry, that Democratic nominee
Scott Harshbarger will upset Cellucci. If so, Beacon Hill would be
run by the Democrats, and the Republican Party might well be
reduced to the political impotence it experienced in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   So why does a party whose leaders argue they have governed well
for almost a decade find itself in such a situation?
</P>
<P>
   In part, it's because a rising economic tide tends to buoy all
incumbents, and most incumbents are currently Democratic. In part,
it's because in low-attention years voters' reflex voting habits
kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Still, political specialists say there's real benefit from
strong two-party competition in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vigorous two-party system works better in a lot of ways,''
said Bob Woodbury, director of the McCormack Institute at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston. ``It tends to bring new
people into the political system, and it tends to lead to a better
debate on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a point the Republicans think they proved in 1991, when,
at Governor William Weld's insistence, the state's fiscal problems
were solved by slashing spending rather than hiking taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On a swing through the state a few weeks ago, former Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole, the Republican Party's 1996 candidate
for president, urged voters to think about sending a Republican or
two to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a Republican Congress _ nobody argues
that _ for the next foreseeable future,'' Dole said. ``Obviously,
it is very helpful to have a conduit to Republican majorities in
the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as former congressman Mickey Edwards, now a public-policy
lecturer at the Kennedy School, puts it: ``When you elect only
Democrats and you have a Republican Congress, people in
Massachusetts are basically cut out of the decision-making. A state
that has people only in one party just loses half of its influence
automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow in government studies at the
Brookings Institution, says that states can maximize their clout by
having a senator of each party, but he is unsure whether adding one
Republican will pay much of a dividend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is terribly useful for a state to have one Republican
senator and one Democratic senator,'' Hess said. ``But one freshman
House member? I think that is a little marginal. I don't know how
much they would be able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Massachusetts is widely considered a longtime
Democratic bastion, that's only true if one has a short-term
historical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   From the end of the Civil War until 1940, Massachusetts was
fertile ground for progressive Republicans, who regularly beat more
conservative Democrats. In that period, the GOP won 49 governor's
races, with the Democrats prevailing in only 15.
</P>
<P>
   The next quarter-century was a period of growing Democratic
strength. With Tip O'Neill leading, Democrats won control of the
state House of Representatives in the election of 1948. The state
Senate fell to the Democrats a decade later, in 1958, and the 1960s
saw precipitous dropoffs in GOP strength in both bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republican Party remained highly competitive for
statewide offices. From 1940 through 1974, the GOP won nine
contests, while the Democrats took six of those elections.
</P>
<P>
   It was only with the elections of 1974 and 1978 that the
Democrats drove the GOP into near extinction, seizing control of
all the constitutional offices and the second US Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   That era also saw a transformation of party philosophy and base.
The Republicans, once a progressive party, became Reaganized. The
Democrats, once the party of ethnic city dwellers, increasingly
came to represent the lifestyle liberalism of suburban voters.
</P>
<P>
   Running for reelection in 1986, Governor Michael S. Dukakis
declared that Massachusetts didn't need any Republicans, and voters
seemed to agree. With the state GOP having taken a right turn, the
state had only one elected Republican of any consequence, US
Representative Silvio Conte of Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP really came back to life in the fiscal crisis of the
late 1980s. It was that upheaval, and the two large tax hikes it
took to staunch the red ink, that helped Weld and Cellucci squeak
into office as governor and lieutenant governor in the election of
1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans claim credit for fixing the fiscal mess, and
polls show that voters agree with them. Meanwhile, Weld and
Cellucci built an eclectic coalition by making inroads into groups
that had usually voted Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start with 15 percent (of registered voters) and you
have to get to 50 percent, you have to stretch a lot more than if
you start at 40 percent and you have to get to 50 percent,'' said
long-time political observer Ralph Whitehead, a journalism
professor at the University of Massachusetts. ``Frankly, Weld and
Cellucci have been fairly resourceful and flexible in getting to
50.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weld didn't put much effort into party-building. Feeling
that the Republican State Committee was a welter of feuds and
infighting, he preferred to keep it at arm's length. That meant
that even though Weld was successful, the party itself was not.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci may have other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Cellucci is going to put his stamp on the party,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Brian Lees of East Longmeadow. ``He is
committed to building the party. He believes in grassroots
politics.''

   As Discovery's planned nine-day mission neared the half-way
point, NASA offered the six-man, one-woman crew about five hours to
gaze from the windows of the shuttle and try the things a child
might enjoy in weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What comprises relaxation here is really standing on your
head, looking at things a different way, Glenn explained while
attempting to demonstrate the maneuver for a network news anchor.
``We did some things like make balls of water that float out in
front that you can inject with air bubbles that are very, very
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The elderly astronaut became the first American in orbit in
1962. But his flight was so brief, less then five hours, and his
Mercury capsule so small that there was no time for such
shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   Even on his longer encore visit to space, Glenn seemed reluctant
to characterize the break as a dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a 100 percent day off, it's a little bit more relaxed
up here. All the research and the experiments are still going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The respite permitted all of the astronauts 15-minutes to visit
with family members using camera-equipped laptop computers aboard
the shuttle and in mission control to transmit pictures as well as
sound to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn visited with his wife, Annie, son, David, and daughter,
Lyn, who are monitoring the flight from Houston. Glenn's two
teen-age grandsons, Zachary and Daniel, participated by telephone
from their California home.
</P>
<P>
   He told his family that ``everything could not be going
better,'' said Jack Sparks, Glenn's U.S. Senate office spokesman.
Glenn's family was pleased the 77-year-old has fared well
physically on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average 77-year-old person in good health could certainly
come up here and experience this,'' said Glenn, who had to satisfy
NASA's medical experts that he was up to the flight and the
training that led up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The mission has captured the attention of young and old
worldwide since Discovery blasted off last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very nice to see all the folks around the world and
certainly the United States interested in the space program,'' said
Curt Brown, Discovery's commander. ``Maybe this flight will get the
word out and help people understand what we actually do on these
missions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Discovery crew plans to retrieve the
satellite-based solar observatory called Spartan that was deployed
on Sunday with the shuttle's robot arm.
</P>
<P>
   The retrieval is set for midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The $9 million satellite trailed the shuttle crew on Monday,
recording observations of the sun's outer atmosphere and the solar
wind with a pair of telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and pilot Steve Lindsey plan to maneuver the shuttle
behind and then beneath Spartan so that astronaut Steve Robinson
can use the shuttle's robot arm to recapture the boxy, 3,000 pound
observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The observatory should collect about 1,200 images.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we could be any happier with the results this
far,'' said Craig Tooley, NASA's mission manager for Spartan. &QL;

 &HT;    Gingrich may become 'stuck in middle' despite GOP election gains
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving on (a) general news and (w) Washington categories.)
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He's campaigned in every state save Hawaii and raised
millions of dollars to widen the Republican majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens to Speaker Newt Gingrich if his Republicans do
not make solid gains in today's election?
</P>
<P>
   ``It obviously doesn't help him,'' said Randall Strahan, an
Emory University political scientist who is writing a book about
the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan said anything less than 10 seats would not be a
significant addition to the GOP majority in the House. The
Republicans currently hold 228 seats. There are 206 Democrats and
an independent who generally votes with them.
</P>
<P>
   The party's second-guessers will be out in full force, on the
one hand assailing Gingrich's compromise with President Clinton on
last month's $520 billion spending deal and on the other hand
chiding him for an aggressive pursuit of impeachment in the face of
polls that indicate impeachment lacks public support.
</P>
<P>
   In the event Republicans pick up fewer than 10 seats _ and there
is a growing view among analysts that GOP gains will be limited _
Gingrich's first headache may be how to handle the ongoing
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will find a division in the House Republican party between
more conservative members who will want to proceed aggressively and
more moderate members who will see the election as a signal to
proceeed cautiously,'' Strahan said. ``And Gingrich will be stuck
in the middle of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Palazzolo, a University of Richmond political scientist who
has written extensively about Gingrich, said that even if
Republicans add 20 seats to their majority, Gingrich still would
have to deal with a fractious membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be enough to get him out of the woods, although it
could make Clinton's situation more tenuous,'' Palazzolo said. ``He
won't be able to push the most strident issues the right wing of
the party wants to deal with. That's the problem with this
election. It's not going to shake things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Galen, a close Gingrich adviser, disagreed with the
assessment of the academics.
</P>
<P>
   He said the speaker will not allow election returns affect the
impeachment process. ``I don't care what happens tomorrow,'' Galen
said. ``If I had to bet right now, I'd bet you that sometime in
late January or early February, there will be a vote on the House
floor to impeach and the matter will be sent to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Galen acknowledged that Gingrich would have to manage the
competing interests of the GOP's various factions, but he took
issue with the claim that the party, and the speaker, would not be
strengthened if more Republicans, even as few as eight, serve in
the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the first time since 1946 with fewer than 200
members on their side of the aisle,'' Galen said. ``No matter what
the White House says about it being a great victory, Democrats in
the House (are not) going to see it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent grumbling among conservatives who were upset
with the budget compromise with Clinton, the prospect of ousting
Gingrich as speaker appears remote.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative and moderate wings of the GOP would have
enormous difficulty agreeing on a successor, Palazzolo said.
</P>
<P>
   And many Republicans in the House believe that Gingrich may step
down sometime in 1999 to run for president, making an unpleasant
internecine battle unnecessary, Palazzolo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has weathered the storms,'' he said. ``I think the
fight is going to be over the succession after he leaves, rather
than an attempt to overturn him.''

 &HT;    Books to remain on Georgia shelves
 &HT;    By Doug Payne
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two books that protesters sought to have condemned as
child pornography do not meet the legal definition of obscene
material, and Cobb County, Ga. authorities will not seek their
removal from bookstore shelves, Solicitor Barry Morgan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said he reviewed case law on pornography and
showed copies of the two volumes to grand jury members,
professional photographers and members of civic groups to try to
gauge the community's standards on pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that no one condoned or approved of the
material,'' he said. However, he said, most of the people he showed
the books to felt they were not in violation of state obscenity
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue and local
anti-abortion activists staged demonstrations last month outside
two Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstores to bring attention to ``The Age of
Innocence'' by David Hamilton and ``Radiant Identities'' by Jock
Sturges, two photographic collections that show pre-adolescent and
teenage girls and boys in various poses and degrees of nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters expressed disappointment and even shock after
Morgan announced his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next child that is taken into the woods and raped, this
man (Morgan) is going to bear that innocent blood on his hands,''
said the Rev. Phillip Benham, national director of Operation
Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Michael and Michelle Wolven, two Atlanta-area anti-abortion
activists who took part in the Oct. 19 protest, said they were
disappointed by Morgan's decision but believe he was hamstrung by
state law. Michael Wolven said he and his wife may take the issue
up with the state attorney general's office after today's election.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Morgan said the books ``taken as a whole'' must
appeal to the average person's prurient interest and be lacking in
artistic value. ``I don't think anyone was pleased with the
stuff,'' he said. But ``there is no doubt that it's quality work. .
. . I don't think, taken as a whole, one can say they lack serious
artistic value.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble senior vice president Mary Ellen Keating
applauded the decision, noting that it is in line with the course
of action taken by prosecutors in Texas, Maryland, Kansas and
Wisconsin. Steven Maklansky, curator of photographs at the New
Orleans Museum of Art, has produced museum shows incorporating
Sturges photographs. He said both Sturges and Hamilton are
internationally respected artists whose photographs ``become
metaphors for childhood innocence or adolescence or immaturity or
life transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexual deviants and ``hard-core right-wingers'' take the
photographic image too literally, he said. ``Both those sorts of
people see only the naked person. They do not have either the
imagination or the inclination to understand that a photo image,
though apparently real, also can have significant metaphorical
qualities.''

 &HT;    Nude sign law deemed unconstitutional by Supreme CourtBy Bill
Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A state law prohibiting highway billboards that
advertise nude clubs is unconstitutional because it violates the
rights to freedom of speech, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Erotica, the Peach County, Ga. restaurant featuring nude
dancers, and a billboard company, Sunshine Outdoors Inc.,
challenged the law. The restaurant near I-75 is well-known to
Georgia motorists because it relies heavily on its brightly colored
billboards along interstate highways to draw customers.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous ruling written by Justice Hugh Thompson, the
court found that the outdoor advertising ban for adult
entertainment ``impedes the free flow of information and far
exceeds the state's legitimate interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling allows all adult entertainment establishments to
continue advertising on highway billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients are happy with the result,'' Tucker lawyer Thomas
E. Maddox Jr., who represents Cafe Erotica, said.
</P>
<P>
   The state law said such advertising could mislead the public,
hurt property values near the billboards and ``divert the attention
of drivers and thus cause traffic hazards.''

 &HT;    Time article critical of GM
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A Time magazine cover story on corporate welfare
slams General Motors' tax breaks in Moraine, Ohio as an example of
the company's ``auctioning its surviving jobs to the highest
bidders.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which hit newsstands Monday, examines the
abatements GM won locally in recent years, particularly one that
came after the company apparently hinted that a plant expansion
could go elsewhere if the Kettering Moraine school board didn't
approve a tax break.
</P>
<P>
   The board agreed to the abatement _ which allowed GM to keep $4
million in taxes over a 10-year period _ but threatened to reverse
the decision when it learned Moraine really had no competition for
the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   GM apologized, and the school board allowed the tax break to
stand.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said the incident was emblematic of a company
``that has secured hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate
welfare at the same time that it has eliminated thousands of
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is their opinion,'' responded GM spokesman Gerry Holmes.
``If no one (else) were getting those benefits, that would be fine
with us. . . . (But) we have to pursue these abatements to be
responsible to our shareholders. Our competitors are pursuing them,
and just to keep even, we have to do so as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Christina Manchester, a member of the Kettering school board and
one who voted to approve GM's tax break, expressed mixed feelings
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not agree with abatements,''she said. ``I do not think
schools should be put in this position. But they have and until
they change, we're in a very difficult position.''
</P>
<P>
   GM's tax breaks are a small part of Time's overall story, which
concludes that government tax breaks and subsidies to corporations
rarely create any jobs and end up costing taxpayers money. The
federal government alone gives away $125 billion a year, the
magazine reported.

MICROSOFT ACCUSES FIVE COMPUTER SELLERS OF PIRACY  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Microsoft Corp. is suing seven Texas computer
resellers, including five in Houston, accusing them of infringing
on the company's copyrights and trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in Dallas and Houston on
Oct. 27, also allege that all but one of the companies distributed
counterfeit versions of Windows 95 and Office Professional 97.
</P>
<P>
   The five Houston companies are ACS Technology, Biway
International Technology, CPU Distributing, Essex Computers and
Megadyne Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas companies are AR Technologies and SMI Liquidiation.
</P>
<P>
   Megadyne, which does business in Houston as Precision Computers,
is the one company not hit with counterfeit software charges.
</P>
<P>
   AR Technologies is accused of putting unauthorized copies of
Windows 95 and Office Professional 97 on the hard disks of
computers it sold, a practice known as ``hard disk loading.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said hard disk loading, counterfeit distribution by
resellers and unauthorized multiple installations of software in
businesses are the three most prevalent forms of software piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Issa, president of Essex Computers of Houston, told
Reuters News Service he was seeking legal advice and intended to
fight the Microsoft lawsuit. He said his company had not intended
to sell counterfeit Microsoft products and had purchased equipment
in good faith from distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a spokesman for Biway in Houston said there had been
no intent to sell counterfeit Microsoft products. He said Biway had
been cooperating with Microsoft sales representatives to identify
counterfeits.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Lain, an attorney for ACS, said he was in discussions
with Microsoft's lawyers about the suit and could not comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   The other Houston companies either had no comment, or did not
return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The suits were spurred by tips to an anti-software-piracy hot
line operated by Microsoft. The software giant gets approximately
2,000 calls and e-mail messages a month about potentially pirated
products. &QL;

BMC ACQUIRES BOOLE &AMP; BABBAGE AND ANOTHER SILICON VALLEY FOOTHOLD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ BMC Software's $877 million acquisition of Boole &AMP;
Babbage financially combines two companies, but their customers
have been putting them together for years.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, formally announced Monday, creates a software
company with approximately $1.1 billion in combined revenues. BMC's
global workforce will swell from 3,200 to 4,400, and Boole's San
Jose, Calif., offices will give BMC another recruiting foothold in
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The all-stock transaction has Houston-based BMC giving .675
shares of its stock for every share of Boole &AMP; Babbage. The deal is
expected to close by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, company executives said it will place BMC in the
``next tier'' of competition, where it will face down such giants
as Computer Associates and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   It's a marriage that's been in the works for about two months,
said Max P. Watson Jr., BMC's chief executive, when BMC first
approached Boole about a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attractive combination, and shame on me, we should
have done it earlier,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   BMC's stock closed Monday at 46 1/16, down 2 on volume of 7.9
million shares. Boole &AMP; Babbage closed at 30 [, up 3 {, a 52-week
high, on volume of 5.3 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies make software designed to be used on big computer
mainframes, as well as on sprawling corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   BMC's products are used to monitor, enhance and maintain large
applications, such as databases and workflow management software.
</P>
<P>
   Boole's products, on the other hand, do the same thing for the
computer systems themselves, making sure that networks and
computers are functioning properly and automatically fixing them if
need be.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said the goal is to create products that mesh seamlessly.
For example, the companies might combine their various monitoring
products so that technicians can track nearly every aspect of a
mainframe running a sophisticated database from a single
software-based control panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers need a more integrated system,'' Watson said.
``Boole &AMP; Babbage operates in the same general area as BMC, but
there is no product or revenue overlap. We can extend our reach to
reach to areas that are complementary.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer network managers have been figuring out ways to make
the two companies' products work together, usually by cobbling
together an on-screen display that presents the programs side by
side.
</P>
<P>
   But customers like Bert Cooley, a technical leader in the
information services division of New York State Electric and Gas,
said he hopes the merger will result in a more integrated product
line.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley said he uses BMC software designed to speed up and
maintain his operation's databases, and a Boole program called
Command Post that lets him monitor his network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put together an interface (that joins the programs), but
it's very minimal,'' said Cooley. ``That is one of the things I
would be looking for in this merger. It would make it much easier
to monitor everything that's going on from one location.''
</P>
<P>
   Boole, a relatively old company in the high-tech world, was
founded in 1967 and bears the names of two early legends of
computing. George Boole (1815-1864) is considered the father of
computer science. Charles Babbage (1791-1871) is credited with the
design of the modern computer, which he called a ``difference and
analytical engine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul E. Newton, Boole's president and chief executive, said
the company will drop its name and become a part of BMC, though it
will maintain its San Jose headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Newton said he will stay on until some time next year to help
with the integration of the two companies. He also said only a
handful of jobs will be lost, most likely in the combining of
regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies were born in an era when the mainframe computer
was king. And both have successfully weathered the transition in
corporations to what's known as distributed computing, in which
different kinds of machines are linked by complex networks.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies who design programs for use on mainframes and
networks have found their stock battered in recent weeks as several
bellwethers _ most notably PeopleSoft and Baan Systems _ have
reported poor earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But Melissa Eisenstat, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer in New
York, said that while information systems managers may be buying
fewer products from those companies, the outlook for BMC and Boole
&AMP; Babbage is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today are trying to digest all the software they have
bought, and they are having problems doing so,'' Eisenstat said.
``BMC and Boole make software that makes all the other software you
bought work.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstat said the acquisition bumps up her estimate of BMC's
one-year profits by nickel to 1.95 a share. &QL;

   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ As rescue workers throughout Central
America struggled Monday to reach scores of remote peasant
settlements left battered and isolated by Hurricane Mitch,
authorities in Nicaragua and Honduras said the combined death toll
from the storm and its aftermath was likely to surpass 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are corpses everywhere _ victims of landslides or of the
waters,'' Carlos Flores Facusse, the president of Honduras, said in
a grim television address on Monday afternoon after a thorough
inspection tour of his stunned and beleaguered nation of 4 million
people. ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and
ruin throughout the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   There also were reports of numerous deaths and widespread damage
to property and crops in El Salvador and Guatemala from the storm
and the torrential rains and region-wide flooding that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual late-season storm was being classified as one of the
worst natural disasters to strike the region in modern times,
perhaps even eclipsing the devastating earthquakes that leveled
this city in 1972 and flattened parts of Guatemala in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen earthquakes, droughts, two wars, cyclones and
tidal waves,'' said Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Managua and the nation's senior religious
figure. ``But this is undoubtedly the worst thing that I have ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Hurricane Mitch packed 180 mph winds, making it a
deadly category five storm, the most powerful on the Saffir-Simpson
scale. But it had a compact eye and was on a course that kept it
out over the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Honduras, far away from
population and agricultural centers.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane turned deadly as it disintegrated, though. It was
blocked from moving northward by a powerful front over the Gulf of
Mexico and was stalled for six days, a pattern that Max Mayfield of
the National Hurricane Center in Miami called ``extremely
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   It dumped as much as two feet of rain a day throughout the
region, inundating not just coastal and mountain areas, but also
large cities bisected by rivers whose flow was swollen far beyond
their normal capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras alone, ``the number of dead could surpass 5,000,''
Lt. Col. Saul Castillo, a member of that country's Civil Defense
Commission, estimated on Monday. But another relief official, Dimas
Alonzo of the Honduran National Emergency Committee, acknowledged
in a radio interview: ``We will probably never know how many people
died.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Nicaragua, the focal point of rescue efforts Monday was
the region of Posoltega, at the foot of the Casitas Volcano, about
50 miles northwest of the capital, in the province of Chinandega.
At least 800 people have been confirmed dead in a series of mud
slides over the weekend there, and another 2,000 people are
reported missing and are feared dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hear people buried in the debris imploring us to help
them,'' said one shaken resident-turned-rescue worker, who would
give his name only as Nicolas. ``But there was nothing we could do
for them. It was the most impotent I have ever felt in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers who arrived in the area on Sunday said that
perhaps as much as 30 square miles had been affected by the
mudslides, which entombed at least five peasant villages. ``It's
like a wilderness there now,'' Rosa Caballero, a survivor who was
evacuated to a nearby hospital, said Monday. ``You don't see
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, soldiers, relief workers and evacuees, many of whom
were visibly disturbed by what they had seen, used phrases like ``a
vision out of Dante'' or ``a deluge of Biblical proportions'' to
describe the destruction. Somber news reports on Nicaraguan
television showed bodies half-buried in mud or pinned against tree
trunks or tiny limbs protruding stiffly from piles of debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of children dead,'' said Graciela Saenz, a
relief worker who has been in the area. ``It's horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The devastation is so extensive that Pedro Joaquin Chamorro
Barrios, the country's minister of defense, said that it may be
impossible ever to obtain an accurate count of fatalities. For that
reason, he recommended in a report made public Monday that ``it
would be appropriate to declare the area of the tragedy a `national
cemetery''' and seal it off.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even as they struggled to mobilize military and Red Cross units,
government officials and disaster relief experts throughout the
region warned that more problems were on the way. The difficulty in
recovering the bodies of human victims and the widespread
destruction of livestock was rapidly creating the danger of
epidemics of cholera, dengue fever and other diseases, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The growing shortage of food and water in rural areas cut off
from the rest of the country was equally alarming. Many warehouses
where foodstuffs were stored have been destroyed, roads that would
normally bring goods from commercial centers are impassable, and
crops of beans, bananas, vegetables and coffee have been largely
washed away.
</P>
<P>
   In both Nicaragua and Honduras, nearly every bridge was reported
to have suffered damage of some sort, with perhaps a majority left
unusable. On both sides of the border between the two countries,
traffic is backed up for miles, with some truck drivers reporting
that they have been stuck in one spot for six days, sleeping in
their cabs and depending on the generosity of local people for
food.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the U.S. Agency for International Development
announced that it was providing $3.5 million in emergency
assistance as a first step in recovery efforts. ``We'll be looking
at what else we can do,'' President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, the Honduran leader, has estimated that 70 percent of
the infrastructure in his country, already the poorest in the
Western Hemisphere other than Haiti, has been destroyed. Bridges,
roads, communications, ports, hospitals and schools have all been
so seriously affected that it will take years for the economy to
recover, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has been struck a severe blow in every sense,''
he said on Monday. ``There's practically no place or region that
has not been affected.''
</P>
<P>
   To cope with that deteriorating situation and the outbreaks of
looting that it has triggered, Flores announced a ``state of
exception'' on Monday afternoon allowing the temporary suspension
of some civil liberties. The measure will give the police the right
to unlimited searches and seizures of property, as well as expanded
powers to detain suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floods and landslides have erased many villages and
households from the map, as well as whole neighborhoods of
cities,'' he said. ``I ask the international community for human
solidarity.''

REPUBLICANS WANT VOTES TO SEND A MESSAGE ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Over breakfast Monday at a diner in Santa Monica, Calif.,
Lorraine Hoover expressed the sentiment of many voters who are
poised to send the Republican-controlled Congress a message Tuesday
about the impeachment case against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republicans are wrong,'' said Hoover, a registered
Republican and retired junior high school English teacher from
Thayne, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover said she weighed the costly investigation into whether
Clinton and the former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky,
engaged in ``sex between two consenting adults'' when she recently
cast her absentee ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally vote the person,'' Hoover said. ``This time it was
straight ticket, a no-brainer. I thought if Republicans were voting
Democratic, that would send a message.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Clinton's impeachment case may hang in the balance
Tuesday, as tens of millions of voters head to the polls amid
varying degrees of disdain for Clinton's sex scandal and disgust
with the congressional response to it.
</P>
<P>
   Impeach the president, censure him, or rebuke an overreaching
Congress. By most accounts, the results of Tuesday's mid-term
congressional elections are likely to be interpreted by leaders on
Capitol Hill as a referendum on the historic impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If they had their way, scores of prospective voters across the
country said in recent days, they would send Clinton and the
Congress a common message: Stop the wrangling and move on.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews from Boston to San Francisco Bay, a small number
of voters called for Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I find him a despicable person, and he needs to be put
out,'' said Jack O'Connell, 49, a ``government worker'' and
registered Republican, of Apopka, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he plans to vote for a straight Republican ticket
in the hope congressional GOP leaders will make Clinton's
impeachment their top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But most shared the sentiments of Keith Howard, 24, of Norwood,
who said he wants Congress to drop the impeachment inquiry ``for
the best interest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard, waiting for a train at South Station after studying
downtown for a job in the travel industry, said he voted for Texas
billionaire Ross Perot in the last presidential election ``because
I didn't think he was a womanizer.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wants no more time wasted examining Clinton's alleged
womanizing. ``I'm not Hillary,'' Howard said, ``so I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others said they detest Clinton's personal failures, but
they praised his performance as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think he was a great president, but this whole thing
with Monica Lewinsky is just too cheap,'' said Mandy Samuels, 23, a
waitress and single mother from Maitland, Fla. ``He reminds me of
too many middle-aged guys who come on to me _ more than just
flirting, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   But Samuels said she is voting Democratic in her House and
Senate races because she wants to send the message that Clinton
should remain in office. ``He's been good for the country. What can
I say? I don't want my little girl to grow up in a country run by
gun nuts and religious fanatics, so Clinton's the man,'' Samuels
said.
</P>
<P>
   The refrain was similar among some voters interviewed in
Chicago. Dylan Lower, 20, a Kansas native and registered
Independent who is studying in Chicago, said he is more likely to
support Democrats because he believes the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, has searched overzealously for dirt on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the matter, period,'' Lower said. ``It's been
blown up into something bigger than it needs to have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Both apathy and disillusionment were abundant among eligible
voters across the country, an indication of what many analysts have
predicted will be an abysmal turnout. A large number of eligible
voters said they had not bothered registering to vote and many
others said they were too busy to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Among most of the non-voters, the general attitude was, why
bother, since it doesn't matter anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But many other eligible voters were plenty bothered by the
Republican push for the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I appreciate what Clinton did, but my senator
didn't tell him to go play around with Monica,'' said Martha
Graeber, a Seattle shipping manager who considers herself an
Independent. ``What I don't want is them harping on this. I want
them watching the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wresley Rush, a retired radio broadcaster from the San Francisco
Bay area, is a registered Republican who rarely votes Democratic.
``But I'd vote for Clinton at the drop of a coin because he's done
a great job,'' Rush said. ``I'm in his corner.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's supporting Democrats in part to prove it, including
voting for Senator Barbara Boxer, who is seen by many Republicans
as an extreme liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans hurt themselves tremendously by pursuing
this,'' said Rush. ``There's going to be a backlash against them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Siler, who said she tends to vote Democratic, said she
is not sure Democrats would run Congress any better than
Republicans have.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult time to decide how to vote,'' said Siler,
55, an administrative assistant for an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, which is solid Clinton country, the sex
scandal appears to have diminished support for him, and for
Democrats, not a whit. If anything, the Republican appetite for the
scandal has bolstered convictions in this liberal, heavily
Democratic region that the Republicans are preoccupied with
vengeful pettiness and must be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Leonard, who was arranging a paper turkey display in the
window of his pet shop in the Glen Park neighborhood on Sunday
afternoon, said the scandal indeed had affected the way he would
vote _ but not by provoking the anti-Democratic backlash predicted
by the Republicans. ``It's made me more positive than ever that
I've got to get the Republicans out of there,'' said Leonard, a
registered Democrat in his 50s. ``They're wasting my time and
money.''

AS NETANYAHU STALLS, ARAFAT QUICKLY ACCEPTS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With their new interim peace accord stopped in place
the day it was formally to begin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat both insisted Monday
that the carefully sequenced security-for-land plan can still
proceed nearly on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of his Palestinian and American counterparts,
Netanyahu announced late Sunday that the accord signed in
Washington on Oct. 23 would not ``come into effect'' until it is
ratified by Israel's Cabinet and Parliament, delaying the next
promised withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu phoned Arafat Monday to report that Israel's Attorney
General had said Israel's commitments would not be binding until
the Cabinet and Parliament act, a process expected to take a week
or more. Netanyahu's spokesman said Arafat ``accepted'' this
explanation, as well as a pledge to begin withdrawing Israeli
troops from a further 2 percent of the occupied territories in two
to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me for a few days,'' Arafat said Monday evening in
Ramallah. ``They asked me to accept it, and I accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was extended debate in Israel on Monday over whether
Israeli legal norms mandated some formal ratification for the Wye
Memorandum, named after the place in Maryland where negotiations
were held. But American and Palestinian officials saw Netanyahu's
bid for time as a political rather then a legal necessity, as he
tries to protect his narrow majority against right-wing defections
and left-wing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's government survived a motion of confidence by a
single vote Monday. It might have fallen had it not been for the
support of Israeli Arab legislators aligned with Arafat _ probably
the least likely saviors Netanyahu ever envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   As repeatedly noted Monday by Palestinian negotiators and
Netanyahu's critics on the left, the Wye Memorandum states flatly
that it ``will enter into force 10 days from the date of
signature,'' or Nov. 2, without reference to any subsequent
ratification or approval procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American diplomats here, while acknowledging that they
were caught off guard by Netanyahu, stressed what they saw as the
positive significance of his well-publicized consultation with
Arafat and Arafat's conspicuous refusal to criticize the unexpected
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's advisers downplayed the move, predicting the Cabinet
will approve the memorandum by Wednesday, with the full Parliament
following suit next week. Independent analysts concur that the Wye
pact should win strong majority backing in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, this will delay redeployment by two or three
days, that's all,'' said David Bar-Illan, a government spokesman.
``So we will begin implementing the withdrawal by the 18th or the
19th, instead of the 16th.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat vowed to adhere to the original timetable, including the
presentation to the CIA on Monday of a plan for seizing illegal
weapons and arresting terrorism suspects.
</P>
<P>
   American officials confirmed receiving such a plan Monday and
said it fulfilled Palestinian commitments. But it remained unclear
whether it was presented as a document or as a verbal briefing,
and, if the latter, whether this would satisfy Israeli demands for
a detailed, written statement on counterterrorism strategy from the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Monday evening that Arafat was saying that his
plan had been presented and ``discussed'' with both the Americans
and the Israelis, the Netanyahu government was contending that the
Palestinian plan is incomplete and thus not in compliance with the
Wye accords.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu finds himself forced to balance carrying out the Wye
accord against his own short-term political survival, and his
negotiating partners appear to appreciate the difficulty of this
high-wire act. Over the next 12 weeks, if the Wye pact is put into
effect as planned, Netanyahu must turn over another 13 percent of
the West Bank to Palestinian control in three stages, moves certain
to provoke bitter public protests from right-wing Israelis.

RESULTS WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON ISSUES, MANY FEEL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By this time Wednesday, nearly all the winners will
be known in 34 Senate races, 435 House contests and elections for
governor in 36 states. What will not be clear is this: What should
all those politicians do with their new power?
</P>
<P>
   From Social Security to education and tax policy, advocates for
some of the most heated issues of the day say the 1998 election
will produce few clues, and certainly little consensus, about the
direction that voters want their elected leaders to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a missed opportunity, and I don't think the election
results will tell us anything,'' said Robert Bixby, policy director
for the Concord Coalition, which is trying to foster a national
discussion about the financially troubled Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits are calling it ``the Seinfeld election,'' an election
that, like the TV show, is essentially about nothing. ``There are
just no prevailing national issues this time,'' said Jennifer Duffy
of the Cook Political Report, who popularized the Seinfeld line.
</P>
<P>
   How should we fix Social Security? Should we raise the
retirement age? Give workers their own stock accounts? Use our
first-in-a-generation surplus to shore up the program? Few
candidates waded into these details, analysts say, so the election
will likely give little insight about solutions.
</P>
<P>
   With one-quarter of the world in recession, candidates might
have debated ways to make sure the US economy does not falter. But
few candidates talked about whether we can boost growth by changing
the tax code, or by spending our way out of a future slowdown, or
about other solutions. A proposal to give President Clinton ``fast
track'' powers to sign new trade treaties became a contentious
issue in Congress this session, but it barely registered with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had some honest policy discourse on those
issues...Neither party wants to discuss an economic slowdown when
everyone is trying to take credit for the surplus and our economic
success story so far,'' said Bruce Josten, executive vice president
at the US Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   With the single-rate ``flat tax'' a hot issue in the last
presidential race, candidates might have given a clue about whether
they would scrap the current tax code for something new. ``I
haven't heard of a single case where it's surfaced as an issue in
any race,'' said Dale Jorgenson, a Harvard University economist who
promotes taxing consumption instead of income.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of responding to a national theme, voters will head to
the polls Tuesday because of local personalities, local issues and,
in many cases, to register their opinion about whether to punish
President Clinton for lying about an extramarital affair. ``The
public isn't clamoring for Washington to embark on some big new
program or for the government to stop doing something,'' Josten
said. ``We are literally into the Tip O'Neil `All politics is
local' debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of candidates, for example, are talking about education.
But the issue in Massachusetts turns on expanded teacher testing,
as promoted in different forms by both major candidates for
governor, while in South Carolina the debate is whether to create a
state lottery to finance public education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to education, Democrats are talking about the need
to shore up Social Security and to give patients new powers when
fighting their health maintenance organizations for medical
coverage. But so are Republicans. ``Candidates will say they all
agree that something has to be done about HMOs, but we have
different ways of getting there. And no one really gets to the
details of what the different ways are,'' said Duffy of the Cook
report.
</P>
<P>
   That means that no matter which party comes out ahead Tuesday,
it will be hard to find a mandate for any policy changes, said
Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll. Teasing out a
mandate will be far harder than in 1994, when Republicans laid out
their platform in the Contract with America, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the results will be particularly hard, Newport said,
because a strong Democratic showing may have less to do with the
party's policy ideas than with the voters' distaste for how
Republicans have handled the impeachment process. Similarly, it
will be hard to know if voters chose Republicans in order to
support GOP programs or to help remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a national theme may have to do with the fact that
Americans are fairly happy these days. When the Gallup Organization
surveyed people this year on various aspects of their lives, such
as their income, safety from physical harm and prospects for the
future, people reported levels of satisfaction as high as any since
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, politicians are now polling so relentlessly that they
can form positions that conform to the public's view, Newport said.
``You look at all this -- that we are basically a happy nation,
that politicians are sensitive to our positions, and that the
public is not looking for dramatic change right now -- and it will
be hard to tease out an urgent message from whatever happens in the
election,'' Newport said.
</P>
<P>
   Some policy advocates say that a mid-term election is the wrong
forum for debating the details of national policy. ``A presidential
election is more appropriate,'' said Jorgenson, the Harvard
economist. ``Congressional elections are local in character.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health
consumer advocacy group, said that elections tend to turn on broad
themes, rather than on details. He said he was satisfied that a
large number of candidates backed the ``Patients Bill of Rights,''
which would give patients more powers when fighting HMOs for
medical care. It did not trouble him that in few races did the
candidates debate individual provisions, such as when HMOs must
cover emergency care or whether patients should have new rights to
sue insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it would be better if we had those details, but you
often can't get to that level of specificity in a campaign. I think
it's asking a little bit too much,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some advocates hoped that the elections this year would
have produced a greater number of nuanced, substantive debates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats rallied behind President Clinton's call to hire
100,000 new teachers, and Republicans also talked about reducing
class sizes. But some critics complained that few candidates talked
about how to train all those teachers, or about how to retain the
good teachers who commonly leave the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to have heard a candidate say, `Ladies and
gentlemen, no teacher in (Massachusetts) should ever have to teach
more than 80 children in a semester. How are we going to rearrange
the money now spent so that teachers have a class load that is at
least close to what is required for serious work?' '' said Ted
Sizer, a former Brown University guru on high school excellence who
now leads a charter school, with his wife, at what used to be Fort
Devens in Ayer, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But these questions get into the ``painful substance'' of
setting spending priorities. It is easier to lean instead on the
call for 100,000 new teachers, Sizer said.

N.Y. SENATOR RACE IN DEAD HEAT, POLLS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton came to New York again Monday,
making her fourth appearance in the past month to rally Democrats
behind Charles Schumer's campaign to oust three-term incumbent
Republican Alfonse D'Amato from the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day before the vote in the closest, bitterest, and
most expensive contest in the country, both candidates scrambled to
solidify their bases _ Schumer and Mrs. Clinton speaking to a labor
union in Manhattan, and D'Amato joining Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
former mayor Edward Koch on a stroll through the Russian-immigrant
enclave of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Every poll paints the contest as a statistical dead heat, with
Schumer way ahead in the city, D'Amato somewhat ahead upstate, and
the two neck-and-neck in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, who are very popular here, have involved
themselves in this race with unusual intensity. Besides the first
lady's weekly visits, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
have each come to Schumer's side twice.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when five Democratic senators are in danger of losing
elections, Schumer, a congressman from Brooklyn for the past 18
years, is one of the few candidates who could unseat a Republican _
and the kingpin of New York's Republican Party, at that.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made only a veiled reference to her husband's
political scandals, saying that Republican victories in this
election would mean ``another year of partisanship'' instead of
dealing with social problems.
</P>
<P>
   The main mission of this trip _ and of the most recent trips by
the president and Gore _ appeared to be a get-out-the-vote cry
aimed mainly at the city's blacks, almost all of whom are Democrats
but few of whom vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we vote, we win,'' Schumer told more than 500 members of
the largely black local of the Service Employees International
Union, leading them in a chant of the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who was wildly applauded, exhorted the workers to
tell all their friends to vote. She acknowledged that often the
differences between candidates seem small, but added, ``You sure
can't say that this time,'' noting the gulf between the two on gun
control, public education, Medicare, and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   She also played on the gospel-like atmosphere of the rally,
saying, ``There are only two places where you are equal _ in church
before God, and in the voting booth.'' The crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
   New York Democrats have recently lost key races because minority
and working-class city dwellers turned out in low numbers. In the
1994 governor's race, residents of New York City, who made up 40
percent of the state's voting-age population, supplied just 28
percent of the vote. As a result, Democrat Mario Cuomo lost to
small-town upstate Republican George W. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Schumer flew to Albany and Buffalo, the upstate
cities with the largest pockets of Democratic support. D'Amato also
plowed through Long Island, the suburban area where the Republican
organization is strongest.
</P>
<P>
   In Brighton Beach, Koch and Giuliani, speaking on the street to
a few dozen people, mainly Russian Jews, pushed all the right
buttons, noting D'Amato's record in helping Israel, Soviet
immigrants, and the Jews who were attacked in the 1991 Crown
Heights race riot.
</P>
<P>
   The three politicians were joined by the mother of Yankel
Rosenbaum, the Talmudic scholar who was killed in that riot. She
said she flew all the way from Australia, where she now lives, to
help get out the vote for D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Jews, who make up 15 percent of New York's voters, could be a
deciding force in this election. D'Amato, who is Catholic but long
active in Jewish causes, won 40 percent of the Jewish vote in his
last election, a startlingly high number for a Republican. Schumer,
who is Jewish, has taken back much of that group, slicing its
support for D'Amato in half, according to one poll.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who also campaigned with Giuliani in the heavily Jewish
neighborhood of Borough Park on Sunday, must know that boosting his
share by a mere percentage point or two could put him over the top.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has taken a slight slide in the past couple weeks, first
after calling Schumer a ``putzhead,'' a Yiddish vulgarism, then
giving a shrill performance in two televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   He has scored most points in attacking Schumer's failure to show
up for many votes in the House this past year while out
campaigning. This tactic seemed to have some effect in Brighton
Beach. Simon Komissar, a neighborhood leader who came out to greet
D'Amato, said of the Democratic challenger, ``He's done little.''
Joseph Kruglach agreed: ``Sure, Schumer's Jewish, but that doesn't
mean anything. What matters is, he doesn't vote.''

LONDON FUTURES EXCHANGE TO REORGANIZE
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Under pressure to make its trading system faster and
cheaper, the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange on Monday announced a sweeping reorganization intended to
cut its operating costs in half by the end of next year. The
changes will mean a loss of 600 of its 1,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was the latest indication that the exchange,
known as Liffe, is under growing pressure _ predominantly from the
new German-Swiss Eurex futures exchange _ to accelerate its move
toward screen-based trading and away from its slower and more
costly open-outcry system.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williamson, the new chairman of the London exchange, said
it ``needs to act decisively and quickly'' against sharp
competition. The London derivatives market _ once unchallenged as
the biggest of its kind in Europe _ has been under increasing
pressure since the Deutsche Terminborse, Frankfurt's futures
market, seized control of the benchmark 10-year German bond market
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   With the creation of a German-Swiss electronic futures exchange,
Liffe has been caught up in such competition between European
exchanges in advance of the January introduction of the euro, the
single European currency, which will change European trading by
creating huge bond and stock markets denominated in the new
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Liffe executives said at a news conference Monday that the
reorganization would be carried out on three levels: cost savings,
including a reduction in the number of employees to 400 by the end
1999; a quest for new partners in different time zones, and changes
in regulations now modeled on the practices at Chicago trading-pit
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that nothing remotely like our current cost base
is sustainable and that we shall have to cut jobs to remain
competitive,'' Williamson said. The cuts are supposed to reduce the
exchange's operating budget to about $100 million by the end of
next year from more than $200 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deliver an efficient trading platform and products
that our customers want at a price they are prepared to pay,'' he
said. ``It is clear we shall have to cut jobs to remain
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Liffe executives declined to comment on potential new partners.
In the past, traders have spoken of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
as a possible partner, mirroring negotiations reportedly under way
between Frankfurt-based futures traders and the Chicago Board of
Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liffe and the London Clearing House have also discussed closer
cooperation. Williamson also said that ``one of the strategies is
to talk to Chicago and Frankfurt.''
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to travel to Chicago this week, but ruled out an
announcement there. ``We have a program starting quite soon where
we will take up offers of interest and we will initiate talks,''
Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   The third aspect of the changes involves drawing up regulations
for automated trading, Liffe executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement showed how much the introduction of the euro is
pushing markets into alliances beyond their traditional boundaries.
Frankfurt and London have become the main rivals for derivatives
trading, while some smaller futures exchanges, such as the Matif in
Paris, have thus far been squeezed out.

RENEWAL OF TWO-PARTY POLITICS AT STAKE IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Massachusetts citizens head to the polls Tuesday,
they may decide an issue that has scarcely been talked about:
Whether the state will take a small step toward a competitive
two-party system or slip further toward Democratic dominance.
</P>
<P>
   That question has been shrouded by the gubernatorial race, where
the Republican incumbent, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, appears to
be holding an election-eve lead, according to polls. But further
down the ballot, GOP prospects are not so sanguine, despite a
ticket as good as any the party has fielded in years.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Brad Bailey, the party's nominee for attorney
general, and Michael Duffy, its choice for auditor, are bright,
articulate, experienced candidates who have run impressive _ albeit
underfunded _ campaigns against opponents who have chosen to lie
low.
</P>
<P>
   In 6th District congressional candidate Peter Torkildsen, the
GOP boasts a candidate who has actually held the seat before. And
in the 3d District, state Senator Matthew J. Amorello of Grafton,
an experienced legislator, is making a run at US Representative
James P. McGovern, who as a first-termer is in an incumbent's most
vulnerable period.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a state where late-focusing voters tend to have an
underlying Democratic reflex, polls show all but Cellucci are
running uphill.
</P>
<P>
   On the legislative front, some party activists hope for a gain
of three to five seats. ``We're optimistic,'' said Marc DeCourcy,
executive director of the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend, other Republicans said it would be a
victory if their small band is not diminished even further. They
now hold 28 of the 160 House seats. On the Senate side, GOP leaders
hope to pick up one or two seats to add to their current seven in
the 40-member body, still far short of their numbers in 1991-92,
when they had 16 senators, two more than the 14 needed to uphold a
gubernatorial veto.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the GOP's biggest worry, that Democratic nominee
Scott Harshbarger will upset Cellucci. If so, Beacon Hill would be
run by the Democrats, and the Republican Party might well be
reduced to the political impotence it experienced in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   So why does a party whose leaders argue they have governed well
for almost a decade find itself in such a situation?
</P>
<P>
   In part, it's because a rising economic tide tends to buoy all
incumbents, and most incumbents are currently Democratic. In part,
it's because in low-attention years voters' reflex voting habits
kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Still, political specialists say there's real benefit from
strong two-party competition in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vigorous two-party system works better in a lot of ways,''
said Bob Woodbury, director of the McCormack Institute at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston. ``It tends to bring new
people into the political system, and it tends to lead to a better
debate on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a point the Republicans think they proved in 1991, when,
at Governor William Weld's insistence, the state's fiscal problems
were solved by slashing spending rather than hiking taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On a swing through the state a few weeks ago, former Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole, the Republican Party's 1996 candidate
for president, urged voters to think about sending a Republican or
two to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a Republican Congress _ nobody argues
that _ for the next foreseeable future,'' Dole said. ``Obviously,
it is very helpful to have a conduit to Republican majorities in
the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as former congressman Mickey Edwards, now a public-policy
lecturer at the Kennedy School, puts it: ``When you elect only
Democrats and you have a Republican Congress, people in
Massachusetts are basically cut out of the decision-making. A state
that has people only in one party just loses half of its influence
automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow in government studies at the
Brookings Institution, says that states can maximize their clout by
having a senator of each party, but he is unsure whether adding one
Republican will pay much of a dividend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is terribly useful for a state to have one Republican
senator and one Democratic senator,'' Hess said. ``But one freshman
House member? I think that is a little marginal. I don't know how
much they would be able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Massachusetts is widely considered a longtime
Democratic bastion, that's only true if one has a short-term
historical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   From the end of the Civil War until 1940, Massachusetts was
fertile ground for progressive Republicans, who regularly beat more
conservative Democrats. In that period, the GOP won 49 governor's
races, with the Democrats prevailing in only 15.
</P>
<P>
   The next quarter-century was a period of growing Democratic
strength. With Tip O'Neill leading, Democrats won control of the
state House of Representatives in the election of 1948. The state
Senate fell to the Democrats a decade later, in 1958, and the 1960s
saw precipitous dropoffs in GOP strength in both bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republican Party remained highly competitive for
statewide offices. From 1940 through 1974, the GOP won nine
contests, while the Democrats took six of those elections.
</P>
<P>
   It was only with the elections of 1974 and 1978 that the
Democrats drove the GOP into near extinction, seizing control of
all the constitutional offices and the second US Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   That era also saw a transformation of party philosophy and base.
The Republicans, once a progressive party, became Reaganized. The
Democrats, once the party of ethnic city dwellers, increasingly
came to represent the lifestyle liberalism of suburban voters.
</P>
<P>
   Running for reelection in 1986, Governor Michael S. Dukakis
declared that Massachusetts didn't need any Republicans, and voters
seemed to agree. With the state GOP having taken a right turn, the
state had only one elected Republican of any consequence, US
Representative Silvio Conte of Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP really came back to life in the fiscal crisis of the
late 1980s. It was that upheaval, and the two large tax hikes it
took to staunch the red ink, that helped Weld and Cellucci squeak
into office as governor and lieutenant governor in the election of
1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans claim credit for fixing the fiscal mess, and
polls show that voters agree with them. Meanwhile, Weld and
Cellucci built an eclectic coalition by making inroads into groups
that had usually voted Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start with 15 percent (of registered voters) and you
have to get to 50 percent, you have to stretch a lot more than if
you start at 40 percent and you have to get to 50 percent,'' said
long-time political observer Ralph Whitehead, a journalism
professor at the University of Massachusetts. ``Frankly, Weld and
Cellucci have been fairly resourceful and flexible in getting to
50.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weld didn't put much effort into party-building. Feeling
that the Republican State Committee was a welter of feuds and
infighting, he preferred to keep it at arm's length. That meant
that even though Weld was successful, the party itself was not.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci may have other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Cellucci is going to put his stamp on the party,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Brian Lees of East Longmeadow. ``He is
committed to building the party. He believes in grassroots
politics.''

COMMENTARY: IS THIS AMERICA? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``How can this be in America?'' Julie Hiatt Steele
asked. ``It's not the country I thought I lived in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele is an obscure person _ a nobody, as she says. But she
has become a target of Kenneth Starr, and that has changed her
life. She has been threatened by Starr's prosecutors and shouted at
by FBI agents. She, her daughter, her brother and her former lawyer
have been called before a grand jury. Her tax returns, bank
records, credit report and telephone records have been subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   All this has happened because Ms. Steele once was a friend of
Kathleen Willey, who said President Clinton made a pass at her in
the White House in 1993. Ms. Willey said she was so upset that she
went to Ms. Steele's home that night and told her what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997 Ms. Steele told Newsweek, which was looking into
the story, that she had had that visit from Ms. Willey. But in
August of that year _ before its report was published, and five
months before the Monica Lewinsky story broke _ she told Newsweek
that she had lied at Ms. Willey's request, that there had been no
such visit. She has stuck to that position ever since.
</P>
<P>
   This matters to Starr because he wants to send the House
Judiciary Committee another reason to impeach Clinton: that he lied
in denying the pass at Kathleen Willey. Ms. Steele stands in the
way of that objective. So Starr is trying to break her, suggesting
that she was paid or pressured into calling the Willey story false.
</P>
<P>
   I telephoned Julie Steele after reading an article about her
situation by Jill Abramson in The New York Times. She is 52 years
old, divorced, and lives in Richmond, Va., with Adam, the
8-year-old son she adopted in Romania in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Last March she was visited by two FBI agents working for the
Starr office. ``They yelled at me,'' Ms. Steele said. They assumed
her guilt, asking her who made her do it.
</P>
<P>
   In June she was subpoenaed to go before the Starr grand jury in
Washington. She was told she was being called as a witness _ but
afterward, retroactively, they said she was a target. In five hours
of questioning she was asked mostly about Newsweek. There were
virtually no questions about Ms. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in that grand jury appearance, Ms. Steele said, she
asked if she could speak with her lawyer, Nancy Luque _ a request
that prosecutors routinely honor. ``They said that if I continued
doing that, I might be obstructing justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In August Ms. Steele was subpoenaed again. This time Ms. Luque
advised her to invoke her privilege against forced
self-incrimination. Justice Department rules say prosecutors should
not call people who intend to rely on the Fifth Amendment, but the
Starr prosecutors insisted she go before the grand jury and invoke
it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Starr's office told the Judiciary Committee that it
was still considering other possible grounds for impeachment. After
that, there was another flurry of actions against Ms. Steele. The
subpoenas went out for her family members and former lawyer; the
prosecutors said the attorney-client privilege did not apply.
(Starr has tried to destroy that privilege in case after case.)
</P>
<P>
   Her 30-year-old daughter, Liza, was asked in the grand jury
about the fact that she stayed with her mother last spring. Why
hadn't she paid rent?
</P>
<P>
   Then FBI agents questioned Ms. Steele's neighbors. They asked
about her finances and about her adoption of Adam, which they
seemed to suggest was illegal. In fact Ms. Steele went through
Romanian and then, to be meticulous, Virginia legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   For a prosecutor's agents to hound an American mother for
rescuing one of the innocent victims of Romania's communist horror
seems to me about as low as you can get. Starr's people never asked
Ms. Steele about Adam. They just wanted to poison the atmosphere,
to intimidate her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here alone, lost,'' Ms. Steele said. ``I'm not a public
person. I don't have that support system, and I'm being beaten to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people brush off, as unimportant, the bullying means used
in Starr's pursuit of Clinton. The danger _ the danger to our
freedom _ may be more understandable when the tactics are used
against an ordinary person. Ask not for whom the bell tolls. It
tolls for thee.

IN BOSTON, BIG CRANES AND A COUTH COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston, of course, would never do anything so utterly
uncouth as to boom.
</P>
<P>
   But consider: Big cranes are in such demand here that builders
have been looking for them as far west as the Mississippi.
Architects are in short supply. Downtown commercial real estate has
the lowest vacancy rate in the country, local monitors say, and the
highest average rental rates, topping even San Francisco's and New
York City's. Hotel rooms are often so difficult to get that
reservation clerks might as well be Cabots or Lodges, for all the
airs they put on.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, too, that for the first time in more than five years
new office towers are going up in downtown Boston, with one planned
to rise higher than the landmark Prudential Center. Warnings of the
dreaded ``Manhattanization'' of downtown can again be heard.
</P>
<P>
   And this: Boston, its face already changing with the $11 billion
highway project known as the ``Big Dig'' is embarking on a new
project so grandiose it has been compared to the creation of the
graceful Back Bay section a century ago: development of the
1,000-acre Seaport district in South Boston, the last great chunk
of convenient empty land on the water. (Water that was once the
filthiest urban harbor in the country and is now, thanks to a
nearly complete $4billion clean-up, possibly the cleanest.)
</P>
<P>
   The city, said the Boston Redevelopment Authority director,
Thomas O'Brien, using the local vernacular, ``is wicked hot.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, it is already too hot. In legendary working-class
neighborhoods like the Italian North End and traditionally Irish
South Boston, apartment rental and sale prices have nearly doubled
in the last two years, as white-collar-wearers have invaded and
some blue collars have been squeezed out. And advocates for the
poorest Bostonians worry about still-greater crowding and
displacement.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Boston's resurgence is seen by many urban experts
as spearheading a hopeful trend among aging northern cities
emerging from decades of decay. Planners talk about an ``urban
surge'' or ``comeback cities,'' spurred by factors as varied as
plummeting crime rates, the strong national economy, the return of
empty-nesters to walkable lives and the disdain that many young,
educated professionals feel for the suburbs they grew up in.
</P>
<P>
   They qualify carefully. The greatest population and employment
growth is still occurring in the suburbs and ``exurbs,'' farther
out, and many urban cores continue to crumble, losing people and
jobs. Many parents still spurn urban school systems. And of course
it is sunny cities like Atlanta, Phoenix and Las Vegas that have
been booming loudest.
</P>
<P>
   But from Chicago to Cleveland to Pittsburgh to Baltimore, urban
scholars also note mounting signs of a popular willingness _ even
eagerness _ to live and work and play in once-shunned downtowns and
centers, and of both public and private willingness to invest
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the traditional downtowns of older cities are now
being kind of re-imagined by people,'' said Alex Krieger, chairman
of Harvard's department of urban planning and design. ``Instead of
places where you get blue-collar jobs, which is the mid-century
view of the city, they're being re-assimilated in the consciousness
of Americans as places of culture, leisure, entertainment,
bar-hopping and service-sector jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most interesting changes in
turn-of-the-century American society,'' he said. ``There's this
amazing shift from the city as a place where you live because you
can't afford to live anywhere else, to a place where you go to have
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And among resurging eastern and midwestern cities, some urban
scholars say, Boston seems to be coming back the best, helped by
huge public projects but also by a right-place-right-time position
in the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, such a high-stepping comeback seems only fair. The
20th-biggest city in the United States, with nearly 600,000 people,
Boston suffered disproportionately in the last recession. As New
England hit the worst economic times of any region since the
Depression, the Boston-area overbuilding of the mid-1980's turned,
by the end of the decade, to speculative despair.
</P>
<P>
   It took until last year to regain all the recession jobs lost
and sop up the extra office space. But now, history seems to be
smiling again on the intellectual and cultural peacock of a town
that calls itself The Hub and the Athens of America. In a
traditional toast, Boston is also called ``The Home of the Bean and
the Cod''; but now at just the right time, it is more of a home to
the bit and the doc _ a capital of financial services, medicine and
high technology, all fields that have particularly thrived in this
thriving economy.
</P>
<P>
   That economic diversity should help cushion Boston from
financial shocks like this summer's stock market ``correction,''
said Thomas Menino, Boston's first Italian-American mayor and a
nuts-and-bolts kind of guy whose business-friendly approach has
helped fuel the city's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston depends on four different economies _ academia, health
care, mutual funds and tourism,'' he said, speaking in the
cavernous, concrete-beamed City Hall office that he unhappily
compares to a racquetball court. ``Most cities depend on one
segment of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of late, economic uncertainty has led to tighter credit for
commercial real estate deals here, and economists predict a slowing
in the city's growth rate. They also warn of an impending labor
shortage, particularly of skilled workers. But at the same time,
they point to the flip side of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   In the Italian North End, for example, Nancy Caruso, a pillar of
the dense, sauce-scented neighborhood who has lived there for 50
years, said she got cards and letters almost every day asking
whether she might not like to sell her small building. Buildings
bought by speculators in the 1980's for $200,000 would now bring
perhaps $600,000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the last two years, it's started to boom again, and
last year it was very booming, and this year, it's just gone
crazy,'' she said _ to the point that Italian families who had
moved to the suburbs and now want to come back find they cannot
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   The North End situation, though nice for owners, also
illustrates the great downside of the city's current vigor. Boston
housing has long been some of the most expensive in the nation, but
the soaring prices lately have been squeezing poorer residents ever
harder, particularly new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every neighborhood in Boston has very strong pressures in its
residential market,'' said O'Brien, of the Boston Redevelopment
Authority.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Real estate brokers say that in South Boston, the heavily Irish
enclave that gained ill-fame for its opposition to busing in the
1970's, rents have shot up perhaps 70 percent in the last 18
months; and in the traditional triple-deckers that have usually
housed a family on each floor, the population is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is that the families that have lived here for
so long are really becoming displaced,'' said Mike Foley, regional
vice president for Jack Conway and Co. Realtors. ``We're renting to
three or four individuals who can pay $500a piece. Two years ago,
you might have been getting $800 for those same apartments. The
marketplace has increased so drastically that South Boston families
can't afford these rents.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Boston's poorest, the economic energy has helped. Marc
Germain, a social worker in the Dorchester section, said, ``It's
easier to get a lot of young people, who are traditionally unable
to get into the labor market, jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has also hurt, said Charlotte Kahn, director of the
Boston Foundation's Persistent Poverty Project. With the city's
high cost of living, she said, ``for people on fixed incomes or
minimum wage, it has always been tough, and in this kind of boom
environment, it becomes that much tougher. And when you factor in
welfare reform, which is due to start in December, nobody knows
what that's really going to mean for people _ because in this
environment, with costs rising and job opportunities contracting,
it could be very tragic for a lot of families. We're already seeing
an increase in homelessness.''

   Boston's growth also creates problems for those in the path of
development _ like George Hagerty, an artist with a studio in the
historic Fenway Studios building near the chichi boutiques of
Newbury Street. He protests that his light will be ruined if plans
go forward for a neighboring skyscraper over the Massachusetts
Turnpike, and that in these times of bullish building, sometimes,
``People get squished.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could either succeed or fail very badly at changing the
face of Boston,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The burst in Boston's civic energy, some city leaders say, seems
to come not only from economic forces but from social changes as
well, changes in a city so known for paralyzing political fights
that former Governor William Weld said not long ago it had boomed
``in spite of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   For well over three decades, for example, an elite, rather
secretive group called The Vault, founded in 1959 by mainly Yankee
bankers and businessmen to help create a ``New Boston'' in the
dismal post-war years, was seen as a leading force in shaping the
city. That group imploded nearly two years ago, and is officially
defunct.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Ira Jackson, an executive vice president at
BankBoston, a broader, more open, more inclusive group of business,
labor, neighborhood and political leaders has been coalescing, with
more of a tendency to consult each other, collaborate, and even be
friends, and more of a ``getting-it-done'' approach to everything
from crime reduction to education.
</P>
<P>
   Take Boston's push to host the Democratic National Convention in
2000. Boston has never hosted the convention, Jackson noted, in
part because it could not get its act together compete for it. This
time, when Democratic scouts came around and visited everything
from the city's tallest building, the blue-mirrored John Hancock
tower, to its popular new amphibious-vehicle tours through the
Charles River and around town, it was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion you could get business guys to sit down with labor
and community leaders and the Republican governor and the
Democratic Speaker and everybody at a big lovefest at the top of
the Hancock or at 7:00 in the morning at Filene's Basement!''
Jackson exclaimed. ``Or taking a Duck Tour with delegates and
driving the thing onto the floor of the Fleet Center! All those
things happened. It couldn't have happened in Boston ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The new model for city development, said Thomas Piper, an
urban-planning research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, is the way Boston is approaching the gargantuan project
of developing the new Seaport district, which is expected to take a
good 20 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The area, which already includes the World Trade Center
exhibition complex, the just-opened $220-million Federal courthouse
and the just-opened Seaport Hotel, was the subject of a special
town meeting-like conference in May, and the city's plan for it is
now absorbing widespread comment from groups ranging from
neighborhood defenders to the Boston Society of Architects.
Interested residents can even check out a 3-dimensional Seaport
plan on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge to the imagination,'' Piper said, comparing
the project's scale to the development of Battery Park City in
Manhattan. The Seaport can also be seen, Piper said, as the shape
of the urban future: a mega-project, made possible by an
environmental clean-up, that will offer enticing recreational
spots, serve pedestrians well, and embody broad public input.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Lively debate is also already under way about what to do with
the 27-acre empty swath that will be left over when the Big Dig has
succeeded in sinking the unsightly main highway known as the
Central Artery.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has recovered and then some, but not all by itself, all
acknowledge. It has been blessed by $17 billion in infrastructure
investments, including a $1 billion renovation of Logan Airport,
brought home by long-serving and powerful congressmen and
contributed by a wealthy state that makes its capital here. The
seaport district will have a subway line and turnpike exits
courtesy of the Big Dig, for example, and the North End is red-hot
in part because soon, it will no longer be cut off from the rest of
the city by the Central Artery.

<P>
   ``Boston is exceptional'' in its comeback, said Alan Altshuler,
a professor of urban planning at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School
of Government and a skeptic about the talk of urban resurgence.
``There's been massive infrastructure investment focused here.''
</P>
<P>
   Other skeptics would agree, pointing out that the concentration
of poverty in many cities has continued to rise. They also note
that, while there are many projections of a coming urban population
influx, in fact, not even fashionable centers like Denver and
Portland have seen much population growth in the 90s compared to
the suburbs. That cities are doing better is undeniable, they say,
but at best that means a new stability, not a full-fledged
renaissance.

<P>
   Krieger of Harvard reflects the optimistic outlook: ``The point
is that, thought about most broadly, there is substantial
reinvestment in the cores of our cities,'' he said, ``and that is
quite different from a generation or two ago in America, or even a
decade ago.''

AS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN KOSOVO IS DESTROYED, CIVILIANS PERISH
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MIKE O'CONNOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The climate of fear in Kosovo during the
Yugoslav government's offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels has
caused the rural health system to collapse, aid workers and the few
remaining health workers say, and hundreds of civilians may have
died as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The workers also say that doctors who have been treating
civilian victims of the war have been arrested, beaten and in at
least two cases killed by the government forces.
</P>
<P>
   While aid workers contend that they see a pattern of attacks on
doctors, it is unclear whether it is an intentional effort to
destroy the health care system or the inevitable result of war.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the doctors who previously served Kosovo's rural
population have been afraid to give medical care to civilians in
areas controlled by rebels, aid officials say. The few doctors who
remained behind rebel lines are working without supplies and
equipment, and in many cases their clinics have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that even with a cease-fire that is allowing many
civilians to return to their villages, fear among doctors and their
patients is so high that people continue to die needlessly for lack
of care.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is the larger of the two
republics that make up Yugoslavia. Ninety percent of the province's
residents are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Government troops have destroyed many villages, including health
clinics, and hundreds of civilians have died during the offensive.
Many civilians in rebel-held areas are afraid to go to
government-controlled areas for needed care, international medical
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Confronting a panorama of misery and illness, those officials
say they do not have exact numbers of civilians who have died
without treatment or of physicians who have be stopped from
treating the ill. But they say that about 20 doctors have been
arrested or have fled the country and that hundreds of civilians
may have died because of the collapse of the rural health care
system.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, fearful that their efforts will be stopped by the
government, declined to give their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a systematic policy on the part of the government,''
said a senior official of an international health agency, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. ``It is intended to remove medical
people and to destroy the rural health care as much as they can get
away with. It's working fairly well.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav goverment officials said that there was no policy of
intimidating health care workers and that the doctors who had been
arrested were guilty of supporting armed insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of Kosovo around Orahovac, and in other areas,
civilians are afraid that if they leave rural zones where the
rebels dominate to seek health care in the regional hospital, they
will be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   For these people, medical care has virtually stopped, except for
the simplest treatments or for care offered by the occasional
visiting foreign doctors from aid agencies. Local doctors say that
many of their colleagues have fled or have been arrested, sometimes
on charges of aiding the rebels. Those remaining work without
adequate medication or even electricity.
</P>
<P>
   On a rural road in that region on Sunday, a panic-stricken man,
a father for 10 minutes, flagged down a passing car and said: ``My
wife just had the baby, and then she lost consciousness. Get her to
the hospital. No one from this area is safe taking her there.''
</P>
<P>
   The nearest medical clinic was destroyed by government forces. A
district health center in Malisevo is empty of staff and medicine,
its doors barricaded and possibly booby-trapped by the Serbian
police like other places in this area.
</P>
<P>
   The new father thought the presence of a journalist in the car
would offer protection so that he could get his wife to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   They had returned only the day before from three months of
living in the open in the forest while hiding from government
forces who had overrun and looted their village.
</P>
<P>
   Shukrije Krasniqi, 19, was quivering as her husband, Qamil, and
his relatives wrapped her in blankets against a freezing drizzle,
and put her in the car. His mother, Hanife Krasniqi, considering
the idea carefully, decided to go too. The husband, fearing arrest,
stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   At the government hospital in Orahovac, the staff said Mrs.
Krasniqi had suffered kidney failure and was close to death. They
criticized her mother-in-law for not having made sure that she
received good prenatal care. The mother-in-law took it, stiff with
anger. She forced a smile and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   They transferred Mrs. Krasniqi from the car in which she had
arrived to a filthy gurney with a torn, stained plastic cover and
shoved it into an ambulance, banging her head against the spare
tire.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After demanding money to pay for gasoline, they sent her to the
hospital in Pristina, the provincial capital, two hours away. She
remained in critical condition there late on Monday. The baby girl
survived.
</P>
<P>
   After destroying many villages and displacing more than 250,000
people, the government has withdrawn many of its forces from Kosovo
under threats of NATO air strikes. But the fear remains. And as
civilians who fled begin to come out of hiding and return to their
villages, they and the doctors who cared for them report that many
villagers died while on the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We woke up to the sound of artillery shells coming in, and we
just started to run,'' said a doctor in the village of Kisna Reka,
describing the residents' earlier flight. ``There was no time to
take medicine.'' He would only give his first name, Ismet, saying
he feared arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mountains the old people and the babies were the
weakest, and we could not help them all,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, some died.''
</P>
<P>
   His clinic was destroyed. He has put together something
makeshift and rather primitive. ``This is where I will stay for a
long time,'' he said, ``because for me it is too dangerous to
leave.'' Asked if he was perhaps being too cautious, he quickly
named four doctors, personal friends, two of whom had been killed,
he said, and two of whom had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In central Kosovo two other doctors sat in their hideout on
Sunday. Though they were well behind rebel lines, a 9-millimeter
pistol was within quick reach on a window ledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't moved from this area for eight months,'' said Dr.
Gani Halilaj. ``I know what will happen if they get me.''
</P>
<P>
   The other physician, Dr. Fadil Beka, said, ``Whenever the police
interrogate someone from around here they always ask where the
doctors are. But I have a good conscience, I know that doctors are
to help people, anyone who needs their help.''
</P>
<P>
   Beka, a surgeon, estimated he has done 300 operations in three
months, somewhat less than half on wounded rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The two doctors said they are only physicians in an area with
about 15,000 people and that lack of medical supplies along with
unsanitary living conditions have killed many of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic they put up to replace the one destroyed in the
military offensive also houses 13 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three days ago I had a patient with tuberculosis,'' Halilaj
said. ``Now, four others in his family have it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Beka, speaking of the regional health center in the nearest town
where the two doctors once worked, said, ``Before the offensive
five other doctors used to come here, our colleagues from Glogovac.
But it is too dangerous now and they won't take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency says nearly all of the estimated 50,000
refugees who had been living in the open have now gone home or have
been taken in by others. The American State Department says some
10,000 still have no shelter.

FED UP, BERKELEY TAKES AIM AT HOMELESS YOUTHS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.) (fb) 
By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The young street people were leaning against
a store window, watching the police watching them from a second-
floor window across the avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll arrest us for anything now,'' Justin Montgomery, 22,
said as he dragged on a cigarette. ``They're just waiting for any
excuse at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we scare people,'' said Orin Wells, 21, who was
sitting on the sidewalk clutching a chubby nine-week-old
mixed-breed German shepherd. ``Are we scary?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are scared or just plain fed up, plenty of people
in the nation's most famously liberal city want the youths,
panhandlers, drug addicts, drinkers, mentally ill homeless swept
off Telegraph Avenue, the shopping district here mentioned in every
tourist guide.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the all-Democratic City Council, which is dominated
by a progressive faction, unanimously passed an emergency measure
authorizing police overtime to fight the drug dealing and disperse
the entrenched camps of the homeless. The police have been all over
Telegraph Avenue, in squad cars, on bicycles and in front of
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've started turning things around,'' said Andy Ross, owner
of Cody's Books, a hangout that has stood at the most popular
gathering spot for the homeless, the corner of Telegraph Avenue and
Haste Street, for 21 years. ``A few days ago,'' Ross said, ``There
were 50 people camped out in front of Cody's dealing drugs and
menacing my customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Store owners started complaining about the youths at least a
year ago. In particular, they have complained about the young
people who come from all over the country to linger on Telegraph
and Haste. The situation is much like that one in San Francisco's
Haight-Ashbury district, which is also showing signs of battle
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless people have congregated here for 30 years, but many
locals say the more recent newcomers have more than tested the
limits of tolerance with their drinking, drug dealing, defecating,
urinating and aggressive panhandling. Not to mention their sheer
numbers: 20 to 30 congregate at any one time in one corner, most of
them with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when one store, Half Price Books, announced it was
moving out because of the youths, and five others threatened to do
the same, Mayor Shirley Dean, declared that the situation had gone
from ``severe to critical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be a vibrant place,'' Dean said. ``It's not
anymore. It's become a menacing place, where hard, hard drugs are
dealt, there have been people having sex on the sidewalks, S&AMP;M sex
on the sidewalk, anti-Semitic graffiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, before the crackdown, two windows at
Cody's Books were smashed, one apparently by a vandal, the other by
a young man who was shoved into it in a fight, Ross said. In recent
months, business has dropped by 15 percent in the day, he said, 75
percent at night. At night, many of the youths had taken to
sleeping along the wall, cocooned in blankets, bodies scattered
like bowling pins. In the daytime, they would use the wall as a
back rest as they smoked pot and sold drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the people who are still hanging around gather in small,
wary clutches.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless advocates question the timing of the crackdown, just
before the mayor and half the City Council members are up for
re-election. ``We really believe this is an election-motivated
issue,'' said Sally Hindman, executive director of the Chaplaincy
for the Homeless, which runs a drop-in center for homeless runaway
youth a block from Telegraph Avenue. ``There is something appealing
to people about hearing tough-on-crime talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindman said the city would be wiser to address the problems of
homelessness, rather than criminalize the behavior of the people on
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``On any night, there are 1,000 to 1,200 people sleeping on the
streets of Berkeley,'' she said. ``Half of them are
deinstitutionalized mentally ill people. It's like a mental ward on
the streets. Some of them are on drugs. But we have no detox center
in Berkeley.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindman said the youths, most of them between 18 and 25, tend to
come from severely troubled families, and that 21 out of 27 youths
the center has counseled have diagnosable mental illnesses,
including post-traumatic stress. ``You talk to them once, they'll
say they're traveling,'' she said. ``You start talking to them
more, they'll tell you they left because their parents were beating
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said she is proposing a plan that involves both
increased social services for the homeless youths and ``tough
love.'' That includes pushing them off the streets with an
anti-encampment ordinance. ``I don't think they'll seek services if
they don't get a nudge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the young people have come up with their own plan, which
they presented to the City Council last week. They promise that
they will stop urinating and sleeping on Telegraph Avenue,
panhandle in smaller groups, keep their dogs on leashes and pick up
their trash. In return, they have asked the city to provide more
trash cans, create a dog run, clean the public bathrooms more often
and open Berkeley's first shelter for young people.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor called the plan ``interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Telegraph and Haste, there were grumblings that the city
would never take the plan seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making us out to be devils,'' Orin Wells said. He said
he comes here from British Columbia when the weather gets cold
there. ``People are getting arrested for selling $10 worth of
pot,'' Wells said. ``They're not even the drug dealers. They get
$20 worth of pot from the real drug dealers and sell it for a $5
cut, just to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a group of homeless people were quietly nodding. Wells
shook his head in disgust. ``This is Telegraph and Haste,'' he
said. ``My parents used to hang out here when they were young. This
is a part of history, whether they like it or not.''

NAKHID WAIVED BECAUSE HE CHALLENGED SYSTEM, AGENT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ David Nakhid's agent said Monday his client is the
victim of a Major League Soccer policy of waiving players who
``challenge the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakhid and defenders Janusz Michallik and Dahir Mohammed were
waived by the Revolution Sunday. Nakhid, the only foreign player on
the Revolution without a guaranteed contract, was involved in a
fight with teammate Edwin Gorter during the Revolution's final
postseason practice last month. Gorter was accused of making a
racial remark and fined $20,000 and suspended for two games by MLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed, because David is a pretty good player, and
other players can vouch for that,'' said Nakhid's agent, Cory
Clemetson. ``I'm not surprised about David being waived. Only in
the MLS are top players who challenge the system put out to pasture
earlier than their time. David is captain of the Trinidad and
Tobago national team and he was a starter in most of the games
until he spoke up against racism within the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you find it disturbing that after the recent violent
altercation in which Edwin Gorter made unprovoked, unwarranted, and
racially inflammatory insult to David, that the powers at MLS
summarily fined him $20,000, suspended him for two games, and
ordered him to take sensitivity training for his racist attitudes,
that he, too, was not waived off the team?
</P>
<P>
   ``David will be speaking with counsel and I'm sure he will have
something to say at the appropriate moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Nakhid were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the statistics this year, these are players
that weren't contributing to the team at a high level,'' said
Revolution general manager Brian O'Donovan. ``We have to make
certain moves because of the four-player limit of international
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``These moves were made based on the perception of the coaching
staff of how players will contribute to the team, their playing
ability, and how they contribute to the team situation under the
strictures of the MLS, including roster limits and international
player limits. Our hands are tied by those strictures of the MLS,
which cause us to make certain decisions. After those cuts, we are
still one player over the foreign player limit.''
</P>
<P>
   If players with guaranteed salaries are waived, their salaries
continue to count against the salary cap. The Revolution have five
foreign players _ Damian Alvarez, Raul Diaz Arce, Richard Goulooze,
player-coach Walter Zenga, and Gorter _ and must comply with the
MLS maximum of four.
</P>
<P>
   Nakhid has been selected to play for the Caribbean All-Stars in
a two-game tour of South Korea. He performed for Grasshoppers
Zurich, PAOK Salonika, and Waregem in Europe and Al Ansar in
Lebanon before joining the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution selected former D.C. United players Kris
Kelderman and Shawn Medved in the waiver draft Monday. Kelderman, a
playmaking midfielder, played 21 games for the Miami Fusion after
being chosen in the expansion draft last year. Medved, who scored
the tying goal in United's 3-2 overtime win over Los Angeles in the
1996 MLS Cup, played 19 games for the San Jose Clash last season
... Jamar Beasley, who played two games at striker for the
Revolution, will train with AC Milan starting this week. Brian
Dunseth, who started 17 games in central defense, will train with
Bayer Leverkusen in Germany ... Defender Ted Chronopoulos, whose 84
career appearances are a Revolution record, is awaiting a transfer
from his Greek team, Panionios. The MLS must pay a fee of $70,000
for Chronopoulos's rights. ``We are assured by the league that he
will be with us next year,'' O'Donovan said.

   CONSUMER-SPENDING (Los Angeles) _ For the first time in 40
years, consumers in September spent more than they earned, pushing
the national savings rate to the lowest point on record. But in the
real world of grocery bills, mortgage payments and a looming
holiday season, the change was so slight few consumers seemed aware
that they'd played a part in history. By Ben Sullivan.

BANKBOSTON TO CUT 37 JOBS IN INVESTMENT UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Citing a downturn in global capital markets, BankBoston
Corp. said Monday it would slash 37 positions in its recently
acquired investment bank, Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   While the layoffs represent a fraction of the investment bank's
925 employees, they reflect the degree to which global economic
uncertainty has brought initial public offerings, foreign bond
trading, and equity underwriting to a near standstill.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs, which affect junior and midlevel executives in
research, operations, investment banking, and stock brokering, are
primarily at Robertson Stephens' San Francisco headquarters,
according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks come on the heels of similar layoffs at other
financial institutions, and show that BankBoston ``has taken quick
action to lower costs in a business that has fallen on hard
times,'' said Gerard S. Cassidy, an industry analyst at Tucker
Anthony Inc., a Boston investment bank and brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks also come barely two weeks after BankBoston said it
would close many of its Asian branches and cut 111 jobs worldwide
in response to a global economic downturn. In July, the bank, New
England's second largest, said it would lay off 114 staffers,
mostly in domestic retail branches, and said more would follow.
</P>
<P>
   A BankBoston statement issued Monday said Robertson Stephens
retained its core research, investment banking, and brokerage
capabilities but gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, a major player in Latin America, joins a growing
list of banks and brokerages are scaling back operations after a
miserable third quarter. The bank lost $45 million last quarter,
primarily by trading emerging market debt that fell through the
floor after Russia defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston eventually hopes to derive up to 30 percent of its
income from capital markets work, up from 7 percent before it
acquired Robertson Stephens in May.

GOVERNOR RIVALS PUT IN FULL LAST DAY ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL

<P>
   BROCKTON, Mass. _ From Worcester to Springfield and from
Brockton to Boston, Scott Harshbarger and Paul Cellucci barnstormed
the Commonwealth Monday in their final day of campaigning for the
governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, registered voters can cast their ballots for local,
congressional, and statewide offices. Polling places are open from
7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates for governor hauled out the big guns from their
respective parties, hoping for voter approval by association.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy and US Representative Barney Frank
accompanied Harshbarger to North Dartmouth, while New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and former Governor William F. Weld visited the
North End for a rally with Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, Weld, Giuliani, and Andrew Card _ Cellucci's former
colleague in the Massachusetts Senate _ were at the center of a
spirited parade down Hanover Street. Led by a brass band cranking
out John Philip Sousa marches, Cellucci was greeted as a favorite
son by many in the heavily Italian-American neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Chants of ``we want Paul'' and ``four more years'' rang out, and
employees and a few patrons of the street's legendary cafes
scrambled to doorways to wave at the passing parade. One man even
rushed to the front of the parade to plant a big kiss on Cellucci's
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   A giddy Cellucci clapped to the music and played the cymbals for
a couple of blocks. He did not hesitate to predict victory Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling pretty good,'' Cellucci said. ``I think people are
focusing on their pocketbooks. I think that's good news for me and
for Jane Swift, but we're not going to rest until 8 o'clock
tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   About two-dozen supporters greeted Harshbarger, the Democratic
nominee, on the front steps of the Brockton Public Library for a
tour of Main Street with Mayor Jack Yunits. Their chants of ``Scott
'98'' quickly petered out as their candidate alighted from his
black sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be a little more enthusiastic than that,'' urged
Troy Garron, the Democrat running for Plymouth County sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaves blew to the sidewalk and a few passing drivers
honked in support, Harshbarger had his photograph snapped on the
steps of the library, pointing out that Cellucci had vetoed $3
million to renovate the old building, which has steep steps and no
access for the physically disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger charged that Cellucci had vetoed many important
community projects around the state, including $300,000 for public
housing repairs in Lynn and $11 million for an Advanced Technology
Center at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best economy of our lifetime, and this is an
example of leadership focusing on the politics of it. It's not
what's right to do,'' Harshbarger said. Cellucci has been ``playing
politics'' in order to get elected, the Democratic candidate
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's reception was more enthusiastic at the
construction site for the new Superior Courthouse. Laborers called
Harshbarger over to shake his hand and waved his green-and-white
banners with fervor from each deck of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to pull a Doug Flutie. We're going to win one for
the little guy,'' Harshbarger said. ``We've always been
underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street in Sol's Cafe, Robert Haynes, the president of
the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, predicted a Harshbarger victory today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're organized. We're ready to get the party out,'' Haynes
said. ``We've identified a couple hundred thousand votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Harshbarger left Brockton, he said he wants voters to
know that the state can do better, particularly when it comes to
expanding health care, providing child care, and helping senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has a trail of broken promises and no
leadership,'' he said. ``Over the next 24 hours we're going to keep
going around and reminding people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the North End, Weld and Giuliani echoed Cellucci's campaign
slogan that Massachusetts voters should not go backward. Weld said
voters support Cellucci because he will be a strong force on
economic issues. ``I truly know that he's going to hold the line on
taxes and the economy and he's going to be a great governor,'' Weld
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, the Republican--Libertarian New York City mayor who
endorsed Democrat Mario Cuomo in the last governor's race in his
own state, credited Weld and Cellucci with turning around
Massachusetts and reminded Cellucci supporters to show up at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls can be very deceiving,'' Giuliani said. ``Elections
happen on election day. He and Bill Weld have turned this state
around, and it's now an example to the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he looks forward to governing as an elected chief
executive, rather than an accidental governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to continue to work hard for the people of this
state,'' Cellucci said. ``I think winning an election probably
gives you a little bit more of a mandate. I think it will give me
more of a mandate to keep moving forward.''

MOSCOW ABUZZ OVER CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's capital city, which has seemed unwilling to
muster even medium dudgeon anymore on questions of politicians and
politics, is suddenly buzzing over an allegation that virtually all
Muscovites regard as a given: that the government is corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The accuser is Grigory Yavlinsky, a respected if ideological
reformer and legislator who was the first politician to tout
Yevgeny Primakov for the post of prime minister last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in a move blunt even by the bare-knuckled rules of
Russian political debate, Yavlinsky gave Primakov a letter seeking
investigations of the conduct of his two highest-ranking aides, two
subordinates directly beneath them, and a ranking official of the
state tax service.
</P>
<P>
   The letter is signed by three members of Yavlinsky's Yabloko
political faction, which holds a sliver of seats in the lower house
of Parliament. But the message belonged to Yavlinsky himself, who
said at a news conference Monday night that ``corruption is an
absolutely rotting element of all power bodies, and probably most
of all in the Russian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Among 16 specific charges, Yavlinsky's letter questions whether
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist and the
government's senior economic adviser, steered government money or
favors to businesses in which he or his relatives held an interest.
It also asks whether First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov, the
former governor of the Leningrad region, has funneled favors to
businesses that financed his gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Yavlinsky's letter raises questions about the
agriculture minister's conduct when he held the same post in the
last days of the Soviet Union, and later as an official of a major
bank. And it asks what favors several officials granted to
businesses seeking exemptions from government rules, and what
benefits those exemptions brought about.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov's office alone has received more than 300 requests for
special treatment from businesses and other groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Maslyukov, perhaps the central target of
Yavlinsky's charges, called them baseless and shallow, and said
they were an attempt to split the government so free-market
advocates could retake power.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Primakov responded dismissively to the complaints,
calling the charges ``general phrases'' and adding that Yavlinsky's
blanket allegation of government rot suggested that the Yabloko
faction was infected with corruption as well.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov also joked about Yavlinsky's decision last month to
turn down his offer of a job in the new government, saying
Yavlinsky must have rejected it ``because he did not have enough
money to pay for the post.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians may fail to see the humor. The network
television program ``Itogi,'' a blend of America's ``60 Minutes''
and ``Meet the Press'' with a dash of Larry King tossed in, focused
on Yavlinsky's charges on Sunday, before the Yabloko letter was
released.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to register their opinion on whether Primakov's government
was indeed corrupt, 16,500 people responded within a few hours.
More than 92 percent of them answered ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not entirely unexpected. Corruption was a fact under
Soviet rule, both among regular citizens striving to eke out a
living and high officeholders. It is probably safe to say a
majority of Russians and many foreigners have been shaken down by a
local policeman or city official, and it is accepted fact that the
shift to capitalism made many government officials rich overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Primakov's gruff, fatherly manner and his
lifetime career in foreign affairs rather than politics ran counter
to that image. He has become not just the most popular figure in
the Russian government _ not exactly a high honor these days _ but
also one of the few seen as having clean hands.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, Yavlinsky has suggested, the government's
defensive response has not been encouraging. A senior official in
President Boris Yeltsin's administration has said there is no known
evidence to support the charges, and the state prosecutor general
has threatened to sue Yavlinsky for libel if he cannot prove them.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has gone no further than to suggest that Yavlinsky take
his evidence to prosecutors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Just why Russians might get exercised about bribery and theft
now, when expectations of politicians' performance already are
dragging bottom, is not completely clear. Communists were unable to
summon a healthy showing for a protest last month against Yeltsin,
the man blamed for most of Russia's troubles. Nor has the public
generated much enthusiasm for any of the candidates who want to
succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky is one of them, and there was speculation that he was
campaigning against corruption to set himself apart from the pack.
That he is campaigning seems beyond doubt: He began railing against
bribery and theft in vague terms a week ago on television, and has
gradually gotten more specific and more ominous in subsequent
interviews in The Daily Telegraph of London and on Russian radio.
</P>
<P>
   His news conference Monday, in which he also blasted Primakov's
economic program as aimless, capped a week in which he has claimed
a prime spot on national television and on the front pages of most
major newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky has said he still supports Primakov, who draws support
from both Communists and liberal reformers, as the best choice to
unite Russia in a time of turmoil.

SILENCE STALKS THE NBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If not upside-down, the world of the National Basketball
Association is certainly spinning crazily on its axis this morning,
the 126th morning of its labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 52 years of operation, regular-season
games will be lost to a lockout. Coach Rick Pitino's Boston
Celtics, led by Ron Mercer, Kenny Anderson, and Antoine Walker,
were scheduled to play their season opener Tuesday night against
the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Not anymore. Boston's
North End and Causeway Street were going to be buzzing with a
Celtics-Miami Heat game Wednesday at the FleetCenter. Not anymore.
Early visits from Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal were
scheduled. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   NBA gyms are quiet; NBA fans are sullen.
</P>
<P>
   What's a man like Pitino, who has been coaching for more than
half of his 46-year lifetime, to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be over soon, I really do,'' said
Pitino, who last weekend was in South Bend, Ind., watching Notre
Dame play football instead of in a gymnasium preparing his team for
Patrick Ewing. ``But I know now that retirement is not an option
for me. This lockout has taught me a valuable lesson in life.
Having all that time with nothing to do is not for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has coached for 24 years. Before last summer, he hadn't
had such a long basketball lapse in, well, 24 years. The coach
likes to golf and watch horses from his Celtic Pride Stable run (he
will be in Kentucky this weekend for the Breeders' Cup). But he has
said many times that he would prefer to avoid television and social
events not related to basketball during the season because, he
joked, ``I feel like God will punish me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why it is understandable that some might accuse the coach
of being in denial when he says the end of the four-month labor
dispute is ``imminent.'' That is hard to believe when both sides
made a little progress in the last week but are still unable to
agree on several issues, including how to share revenues that total
more than $2 billion. Talks resumed Monday with little movement on
either side (the full negotiating teams are scheduled to meet
Wednesday), and one NBA insider believes that the season will be
canceled entirely if the sides do not agree by Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, there will be no games until at least Dec. 1. And
Yun-Ju Choi is one of the few NBA fans who will be able to deal
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life will still go on,'' she said. ``I'll still work (at
the Boys and Girls Club of Roxbury), I'll still read, and I'll
still work out.''
</P>
<P>
   What she won't do is watch ``80 to 90 percent'' of all games
televised by NBC, TNT, TBS, Fox Sports New England, and Channel 38.
That's what she used to do. There were times when her friends asked
her to go out and she would agree only after preparing her VCR to
capture the games she would miss. ``At least I don't do that
anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Thompson doesn't do that, either. That's because you
will not find him leaving his St. Albans, W.Va., home when the
Celtics are beamed to him via satellite. Thompson used to hand out
cards that read ``World's No. 1 Celtic fan.'' He is the same person
who reminds you that he was born in the only 1960s year that the
Celtics did not win the NBA title ('67) but, ``I was born after the
Finals, so I didn't jinx them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is a stockbroker and is usually ``pretty busy.'' But he
has always found time to read the Boston papers, which he began
subscribing to _ in basketball season only _ 11 years ago. He has
not started his subscriptions yet this year. Like most fans, he is
uncertain when he will be able to begin following the league again.
Until that time, he will replace his Celtic-watching time with
passing-the-time time. That's right. He has no plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to do anything,'' he said, ``because nothing
beats watching the Celtics.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Celtic players are keeping in shape on their own, since the
team is not allowed to have contact with them during the lockout.
If Pitino is correct about the dispute being over soon, his players
might be wise to begin a furious exercising plan. Many of them were
so winded during Pitino's first training camp last season that they
had to be hooked up to IVs. The coach's training schedule will not
be more lenient in his second camp, especially since he gave his
players workout instructions to follow just before the lockout
began.
</P>
<P>
   When NBA life resumes its normal course, some fans say, certain
things will not change. Karriem Ali grew up in New York and now
lives in Boston. He has been a fan of the Knicks since 1985. He is
eager to continue following the Celtics-Knicks rivalry as well as
questioning Pitino, who used to coach the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, let me say that the Knicks will win the Atlantic
Division,'' Ali said. ``And Pitino? He walked out (on Knick fans,
to take a job at the University of Kentucky). We'll never forget
that. What happened? He couldn't handle the pressure?''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has heard such grilling before. He hears it all the time
when the Celtics play in opponents' arenas. He usually welcomes it
because it happens in the context of a game being played. But now,
as disappointed NBA fans everywhere can tell you, it's only talk.

FDA OKS ORAL DRUG TO TREAT KIDNEY WOES IN ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a dismal year for biopharmaceuticals, GelTex Pharmaceuticals
Inc. said Monday it received some good news: The US Food and Drug
Administration approved Renagel, an oral drug to help the esimated
220,000 Americans receiving kidney dialysis treatment.
</P>
<P>
   GelTex, a Waltham, Mass. company, said Renagel will be jointly
marketed with Genzyme Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. and manufactured by
a division of Dow Chemical Corp. of Midland, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is one of only a few from New England biopharmaceutical
companies to gain FDA approval this year. Some other promising
therapeutics either failed to gain government regulatory approval
or proved lackluster in pivotal human clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Last month The Medicines Co. of Cambridge failed to gain an FDA
advisory panel approval for Hirulog, a blood thinner, and earlier
this summer Ergo Science Corp. of Charlestown, Mass. was
unsuccessful in gaining regulatory permission to market its
diabetes drug, ErgoSet, after signing a joint-marketing agreement
with Johnson &AMP; Johnson. And Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of
Lexington, Mass. postponed further development of CerAxon, a stroke
medication, after disappointing phase 3 clinical trial results.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, several Wall Street biotech analysts said they expect
Renagel to generate about $30 million in revenues next year,
climbing to between $100 million and $200 million in annual sales
in three to four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice niche product, one where there is a great need
to control the dietary phosphorus in late-stage kidney dialysis
patients with few side effects,'' said Meg Malloy, a biotechnology
analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike healthy patients whose kidneys remove waste products from
blood through urine, patients with late-stage kidney disease,
predominantly older people, retain phosphorus, which, if untreated,
can lead to bone disease and soft-tissue calcifications. Renagel
was granted FDA approval because it neutralizes and removes harmful
dietary phosphorus in the gastrointestinal tract and helps lower
cholesterol levels, according to Mark Skaletsky, GelTex chief
executive, who said the drug is not absorbed into the blood stream.
</P>
<P>
   Two to three Renagel capsules are taken each day with every
meal. The drug will cost $1,100 to $1,400 annually per patient,
Skaletsky said, with Medicaid covering about half of patients
requiring it. He said the company hopes private medical insurance
will reimburse the remaining Renagel users.
</P>
<P>
   Renagel is GelTex's first drug and took almost four years and
$50 million to develop, said Skaletsky. The first shipments should
reach patients next month.
</P>
<P>
   GelTex shares closed Mondayat 23 7/8, down 1 1/8.

IRISH LEADER URGES RESTARTING ULSTER PEACE DRIVE

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Two days after the killing of a
Roman Catholic man here, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of the Irish
Republic conferred with Catholic and Protestant leaders of the new
Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday in an attempt to restart the
stalled Ulster peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   But the daylong meetings were clearly also an attempt to allay
fears that the shooting death of the man, Brian Service, apparently
by a Protestant splinter guerrilla group, would lead to renewed
violence.
</P>
<P>
   That would further delay the resolution of political disputes
that have impeded the peace effort since April, when the
politicians and the Irish and British governments approved an
agreement to end sectarian warfare between the Protestant majority
and the Catholic minority in the British province.
</P>
<P>
   Before the talking began at Parliament in the Stormont area
Ahern said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have to move things, and today everybody has to say:
`Let us keep moving. Vacuums are dangerous.' The events of this
weekend showed that. What we have to do is concentrate our minds,
make the compromises, put in the effort and keep it moving.''
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the Protestant first minister of the assembly and
Seamus Mallon, his Catholic deputy, said in a statement, ``If this
murder is designed to derail the peace then it will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   At a break in the talks this evening Ahern and Trimble said the
discussions were positive and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   They did not, however, predict imminent solutions and mostly
discussed less contentious areas like tourism, agriculture and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hutchinson, a former guerrilla and convict who has won
bipartisan respect as an official of a party in the assembly, the
Progressive Unionists, expressed doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, who still has contact with Protestant paramilitary
groups, said that if the killers were a splinter of the Loyalists
Volunteer Force ``we can expect more killings, and I would advise
all people in north Belfast to be on their guard.''
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made in the killing, for which a group that
calls itself the Red Hand Defenders, a splinter from the Loyalist
Volunteers, has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The main Protestant paramilitary groups have been observing a
cease-fire since October 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republican Army has been
observing a cease-fire for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA refusal to disarm has provoked the main disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, as head of the assembly, says the IRA political wing,
Sinn Fein, may not fully take part in the new provisional
government until the IRA begins to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein has said it will seek to persuade the IRA not to
retaliate for the killing on Saturday.

MOOD HEATS UP IN MALAYSIA AS LEADER'S RIVAL GOES ON TRIAL
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim went on trial Monday in a corruption case that has gripped
the region and come to symbolize the political convulsions that can
flow out of economic distress.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, who was ousted as Malaysia's No. 2 official on Sept. 2
and arrested two weeks later, was led into the courtroom just after
9 a.m. Hundreds of riot police officers with automatic weapons,
truncheons and shields ringed the High Court building in central
Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar listened while a prosecutor read off four charges of
corrupt practices: accusations that he obstructed a police
investigation of his sexual activities. If he is convicted on any
of the four counts, Anwar could be imprisoned for as long as 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar has also been charged with five counts of sodomy, for
which he will be tried later. He has pleaded not guilty to all
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has ratcheted up the tension in Malaysia, where Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad has come under fierce public criticism
for his treatment of Anwar. On Monday about 200 people milled
peacefully behind barriers well away from the court, apparently
heeding warnings that the police would crack down on protests.
</P>
<P>
   With world leaders, including President Clinton, converging on
Kuala Lumpur in two weeks for the annual meeting of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, fears of unrest are likely to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   While most of Monday's session was devoted to legal maneuvers,
Anwar commandeered the proceedings after court adjourned in the
afternoon. Still standing in the dock, a gaunt but galvanized
figure, he delivered a stinging denunciation of the conduct of the
case so far.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the press gallery, he criticized the attorney
general, Mohtar Abdullah, who said on Saturday that Anwar could be
tried on additional sex-related charges later.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you expect me to get a fair trial if the A.G. acts in
this manner?'' said Anwar, who appeared relaxed in a cream-colored
open-neck shirt and dark pants. ``He is not professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar also had harsh words for his former boss, Mahathir. He
said the prime minister had not disclosed the full cost of his new
residence, saying it was ``bigger than the palace'' of Malaysia's
king. And he said his record as deputy prime minister as described
by Mahathir was a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar then theatrically put his hand over his mouth, saying,
``Tomorrow, I think they'll get me.'' In late September, Anwar, 51,
appeared in court with a black eye, which he said was a result of a
police beating.
</P>
<P>
   That Anwar would publicly denounce Mahathir on the first day of
his trial illustrates the extent to which this case is part of an
epic power struggle between men who have dominated Malaysian
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was once Mahathir's protege _ doted on by the doctor, who
has been prime minister since 1981. Anwar, a suave intellectual and
author of a book, ``The Asian Renaissance,'' was the anointed
successor of Mahathir, 72, with a dual portfolio as deputy prime
minister and finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Asian crisis devastated Malaysia, the men clashed
over economic policy _ with Mahathir favoring a staunchly
nationalistic strategy while Anwar preferred a more global
approach. As Anwar became bolder, he became a rival and, finally,
an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, Mahathir abruptly imposed sweeping controls on
Malaysia's capital markets, over the strenuous objections of Anwar.
The prime minister also scuttled his deputy's economic program,
which had relied on a strict regime of the type championed by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Mahathir forced out Anwar, saying he was unfit to
be the leader of Malaysia. Rumors that Anwar had had extramarital
affairs with women and men had been simmering for several months.
After the dismissal, the prime minister said he believed the
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar maintains that the accusations about sex are a pretext to
remove a rival. In particular, Anwar's aides have said that the
charges of homosexual conduct were intended to destroy him
politically since homosexuality is considered taboo in this Muslim
country.
</P>
<P>
   But Anwar has only grown in popularity since his arrest. He has
rallied tens of thousands of people, who have marched through the
streets here shouting, ``Reformasi!'' The chant was made famous in
Indonesia this year when President Suharto was forced to step down
after 32 years in power. They have also called for the resignation
of Mahathir, who led Malaysia through a period of rapid economic
growth before the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anwar is aware that this whole thing is political,'' said K.S.
Jomo, a political economist at the University of Malaya. ``He is
politicizing the trial. But it is political, so why pretend that it
is not?''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the dock on Monday, Anwar seemed to be campaigning for
the support of Malaysians and the international community. He
denied suggestions that he was opposed to a salary increase for
civil servants. And he sought to distance himself from a
government-orchestrated bailout of a Malaysian conglomerate, saying
that Mahathir had lied about his role in it.
</P>
<P>
   But first Anwar has to survive this trial. The judge turned away
a motion Monday to throw out the case because Anwar is being
prosecuted under a law that is about to be repealed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun stuck close to her hometown
on Monday, playing to her Democratic political base in an
eleventh-hour attempt to keep her job.
</P>
<P>
   She greeted dawn riders at an elevated train stop on the South
Side, stopped at a commuter rail station downtown and picked up
last-minute endorsements from a group of Latino political leaders.
She worked the lunchtime crowd at a North Side diner that is a
favorite hangout of another Democratic stalwart, former Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski. And she finished the day at a candlelight vigil for
Barnett A. Slepian, the obstetrician from a suburb of Buffalo who
was killed because he performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each soul to the polls,'' she exhorted about 50 black church
leaders and small-business owners at a breakfast rally at Captain's
Hard Time restaurant, a South Side eatery not far from where
Moseley-Braun went to high school. ``Take someone with you. Get on
the phone. I know there's a few voodoo ladies in this room, so do
what you need to do to get the sun shining tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Vigorous turnout by her core supporters is Moseley-Braun's best
chance for re-election, political experts believe.
</P>
<P>
   After bounding from an obscure Cook County office to become the
nation's first black woman senator six years ago, Moseley-Braun has
been buffeted by misjudgments in her personal and political life.
Her opponent, state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, a conservative
multimillionaire, has hammered at her missteps in a glut of
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls over the last few months have shown Moseley-Braun
trailing badly, but three polls published in the last few days show
her gaining ground and, in one case, running even with Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have a really good chance to get elected
tomorrow,'' Moseley-Braun said at Captain's Hard Time. ``What has
happened in the last few weeks is that we've been able to make the
point that his record really is as extreme as I said it was.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the professions of optimism, Moseley-Braun's
campaign was determined on Monday to pull out all the stops. She
was accompanied by Rodney Slater, the secretary of transportation,
a rousing campaign speaker, and praised by Democratic congressmen
like Luis Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   On the South Side, her campaign staff handed out buttons and
bumper stickers intended to tap into the black community's
adoration for the late Harold Washington, Chicago's first black
mayor. ``Remember Harold,'' one bumper sticker said. ``Punch 16 for
Carol.''
</P>
<P>
   At Northwestern Station, where the senator was trying to reach
suburban working women, the sneaker-and-skirt crowd who supported
her so strongly in her 1992 election, the campaign signs read ``A
Seat at the Table for Women. Vote Moseley-Braun'' and ``Pro-Choice,
Pro-Child, Pro-Carol.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the voters Moseley-Braun saw on Monday said they were
well aware of her missteps, but would vote for her, anyway, because
she was supported by people they respected, or because they
objected to Fitzgerald's positions on abortion, gay rights and the
right to bear concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Taylor-Williams, who runs a beauty salon and a
hair-products company on the South Side, said she would vote for
Moseley-Braun because she was the only black woman senator, and
because Hillary Rodham Clinton had been campaigning so hard for
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's made a few mistakes,'' said Luanne Adams, 40, a computer
programmer who saw the senator at the commuter rail station. ``But
if she's in Washington, D.C., she is my representative. If
Fitzgerald were to win, he does not represent me in any way. His
views are so radically different than mine.''

MICROSOFT GIRDING TO BATTLE LINUX, MEMO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A leaked memorandum from a Microsoft Corp. engineer suggests
that the famously competitive software company is girding for
battle against the upstart Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The memo describes Linux as a ``short/medium-term threat'' in
the rich market for software that runs on computer servers. It
speaks of ``beating Linux'' by stressing the product's drawbacks.
It also suggests undercutting Linux's growing popularity by adding
enhanced features to Microsoft computer networking products that
compete with Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has confirmed that engineer Vinod Valloppillil wrote
the memo in August. It was posted late Sunday on the Internet by
Eric Raymond, a well-known Linux software developer and industry
gadfly.
</P>
<P>
   Similar memos from Microsoft executives have formed a key part
of the federal government's ongoing antitrust suit against the
company. Raymond doesn't believe that any of the proposals in the
Valloppillil memo are illegal. But he sees them as proof that
Microsoft is unwilling to coexist with Linux and other
``open-source'' software, or OSS, products based on universal
software standards that Microsoft does not control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fundamental opposition between the Microsoft way of
doing things on the one hand, and the Internet open-standards,
open-source world on the other,'' said Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But according to Microsoft's enterprise marketing group
manager Ed Muth, the memo is just one man's opinion, not official
Microsoft policy. ``I think overall it's a good piece of work that
does a thought-provoking job of raising the issues,'' Muth said.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source software like Linux is usually available free of
charge. Just as important, open-source programs let users make
modifications to the software by including a copy of the raw
``source code'' created by the program's designers. As a result,
users of open-source code can easily customize their software.
</P>
<P>
   Linux itself is largely composed of software created by the GNU
Project, a volunteer group sponsored by the Free Software
Foundation in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of open-source software say it's cheaper and more
reliable than traditional programs made by companies like
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   And the memo suggests that Microsoft has gotten the message.
``Linux and other OSS advocates are making a progressively more
credible argument that OSS software is at least as robust, if not
more, than commercial alternatives,'' wrote Valloppillil.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, open-source products like Linux have surged in
popularity in recent months. Industry estimates suggest that Linux
is running on about 7 million computers worldwide, and that the
number is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one company owns open-source software, it's difficult
for Microsoft to compete with it head-on. ``We must target a
process rather than a company,'' the memo says.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source software is well suited to the Internet because it's
based on standard ways of performing certain tasks, like handling
e-mail. These protocols, with names like POP3 and SMTP, are
standard software commodities known to programmers worldwide, and
they can be used without paying royalties to Microsoft or anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux can win as long as ser-vices/protocols are
commodities,'' Valloppillil warns. He urges Microsoft to add new
features to the standard protocols, so that the Microsoft versions
work better than the open-source versions. In this way, he writes,
``we can deny OSS projects entry into the market.''

GOVERNMENT SHOWS VIDEOTAPED TESTIMONY BY GATES IN MICROSOFT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: MICROSOFT-GATES, MICROSOFT-MEMO) 
(htv)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bill Gates on the courtroom screen was evasive
and uninformed, pedantic and taciturn _ a world apart from his
reputation as a brilliant business strategist, guiding every step
in the Microsoft Corporation's rise to dominance in computing.
</P>
<P>
   In two hours of videotaped questioning shown at the Microsoft
antitrust trial here Monday, a small part of the three-day
deposition he gave last summer, Gates professed ignorance of
several key charges in the government's case including allegations
that he was involved in plans to bully competitors like Apple
Computer Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp. to step back from
Internet software markets that Microsoft sought to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   When presented with e-mail messages he had written, he often
said he did not recognize the messages or recall the discussions
surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   To question after question he answered, ``I don't remember using
those words,'' or ``I'm not sure what you're trying to say.''.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases Gates' answers were so banal that even Thomas
Penfield Jackson, the U.S. District Court judge who is hearing the
the case, chuckled and shook his head. Asked once, ``who was at the
executive staff meeting'' where a key discussion took place, Gates
said simply: ``Probably members of the executive staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that the few hours of taped excerpts, drawn
from 20 hours of questioning by government lawyers, were often
taken out of context, selected merely to embarrass Gates and
Microsoft with little direct bearing on the case. Gates, Microsoft
says, was obviously not going to cooperate with prosecutors trying
to put words in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, both Gates, the nation's wealthiest man, and
his questioner, David Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer,
remained civil and polite. Boies, however, did show a flash or two
of irritation at Gates' plodding evasions _ so at odds with his
public image as a quick-witted tactician, immersed in every
significant detail of Microsoft's business. At times, Boies
pointedly reminded Gates that he was under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The pile of e-mail offered as evidence Monday vividly showed the
round-the-clock pace at Microsoft, a pace set by Gates. E-mail
messages sent to him at 4 A.M. were answered a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, through two hours of verbal thrusts and parries, Boies
never quite succeeded in trapping Gates, and Gates was generally
unable to discredit Boies' assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, dressed in a hunter green suit with a brown striped tie,
sitting at a plain conference table at Microsoft's headquarters
next to his attorney, seldom smiled but never raised his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Long pauses _ some more than 20 second long _ hung between many
of Boies' questions and Gates' answers. Microsoft's chairman seldom
looked his questioner in the eye, gazing down at the table instead.
As he read documents that were handed to him, sometimes, he rocked
back and forth in his chair.
</P>
<P>
   For the last week, the government has been trying to play the
Gates deposition in court, but Microsoft's drawn-out cross
examination of government witnesses by Microsoft's trial lawyer,
Jack Warden, had left no time. The announcement that it would be
played Monday came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   During the deposition, taped over three days in August, Gates
was confronted again and again by e-mail _ his own, and messages
sent to him by other Microsoft executives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The government's case, in its broadest terms, is that Microsoft
has used its market muscle to fashion a network of relationships
that would insure that the rise of the Internet did not weaken its
dominance. It began with trying, in a meeting that took place on
June 21, 1995, to divide up with its main rival, the Netscape
Communications Corp., the market for software used to browse the
World Wide Web..
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Gates said that during the period around June
1995 he had ``no sense of what Netscape was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft documents often seem to contradict Gates' profession
of ignorance. In an internal document titled ``The Internet Tidal
Wave,'' written on May 26, 1995, by Gates himself, he gives an
authoritative analysis of Netscape's strategy. He called Netscape a
``new competitor `born' on the Internet,'' whose goal was to
``commoditize'' the value of the personal computer operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's wealth and market power derives mainly from the
dominance of its Windows operating system, the master control
software that runs on more than 90 percent of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition, Stephen Houck, the lead lawyer for the 20
states suing Microsoft along with the Justice Department, asked
Gates about e-mail he had received that appeared to show that
Microsoft was proposing to divide the market for browsers.
</P>
<P>
   An electronic message to Gates, written by Thomas Reardon, a
Microsoft executive, lists the goals of trying to strike a deal
with Netscape. They include ``move Netscape out of the Win32
Internet client area'' _ a reference, in industry jargon, for
desktop Internet software that runs on the Windows operating
systems using so-called 32-bit technology, Windows 95 and Windows
NT.
</P>
<P>
   The next objective, stated in the e-mail, was to ``avoid cold or
hot war with Netscape. Keep them from sabotaging our platform
evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he did not recall this message.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that when Netscape refused Microsoft's
illegal offer on June 21, 1995, Microsoft set out to crush its
competitor and slow the rise of other Internet technology, like
Apple Computer's Quicktime multimedia software, and Sun
Microsystems's Java, an Internet programming language. All of these
posed a potential threat, the government argues, to Microsoft's
firm grip on computing.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, asked Gates
whether he tried to ``get Apple to agree to help you to undermine
Sun?'' He showed Gates an e-mail on Aug. 8, 1997, sent to Paul
Maritz, a senior executive at Microsoft, and others. In dealing
with Apple, Gates wants to get ``as much mileage as possible'' in
competing against other Internet software companies. ``In other
words,'' he writes, ``a real advantage against Sun and Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes the e-mail by asking his aides, ``Do we have a
clear plan on what we want Apple to do to undermine Sun?''
</P>
<P>
   Boies then asked Gates what he meant when he asked that
question. Pausing and staring down at his own brief message, Gates
eventually replied, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is alleging that Microsoft has repeatedly used
its market power for anticompetitive ends, prodding partners and
competitors to divide, or stay out of, markets that Microsoft wants
to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about these allegations in general, Gates gave his
most unequivocal reply. ``Are you aware,'' Boies asked, ``of any
instances in which representatives of Microsoft have met with
competitors in an attempt to allocate markets?''
</P>
<P>
   Gates replied, ``I'm not aware of any such thing. And I know
it's very much against the way we operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies probed further to ask, ``It would be against company
policy to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gates answered, ``That's right.''

CLINTON SAYS IRAQ'S BALKING OVER WEAPONS WILL BACKFIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton predicted on Monday that Iraq's
decision to end all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors would
backfire. He said the move had unified the international community
in condemnation of President Saddam Hussein's government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent Defense Secretary William Cohen to the Middle East
and Europe to consult with allies about options for a response to
Iraq's action. Senior administration officials said the options
included an American military strike on Iraq to force it to comply
with the weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left open the possibility of military action after
meeting at the White House on Monday with his top national security
advisers to discuss the latest in a series of showdowns with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the inspectors are back, no options are off the table,''
Clinton said, interrupting a White House event on health care to
discuss the situation in Iraq. He added, ``Saddam Hussein's latest
refusal to cooperate with the international weapons inspectors is
completely unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, though, it will backfire,'' he said. ``Far from
dividing the international community and achieving concessions, his
obstructionism was immediately and unanimously condemned by the
U.N. Security Council. It has only served to deepen the
international community's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Iraq, the only path to lifting sanctions is through
complete cooperation with the weapons inspectors _ with no
restrictions, runarounds or roadblocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Iraq's announcement on Saturday that it was ending all
cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors, the United Nations
reported that inspectors had been allowed to carry out some minor
monitoring work on Monday and that the Iraqi government had made no
move to expel any inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't thrown our people out, and they haven't told us
to pull out our cameras or technical sensors,'' said Charles
Duelfer, deputy executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission.
``The fact that they didn't expel us indicates that they are still
interested in discussing this.'' The commission is charged with
enforcing Iraq's compliance with Security Council resolutions
calling for it to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that despite the tougher
language from the White House on Monday, no military action against
Iraq was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said they were not convinced that Iraq would
follow through on its threat of shutting down the entire weapons
inspection program, a move that they agreed would almost certainly
result in a devastating military response from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would be surprised if this was another bluff from
Saddam,'' said a senior administration official. ``However, if it's
not a bluff, then we have a true crisis on our hands. Then we have
to start thinking seriously about a military attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that Clinton had weighed his options in
dealing with Iraq during his meeting Monday with Defense Secretary
Cohen; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Samuel R. Berger, the
national security adviser; Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff; and George J. Tenet, the director of Central
Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and his team reviewed and discussed potential
options for next steps,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House
spokesman. ``No decisions were made beyond the president asking the
secretary of defense to travel to Europe and to the region to
consult with our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if military strikes were among the options discussed,
Lockhart replied, ``All options are on the table, and that means
all options are on the table.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Pentagon declined to make public the itinerary of Cohen, who
will be traveling with Undersecretary of State Thomas R. Pickering.
But aides to both men said they were likely to visit Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia, where the United States has maintained a sizable
military force since the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials said, the administration's attention was
focused on the United Nations, where the Security Council is
expected to vote shortly on a resolution to condemn Iraq's latest
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is clearly for the council to make clear that
this is unacceptable, that this decision is in flagrant violation
of the requirements of the Security Council,'' said James P. Rubin,
the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been heartened by the quick condemnation
of Iraq's action by France and Russia, two permanent members of the
Security Council that have sought in the the past to loosen the
sanctions on Iraq.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a campaign season that lacked any raging
national issue greater than President Clinton's tribulations,
Americans are expected to trickle, if not stream, to the polls on
Tuesday in a midterm election that will inevitably be interpreted
as a referendum on the fate of the President.
</P>
<P>
   In election eve dashes around the country, Democrats and
Republicans sought to disprove forecasts that less than 40 percent
of eligible voters will participate. They implored voters to take
part in an election where the outcome of many important _ and
excruciatingly close _ races could hinge on a very small number of
votes. In fact, analysts predicted that of the millions of people
expected to go to the polls, the decisions of only about 200,000
people in 50 competitive House contests could make a 15-seat
difference.
</P>
<P>
   While the reverberations over Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky have not openly figured as a consequential issue on the
campaign trail _ and voters in both parties tell pollsters they
want to put the scandal behind them _Republicans and Democrats
alike agreed that the outcome cannot help but guide the House's
approach in its impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome also could affect the fate of Speaker Newt Gingrich;
conservatives in his party have warned that if the performance of
Republican House candidates is less than impressive, they may blame
it on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's fate is on the line and Gingrich's fate is on the
line,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Both politicians devoted the closing hours of the elections to
imploring their loyalists to vote. ``These races are very, very
close,'' Clinton said on Monday in a radio interview with Hispanic
reporters. ``There are almost three dozen close House races that
could go one way or the other,'' he said. ``There are seven close
Senate races that could go one way or the other. And we need a
strong turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, at a rally in Roswell, Ga., Gingrich said it
had been ``a great campaign'' for his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tomorrow we have a chance to win some very startling
victories all over the country,'' he declared, sarcastically
heaping praise on the president: ``Bill Clinton's contribution to
the demise of the Democratic majority has been significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Republican and Democratic strategists held firm with
predictions of modest Republican gains in the House, where all 435
seats are up for grabs, though a few pointed to recent surveys that
they said suggested that Democrats could gain seats. The
strategists also said they anticipated a Republican gain of no more
than a few seats in the Senate, and predicted that there would not
be an appreciable shift in the Republicans' domination of
governor's offices in the 36 gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
   Still, politicians and analysts in both parties noted that there
had been no obvious tide favoring Republicans or Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more uncertain now than '94 or '96 _ I'm a lot less
comfortable with predictions,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of a
nonpartisan newsletter that tracks races nationwide, as he pored
over the latest polls. ``I'm almost expecting a few major
surprises.'' But echoing other experts, he added, ``The most likely
outcome in the House is low to mid-single digit gains for the
Republicans and in the Senate, a Republican net gain of two or
three'' seats.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, the president's party has never gained seats
in the House in midterm elections; on only three occasions has it
won seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   While for months, much of the attention in the campaign of 1998
has centered on House races, in the closing days some of the most
dramatic contests have been for the Senate. Incumbent senators who
are in particular trouble are Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois and
Harry Reid of Nevada, both Democrats, and Alfonse D'Amato of New
York and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, predicted that turnout would be between 36
percent and 38 percent of eligible voters, a decline from the 38.8
percent who voted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But, noting that this campaign's subtext is ``the possible
removal of a president,'' Gans offered a caveat. ``Anyone in this
climate who would venture a hard prediction about either turnout or
result,'' he said, ``has a degree of hubris that will probably
suffer its comeuppance on Election Day.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The scrambling for votes on Monday capped a campaign season that
has been anything but predictable. Month after month, candidates on
both sides waited anxiously to see what impact the White House
scandal would have on their fates. But even on the eve of the
election, the answer was not entirely clear.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the year, it appeared to be an incumbent's
political season because voters seemed relatively content.
Certainly, they were not riven by the restlessness and
dissatisfaction that drove the midterm season four years ago _ and
led to the historic Republican takeover of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Because Republicans hold only a slim 11-seat advantage in the
House, many Democrats triumphantly predicted that they would take
back the House. Early this year, the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee put out a thick book of maps and statistics.
``These factors demonstrate the momentum needed to put Democrats
back in charge of the House of Representatives,'' the booklet said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But many of the most optimistic Democrats stopped talking up a
Democratic triumph after Clinton admitted in late August that he
had had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and had
misled the public about it. And many of the party's candidates
complained that they could not capture any attention on their
issues _ from education to health care to protecting Social
Security _ because the press was preoccupied with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans who had gleefully predicted that the Lewinsky
matter was their ticket to huge victories have also scaled back
their expectations in the face of polls showing that voters do not
care to hear more about the scandal _ and may even blame
Republicans for trying to keep it alive.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that on the eve of the election, the dynamic may
be not so different from what it was 10 months ago: Voters do not
seem to want massive change. Races are being fought over local
issues. And many incumbents seem safe. In a contrast with the
election of 1994 _ an anti-incumbent year _ many lawmakers
highlighted their backgrounds as Washington insiders who knew how
to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the outcome, it is bound to influence how the Congress
handles the impeachment inquiry. ``If Democrats either hold their
own or pick up a few seats you could make the argument that voters,
through their inaction, said, `I don't want to deal with that
issue; leave it alone,''' said John Hutchens, a Democratic
strategist in Denver. ``If Republicans are much stronger than we
are anticipating right now, it would probably provide some real
momentum for those hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Brookover, political director of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, which channeled millions of dollars into
recent commercials in districts across the country to remind voters
of the Lewinsky matter, said, ``I still think that our voters are
turning out to send him a message. They don't like what he's done
and how he's conducted himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing Democrats who contend there will be a backlash
against the Clinton advertisements, Brookover said, ``We're not
having candidates screaming to take them off the air.'' At the
request of Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, Brookover said the
committee today began broadcasting one of the scandal commercials
in Portland, Maine, to help Ross Connelly, a Republican who is
trying to oust Rep. Tom Allen, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said an unimpressive showing for their party's
candidates could damage Gingrich. Already, officials of the
Republican Governors Association, which is meeting in New Orleans
after the election, has scheduled an unusual meeting with party
officials around the country and major donors _ congressional
leaders are not invited _ to decide how the party might be better
defined by politicians outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans don't do as well as either the political
class or the Republican base thought they should have,'' Reed said,
``it could accelerate the search for leadership outside
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   While national polls are not reliable indicators of how
candidates will perform in local races, several new polls on Monday
reinforced the impression of an evenly-matched competition between
both parties. The Gallup Organization polled 1,105 registered
voters Thursday through Sunday for CNN and found 49 percent
supporting Democratic candidates and 45 percent for Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center polled 743 voters from Wednesday through
Saturday and found 46 percent for Democratic candidates and 44
percent for Republicans. Another poll by CBS News of 509 voters on
Saturday and Sunday found 49 percent supporting Democrats and 48
percent for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And a poll by ABC News taken Thursday through Sunday, with 1,070
voters, found 49 percent preferring Democratic candidates and 46
percent preferring Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The results of each of the polls are within the margin of
sampling error.

CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS DISPUTE FOCUSES ON BIG VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DETROIT _ Environmental regulators in California and Washington
are preparing to require steep reductions in air pollution from
cars and want to apply similar rules to sport utility vehicles,
pickup trucks and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Big Three automakers have accepted that all these
vehicles will have to become much cleaner. But they say that it is
unrealistic to demand that full-size sport utility vehicles like
the Chevrolet Tahoe and full-size pickup trucks like the Dodge Ram
meet the same pollution standards as cars.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is centered now in California, where the California
Air Resources Board is scheduled to vote Thursday on a plan that
would reduce allowable car emissions of various smog-causing gases
by up to 75 percent for vehicles built after 2003, and would
require virtually all light trucks to meet these standards too.
Once the board approves a plan, it takes effect without any further
regulatory or legislative action but could be challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit automakers have allied themselves with California
landscapers, construction contractors, farmers and other small
businessmen in a bid to force the board to authorize separate
standards for full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
With help from Detroit, the California businesses have set up a
group called Californians for Realistic Vehicle Standards. The
group contends that automakers will not be able to sell affordable
work vehicles if state regulators do not make an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The address of the month-old lobbying group is the Sacramento
headquarters of the California Chamber of Commerce, while the
group's telephone number is that of the Sacramento office of
Burson-Marsteller, an international public relations firm often
used by the auto industry. Detroit automakers provided the bulk of
the money for the new group, but small businesses have also made
contributions, said Allan Zaremberg, the chamber's president.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Protection Agency officials were also drafting new
air pollution regulations that would take effect for vehicles built
after 2003, and hoped to issue them for public comment by early
next year. The agency wants to apply car standards to minivans,
mid-size pickup trucks and mid-size sport utility vehicles for the
first time, and is waiting to see what will happen in California
before deciding what to do with full-size sport utility vehicles
and pickup trucks, people familiar with the agency's plans said.
</P>
<P>
   An agency official said Monday that the EPA had not yet made any
decisions and would evaluate whatever California does. The federal
agency has been following California's lead in a series of
automobile emissions reductions for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans are classified as
light trucks and have been regulated as work vehicles for decades.
All but the smallest are allowed to emit more gases that cause smog
per mile than cars. Full-size sport utility vehicles and pickups
are currently allowed to emit three times as much smog-causing
nitrogen oxide per mile as cars, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Cars and light trucks alike pollute far less now than in the
1950s because of innovations like catalytic converters. But with
three-quarters of all light trucks now used by families instead of
businesses, regulatory interest in them has been rising.
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution standards are set in terms of grams per mile, but
large light trucks have big engines that pump through considerably
more air per mile and therefore tend to pollute more. It may not be
technically possible to make full-size sport utility vehicles like
the Chevrolet Tahoe and full-size pickup trucks like the Chevrolet
Silverado meet car standards, said Sam Leonard, the director of
vehicular emissions policy at General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the air resources board estimated that it would add
$96 to $304 a vehicle to meet the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The American Automobile Manufacturers Association, a trade group
for domestic automakers, has made a counter-proposal to the
California regulators. It wants even deeper reductions in car
emissions than California has proposed. Minivans, mid-size pickup
trucks and mid-size sport utility vehicles, like the Ford Explorer
and Chevrolet Blazer, would be required to meet these very low car
standards for the first time in the proposal from the automakers.
</P>
<P>
   But full-size sport utility vehicles and full-size pickup trucks
would be allowed to emit twice as much of a key pollutant, nitrogen
oxide, as cars. This would still represent a steep reduction in
pollution from these vehicles, Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   This proposal was rejected by the staff of the California Air
Resource Board because the total reduction in pollution from cars
and light trucks would be 10 percent less than under the staff's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic automakers' proposal reflects their business
interests. The California car market is dominated by Toyota Camrys,
Honda Accords and other Asian brands, while Detroit has had the
most success in the state in selling very large light trucks like
Lincoln Navigators and GMC Yukons. Asian automakers, most of which
have their headquarters in California and considerable political
clout as a result, are not supporting the domestic industry's plan,
contending that car pollution standards should not be tightened
beyond the California board's initial proposal.
</P>
<P>
   While Detroit's automakers have presented a united front in
their California lobbying, they have shown different degrees of
enthusiasm. GM and Chrysler Corp. have taken a hard line. But Ford
Motor Co. perceives a marketing advantage in offering cleaner light
trucks. Its chairman-elect, William Clay Ford Jr., is a longtime
advocate of environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the 1999 model year, all Ford sport utility
vehicles are roughly as clean as current cars; the California Air
Resources Board tested a 1999 Ford Expedition full-size sport
utility and found that it came fairly close to meeting the proposed
new standard.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Brown, Ford's director of vehicle environmental
engineering, said that Ford was working on even cleaner Expeditions
but was not sure when they could be built. But Brown said that most
of the California board's proposals were feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 90 percent of what they asked us to do, we can do,''
Brown said, adding that Ford's interest in cleaner light trucks had
caused a rift within the auto industry. ``It makes you the skunk at
the picnic at an industry meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The California plan, which was drafted by the air resources
board's staff, has two concessions to the auto industry, but
domestic automakers argue that these are inadequate. The first
concession is that very large light trucks weighing more than 8,500
pounds when fully loaded will be permitted to meet more lenient
standards. This includes some very large pickup trucks,
four-wheel-drive versions of the Chevrolet Suburban and an even
bigger sport utility vehicle that Ford plans to introduce next year
that will be the world's largest sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The second concession is that 4 percent of each manufacturer's
light trucks weighing less than 8,500 pounds fully loaded will also
be allowed to meet a more lenient standard, provided they also can
carry large quantities of freight.

AS CLOSE RACES APPEAR CLOSER, CLINTON COURTS BLACK VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the latest polls suggesting that many key races are tighter
than expected, the last day of campaigning for Tuesday's election
was marked by a fusillade of ads and suggestions by President
Clinton that Republicans are trying to suppress black voter
turnout. GOP officials denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   A final round of polling showed that Democrats had moved ahead
in the ``generic'' congressional poll, in which voters indicate
which party's candidates, in general, they are more favorably
inclined toward.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum shifts rumbled through many campaigns. Senator
Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, long considered one of the most
endangered Democrats, moved ahead of Peter Fitzgerald, the
Republican, by 45 percent to 42 percent, still within the 4-point
margin of error. In California, meanwhile, Matt Fong, the
Republican, pulled within striking distance of Democratic Senator
Barbara Boxer, who led 45 to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts cautioned that races for the House and Senate are
decided on so many unique local issues that the surveys might be
misleading. Most predicted slight Republican gains in the Senate
and governorships, with varying views about which party might pick
up a small number of House seats. A heavy turnout could alter the
outcome of the three dozen or so closest contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans clearly have history and money on their side,''
the Democratic National Committee cochairman, Steve Grossman, said
in an interview. ``But the momentum we seem to have in the last few
days certainly is evidenced by the polling.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, whose impeachment fate could be determined by
the makeup of the new Congress, spent his second straight day
courting black voters, suggesting that a few thousand votes in each
of 35 races could determine the victor. The president, citing
reports that police planned a heavy presence at some polling places
with many black voters, asked Republicans to ``renounce'' such
activities.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said Clinton's charges were false and that the
president was making a last-minute ploy to boost black voter
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States Tuesday falsely and
improperly suggested that the Republican Party is responsible for
voter intimidation in an effort to keep black Americans from
voting,'' said the Republican Party chairman, Jim Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson then asked Clinton to call upon the Missouri
Democratic Party to withdraw radio commercials ``suggesting that a
vote for Republicans would lead to church bombings and burnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute charges and countercharges about voter
intimidation resulted from a handful of incidents. Democrats, for
example, noted that Republicans in North Carolina have made plans
to videotape voters as they go to the polls, while Republicans
cited the Missouri Democrats' ad that said: ``When you don't vote,
you let another church explode.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was no evidence of widespread intimidation, the
pre-election rhetoric among party leaders underscored that many
races have tightened in the final days and could turn on a few
thousand votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing days of the campaign, Republicans spent $10
million on an ad campaign that highlighted the Clinton sex scandal.
Democrats, nearly broke as a party, responded by releasing an ad
that questioned whether Republicans care about ordinary people.
Democrats said they gained momentum from a backlash against the GOP
ads, which ran in 68 key districts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged a high turnout, especially among black voters, and
suggesting that Republicans would act irresponsibly if given more
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody stays home and we have people in here who would
be irresponsible, then things could get worse in a hurry,'' Clinton
said. ``That's a big risk that that's not worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the election, according to leaders of both parties,
is turnout. Curtis Gans, director for the Committee for the Study
of the American Electorate, said in an interview that he expected
turnout to be between 36 to 38 percent, ``but I am less sure of
that than at any time in my lifetime because of the subtext of the
impeachment issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gans said turnout might be slightly higher among the
``upper-income, better-educated, and older people. The first two
are lightly in the Republican direction, and the last is in the
Democratic direction.'' The impact of older voters could spell the
difference in many races, which explains why Democrats have spent a
lot of advertising dollars on promoting the idea that the party
will be more effective in protecting Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   As for black turnout, Gans foresees only a ``slight uptick.''
Republicans normally would be expected to pick up about 35 House
seats in a mid-term election when Democrats control the White
House. But with the GOP having picked up 52 seats in the 1994
election and already controlling the House 228 to 206, Republican
leaders predicted the party would do well to pick up 10 seats
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who for months have been playing down expectations in
the wake of Clinton's sex scandal, expressed confidence that they
are pulling ahead in key races and predicted strong showings in
Republican-leaning areas of the South and border states.
</P>
<P>
   In good news for Democrats, the Gallup Poll found that likely
voters prefer Democrats over Republicans by 49 percent to 45
percent in a generic congressional ballot. But the House races are
decided on many local issues, making it difficult to predict
whether Democrats will be ahead by such a margin in the actual
election.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, of 435 House races, 402 feature incumbents, nearly all
of whom are likely to be reelected. Most political analysts said
there are about three dozen highly competitive House contests and
perhaps six tight Senate contests out of 34 up for election.
</P>
<P>
   But among those tight races, many became even tighter in the
closing days of the campaign, making the election results tough to
call. A major swing even in the small number of competitive races
could determine which party controls Congress and affect the
outcome of a possible House impeachment vote and Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Boxer and Moseley-Braun races, the closest
Senate contests include those between Republican Senator Alfonse M.
D'Amato and Democratic Representative Charles E. Schumer of New
York, and between Republican Representative Jim Bunning and
Democratic Representative Scotty Baesler of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Republicans to pick up one to three seats in
the Senate, which is controlled 55-45 by the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were expected to pick several more governorships,
adding to their total of 32. Another 17 governors are Democratic
and one is an Independent. The most closely watched governor's race
is in California, where Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis is leading
Attorney General Dan Lungren.

DEATH TOLL IN CENTRAL AMERICA FROM MITCH COULD HIT 7,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ CENTRO, Nicaragua _ After nearly a week of torrential
winds and rains from Hurricane Mitch, government and rescue
officials across Central America Monday began taking toll of the
storm's chaos and destruction, estimating that as many as 7,000
people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   From the hardest hit areas of Honduras and Nicaragua, where the
sun finally shone Monday, further northward to El Salvador,
Guatemala and Mexico, which were shrouded in rain for most of the
day, it became clear that the floods and mudslides triggered by the
storm inflicted some of the worst damage ever produced by a natural
disaster in this region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever seen this kind of damage before,''
said Nicaraguan Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Barrios
said after visiting some of the most severely affected areas north
and west of the capital city of Managua. ``These places look like
the lunar landscape with large craters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe it unless you see it with your own eyes,
there are bodies everywhere'' Chamorro added. ``The images are
really horrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguan officials believe up to 1,500 residents were buried
alive late last week when a slope of the Casitas Volcano collapsed,
spilling a rapidly moving wall of mud on nearby villages. Another
700 people are believed to have died in floods in other parts of
the country, Chamorro said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch proved to be equally devastating for other countries, too.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse, who suspended civil
rights and called out the military to prevent looting, said the
death toll in that country was ``in the thousands, not hundreds,''
because of Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials said the exact number of dead would never be
known. Several parts of the country remained cut off from
communication. The storm dropped up to 25 inches of rain in a
six-hour period last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Floodwaters in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital of 800,000
residents, appear to have receded. But all four bridges across the
Rio Choluteca were still out of service. The city's popular
49-year-old mayor, Cesar Castellanos, was killed in a helicopter
crash on Sunday while surveying the storm's damage.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people died and seven US citizens, all apparently part of
a missionary organization, were injured when their small plane
crashed into a Guatemalan hillside on Sunday in heavy fog and rain.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring El Salvador, the National Emergency Committee
officially listed 74 dead and 106 missing. Another 27,000 were
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala, where the storm was centered Monday, reported nearly
three dozen deaths related to Mitch. And Mexico noted one death,
but officials there cautioned that number could rise as the rains
move into its rural and poorer southern states.
</P>
<P>
   The International Red Cross tripled its appeal for aid to those
affected to $7.4 million. And President Clinton pledged $2 million
in US assistance in food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Tuesday, Mitch was elevated to a rare Category 5
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with winds clocked at about
180 m.p.h., making it the fourth most powerful recorded hurricane
in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of pushing northeastward toward the Mexican Yucatan
Peninsula, as most forecasters predicted, the storm lodged near the
Honduran coast, leveling port communities and small islands popular
with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, the storm's center, although weaker, began moving
southwest, moving inland over the rest of Honduras and into
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:20 that morning, according to government officials, who
Monday recounted stories told by survivors of the Casitas Volcano
mudslides, a large blast shook the earth. Just two minutes after
residents received official warnings, an avalanche of mud and
debris swept over entire villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the hurricane going away from Nicaragua,'' Chamorro
said. ``We didn't expect that it would come back and stay so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Persistent rains and extensive damage to bridges and roads
around the volcano made it impossible for rescue workers to reach
most of the injured. Many reportedly died from their wounds while
waiting for help to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Chamorro added, about 70-80 bodies could be
spotted on the ground, often with only limbs or faces sticking up
from the mud. Another 450 bodies had been recovered. In the
afternoon, the government began mass cremations to reduce the risk
of disease from decomposing bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Harding, executive director of Nicaragua's National
Emergency Committee, said plans were being made to create a large
``national cemetery,'' at the site where the mudslide hit the
hardest.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,600 people are still missing, he added, and the further
would probably rise as rescue workers and the military reached
areas that are still cut off from communication and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the coffee-growing countryside outside
Managua, meanwhile, schools, churches and government buildings were
turned into makeshift shelters for those who were evacuated from
flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no home, no animals and no food,'' said Jose Rios, 66,
who was evacuated from the nearby village of La Paz Vieja and took
refuge in a classroom with 43 other men. ``All I have is these
clothes and the pain of the memory of what this storm has done.''
</P>
<P>
   A damp soccer field in the town of La Paz Centro, about 50 miles
west of the capital, was used as a staging area for three
helicopters which transported doctors, civil engineers and food and
medicine to isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority right now is to help the living,'' said one
government official at the landing site. ``And to restablish ground
access to these communities because using helicopters for
everything is too expensive for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harrowing tales of destruction that seemed to hover
over most Central American countries Monday, on a religious holiday
known as Day of the Dead, there were also stories of survival.
</P>
<P>
   There was the man, rescue workers said, who slid nearly five
miles along the current of the mudslide near the volcano but
managed to keep his head up and his body balanced and come away
with only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-year-old girl who was nearly paralyzed managed to stay alive
for days because a neighbor gave her drinks of water from his
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors in the rural areas were taken to a hospital in
Chinendaga, where supplies were reportedly running desperately low.
Government officials said many children were left orphaned by the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of families in the hardest-hit areas, like the village of
Rolando Rodriguez, had gone days without eating. Doctors noted that
many residents were suffering from weather-related illnesses,
especially ear infections.
</P>
<P>
   At times Monday, the massive scale of the cleanup and rescue
project needed for Nicaragua, the hemisphere's second-poorest
country after Haiti, seemed to overwhelm workers. Not since a
devastating earthquake hit Managua in 1972, killing 5,000 people,
has the country seen such widespread death and devastation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference this time is that the hurricane has destroyed
much of this country's infrastructure,'' whereas the earthquake was
centered in one area, Chamorro said. ``It's like the rains have cut
our country into several small pieces.''

 &HT;    There's no show tonight
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No Game Tonight.
</P>
<P>
   They don't need that sign at the Georgia Dome today. The NBA let
fans know it was coming when the players were locked out July 1 and
made it official weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pistons at Hawks is canceled, as well as the rest of the 13-game
November schedule and perhaps all of December.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, on the eve of what would have been, union executive
director Billy Hunter used a telephone conference call to dampen
any enthusiasm for a quick settlement. ``I don't see any
possibility for us to reach an agreement this week and I don't know
when we will,'' he said. Asked to predict a possible start date for
the season, he said, ``My gut tells me January.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said Wednesday's meeting of lawyers on technical issues
made so little progress that a full negotiating session scheduled
for Wednesday has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are much further apart on the economic issues,'' Hunter
said, citing ``fundamental differences on positions in regard to
policy on how a system would work'' and ``a general lack of
understanding and communication in regard to a framework of how
this thing would be structured.''
</P>
<P>
   That contradicted remarks last week by NBA commissioner David
Stern, who reported a ``skeleton'' around which to build.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he thought the issue of dollars would be easier to
resolve, but said, ``They have one concept we have another.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Hunter mentioned the issue of cost certainties.
``We have one view. They have another,'' he said. ``The NBA elected
today to actually take a step back and there is a question on
whether we will agree in the future. Hard cap isn't an issue. They
know we would never accept one. The question is the structure of
what can actually work.''
</P>
<P>
   One apparent barrier is the apparent collapse of any luxury tax
proposal. ``The entire framework of tax, credit, how you set it up.
We didn't agree on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also said the players want to move away from the
traditional concept of BRI (basketball related income) as a source
for the division of revenues, to ``reduce our need to do these
exhaustive audits and we would have a fixed pool of revenues from
which our percentage would be derived. We're still working on it.
We won't have to worry about people under-reporting income.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a genuine concern. The most serious issue involved the
Chicago Bulls, who several years ago did not declare income from
200 luxury suites. This was uncovered only when the team and the
NBA battled over the team's desire to show a significant number of
games over Chicago's super station, WGN. As a result the NBA had to
increase the salary cap number for each team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   There is some agreement on such issues as retaining guaranteed
salaries, a form of the Larry Bird rule and the growth of the
middle class. There is sentiment toward extending rights over
rookies for longer than three years and of a tougher drug policy.
But the players have rejected a 50-50 split, although Hunter said
they have come down from 63 percent to 60.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he has always taken the stance that ``when the
owners want to reach an agreement we will reach one.'' He said he
does not believe that time has come.
</P>
<P>
   He indicated that might happen when the TV networks, sponsors
and some owners may call a halt to this. ``When it comes to a
boiling point,'' he said. ``When people decide that the asset _ the
game of basketball _ is about to take a significant hit, something
will happen.''

 &HT;    Anderson's rushing has Reeves gushing
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves was effusive in his
praise Monday when talking about Sunday's 37-15 win over the Rams,
which left the Falcons 6-2 for the first time in the 33-year
history of the franchise. Reeves made it clear he thinks running
back Jamal Anderson is playing at a Pro Bowl level.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-year player from Utah, the 24th running back selected
in the 1994 draft, rushed 22 times for a career-high 172 yards and
two touchdowns, and caught two passes for 31 yards, including a
9-yard TD.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta even split Anderson out wide a few times for the second
week in a row to make it tougher for the Rams to disguise blitzes.
It was as a wideout that he made a one-handed 22-yard catch that
was critical on the team's lone second-half TD drive.
</P>
<P>
   He has rushed for 862 yards this season, putting him on pace for
1,624 yards (the team record is 1,719 by Gerald Riggs in 1985).
Anderson has rushed for six TDs, and caught 16 passes for 215 yards
and a TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy that was the catylast was Jamal,'' Reeves said. ``He
was awesome. I've never seen him run any better. He's been more
aggressive than he was; he broke an awful lot of tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dangerous as a receiver outside because he's got very
good quickness. He has great hands. He is a complete football
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouquets for the O-line
</P>
<P>
   Reeves also was ecstatic over the play of the offensive line,
which allowed just one sack after entering the game surrendering
one every 7.7 passing plays, the worst ratio in the NFL
</P>
<P>
   In particular, left tackle Bob Whitfield had perhaps his best
game as the Falcons totaled a season-high 434 yards against a St.
Louis defense that had allowed an average of just 251.5 yards a
game in the previous four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are likely to continue playing undrafted rookie Jose
Portilla part-time at right tackle in rotation with rookie Ephraim
Salaam, and second-round draft choice Bob Hallen will continue
spelling second-year left guard Calvin Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``After an off week against the Jets, they really played well in
both run and pass,'' Reeves said, referring to a week earlier, when
the Falcons allowed five sacks and managed just 55 yards rushing in
a 28-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The two new guys did have breakdowns, however. Portilla gave up
the lone St. Louis sack, when Rams DE Kevin Carter ran past him.
Hallen, while spelling slightly injured RG Gene Williams, let Rams
DT Ray Agnew blow past him and strip QB Chris Chandler of the
football on the St. Louis 6-yard line. Center Robbie Tobeck
recovered, and the Falcons had to settle for a field goal. And in
the fourth quarter, Rams DT D'Marco Farr beat Hallen up the middle
to block Morten Andersen's 29-yard field goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Big year for Bennett
</P>
<P>
   On defense, weakside LB Cornelius Bennett is having a year
comparable to what Anderson is doing on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he had eight tackles and batted down a pass while
playing every snap. Because Bennett is on the field during nickel
and dime defenses, he rarely comes off the field. He leads Atlanta
with 67 tackles, ahead of MLB Jessie Tuggle (53 tackles).
</P>
<P>
   Right DE Chuck Smith continues to play especially well against
the run, totaling six tackles Sunday. He added a sack, and is tied
for the team lead with DE/DT Lester Archambeau with 4.5.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie LB Keith Brooking, the team's first-round draft choice,
has had a hard time getting on the field because of Bennett's
outstanding play, but he was in on 46 snaps against the Rams
because Atlanta spent so much time in nickel and dime defenses.
Brooking responded with a season-high seven tackles and broke up
two passes. He did not have a sack, though, as postgame statistics
orginally indicated. He has 15 tackles for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   WR/PR Todd Kinchen, who suffered a concussion on a third-quarter
punt return, was observed Sunday night at Piedmont Hospital for a
couple hours, and underwent a battery of neuro-physchological tests
Monday that gauge memory recall and fine-motor skills. The results
of those tests will be compared with results from preseason tests
and his status for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots
(5-3) will be determined later in the week. If he can't play, CB
Ray Buchanan and/or WR Terance Mathis would return punts. . . . DT
Travis Hall, whose nagging knee injury was originally diagnosed as
a bruised tendon two weeks ago, wasn't recovering as anticipated,
so Friday night team physician Andrew Bishop suggested he undergo a
bone scan. It showed a ``hot'' reading, indicating something was
wrong. Hall had arthroscopic surgery Saturday morning, and a piece
of debris that was catching the back of his kneecap was discovered
and removed. He missed the Rams game and isn't likely to play
against the Patriots. . . . Tuggle hyperextended a knee, but wasn't
limping Monday, and his status for Sunday's game looks good.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling in the red zone
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have scored on 21 of 23 ``red zone'' possessions
this season _ possessions that include at least one first down
inside the 20-yard line. Atlanta has 12 TDs and nine field goals;
the two unsuccessful trips into the red zone ended with a blocked
field goal and QB Steve DeBerg kneeling down in the waning minutes
of a win over the Saints. In the last two seasons, QB Chris
Chandler has thrown 17 TD passes in the red zone and no
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said he has never seen a fullback block better than Bob
Christian did Sunday. . . . From the middle of last season to now,
only two teams, Green Bay and Denver (13-3), have a better record
that the Falcons' mark of 12-4, same as San Francisco and
Jacksonville. . . . Atlanta's six wins have come against teams with
a combined record of 12-35 prior to Monday night's game between
Philadelphia and Dallas. Reeves is irritated that that keeps
getting mentioned in the media. ``People see (what's sometimes
written) and take it as gospel,'' he said. ``That can influence
(potential ticket buyers).'' . . . In their first six games, the
Falcons gave up 12 plays of 30 or more yards, and six of 56 or more
yards. But in the last two games, they haven't given up a play
longer than 26 yards. The Rams' longest play Sunday was a 22-yard
pass to Az-Zahir Hakim, and in the 28-3 loss a week earlier, the
longest play was a 26-yard pass to TE Kyle Brady. . . . The 212
points scored by the Falcons is a team record for the first half of
a season, topping the 208 scored in 1990. Atlanta is fifth in the
NFL with a scoring average of 26.5 points. . . . The Falcons'
six-game home winning streak is their longest ever in the Georgia
Dome. The franchise record for longest home winning streak is seven
games, in 1978 and '80-81. . . . Atlanta is No. 7 in the NFL in
defense on third downs, allowing a conversion rate of 34.3 percent.
. . . Falcons coaches are pleased with the progress of second-year
TE O.J. Santiago, who after going without a catch in the opener,
has 13 receptions for 188 yards and a TD. The 6-foot-7, 267-pounder
also is developing qas a blocker.

 &HT;    Half-empty Dome shows Falcons still have doubters
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons are off to the best start in
franchise history, but their reward Sunday was a half-empty Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   There were 37,996 tickets distributed for the game against St.
Louis. With almost 7,000 no-shows, about 31,000 watched a 37-15
victory that left Atlanta 6-2 for the first time. The Dome, which
has a capacity of 71,228, was less than half full.
</P>
<P>
   In one regard, the low turnout was not surprising. The Rams game
has been the toughest sell of all Falcons home games three years in
a row and four times in the 1990s. Three of the five smallest
crowds in the Dome's eight-year history have come against the Rams.
The 26,519 that showed up for the final home game in 1996 remains
the all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few Falcons weren't in the mood for excuses, especially
since the previous game, Oct. 18 against New Orleans, was played
before the biggest crowd _ 61,638 tickets distributed _ in nearly
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point the excitement of a team tied for first place
(with the 49ers in the NFC West) in November ... should be enough
(to draw a bigger crowd),'' running back Jamal Anderson said. ``But
a few of us have been here a few years, and ... we know what's
happened in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, history haunts a team that has just seven winning
seasons in 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people out there in disbelief the Falcons are
6-2,'' reserve running back Harold Green said. ``It's imperative
for us to stay focused. If we do that, we can turn some of the
doubters into believers.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the opponent has something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons already have distributed more tickets for all four
remaining home games than they did for the Rams game. And the next
home game, Nov. 15 against San Francisco (6-2), could be the first
sellout since Oct. 29, 1995, a 28-13 loss to Dallas. Already, some
62,500 tickets have been sold for the 49ers game.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's average of 49,832 tickets distributed is way behind
the NFL attendance average of 63,676, but it is ahead of Tennessee
(37,280) and Oakland (44,920).
</P>
<P>
   ``To have 20-some thousand less than we had at the last home
game is disappointing,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``I think (the
Falcons) would be a fun team to watch, but I can't make people see
the same things I do.

 &HT;    Suspect should have been jailed at time of slayings
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook and Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The man suspected in five Atlanta-area slayings in
October _ including the triple killings at a Hilton hotel in
downtown Atlanta _ should have been in prison at the time instead
of on the streets, according to state and county records.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Fulton County Superior Court Judge William Daniel
sentenced Timothy Dawson to 10 years probation for aggravated
sodomy and aggravated assault on his girlfriend. Georgia law
requires a minimum of a decade in prison with no chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson, also known as Harry Lee Johnson, is suspected of killing
three men in the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers, one in the Days Inn in
College Park, Ga. and another in a DeKalb Co. home invasion. He was
arrested Saturday near Memphis, Tenn., on a traffic offense,
charged with murder and returned to Atlanta in custody Monday. The
Georgia Department of Corrections, which supervises felons
sentenced to probation, several times had asked the Fulton County
court to revoke Dawson's probation because he was not reporting to
his probation officer, paying his probation fees or notifying the
state each time he moved.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Fulton County indictment, Dawson forced his
former girlfriend to perform oral sex on him and then he beat her.
In exchange for a guilty plea to aggravated assault and aggravated
sodomy other charges were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that we worked out with the district
attorney's office and the judge went along with it,'' said Thomas
West, Dawson's defense attorney in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the recent shooting victims were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd have been in prison, Gerrold would be alive,'' said
Maple Bronner, girlfriend of Gerrold Shropshire, one of the men
slain at the Atlanta Hilton. ``The justice system just leaves a lot
to be desired.'' Dawson was also on probation at the time he was
charged with attacking his former girlfriend. He had been sentenced
to five years in prison to be followed by five years probation for
a 1989 Baldwin County theft by receiving conviction.
</P>
<P>
   While free on $20,000 bond on the assault charges, Dawson was
again arrested on a felony charge, for stalking his girlfriend to
keep her from testifying against him. He was shot in the stomach
when police came to arrest him because, the officer said, he
thought Dawson may have had a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Daniel said he did not remember the case, but the
prosecutor, Charles Smegal, said the deal was struck, despite the
dictates of the law, because ``the victim didn't want to
prosecute.''

AS CLOSE RACES APPEAR CLOSER, CLINTON COURTS BLACK VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the latest polls suggesting that many key races are tighter
than expected, the last day of campaigning for Tuesday's election
was marked by a fusillade of ads and suggestions by President
Clinton that Republicans are trying to suppress black voter
turnout. GOP officials denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   A final round of polling showed that Democrats had moved ahead
in the ``generic'' congressional poll, in which voters indicate
which party's candidates, in general, they are more favorably
inclined toward.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum shifts rumbled through many campaigns. Senator
Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, long considered one of the most
endangered Democrats, moved ahead of Peter Fitzgerald, the
Republican, by 45 percent to 42 percent, still within the 4-point
margin of error. In California, meanwhile, Matt Fong, the
Republican, pulled within striking distance of Democratic Senator
Barbara Boxer, who led 45 to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts cautioned that races for the House and Senate are
decided on so many unique local issues that the surveys might be
misleading. Most predicted slight Republican gains in the Senate
and governorships, with varying views about which party might pick
up a small number of House seats. A heavy turnout could alter the
outcome of the three dozen or so closest contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans clearly have history and money on their side,''
the Democratic National Committee cochairman, Steve Grossman, said
in an interview. ``But the momentum we seem to have in the last few
days certainly is evidenced by the polling.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, whose impeachment fate could be determined by
the makeup of the new Congress, spent his second straight day
courting black voters, suggesting that a few thousand votes in each
of 35 races could determine the victor. The president, citing
reports that police planned a heavy presence at some polling places
with many black voters, asked Republicans to ``renounce'' such
activities.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said Clinton's charges were false and that the
president was making a last-minute ploy to boost black voter
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States Tuesday falsely and
improperly suggested that the Republican Party is responsible for
voter intimidation in an effort to keep black Americans from
voting,'' said the Republican Party chairman, Jim Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson then asked Clinton to call upon the Missouri
Democratic Party to withdraw radio commercials ``suggesting that a
vote for Republicans would lead to church bombings and burnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute charges and countercharges about voter
intimidation resulted from a handful of incidents. Democrats, for
example, noted that Republicans in North Carolina have made plans
to videotape voters as they go to the polls, while Republicans
cited the Missouri Democrats' ad that said: ``When you don't vote,
you let another church explode.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was no evidence of widespread intimidation, the
pre-election rhetoric among party leaders underscored that many
races have tightened in the final days and could turn on a few
thousand votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing days of the campaign, Republicans spent $10
million on an ad campaign that highlighted the Clinton sex scandal.
Democrats, nearly broke as a party, responded by releasing an ad
that questioned whether Republicans care about ordinary people.
Democrats said they gained momentum from a backlash against the GOP
ads, which ran in 68 key districts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged a high turnout, especially among black voters, and
suggesting that Republicans would act irresponsibly if given more
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody stays home and we have people in here who would
be irresponsible, then things could get worse in a hurry,'' Clinton
said. ``That's a big risk that that's not worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the election, according to leaders of both parties,
is turnout. Curtis Gans, director for the Committee for the Study
of the American Electorate, said in an interview that he expected
turnout to be between 36 to 38 percent, ``but I am less sure of
that than at any time in my lifetime because of the subtext of the
impeachment issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gans said turnout might be slightly higher among the
``upper-income, better-educated, and older people. The first two
are lightly in the Republican direction, and the last is in the
Democratic direction.'' The impact of older voters could spell the
difference in many races, which explains why Democrats have spent a
lot of advertising dollars on promoting the idea that the party
will be more effective in protecting Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   As for black turnout, Gans foresees only a ``slight uptick.''
Republicans normally would be expected to pick up about 35 House
seats in a mid-term election when Democrats control the White
House. But with the GOP having picked up 52 seats in the 1994
election and already controlling the House 228 to 206, Republican
leaders predicted the party would do well to pick up 10 seats
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who for months have been playing down expectations in
the wake of Clinton's sex scandal, expressed confidence that they
are pulling ahead in key races and predicted strong showings in
Republican-leaning areas of the South and border states.
</P>
<P>
   In good news for Democrats, the Gallup Poll found that likely
voters prefer Democrats over Republicans by 49 percent to 45
percent in a generic congressional ballot. But the House races are
decided on many local issues, making it difficult to predict
whether Democrats will be ahead by such a margin in the actual
election.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, of 435 House races, 402 feature incumbents, nearly all
of whom are likely to be reelected. Most political analysts said
there are about three dozen highly competitive House contests and
perhaps six tight Senate contests out of 34 up for election.
</P>
<P>
   But among those tight races, many became even tighter in the
closing days of the campaign, making the election results tough to
call. A major swing even in the small number of competitive races
could determine which party controls Congress and affect the
outcome of a possible House impeachment vote and Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Boxer and Moseley-Braun races, the closest
Senate contests include those between Republican Senator Alfonse M.
D'Amato and Democratic Representative Charles E. Schumer of New
York, and between Republican Representative Jim Bunning and
Democratic Representative Scotty Baesler of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Republicans to pick up one to three seats in
the Senate, which is controlled 55-45 by the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were expected to pick several more governorships,
adding to their total of 32. Another 17 governors are Democratic
and one is an Independent. The most closely watched governor's race
is in California, where Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis is leading
Attorney General Dan Lungren.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ National political parties have been steadily
pumping money into critical state races, in part because whoever
controls the statehouses and governors' mansions will have a hand
in redrawing congressional districts after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in many races, money that would go to
congressional candidates is reaching candidates for governor and
state legislature in large amounts. Candidates like Ron Adair of
Roswell, N.M., who is running for the state Senate, received
$35,000 from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which
typically supports congressional candidates. In California, Helen
Thomson received $25,000 from the Democrats for her Assembly race
while the Republicans gave $125,000 to Lee Daniels, a state House
candidate.

   ``We are doing this for one overarching reason,'' said Mary
Crawford, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional
Committee, ``and that is because redistricting is important in the
long run to the next congressional election.''
</P>
<P>
   Control of 26 state legislative chambers is at stake Tuesday,
with some races so close that a loss of four or fewer seats would
shift the leadership to the other party.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the concern over redistricting more visible than in
California, where Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, and Attorney
General Dan Lungren, a Republican, are battling to be governor and
where all of the seats in the state Legislature are up for
re-election. Lawmakers will draw the congressional districts _ 52
of them or more depending on the the 2000 census _ for the decade
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires that each congressional district within a
state contain about the same number of people. But, as in all other
states, the districts in California, which has the largest
delegation in the country, can be drawn to benefit either the
Democrats or the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who controls that drafting process is very important,'' said
Craig Engle, general counsel at the National Republican Senatorial
Committee. ``In California, there could be a difference of 10 House
seats, depending on how the map is drawn. And when the Republicans
have an 11-vote margin in the House, losing 10 seats from
redistricting would be unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 Republican candidates who received more than $100,000
from the national party, six are seeking state office. Lungren
received the largest amount, $1.7 million. Other state office
seekers who received hefty checks were: Jim Ross Lightfoot, a
candidate for Iowa governor, and Robert Taft, a candidate for Ohio
governor, who each received $250,000, and J. Kenneth Blackwell, who
got $100,000 in his bid to become Ohio's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell, the state treasurer in Ohio, said Republicans gave
him additional money after he decided not to oppose Taft in a
primary. The party also contributed to his campaign because, as
secretary of state, Blackwell would cast one of the five votes on
the state reapportionment board, which draws the districts for the
state Legislature. The state lawmakers, in turn, draw the map for
the U.S. House districts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, a congressional expert at the Brookings
Institution, said there had been a marked increase in spending on
contested state races.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened before the 1990 election, which was the last
round of redistricting,'' Mann said, ``and it is happening again.
The parties are looking to play an influential role in
congressional redistricting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Right now, of the 99 state legislative chambers, one is split
evenly between the two parties, 49 are controlled by Democrats and
48 by Republicans. (Nebraska has a nonpartisan legislature.) Among
governors, 32 are Republicans, 17 are Democrats and one, Maine's,
is an independent. There are elections for governor Tuesday in 36
states.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have sent $4 million to California since July 1 for
all races. About $1.8 million was rushed there in the first week of
October, according to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is the 800-pound gorilla of this election,'' said
Steve Grossman, finance director of the Democratic National
Committee. ``This election is linked to the strategy for the year
2000 because it is about redistricting the biggest state in the
country and it will determine who controls the legislative process
and, therefore, a good part of the political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, national Republican Party committees have sent $37.8
million to state-level races since July 1, according to figures
compiled for The New York Times by the Campaign Study Group. That
money was also used to support federal candidates and
get-out-the-vote efforts. Democratic Party committees sent $31
million to state-level committees and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Another top recipient of Democratic dollars is Texas,
specifically the district of Rep. Martin Frost, who heads the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. That panel transferred
$1.2 million to Texas: $988,400 to the state Democratic Party;
$85,995 to the Tarrant County Democratic Party, $15,620 to the
Dallas County Democratic Party and $25,000 to Hidalgo County in the
Rio Grande Valley. (Tarrant and Dallas Counties are in Frost's
district.) In addition, $90,000 went to John Sharp, the Democratic
candidate for lieutenant governor.

DOW UP 114.05 AS STOCKS GAIN FOR FOURTH STRAIGHT SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mass.)   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices continued to plow ahead Monday as
investors gained more confidence that the days and weeks of
instability that were the norm from mid-July until late September
are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is good right now, for now,'' one stock trader
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a continued belief the Fed will ease interest rates
again,'' he added. ``Foreign markets are stable. There is not a lot
of new supply because there are not any deals. And mutual-fund
inflows continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, equities turned in a broad-based advance. The Dow
Jones industrial average Monday rose 114.05 points, or 1.33
percent, to 8,706.15.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth consecutive session to end with a gain for the
blue-chip gauge and the first time it has closed above 8,700 points
since Aug. 18. For the year, the Dow is up slightly more than 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market measures, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index gained 12.93 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,111.60. The NASDAQ
composite index rose 29.52 points, or 1.67 percent, to 1,800.91.
And the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 8.66
points, or 2.3 percent, to 386.82.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive session, investors bought stocks
despite a sharp rise in market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rates rose on all manner of Treasury securities Monday. The
price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell by more than a
point, and the yield rose to 5.25 percent, its highest level in six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the recent selloff in the government debt market
was a sign that investors were increasingly confident that
conditions no longer warranted the safety of Treasury notes and
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, the Treasury bond market got way ahead of itself
in terms of being a flight-to-quality haven,'' said Donald J. Fine,
chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. ``Now, money is
redistributing itself among all financial markets. If people start
getting nervous again, it may reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine said that developments over the last week had slightly
altered what had been a near-unanimous view in the credit markets
that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, however, that view is still widely if not
universally held. Moreover, there is little doubt that the Fed's
decision to cut rates in late September and again last month has
been vitally significant to the stock market's rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is that we now have financial leadership
worldwide, led by the Fed,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In a weekly letter sent to clients Monday, analysts at
International Strategy and Investment noted that concerns about the
world financial crisis prompted 17 central banks, including the
Fed, to cut interest rates last month. Six countries that lowered
rates are European, and those cuts have helped reinvigorate stock
markets on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Most European markets posted strong gains Monday, with indexes
in Britain, France and Germany all rising by more than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First
Boston, said that American equities had benefited from what has
been happening in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Western European markets, he said, ``are picking up steam as
we move toward the end of the year and the birth of the European
monetary union. That has given support to all industrialized
country markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Worries that a global economic downturn would hurt companies
that rely on overseas sales for a big part of their profits helped
to lower share prices of many multinational companies through the
last six weeks of the summer. Those concerns have abated somewhat,
and the stocks are beginning to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Coca-Cola, which relies on foreign sales for more
than 75 percent of its profits, was the Dow's best-performing
issue. Coke rose 3 7/16 a share, to 71. Boeing, another Dow stock,
gained 3}, to 41 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   A third Dow component, Citigroup, fell ~ a share, to 46[, after
James Dimon, co-chief of its investment banking unit and the
presumed heir apparent to Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's
co-chairman, abruptly announced his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Takeover stocks were big gainers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sofamor Danek Group, a surgical equipment maker, rose 8{ a
share, to 110[, after it agreed to be acquired by Medtronic Inc.,
one of the world's biggest manufacturers of pacemakers, in a stock
deal valued at $3.6 billion, or $115 a share. Medtronic shares rose
1 9/16, to 66 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Boole &AMP; Babbage Inc. gained 3{, to 30[, after BMC Software Inc.,
a leading maker of software to manage programs on computer
networks, agreed to buy the company for about $900 million in
stock, or $32.44 a share, based on Friday's closing prices. BMC
shares fell 2, to 46 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among other NASDAQ stocks, Intel rose 2| a share, to 91 13/16.
And Cisco Systems, which is expected to report its third-quarter
results on Wednesday, gained 1 11/16, to 64 11/16.

CHAT ROOM JERRY-RIGGED FOR LOVEBIRDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever hung out in an Internet chat room, you're
probably familiar with this kind of ``conversation,'' quoted
verbatim from a Phoenix-themed room:
</P>
<P>
   SGu6247690: MUSTANG SURE HE FINE HUH
</P>
<P>
   DaNcInAmB2: OH I DON'T CARE
</P>
<P>
   MustangPMP: hell yeah
</P>
<P>
   RTallant: I want to get lucky with a gorgeous woman
</P>
<P>
   DMBalicia: i dont know, some chick on cross country
</P>
<P>
   BlndAzQt: MUSTANG is pretty hot but not my type
</P>
<P>
   MustangPMP: shut up heather -)
</P>
<P>
   Not quite Jefferson's letters to Madison. But stimulating for
those who consider ``Us'' magazine too intellectually challenging,
I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, though, why bother?
</P>
<P>
   But before you write off all chat rooms as places for the
immature and shallow, you should know about Sharon and Jerry
France.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon was an office manager for an animal clinic in Dyer, Ind.,
three years ago when she bought a computer. She didn't know the
first thing about it, so she tried a little bit of this and that. &QL; 
Beginners' luck &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to learn everything right away,'' she said. So she
experimented with all her computer had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, she eventually gave chat rooms a try, and her first
few forays yielded results like the chatter above. But she stuck
with it, looked around a little more and eventually found a chat
room frequented by people with similar interests.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all she found.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first times I was ever there,'' she said, ``I met
my future husband.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Jerry, who co-owns an insurance agency in Lake
Havasu City. His side of the story is even better: He met Sharon
the ``first time'' he entered a chat room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody told me about it,'' he said. ``They said give it a
try, so I did. It was just luck.''
</P>
<P>
   No. Three bars on a slot machine are luck. This was something
different, something better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have the feeling that it was ordained,'' Jerry
allowed. ``It was sort of like destiny, I guess. Or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Something indeed. It wasn't long before the electronic lovebirds
were swapping e-mail and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was calling me every single day,'' Sharon said. ``He was
supporting Ma Bell for a while there.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after almost a year of e-mails and long-distance
conversations, Jerry flew to Indiana to meet Sharon in person. If
you are at all familiar with nightmarish chat-room lore, you know
that it was quite a relief to Jerry to find that Sharon wasn't
really a 14-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he wasn't worried about that sort of prank. They had
exchanged photos. And he wasn't worried whether she would live up
to all he had come to expect of her from the e-mails and talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worried whether I would live up to her expectations,'' he
said. &QL; 
They're a hit! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He did, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit it off in person as well as we did on the computer and
telephone,'' Sharon said. ``It was sort of like getting to know
someone from the inside out.''
</P>
<P>
   They hit it off so well, in fact, that Sharon moved to Lake
Havasu last year, and in January, they got married.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, you're thinking, cute story _ a couple of crazy kids
who probably didn't know any better.
</P>
<P>
   Except that they're both 53.
</P>
<P>
   Young at heart, though.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon still visits the fateful chat room, but Jerry doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to chat with her, she's right here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the cyberspace aspect of their relationship
has crashed. Both of them have computers in their house and use
them frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sends me e-mails all the time,'' Sharon said. ``We sit 3
feet away, and still e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? It's worked from the start. No reason to log off now. &QL;

INTERNAL MEMO SHOWS MICROSOFT EXECUTIVES' CONCERN OVER FREE
SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-TRIAL, MICROSOFT-GATES) 
(pr) 
 By AMY HARMON   and JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An internal memorandum reflecting the views of some of Microsoft
Corp.'s top executives and software development managers reveals
deep concern about the threat of free software and proposes a
number of strategies for competing against free programs that have
recently been gaining in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The memo warns that the quality of free software can meet or
exceed that of commercial programs and describes it as a
potentially serious threat to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The document was sent anonymously last week to Eric Raymond, a
key figure in a loosely knit group of software developers who
collaboratively create and distribute free programs ranging from
operating systems to Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives acknowledged on Monday that the document
was authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Muth, Microsoft's Enterprise Marketing Group manager,
said it had been widely disseminated among employees who were
interested in the threat posed to Microsoft by Linux, a highly
regarded version of the Unix operating system that is distributed
free.
</P>
<P>
   While Muth took issue with some of the memo's points, he said
that its author, Vinod Valloppillil, a Microsoft software engineer,
was a close friend and that he agreed with most aspects of his
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to acknowledging that free programs can compete with
commercial software in terms of quality, the memorandum calls the
free software movement a ``long-term credible'' threat and warns
that employing a traditional Microsoft marketing strategy known as
``FUD,'' an acronym for ``fear, uncertainty and doubt,'' will not
succeed against the developers of free software.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum also voices concern that Linux is rapidly
becoming the dominant version of Unix for computers powered by
Intel microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive issues, the note warns, go beyond the fact that
the software is free. It is also part of the open-source software,
or O.S.S., movement, which encourages widespread, rapid development
efforts by making the source code _ that is, the original lines of
code written by programmers _ readily available to anyone. This
enables programmers the world over to continually write or suggest
improvements or to warn of bugs that need to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum notes that open software presents a threat
because of its ability to mobilize thousands of programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of the O.S.S. process to collect and harness the
collective I.Q. of thousands of individuals across the Internet is
simply amazing,'' the memo states. ``More importantly, O.S.S.
evangelization scales with the size of the Internet much faster
than our own evangelization efforts appear to scale.''
</P>
<P>
   In computer-speak, this means that the growth of the Internet is
producing a far more efficient medium for collaboration on open
programming than for marketing traditional, proprietary software.
</P>
<P>
   The memo is on the Web at
http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html with annotations by
Raymond, the author of a treatise in defense of free software
titled ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar.''
</P>
<P>
   Its appearance touched off immediate speculation among
programmers both about the timing of the leak and the content of
the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is locked in a court battle with the U.S. Justice
Department over business practices it has developed around its
monopoly operating system, Windows.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a number of the company's critics speculated that the
release of the memo might be timed to suggest that while Windows is
shipped on more than 90 percent of all personal computers sold
today _ and while Microsoft programs dominate dozens of markets _
the software giant faces real competition.

 &HT;    Close call: Plane missed long drop-off
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks and Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The AirTran plane that ran off a runway at Hartsfield
International Airport Sunday came close to an estimated 60-foot
embankment before it ploughed into an earthen berm, a federal
safety official said Monday. The accident resulted in at least 10
of the plane's 100 passengers sustaining sprains, cuts, bruises and
minor injuries, but the embankment posed a greater threat, said
John Goglia, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Goglia described the drop-off as severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome would have been different if (the plane) had
missed the berm,'' Goglia said at a midday news conference at
Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt berm was created by nearby taxiway construction,
airport spokesman Robert Kennedy said. But if it hadn't been there,
the plane's front landing gear could just as easily have mired in
the ground before reaching the embankment, Kennedy added.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB sent 30 investigators to Hartsfield and divided them
into seven teams to look into the incident. The investigation will
focus on the plane's hydraulic system to determine if its failure
is the reason the pilot couldn't steer the plane after he made an
emergency landing shortly after takeoff for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB responded with a large number of investigators because
``loss of hydraulics is a very serious problem,'' Goglia said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Boeing 737-200 instruments flashed a problem with the
hydraulics, the plane returned to Hartsfield at 5:30 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It could take days to dislodge the plane from the berm with
either cranes or air bags, Goglia said. The aircraft is out of the
way and not interfering with airport operations on one of the
southern runways east of Concourse E, an airport spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old jet is leased to the carrier by GE Capital
Aviation Services, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration records reflect two safety
incidents and 72 ``service difficulty reports'' involving the
Boeing 737-200 since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One of the incidents, in February 1996, involved hydraulic
failure upon takeoff from Omaha, Neb., forcing the plane to return
to the airport. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether the hydraulic problem in that incident was
similar to the one that caused the plane to return to Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   The other past incident involved a cooling fan that shorted out
while the plane was on the ground, creating smoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The service difficulty reports, which log routine maintenance
issues serious enough to be reported to the FAA, include a variety
of problems that were corrected. Most involve corrosion on various
internal metal parts, a common problem in older planes. The airline
said the plane had two regular maintenance checks in October and
one in September.

REPUBLICANS HOPE ADS TURN OUT VOTE FOR AN UNDERDOG

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCK HILL, S.C. _ Over a steaming plate of baked beans and
Southern-style barbecue, Mark Penny, a Republican precinct chairman
here, was shaking his head Monday over new Republican attack ads
that aim to exploit President Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of money,'' Penny, a 63-year-old retired real
estate dealer, said of one television spot that asked if Clinton
should be rewarded for ``not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever turnout we have will be from people voting their
convictions,'' not from negative ads, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But national Republican campaign strategists are betting
otherwise. Here in South Carolina's 5th Congressional District, one
of 30 targeted in a $10 million nationwide campaign, Republicans
hope the ads will stir up their base and help their underdog
challenger, Mike Burkhold, oust eight-term Democratic incumbent
John M. Spratt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have long coveted this Democratic
outpost in one of the nation's most conservative states, especially
since the last three Republican presidential candidates _ Ronald
Reagan, George Bush and Bob Dole _ prevailed here. Indeed,
Republican luminaries Newt Gingrich, Oliver North and Marilyn
Quayle have campaigned in recent weeks for Burkhold, a 29-year-old
former town administrator and specialty-foods company executive.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the National Republican Congressional Committee
flooded the district with mailings that contended ``there's not a
dime's worth of difference'' between Spratt and Clinton. The
leaflets sought to tar Spratt as a supporter of Clinton's ``liberal
social'' and ``pro-abortion'' agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our base is not happy with Bill Clinton,'' said Burkhold, who
joined Spratt in donning an apron and serving up coleslaw and iced
tea at a charity barbecue Monday at Sullivan Middle School. ``We
need to get our base out to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkhold, who acknowledged that he had not seen any of the ads
and learned of them last week from a reporter, discounted any
backlash from voters sick of impeachment talk. He said Democrats
here were too disgusted to defend Clinton or his surrogates. But
the district is about one-third black, so the potential for
energizing the other party's voters is there.
</P>
<P>
   None of this seems to worry Spratt, 56, whose district runs from
this Republican-leaning suburb of Charlotte, N.C., to the dusty old
Democratic textile towns to the east. ``If the effects of this ad
campaign are out there, I don't sense it,'' he said after
traversing his district.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do many Republicans who plan to vote for Burkhold, but not
because of some last-minute prodding. ``I don't put much stock in
that,'' said Matt England, a 49-year-old contractor. ``I don't pay
much attention to those negative ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican voters here say the ads will be just the tonic
to turn the tide against Spratt. ``They'll agitate a good many
people,'' said Mary Rawls, a retired elementary school teacher who
has lived here for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie Helms, a 36-year-old building inspector, and her two
children, Trey, 12, and Taylor, 5, wore ``I Like Mike'' buttons.
``Democrats are in trouble this year, and this will hurt the whole
Democratic ticket,'' Ms. Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult to stick a label of ``tax-and-spend
liberal'' on Spratt, a centrist and one of only 31 Democrats who
voted last month to begin formal impeachment proceedings against
Clinton. Spratt also played an important role in last year's
balanced-budget compromise, is hawkish on defense, and serves on a
special House panel investigating whether China improperly obtained
sensitive American technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans would like to tie Spratt close to Clinton, but
that'll be hard to do,'' said Marty Mobley, a 46-year-old
electrical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhold has run hard on a theme of ``new energy, new
leadership,'' borrowing a page from Rep. Bob Inglis, the Republican
who is challenging Democratic Sen. Ernest F. Hollings in a titanic
battle for his Senate seat here.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago, Burkhold favored an upbeat campaign that
focused on lower taxes, prayer in public schools and less federal
government. Even Spratt's campaign manager, Matt Kuhn, complimented
the challenger's serious tone.
</P>
<P>
   But things have turned nasty. Republicans last week broadcast a
spot challenging Spratt's record on school prayer. Spratt said the
ads were false and demanded that they be pulled. Burkhold at first
distanced himself from the spots, noting that they were paid for by
his party, but after viewing them said he did not find them
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   To be effective, the new television ads dwelling on Clinton must
attract attention, but this area is saturated with spots for
contested gubernatorial and Senate races in North and South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deadening the message,'' said Glen Broach, chairman of
the political science department at Winthrop University here. ``The
effects of these ads will be marginal.''

 &HT;    Candidates make final pitches
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With one day left to subvert a Republican takeover of
Georgia government, seven Democratic candidates for statewide
office and the popular outgoing Democratic governor boarded three
planes after sunrise Monday for a seven-city tarmac tour to show
ticket diversity and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   Gubernatorial candidate Roy Barnes called the ``Victory '98 Fly
Around'' a ``message of continuity of Gov. Zell Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Miller were accompanied by lieutenant governor candidate
Mark Taylor; state school superintendent candidate Joe Martin;
secretary of state candidate Cathy Cox; Attorney General Thurbert
Baker; labor commission candidate Mike Thurmond; and U.S. Senate
candidate Michael Coles.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with complaints about the Republicans, candidates
joked amoung themselves to ease last day jitters.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, who is black, was ribbed about being related to
Republican icon, U.S. Sen Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who is
white. ``Maybe they ought to do a DNA test,'' quipped Mike
Thurmond, referring to the recent tests that show Thomas Jefferson
had an African-American branch to his family tree.
</P>
<P>
   In Chattanooga, which has about 150,000 Georgian suburbanites,
Barnes pointed out the get-out-the-vote urgency by saying there are
2,200 precincts statewide and ``several of these elections can be
determined by four or five votes difference in each precinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also out in search of the precious votes in
those precincts.
</P>
<P>
   As the Democratic caravan reached Augusta, they were greeted by
placard-toting supporters of Republican U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell
who had just left the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic operatives plaster the terminal with posters where
Coverdell placards hung 10 minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governor's candidate Guy Millner was also making one
last whirlwind tour of the state Monday, trying to drum up the
votes to make him Georgia's first GOP governor in more than 130
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the Democrats finished their tour at
Peachtree-DeKalb Airport, Millner rallied about 150 supporters
there during a stopover on his own seven-city fly-around.
</P>
<P>
   A sea of blue and white Millner '98 signs, chants of ``Go Guy,
go'' and an eight-foot elephant greeted Millner and his traveling
companion for the day, Secretary of State nominee John McCallum.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Democrats, who have campaigned together as a ticket,
Millner has rarely been seen with GOP lieutenant governor candidate
Mitch Skandalakis, who has been roundly criticized recently for
negative campaigning and ads that Democrats call race-baiting.
Skandalakis campaigned elsewhere Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that several polls show the race a dead-heat, or give him
a tenuous edge, Millner told supporters the race now depends on
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   In Augusta, Patricia McCracken, an activist who started a
newsletter focusing on energy issues said she wanted to see Barnes,
an old Marietta, Ga. friend, to try to get some support for her
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they say the same thing at every stop?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election could be determined by four or five votes in
each precinct,'' said Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   In Savannah, the Dems again arrive in the wake of Coverdell. And
Miller again tells the crowd of about 60 supporters that his
travelling candidate companions, four white men, two black men and
one white woman ``look like Georgia, not like charter members of a
country club.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing his stump speech, Miller unsuccessfully tries to
get his cell phone to work and pauses momentarily when asked about
thoughts on his last campaign as an elected official. ``I'm not
nostalgic,'' he contends. The concrete issue of getting out votes
to continue his legacy keep him from pondering too much.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, Barnes says his supporters tell him to smile more
while debating Millner. ``But it's hard to smile when I'm around
him,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight to Albany, Baker reflects on the ego-driven grind
that is political campaigning. ``All this would be fun if you
didn't have to worry about the winning and losing,'' he chuckles.
The other passengers tell him he's been on the road too long.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Miller says, ``Folks, I'll tell you like it is. This
is a tough, tough, close, close race. I think it can be won in
South Georgia,'' he says, giving the crowd ownership of the race.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later in Clumbus, Baker lets the locals know ``as
Columbus goes, so goes the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   In politics, no locality is an important as the one you're in.
</P>
<P>
   In Macon, former Democratic Ocmulgee County District Attorney
Joe Briley, winces at the feeling that Republicans are breathing
down his party's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close, but I don't think the Republicans will take over
this year,'' he said confidently. He then adds, ``I'm thinking it's
four years away.''

MORPHINE-BASED PASTE IS FOUND TO GET RID OF BACK-SURGERY PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Nurses noticed it almost immediately: The
morphine-based paste tested in Phoenix wiped out pain caused by
back surgery. Patients awoke with relief on their faces instead of
grimaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something to go in a patient's room and ask, `Do you
need anything?' And they would say, `No, I don't think so,' '' said
Dr. Volker Sonntag, vice president of the Barrow Neurological
Institute's department of neurosurgery.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow researchers on Friday presented the results of a yearlong
study that suggests they have found an effective way to reduce the
pain of back surgery. The institute's research could affect many
Americans who suffer from back pain, but who believe surgery would
make their lives even more miserable. An estimated 30 percent of
Americans experience some sort of back pain.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers offered their findings in San Francisco at a
meeting of the North American Spine Society. A presentation earlier
in October to the National Congress of Neurosurgeons generated
about 60 phone calls from colleagues around the country. Barrow has
won two national awards for the research.
</P>
<P>
   The paste, the consistency of thick cake batter, also may be
used to ease pain caused by assorted other surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, researchers have developed many types of
painkillers. But there has been little help for back surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Morphine has been squirted directly into the nerves exposed
during surgery, but it has offered only short-term relief.
Painkillers have been funneled in via catheters but that increased
infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing that was 100 percent effective. We couldn't
give people a lot of choices,'' Sonntag said.
</P>
<P>
   But after hearing of a patient who went biking one day after
back surgery, Sonntag and other surgeons are more optimistic. The
reason came after Sonntag accepted an offer from a doctor he had
worked with almost 25 years ago at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   While riding on a bus to a conference, Sonntag was approached by
Dr. Charles Needham, professor of neurosurgery at the Yale
University College of Medicine. Needham had created a paste. Would
Sonntag test it on his patients?
</P>
<P>
   Sonntag, an internationally recognized surgeon, agreed, and
Barrow decided to test the paste on 60 patients from January 1996
to August 1997. Only patients who had never previously had back
surgery participated in the study. Most patients signed
enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Some did have concerns about getting hooked on morphine. Sonntag
assured them a one-time dose of the potent painkiller wouldn't
cause addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sonntag nor the patients knew who got the paste and who
got a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   One of the roles of Dr. Nicholas Theodore, one of the study's
researchers, was to mix and apply the paste to the epidural, which
was inserted into the spine in the same place women in labor get
anesthesia. One part of the paste acts as a reservoir, slowing the
release of the morphine and anti-inflammatories.
</P>
<P>
   Although only Theodore knew for sure which patients got the
paste, nurses quickly caught on as patients awoke in the recovery
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The nurses) would know that this guy got the juice,'' said
Sonntag.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Sutton was one who got the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept trying to get them to tell me if I would get it. The
nurses told me that if I got it, I would know it,'' said Sutton,
who went in for surgery because her nerves and spinal cord were
being squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery, the 75-year-old Glendale woman didn't have to
take any pain pills. She went home the next day. Although she had a
6-inch scar along her spine, she soon hit the shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's story was typical. The Barrow study showed:
</P>
<P>
   Patients who took the paste consumed three times less pain
medication than those who had the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Patients' relief from pain came within 24 hours and lasted for
up to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who received the placebo took up to 12 weeks to feel
better.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore said they could not detect any patients having side
effects from the paste. Sometimes, using morphine can cause
respiratory problems but there was no complication like that,
probably because it was used in such a small dose, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore and Janine Drabier, a research nurse at Barrow,
conducted a follow-up study of the patients a year later and found
none reported side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Needham now will use the Barrow studies to convince the Food and
Drug Administration to approve his paste.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, surgeons can concoct their own version of the paste.
Its ingredients already have been approved for other uses such as
blood clotting and reducing inflammation. But to use drugs
``off-label'' like that, doctors must get the consent of their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easier if the paste could be packaged and come into
the operating room pre-made, Sonntag said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitchell Gropper, assistant professor of surgery at UA, said
the study offers welcome news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always coach my patients on how bad it is going to be. I
don't want them to have any false expectations but I tell them that
it's an investment in the future. This could be very promising,''
he said. &QL;

FRENCH MAJOR ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF SPYING FOR SERBIA
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A French military officer at NATO headquarters in
Brussels has been arrested on suspicion of telling Serbia about
targets that the alliance was planning to bomb if Serbian forces
did not stop attacking civilians in Kosovo last month, French
officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Maj. Pierre Bunel, 46, is suspected of having
passed top-secret documents to Serbian agents, officials said. He
is assigned to the alliance's military committee, a liaison panel
between the NATO military commands and the civilian political
authorities that they report to.
</P>
<P>
   The documents related information about military targets that
NATO forces would hit if President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
failed to meet a deadline of Oct. 27 to stop an offensive against
civilians in Kosovo, the mainly ethnic Albanian province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The allies had given their top military commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark, authority to begin bombing throughout Yugoslavia that
evening if Milosevic did not comply. But they postponed the start
of the attacks indefinitely after Milosevic began pulling back his
forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Brussels had no comment tonight on the arrest,
which French officials said was made on Saturday morning in Paris.
Bunel admitted passing documents to the Serbs but said he had acted
out of sympathy for the Serbian cause, not for money, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   France, though not part of the integrated command structure of
NATO, is a member of the alliance and has deployed thousands of
troops under American command to the peacekeeping operations in
Bosnia.

 GATES ON TRIAL ON THE INTERNET _ VIRTUALLY  (See also:(pr) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the dry paper trail of court deposition, it was
simply government exhibit number 1400, recorded last August. But on
the Internet of real life on Monday, number 1400 turned out to be
the man himself, Bill Gates, Microsoft mogul under fire, suddenly
appearing in watery living color, his recorded image slightly
dream-like but definitely in motion above the keyboard, his voice
firm in fencing with his inquisitors for all the world's surfers to
witness, virtually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything more than what it says in the e-mail,''
Gates _ his color image slightly tattered, but slightly glowing,
too _ could be seen and heard declaring from computer screens at
mid-afternoon for anyone who managed to finally join the crowd on
the TechWeb site for the special presentation headlined ``Microsoft
On Trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience was to see Gates engulfed in his ultimate
element, defending himself on the very Web he helped to propagate.
It was the media evangelist as message, the person most identified
with the Web having to defend himself under oath and on the Web in
his pre-trial deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony recorded last August, Gates could be seen
seated at an office desk, leafing through endless printouts of
e-mails and warily responding as a witness at the government's
antitrust trial of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting documents, brushing back his boyish bangs, Gates was
seen seated in his headquarters in Redmond, Wash., defending his
realm from charges that he bullied competitors and unfairly
monopolized the lucrative world of the Internet and its multimedia
offshoots.
</P>
<P>
   The image filtered through the website technology offered a
shimmering, blurry edge, as if transferred from deep space. But his
voice and the printed scroll of his testimony provided a clear
measure that the issue was high-stakes and rooted in the realm of
the wordly.
</P>
<P>
   An amateur on the web confronted the usual flood of wonky arcana
and remained clueless about such dark sounding e-mail excerpts as
someone's bit of corporate resolve to ``keep them from sabotaging
our platform evolution.'' And Gates himself was painstaking in
sifting through the abstruse terminology that is routine in his
electronic universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever had discussions within Microsoft about the
desirablity of trying to undermine Sun because of what Sun was
doing in Java?`` he was suddenly asked, as if caught in some
high-tech James Bond denouement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the term Java itself can mean different things,'' he
replied, checkmate fast.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone hoping to duplicate the unusual experience last August of
witnessing President Clinton's deposition under fire had to be
disappointed. Software and monopoly, not sex and mendacity, was at
the heart of the Gates deposition. The brand-name of the soft drink
Gates quaffed for comfort was not clear in the muddy web images.
Like the other chief executive, however, Gates did not hesitate to
parse some of the unfriendly questions he faced in defending
himself against antitrust accusations from the Justice Department
and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what you're talking about when you say `ask,'''
he responded to one question in the first trial salvo to be
webcast, his image interrupted, then reappearing in blurred motion,
shady as a Howard Hughes sighting.
</P>
<P>
   If there was anything new to be noticed about Gates in his
celebrity, it was, perhaps, that he was not always the wonk some
might understand him to be.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with one piece of e-mail, he was asked whether he
recognized it as a document from Microsoft's files.

<P>
   ``No,'' he flatly replied, his image floating opaquely on the
computer screen as he awaited some counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how would I know that?'' he asked, with his questioner
then referring him to ``document production numbers'' at the end of
the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what those numbers are,'' Gates replied with
impatience refreshing to any watching non-wonk, hardly apologetic
that the webmeister's eye need not be on every sparrow. In similar
spirit, he noted that he had never read the government's actual
complaint against him. ``I've talked to my lawyers about the
case,'' he said, relying on the high-paid specialists from that
entirely different web of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   With all his questioners off-screen and the broadcast arriving
somewhat disconnected and buffered at times, Gates' deposition came
across as something of an anti-climax to anyone craving the sense
of a trial's human cut-and-thrust. In the opening minutes of the
deposition excerpt, Stephen Houck, a lawyer for the state side in
the case, began asking about a Microsoft office ``memorandum,'' but
quickly realized how antique he sounded to such a man as Bill
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize for using my old-fashioned terminology,'' said
Houck, thereafter putting the case and its disputants firmly in an
e-mail frame of reference.
</P>
<P>
   On the computer screen, Gates was watching and listening
closely, his image blurry but right there, on the web.

THE YEAR IN GOLF: MAJORS BETTER THAN MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In honor of John Daly, whose 12-step approach to battling
alcoholism apparently will result in the PGA Tour's biggest victory
of the 1998 season, here are a dozen lessons professional golf fans
should have learned in the past calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, none of them involve ways to improve your game to the
point you could challenge the season-earnings record of $2,591,031
set yesterday by David Duval at the Tour Championship. But here is
what the savvy spectator should carry forward to the 1999 season
for a greater understanding of professional golf and professional
golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Money is good; majors are better.
</P>
<P>
   Duval led the PGA Tour in victories (four) and earnings. But he
expects to finish second to Mark O'Meara, winner of the Masters and
British Open, when peers cast ballots for player-of-the-year honors
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any other year, I've had a player of the year-type
season,'' Duval said. ``But I still believe the majors are the four
most important weeks of the year. I don't even know if I have a
chance to win it, to be honest. You have to look at Mark because of
the two majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Amateurs cannot be discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Those who play for something other than pay cast an imposing
shadow in major championships. Jenny Chuasiriporn, a senior at
Duke, lost in a 20-hole playoff at the Women's U.S. Open. Justin
Rose, a 17-year-old from England, finished fourth at the British
Open. Matt Kuchar, a senior at Georgia Tech, finished 14th at the
U.S. Open and 21st at the Masters. Overall, six amateurs posted
top-25 finishes on the PGA or LPGA tours.
</P>
<P>
   Current purses are chump change.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Duval's PGA Tour earnings record to survive next
season, when television exposure for tour events will increase 20
percent. In addition, the advent of the World Golf Championships _
a series of four high-profile events limited to the game's
top-ranked players _ will boost the total purse for PGA Tour events
to $130 million, up from $96 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   A season of $3 million in earnings for one player suddenly is a
realistic goal.
</P>
<P>
   Player dissension is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   With purses skyrocketing, it seems an ill-advised time for
players to complain and expect much public support. But a group of
players, led by journeyman Danny Edwards, have formed an
organization called the Tour Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   The TPA takes issue with the World Golf Championships being
limited-field events that still count in the official money list, a
move they claim will widen the disparity between the haves and
have-nots on the PGA Tour. TPA members also seek a more public
accounting of tour revenues from commissioner Tim Finchem and a
greater voice for rank-and-file players in formation of Tour
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in August, TPA membership has peaked at 53, well below a
majority of players. How much clout the organization will have
remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is not slumping. He's human.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he won only one PGA Tour event in 1998. But Woods entered
the Tour Championship with the same scoring average (69.10) he had
during his 1997 season, which included four victories and rampant
Tigermania.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also finished second to Duval in the race for the Vardon
Trophy, given to the player with the lowest scoring average for the
season. In Woods' estimation, the dropoff in victories is offset
over the long haul by a swing change that eliminated his tendency
toward boom or bust rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the strides I've made,'' Woods said.
``Expectations \Rfrom outsiders\S obviously have diminished, but
that's all good. To me, this has been a great year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors have rediscovered Texas golf fans.
</P>
<P>
   After abandoning the Fort Worth-Dallas market in 1995, the
Senior Tour returns next season with the Bank One Championship on
Sept. 17-19 at Las Colinas Country Club in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA Tour, which last held a full-field event in Texas in
1991, also returns. The Philips Invitational Honoring Harvey
Penick, a 72-hole event, is scheduled for May 20-23 at Onion Creek
Golf Club in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just a young man's game.
</P>
<P>
   Three 20-something players won major championships on the PGA
Tour in 1997. This season, the average age of the four major
champions was 37.5. In addition, Tom Watson and John Cook became
the first over-40 players to sweep the Fort Worth-Dallas tour
events since 1958. Watson, 48, won the MasterCard Colonial and
Cook, 40, prevailed at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The wheels of progress keep spinning.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin rolled into our consciousness with a golf cart and
a court order, forever altering the way people view handicapped
golfers. Martin, who struggles to walk because of a circulatory
disorder in his leg, won once on the Nike Tour and qualified for
the U.S. Open. He also won in court, gaining the right to ride in a
cart during competition. But he must go through the PGA Tour
qualifying tournament in December to regain playing privileges in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Players walk softer while swinging big sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The clickety-clack of metal spikes is becoming a distant memory
at professional golf tournaments, especially those on the LPGA
Tour. A survey of players showed 78 percent of competitors used
nonmetal spikes last season. The figure was 60 percent on the
Senior Tour, 41 percent on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring records are an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Huston finished 28 under at the Hawaiian Open, wiping out
the PGA Tour's 72-hole scoring record that had been held for 43
years by the late Ben Hogan. On the LPGA Tour, Se Ri Pak lapped the
field at the Jamie Farr Classic, setting records for single-round
(61) and 72-hole (261) totals. Notah Begay posted the first 59 in
Nike Tour history, tying the lowest score ever in professional
golf.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is not life.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most poignant moments of the season came while
watching Daly, a recovering alcoholic, suffer through involuntary
shakes while finishing a round of 74 in Vancouver, British
Columbia. Another came at the PGA Championship, where Stuart
Appleby received a standing ovation after completing his first
tournament following the death of his wife, Renay, in an automobile
accident the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best-laid plans can still fall through.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Country Club representatives, who spent 32 months and
$225,000 in a high-profile pursuit of the 2003 Ryder Cup, were
reminded of this last month when PGA of America executives opted to
award the event to another course that spent far less time and
money in organizing its bid.

SPORTS COLUMN: FLUTIE AND TESTAVERDE TEST FATES
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
BY HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Do not ask Vinny Testaverde to expound on the
symbolism of Doug Flutie, the Orange Bowl and 1984, other than to
refer to a game he watched from the sideline as ``one of the
greatest'' he ever saw and that, during the third quarter, he
turned to one of his teammates to say, ``The team with the ball
last is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was a redshirt quarterback for Jimmy Johnson's Miami
Hurricanes that day, Nov. 23, almost 14 years ago. Down to his
final fling, Flutie somehow found Gerard Phelan in an end zone
crowd for 64 yards, a touchdown, a 47-45 victory for Boston College
and one career-defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   All these years later, Testaverde, who was supposedly destined
for his own snapshots of indelible brilliance, pursues the perfect
astrological alignment of the stars, the moon and the Meadowlands.
At 34, he plays on for what Flutie extraordinarily achieved with
that one desperation pass at 22. Testaverde plays on to be
remembered as a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kept his poise and he's not making a lot of bad
decisions,'' Bill Parcells said, in the manner of a neutral
observer more than a biased coach, referring to Testaverde's latest
episodic rewriting of his reputation. The Jets' tough-to-please
coach was thrilled with his team's 20-17 rain-soaked victory on
Sunday at Kansas City, tempered in what statement, if any, the
Testaverde-led Jets had made in terms of establishing themselves as
a post-New Year's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you last week, it's too early for that,'' Parcells
said. ``There's not enough on the line. That has to be further down
the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatically spoken, but even the coach knows that this week,
he cannot hold back the forces of hyperbole. Flutie and the Buffalo
Bills come to New Jersey on Sunday, matching two of four deadlocked
division rivals and the two top-rated quarterbacks in the American
Football Conference. They are also former Heisman Trophy winners,
one whose career drifted south of mediocrity, the other's north of
the border, before they rose this season from the benches of their
new teams to pitch 5-0 shutouts as the starters in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know both of them won the Heisman, to tell you
the truth,'' Parcells said. ``But I think this is interesting.
Flutie is a good story, with all he's accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Part by perception, part by performance, Flutie, 36, has
actually lived with little of the underachiever's rap that
Testaverde has. Testaverde, at 6 feet 5 inches, showed up with the
classic quarterback's body, and the right collegiate breeding. Few
believed Flutie, at 5-9, from pesky B.C., would be more than a
marginal pro. Those who ridicule the National Football League for
ignoring him for years while he won championships in Canada
conveniently forget the uninspiring years Flutie had in Chicago and
New England, from 1986 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, in all likelihood, became a better quarterback in
Canada, by the recurrence of personal and collective success.
``These guys were both good players,'' Parcells said. ``They've got
some God-given talent. Flutie's is different from Vinny's, but
they've been playing a long time. So then a situation comes along
that allows them to flourish a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   In so many words, Parcells was saying, hold on, don't get
carried away by part of one half-season. Quarterbacks may improve
with advancing age, but not quite like wine. Testaverde and Flutie
haven't exactly reinvented themselves. They have stepped into
better circumstances. They have, to date, made the most of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Testaverde, it is not as if he has no track
record. After escaping Tampa Bay, he drove Cleveland two rounds
into the playoffs in 1994. Two years later, he was a Pro Bowl
performer on a bad Baltimore team. Long since forgotten is his 21-1
record as a two-year college starter, but he may never live down
five interceptions against Penn State in the 1987 Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've continued to work at this, and it feels good to know it
pays off,'' Testaverde said. ``The more experience you have, the
better knowledge you have.''
</P>
<P>
   He did sound like a winner when he stepped into the Jets' huddle
on Sunday before their game-winning drive. ``This is what great
teams do,'' he said. ``Finish teams off on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are not a great team, not yet, any more than Testaverde
is a great quarterback. But together they went down the field,
making several crucial plays, and scored. Testaverde was one step
closer to the playoffs, to giving himself a chance to step into the
kind of Flutie moment he witnessed from the sideline 14 years ago.

RANGERS STILL WANT CLAYTON, BUT WON'T WAIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Jose Vizcaino and Jeff Blauser are two
shortstops the Rangers might have to consider if they can't re-sign
free agent Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said re-signing Clayton is still a
top priority. But Melvin said if Clayton starts shopping himself to
other teams, then the Rangers will have to start talking trade
about a shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a guy goes into free agency and files and they want to
hear what other clubs are offering, then they're telling us we're
free to pursue other options,'' Melvin said. ``We can't wait for
guys to talk to other clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton is the only front-line shortstop eligible for free
agency, but Melvin said other teams have called about shortstops
available for trade.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin declined to reveal names, but major-league officials said
the Los Angeles Dodgers, after acquiring Mark Grudzielanek during
the season, are shopping Vizcaino and the Chicago Cubs are offering
Blauser, who lost his job to Jose Hernandez late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is San Francisco Giants shortstop Rey
Sanchez, who split time with Rich Aurilia this year. Before
acquiring Clayton in a July 31 trade with St. Louis, Melvin had
interest in Sanchez. The Florida Marlins might trade Edgar
Renteria, but first they want to make sure that Triple-A prospect
Alex Gonzalez is ready to take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people out there we're going to have to take a
look at,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs have exclusive negotiating rights with their own free
agents until Friday. Melvin said he'll continue to talk with
Clayton's agent, Arn Tellem, and will know better by the end of the
week if a deal can get done quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not optimistic,'' Melvin said. ``There's nothing
imminent. I get a sense these guys have been instructed \Rby the
Players Association\S to test the market unless you overwhelm
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellem could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin is also talking with Jeff Moorad, Will Clark's attorney,
but said re-signing Clayton and the Rangers' quest for pitching
help remain his top priorities. Clark is eligible for free agency,
but has yet to file.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to see what Clayton costs and what pitching costs
and then go from there,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Moorad said, ``Will's first clear choice is to re-sign with the
Rangers. In that regard we've been purposely dragging our feet on
filing for free agency in hoping to give the process with the
Rangers a chance to reach a conclusion.''

COURT AGREES TO RESOLVE DISPUTE OVER LAW ON GIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The law that prohibits giving ``anything of value''
to a federal official, known as the unlawful gratuity statute,
criminalizes conduct that falls somewhere in the zone between
outright bribery and the innocent exchange of gifts between
friends, one of whom happens to be a public official.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in a case growing out of an independent counsel's
investigation of Mike Espy, the former secretary of agriculture in
the Clinton administration who is being tried on criminal charges
here, the Supreme Court agreed to resolve a dispute among the lower
federal courts over just what it is that the gratuity statute makes
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an appeal by the independent counsel, Donald Smaltz,
who two years ago obtained a conviction of an agricultural
cooperative, Sun-Diamond Growers of California, for giving Espy
tennis tickets, luggage and other gifts worth $5,900. In a ruling
last March that troubled federal prosecutors, the federal appeals
court here overturned the conviction and defined the offense of
giving an illegal gratuity in a way that will make it difficult for
any prosecutor, not just an independent counsel, to win cases
against those who seek illegitimate influence over federal decision
makers.
</P>
<P>
   The law at issue, which dates to 1961, is inherently ambiguous.
It is a crime to give, offer or promise ``anything of value'' to a
public official ``because of any official act performed or to be
performed by such public official.'' Under the independent
counsel's interpretation, as reflected in the instructions to the
jury that convicted Sun-Diamond, the law's reference to an
``official act'' simply meant that the gift had to have been
motivated by the recipient's official position, without regard to
any expected or hoped-for response by the official.
</P>
<P>
   But in overturning the conviction, a three-judge panel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the
law required proof that the gift was motivated not simply by the
recipient's position, but by an official act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The giver must intend either to reward some past concrete
official act or acts, or to enhance the likelihood of some future
act or acts,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have refused to allow the official act requirement to be
satisfied by some vague hope of inducing warm feelings toward the
donor,'' the appeals court continued, adding that ``the terms of
the statute require a finding that the gifts were motivated by more
than merely the giver's desire to ingratiate himself with the
official generally, or to celebrate the latter's status.''
</P>
<P>
   The line between that definition _ which has been rejected by
most federal appeals courts but accepted by some _ and the legal
definition of bribery is a fine one. Bribery requires a quid pro
quo, an explicit agreement linking the gift to the desired action.
Federal law punishes bribery more harshly than an illegal gratuity,
with up to 15 years imprisonment compared to a maximum of two
years. Sun-Diamond received a $1.5 million fine after its
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court's treatment of the gratuity law ``may make
an unlawful gratuity virtually indistinguishable from a bribe,''
Smaltz complained in his Supreme Court appeal, United States vs.
Sun-Diamond Growers of California, No. 98-131. Asserting that
Sun-Diamond's conviction would have been upheld in many other
federal appellate circuits, he said it was unfortunate that ``the
most important circuit for the enforcement of the unlawful gratuity
prohibition has interpreted the statute differently and more
leniently than virtually every other circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy himself is on trial in U.S. District Court here, on charges
brought by the independent counsel for accepting various gifts from
companies regulated by the department he ran. His contact at
Sun-Diamond, and the donor of that company's gifts, was Richard
Douglas, Sun-Diamond's vice president for corporate affairs, who
was Espy's college classmate and longtime friend. In trying to
persuade the Supreme Court not to hear the independent counsel's
appeal, Espy's lawyer, Richard Hibey, told the court that the case
was atypical, involving ``an uncontested, legitimate friendship
that spanned more than 25 years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the other new cases the court granted Monday were these:
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination Damages:
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed to resolve another dispute among the lower
federal courts and define the circumstances under which a
successful plaintiff in an employment discrimination case can win
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Congress revised the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
which had provided only limited remedies, and made punitive damages
available for the first time. The revised law made punitive damages
of up to $300,000 available to plaintiffs who could prove that the
employer ``engaged in a discriminatory practice with malice or with
reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an
aggrieved individual.'' The question for the court in this case,
Kolstad vs. American Dental Association, No. 98-208, is essentially
how bad the defendant's conduct had to be.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-5 decision last May, overturning an earlier ruling by a
three-judge panel, the District of Columbia Circuit set a very high
threshold and ruled that punitive damages could be awarded only on
proof of ``egregious discriminatory conduct.'' Other courts have
held that plaintiffs need show only that the discrimination was
conscious, deliberate, or engaged in by management.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff in this case, Carole Kolstad, sued the American
Dental Association after a high-level position she sought in the
organization's Washington office went to a man with less seniority.
A jury agreed that the selection was the result of sex
discrimination and awarded Ms. Kolstad more than $52,000 in back
pay. After the appellate panel ruled that she was entitled to a
trial on her request for punitive damages, the full court
reconsidered the case and ruled that the defendant's behavior was
not ``egregious'' enough to merit punitive damages. The Supreme
Court's decision in this case could also determine the standard for
punitive damages under other federal civil rights laws.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Military Double Jeopardy:
</P>
<P>
   The justices agreed to hear an appeal by the Clinton
administration from a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Armed Forces, a civilian court that serves as the highest court in
the military justice system. The appeals court barred the president
from dismissing an Air Force major from the service after the
officer's conviction by a court-martial for willfully disobeying a
``safe sex'' order.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping an officer from the rolls, as such a dismissal is
known, is an action authorized by Congress following certain types
of convictions. Two years after Maj. James Goldsmith's conviction,
Congress expanded the president's authority to include cases like
his. The military appeals court, rejecting the government's view
that the action was an administrative personnel matter, found that
it amounted to extra punishment in violation of the constitutional
prohibition against double jeopardy. An additional issue in this
case, Clinton vs. Goldsmith, No. 98-347, is whether the military
court had jurisdiction to hear the case.

   But Phoenix Zoo officials said a C-section is the best chance
they have to save Ruby, the popular artistic elephant, who's
fighting for her own life after losing the calf she had nurtured in
her womb the past 22 months.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo will bring in a team of top doctors and experts late
this week to perform the operation to remove the dead, decomposing
fetus that remains inside Ruby and threatens the 25-year-old
elephant with fatal infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try our best to recover this elephant,'' said
Jeff Williamson, executive director of the Phoenix Zoo, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians, who discovered the dead calf during a surgical
procedure Saturday, could not remove the fetus via the birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   The C-section would not take place before Friday, so zoo
veterinarians can put Ruby on a fast to clear her intestines and
give her a better chance to survive. Her home, a brown brick
building near the children's zoo, also has to be cleaned and
prepped for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the doctors assembled and equipped, and get
Ruby as strong as possible,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials would not disclose Monday the doctors involved or
the possible cost and scope of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put the pieces together, but there's a lot of
pieces,'' said Bruce Bohmke, general curator, adding the zoo _ the
country's largest not supported by tax dollars _ can afford the
best care possible.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy, either. Ruby weighs 9,000 pounds. Her baby
weighed 250.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take the human condition, and exaggerate it by a
hundredfold,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy calf would have been the first born in captivity at
the Phoenix Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   In the other C-section cases involving Asian elephants,
Williamson said the animals all had to be operated on under
emergency circumstances, during the delivery, when they went into
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animals were already under severe stress,'' he said,
adding Ruby is in relatively good health. Asian elephants have a
life expectancy of up to 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby's baby apparently was not compatible with her mother,
veterinarians discovered Saturday. If she survives, Ruby will
likely never be mated again, Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby became pregnant in 1996, during a two-year loan to the
Tulsa Zoo, where she was mated with an elephant named Sneezy,
considered a good match.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were really excited when she got pregnant, and we were
looking forward to a healthy calf,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to the Phoenix Zoo in November 1997 when she was 11
months pregnant. In recent days, reaching full term, she showed
signs of going into labor, and veterinarians last week began
administering oxytocin to induce labor.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Ruby's water broke. Saturday morning, zoo
veterinarians took video of the elephant and transmitted it to
several national experts, who recommended a surgical procedure to
determine the position of the calf.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. Saturday, doctors discovered the dead calf in the
birth canal, but could not remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby, born in Thailand, arrived at the Phoenix Zoo in 1974, a
baby herself at just 7 months.
</P>
<P>
   She became famous for painting in 1987, after zoo keepers saw
doodles she left in the sand with a stick.
</P>
<P>
   The keepers then gave Ruby a brush and canvas, and she went to
work, dazzling zoo patrons with her deft strokes of pastels on
canvas. Her lithographs sold for $40 in the gift shop, and raised
about $500,000 for the zoo over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of tears today,'' said Lisa Hodak, a zoo
gift-shop employee who owns three Rubys. ``I grew up with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruby gave up the palette in 1995, as zoo keepers helped her
focus on preparing to raise a calf.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo patrons looking for Ruby on Monday said they were pulling
for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is best for the mother,'' said Tammie Anders of
Phoenix, visiting with her 4-year-old daughter, Ashley. ``I know
there's not a lot of Asian elephants in captivity. I hope she pulls
through.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Season's 2nd half is for salvaging jobs
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The middle portion of the season traditionally marks
the beginning of decision time in the league, and this year is no
different. In some precincts, coaching staffs today are debating
the short- and long-term futures of quarterbacks. In front offices
around the NFL, owners are beginning to consider coaching changes.
</P>
<P>
   One coach, Kevin Gilbride of San Diego, already has been fired,
after an Oct. 11 loss to Oakland. Look for Baltimore's Ted
Marchibroda to be the next coach let go if he loses Sunday to
Oakland. Despite the denials from owner Art Modell and personnel
director Ozzie Newsome, the fate of Marchibroda already is decided.
There is no way he'll be back in '99, and rumor is he'll be
relieved if the Ravens lose Sunday. The best bet is he would be
replaced by defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis on an interim basis
and that Modell will pursue George Seifert in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis team president John Shaw wouldn't throw himself in
front of the door if Dick Vermeil offered to resign, but the Rams
owe the coach $5.7 million in salary for three more seasons and
will have a tough time firing him. Norv Turner is as good as gone
in Washington, and Seattle's Dennis Erickson is shaky after
Sunday's night's loss.
</P>
<P>
   Some other coaches who need strong second-half finishes to save
their jobs are Vince Tobin (Arizona), Jeff Fisher (Tennessee),
Bruce Coslet (Cincinnati) and Pete Carroll (New England).
</P>
<P>
   On the quarterback front, Pittsburgh will stick with Kordell
Stewart as its starter but must re-evaluate him at the end of the
season. Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer might be close to
replacing Elvis Grbac with Rich Gannon. And there are difficult
decisions on when to bring back Rob Johnson (Buffalo), Brad Johnson
(Minnesota) and Jeff George (Oakland), because their replacements
are a combined 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' woes continue
</P>
<P>
   When Kerry Collins asked Mike Ditka if he could stay behind in
Carolina after Sunday's game there, the coach reluctantly granted
the request. Given Collins' history in Charlotte, the results were
predictable. Collins was arrested early Monday morning for alleged
drunken driving and faces a Nov. 12 hearing. Ditka and Saints
president Bill Kuharich have presented Collins the opportunity to
start over and promised he will start ahead of Billy Joe Tolliver
by Nov. 15. The four-year veteran, though, continues to exhibit a
lack of maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Rypien report
</P>
<P>
   Veteran quarterback Mark Rypien, who couldn't fulfill his
Falcons contract this year because of the death of son Andrew from
a brain tumor, hopes to get himself back into shape to resume his
NFL career. Rypien, 38, was in Pullman, Wash., over the weekend to
thank Ryan Leaf for donating a $100,000 scholarship to Washington
State in Andrew's name. Rypien's wife, Annette, will have her final
treatment for cervical cancer next Tuesday. ``We're hoping this is
over,'' Rypien said. The Dolphins, who are seeking veteran backup
help for Dan Marino, are said to be interested in Rypien for the
stretch run. But agent Ken Staninger said Tuesday he hasn't heard
from any teams recently.
</P>
<P>
   Champ chatter
</P>
<P>
   Two of five NFL scouts surveyed at the Florida-Georgia game said
Bulldogs cornerback Champ Bailey actually has a bigger long-term
upside as a wide receiver. Because Bailey is a junior, and the
scouts would be subject to a fine by the NFL for any comments about
an underclassman, their assessments were not for attribution.
</P>
<P>
   Tee time
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta chapter of the NFL Alumni will stage its annual
charity golf tournament today at the Golf Club of Georgia. Former
Falcons center Mike Ruether, the president of the group, has
focused the local chapter on a ``Caring for Kids'' initiative.
Ruether has recruited Andrew Young and Newt Gingrich, among others,
to help raise visibility. An auction will follow today's
tournament, and information on it and other chapter ventures is
available at 770-850-8881.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tops
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has had only four rushing performances in its history _
two each by Gerald Riggs and Erric Pegram _ better than Jamal
Anderson's 172-yard effort Sunday. His 203 total yards from
scrimmage were the 13th-best in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive best
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Brooks of Tampa Bay might be the best weakside
linebacker in the NFL right now, and he demonstrated his all-around
abilities in the Buccaneers' win over Minnesota. The former Florida
State star had 10 tackles, two passes defensed, an interception and
two quarterback pressures. Brooks helped to cover Vikings slot
receiver Cris Carter and his deeper-than-normal pass drops aided
young cornerbacks Ronde Barber and Brian Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Truly special
</P>
<P>
   Denver return specialist Vaughn Hebron got plenty of chances
Sunday, returning six kickoffs for 161 yards against Cincinnati.
But the six-year journeyman saved the best for last. With the
Broncos and Bengals tied 26-26, be broke two tackles on a 38-yard
return that set up Davis' 5-yard touchdown run to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing . . .
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Jay Riemersma was cut by the Bills two years ago, but
he has blossomed into a go-to guy for Buffalo, especially in the
red zone. Riemersma has just 11 catches, but four have been for
touchdowns, including two Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stat stuff
</P>
<P>
   Marchibroda thought he had discovered a tailback from heaven on
Sept. 27 when little-used Priest Holmes rushed for 173 yards on 23
carries against the Bengals. Since then, however, Holmes hasn't had
a prayer. In the four subsequent games, he has just 156 yards on 50
attempts and only once has gained more than 41 yards in a game. The
Ravens might go back to Errict Rhett or Jay Graham this week.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes isn't the only back slumping in Baltimore. The coaches
are disenchanted with fullback Roosevelt Potts, and he could be
replaced as the starter by Kenyon Cotton. . . . Buffalo wide
receiver Andre Reed had five catches in a victory over Miami, four
of them third-down conversions. . . . Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson
went for it and failed on fourth-and-1 from his own 34-yard line in
the first half. . . . The best offensive tackles on a team going
nowhere continue to be the Ravens' tandem of Jonathan Ogden and
Orlando Brown. The latter is a free agent next spring and will be
sought heavily by teams looking for a right-side power blocker. . .
. Oakland cornerbacks Eric Allen and Charles Woodson limited
Seattle wide receiver Joey Galloway to no catches of more than 8
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay defensive end Reggie White, who despite three sacks
Sunday and 11 for the season still insists he won't be back in
1999: ``This time the (retirement) is going to stick. It's fun on
game day, but getting from Monday and back to Sunday again is so
much harder than anyone can imagine.''

GORE ENDS CAMPAIGN URGING DEMOCRATS TO TURN OUT BIG VOTE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ Vice President Al Gore ended his long and
labored campaign season on Monday with a long and laboring day on
the West Coast, joining major Democratic candidates for a rally in
Sacramento, Calif., and along a four-stop, 130-mile bus tour
through western Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the final hours before the elections, Gore delivered a fiery
speech at every event, each generally focused on urging Democrats
to vote on Tuesday. To an assemblage of 800 noisy, card-waving
partisans in Sacramento to start the day, he raised his voice to
say: ``The enthusiasm level in this room is very high. You have to
translate that into a very high turnout tomorrow. I know you are
determined to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats across the country, the stakes are unusually high,
measured against predicted losses for the party in the House, the
Senate and governors' mansions, in part because of the
eleventh-hour Republican strategy to make President Clinton's
involvement in a sex scandal a major campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and the candidates who accompanied him on Monday countered
by stressing issues that Democrats have made the hallmarks of their
fall campaigning _ education, health care, economic progress and
environmental protections _ while taking steady swipes at House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and the right wing of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   After his remarks at a park in Olympia, the Washington state
capital, Gore took the additional step of calling aside Jay Inslee,
a former House Democrat who is trying to regain a seat this year,
to acknowledge his efforts as the first Democrat anywhere to air a
television commercial criticizing Republicans who made the sex
scandal a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters that Inslee was the first ``to sound the
trumpet and say, `Hey, wait a minute, this election ought to be
about the future of the American people and not about investigating
President Clinton.' He's taken that message to the people, and the
people have responded by saying, `That is right.'''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore reprised a favorite laugh-line when he told
the crowd of several thousand: ``The Republican party in 1998 is in
such disarray that the right hand doesn't know what the far right
hand is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the University of Washington-Tacoma, he seemed to
contradict his own joke by saying Republicans are ``united in their
hatred for President Clinton and their fondness for personal
attacks and negative advertisements.'' He repeated the disarray
joke, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, as well, the stakes in the elections are elevated, in
that all his recent campaign appearances _ more than 100 events in
26 states since late August _ have also been designed to help
solidify his political base for a presidential run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from a smattering of ``Gore 2000'' signs along the way
on Monday and a reference to him by Art Torres, the state party
chairman, as ``the next president of the United States,'' most
references to the future were limited to the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said that part of the political calculation for
ending the campaign with a two-day trip that began on Sunday in New
York and Wisconsin was to provide a final boost for four candidates
caught in Senate races that remained too close to call: Rep.
Charles Schumer of New York, Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin,
Sen. Barbara Boxer of California and Sen. Patty Murray of
Washington. Ms. Murray accompanied the vice president on each stop
on Monday.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Thursday, Oct. 22, about 150 top executives of
Citigroup, the financial services titan created by the recent
merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group, set out with their spouses
for what was billed as four days of golf, corporate planning and
managerial bonding at the tony Greenbriar resort in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface of this ostensibly amiable event,
serious trouble was brewing. The day before, Citigroup had posted a
huge and disappointing plunge in third-quarter profits, and those
ensconced at Greenbriar were soon complaining loudly about the
trouble the company was having knitting together disparate
businesses as lending to big companies and bond and stock
underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, said executives at the meeting, Steven Black, a
senior Citigroup executive, quarreled loudly with Deryck Maughan,
Citigroup's vice chairman, over how best to manage the company's
disparate corporate and investment banking businesses. And the man
who finally stepped between them was James Dimon, Citigroup's
president, who had been charged with smoothing out such
differences.
</P>
<P>
   But a week after the meeting, at 2 p.m. Sunday at a conference
center in Armonk, Citigroup's co-chief executives, Sanford Weill
and John Reed, responded to the turmoil in an even more direct and
surprising way: they asked for Dimon's resignation. Dimon was
widely considered to be their heir apparent and had once seemed
more like a son to Weill than an employee. But Dimon's bosses had
evidently decided that he was not succeeding in melding the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Shakespearean overtones of familial betrayal and
internecine battles lies a larger issue: a merger announced only
eight months ago and heralded as ushering in a new era in global
capitalism and supermarket-style financial services is already
showing signs of severe, potentially disastrous, strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a loss of quality management,'' said Joan
Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Jamie played
a significant role in executing the overall strategy. I think
you'll see more departures and further turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation Monday that Black and other executives
close to Dimon were considering quitting Citigroup. Black declined
to comment, and Maughan did not respond to a telephone message. On
the New York Stock Exchange, Citigroup's shares fell 87.5 cents, to
$46.125.
</P>
<P>
   Reed and Weill declined to comment Monday, though in an
interview on Sunday both spoke fondly of Dimon and optimistically
of Citigroup's prospects. Dimon was equally cheery on Sunday,
though few on Wall Street accept this friendly chatter as a true
indicator of the state of affairs at Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever regrets Reed expressed on Sunday about Dimon's
departure, Monday morning, in comments to Citigroup employees over
the internal ``squawk box,'' Reed offered a rather bloodless
account of Dimon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt that given the circumstances the best thing to do was
for him to leave,'' Reed said. ``It probably was the right business
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dimon's departure leaves a gaping hole at the top of
Citigroup, and many analysts and Citigroup employees are
questioning the wisdom of the decision to ask him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it shocking,'' one top Citigroup executive said
Monday, insisting on anonymity. ``He was basically fired, and a lot
of it had to do with corporate politics. Jamie had a lot of fans
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the 42-year-old Dimon's popularity that when he walked
onto the trading floor of the brokerage unit, Salomon Smith Barney,
Monday morning he was greeted with a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Weill and Dimon have come a long way together, becoming a
favorite double act both for Wall Street and for investors around
the world. Their presentations to the investment community
routinely impressed analysts, with Dimon the quiet and trusted
right hand and analyst for Weill, the personable Wall Street baron.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives who have been tapped to run corporate and
investment banking businesses, once considered part of Dimon's
bailiwick, are not seen as credible candidates for Citigroup's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Menezes, Citicorp's former president, is regarded as a
competent, though not stellar, manager. Michael Carpenter, former
head of the Travelers life insurance and annuities business, has a
notable blemish on his resume: He ran General Electric's Kidder
Peabody unit during a financial scandal involving the onetime bond
trading star Joseph Jett.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup declined to make Menezes and Carpenter available for
comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Dimon's popularity, he has had a rocky tenure over the
last year jointly supervising Salomon Smith Barney's investment
banking activities with Maughan. The unit incurred hundreds of
millions of dollars in trading losses in the third quarter, largely
because of errant bets on overseas markets and other risky bond
investments.
</P>
<P>
   In the executive shake-up announced on Sunday, Citigroup
stripped Maughan of any real management duties and appointed him to
a largely ceremonial role as a vice-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Weill, who recently acknowledged that he had failed to
scrutinize his firm's relationship with the risky hedge-fund giant
Long-Term Capital Management, also failed to take account of
Salomon Brothers' explosive bond positions when he acquired that
company last year.
</P>
<P>
   The recent trading losses, though, only added to what has become
an increasingly distant relationship between him and Dimon. And
people close to both men said this rift was not apparent to Reed
when the merger was engineered earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There were two main reasons for that rift, people close to both
Dimon and Weill said.
</P>
<P>
   One was Dimon's treatment of Jessica Bibliowicz, Weill's
daughter, when a mutual fund division she managed did not do as
well as expected. Although Dimon and Ms. Bibliowicz had been
friends and vacationed together as teen-agers, Ms. Bibliowicz left
Travelers last year after a series of run-ins with Dimon.
</P>
<P>
   Another divisive issue was what some Travelers executives
believed to be the 65-year-old Weill's growing resentment of
Dimon's spot in the limelight and generally stellar reputation on
Wall Street. Meanwhile, Dimon was beginning to chafe under his
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Salomon Inc. in the fall of 1997, which Weill
strongly favored, but which Dimon voiced reservations about, was
but one of the latest frictions in their increasingly troubled
working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   All these problems reached a crucial stage with the highly
ballyhooed creation of Citigroup, which aspires to combine consumer
businesses like credit cards, savings accounts and mortgages with
corporate businesses like underwriting and mergers and acquisitions
advice. Once the new machine is up and running, the thinking goes,
Citigroup will be able to sell all of these products worldwide as
Wall Street's answer to Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   While Citigroup has had a relatively easy time putting its
consumer businesses together, it has had a far rockier time
rearranging its corporate activities. And the debate about whether
to integrate Travelers' investment banking business with Citibank's
corporate banking was the final blow in the troubled relationship
between Dimon and his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon, colleagues said, expressed concern about the wisdom of
hastily combining the two businesses into one operating unit _ the
path Citigroup chose when it announced the executive shake-up on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted when the merger was announced in April that both
companies had enjoyed buoyant profits in their respective corporate
businesses and could allow them to coexist without damaging that
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Integrating the corporate businesses raises the stakes for Reed,
59, and Weill because sound management will be required to make
such a potentially unwieldy structure perform effectively. Already,
there have been hard-fought turf wars between Citicorp and
Travelers executives over how to manage the new company's bond
business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dimon, who lost a board seat when the merger occurred,
made it clear the last week that he wanted to be the person who
presided over the integrated corporate businesses. But Weill and
Reed had no intention of giving him that plum and made the decision
to ask for his resignation after consulting with Citigroup's board
last week.
</P>
<P>
   When Dimon was summoned to Armonk, he was not expecting to be
asked for his resignation, people who attended that meeting said.
Nor, as some at Citigroup believe, was he offered a ceremonial job
like that given to Maughan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a partnership with Weill that had lasted more than 15
years was over. Dimon waited in Armonk until 4 p.m. on Sunday to
briefly tell other senior executives of his resignation. Then he
left.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon's resignation, the latest in a series of high-level
departures in a commercial and investment banking business roiled
by global economic turmoil, is likely to lead to the departure of
several of his close subordinates from Salomon Smith Barney,
colleagues said Monday. Several top managers at Salomon Smith
Barney have been closely identified with Dimon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real sense of shock among the investment community.
Investors have the highest regard for him,'' said Sallie Krawcheck,
an analyst at Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``There's a little bit of a
kick in the stomach that you feel from having one of the best-known
and most visible talents leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimon is leaving Citigroup with a full wallet. He was paid $23.1
million last year and exercised stock options in 1997 worth almost
$37 million. He is also likely to garner a number of job offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is and has been one of the best executives in the financial
services industry,'' said Gerard Roche, chairman of Heidrick &AMP;
Struggles, an executive search firm. ``Any broad-gage financial
services company _ and that includes brokerage and investment and
commercial banking, and insurance, any credit card company _ should
be at least looking at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Weill and Reed still have their work cut out for them
delivering on the promises of the Citigroup merger. Shrinking
profits have caused Citigroup's shares to plunge 38 percent since
reaching a high of $72.625 on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there's a definitive amount of time for Weill and
Reed to prove themselves, but there's not an unlimited amount of
time either,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman
Brothers.

AFC EAST GOES FROM FEEBLE TO FORMIDABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
BY MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ As Doug Flutie walked off the field on
Sunday, fresh from leading the Buffalo Bills to a big victory as
quarterback for a franchise that has had a lot of big victories, he
was surrounded by a mob of people. The team's public-relations man
walked with his arm around Flutie, playing the role of a blocker
watching Flutie's backside, protecting him from the news media
throng. There were dozens of microphones jammed into Flutie's face,
cameras rolling, questions yelled at him as if he were campaigning
for governor.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those scenes that once in a while causes even the
most bitter sports fan to crack a smile. Watching a good man get
revenge on a sometimes arrogant league is a pleasant thing. Of
course, Flutie appreciates the situation. In a quiet moment away
from the attention, he was asked if it had sunk in that the man who
over a decade ago couldn't get a job in a National Football League
mail room is one of the main reasons why the American Football
Conference East has become the best conference in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie smiled that smile that graces the box of his new cereal,
Flutie Flakes. ``Yes,'' he said, ``funny how things work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, indeed. For the last few years, the AFC East has been one
of the more boring divisions in football. Now, by far, it is the
most competitive and fun division to watch, full of great coaches,
solid quarterback play and good defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, Miami, Buffalo and New England are all tied for first
place, with 5-3 records. It is the first time since 1987, in any
division, that there are four or more teams tied for first this
late in the season. ``We're stacked up like club sandwiches,'' Jets
Coach Bill Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie is the wild card. If he were still stuck playing his
football in the Canadian Football League, where his biggest
television audience in America was 10 inebriated snowboarders
watching ESPN2, the division would not be the same. He adds that
much. But there are other reasons, just as important, why the AFC
East has become the showcase division, stealing the title from the
NFC East, the last powerhouse division in football. Those reasons
include:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Great Migration. A number of coaches and players have
left the NFC East and joined their AFC counterparts. Jimmy Johnson
coached the Dallas Cowboys to three Super Bowls and is now with
Miami. Parcells paid a lot of toll money crossing the George
Washington Bridge from the Giants to the Patriots and then back to
the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins were a soft team under Don Shula in the 1990's, but
then came Johnson, who hardened Miami with his brutal
inside-rushing drills, something Cowboys players to this day insist
helped add an extra layer of toughness. Under Rich Kotite, practice
for Jets players resembled a round of golf. Now, if Parcells isn't
screaming at players to work harder during practice, he's walking
out in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells likes tough veterans _ he had a bunch of them with the
Giants _ and some of those players went with him to the Jets. They
brought that hard-hitting, nasty NFC East style of football to the
AFC East. Pepper Johnson spent much of his career with the Giants
and Keith Byars made his name mainly in Philadelphia. Offensive
lineman Jumbo Elliott played with the Giants, and is now with the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to the Super Bowl,'' Patriots quarterback Drew
Bledsoe said recently, ``Bill brought a lot of NFC East players to
the Patriots and they were key to us getting to the championship.
David Meggett was a good player for us, as he was with the Giants.
Now, you can see Bill is doing the same thing in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Quarterback's Best Friend. Remember the late 1980s when
Dan Marino and Jim Kelly would get into 42-40 shootouts? Not
anymore. The AFC East is about ball control and defense _ just like
the NFC East used to be.
</P>
<P>
   There has been great quarterback play in the division, with
Flutie and the Jets' Vinny Testaverde leading the league with 102.7
and 101.6 ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But the running backs have been the key. New England's Robert
Edwards, Miami's Karim Abdul-Jabbar and John Avery, Buffalo's
Antowain Smith and the Jets' Curtis Martin have all played well.
They are the main reason why three of the top four teams in the AFC
in time of possession are in the East _ Buffalo is second at 32
minutes 1 second, Miami third at 31:37 and the Jets fourth at
31:06. Miami is also first in the conference in red-zone offense
because Abdul-Jabbar is so good at scoring near the goal line. And
Buffalo is tied with the Denver Broncos for second because Smith is
one of the most powerful inside runners in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Parcells and his coordinator, Bill Belichick, have
slowly turned an average group of players into a top unit. In their
last three games, the Jets have given up an average of 234 total
yards a game and 3.5 yards per rushing attempt, down from 334 yards
and 4.4 yards a carry in the first five games of the season Miami
has one of the top-ranked defense in football, just like the
Cowboys had the top defense under Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   -- Attitude. Flutie embodies it. Bills players like Rob Johnson
personally, but the man Flutie replaced five weeks ago, several
players said, doesn't have the inner confidence Flutie has. The
players said that Flutie is flat-out cocky _ not in a bad way _ but
Flutie believes there is nothing he, or a team he is quarterbacking
cannot do. That confidence comes from Flutie's being told his
entire career that he couldn't do something, only to constantly
prove people wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Flutie is a great story in a division of great stories. The
Broncos, in the AFC West, are the class of the conference and the
league. If Buffalo, Miami, the Jets or New England have Super Bowl
aspirations, the road goes through Mile High Stadium. But maybe
that Flutie magic goes beyond the Bills and can elevate the AFC
East to the point where one of them could beat the Broncos in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If Flutie can sell his own cereal, anything can happen.

IRAQ YIELDS SLIGHTLY IN MONITORING DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Two days after vowing to cut off all
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, Iraq allowed a small team of
maintenance technicians to change film and make repairs on some
surveillance cameras on Monday in the company of Iraqi chaperones.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have been sending mixed signals about the scope of
their ban since it was announced on Saturday, and some diplomats
suggested Monday that Baghdad may be tempering its edict slightly
in the wake of sharp criticism from Russia and France _ the two
nations on the Security Council most willing to back Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has found no sympathizers with its latest move, which is
likely to be the subject of a Security Council resolution later
this week. The United States took over the council presidency for
November on Sunday, and is expected to push for some strong
response, although no one is expecting a call for military action.
Discussions on a resolution are to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the Iraqi National Assembly, dominated by President
Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, predictably endorsed the government's
new ban. The assembly had been used periodically over the last year
to threaten this kind of cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the U.N. Special Commission, which is charged with
ridding Iraq of biological, chemical and prohibited missile systems
and the ability to resume making them, said in New York on Saturday
that the Iraqis had left open the possibility of maintenance work.
But at the United Nations, Iraq's representative denied that any
access to sites under monitoring would be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Iraq also allowed two teams from the International
Atomic Energy Agency to conduct routine monitoring visits, under an
exemption to the ban that President Saddam Hussein made on
Saturday. The Iraqis have said they can work with the nuclear
inspectors from the energy agency but not with those of the Special
Commission, known as UNSCOM, which they want restructured.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also wants the commission's executive chairman, Richard
Butler, dismissed. On Monday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
spokesman said Annan was standing by Butler. ``The
secretary-general has full confidence in Richard Butler as the head
of UNSCOM,'' said the spokesman, Fred Eckhard. He also said the
camera maintenance ``in no way constitutes an adequate monitoring
function.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan, speaking to reporters before a meeting with Butler and
his deputy, Charles Duelfer, on Monday morning, described Iraq as
being ``in total breach of Security Council resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's hopes of having the nuclear file closed early was also
set back on Monday when the director general of the energy agency
said that new Iraqi restrictions would undermine his inspectors'
confidence that intrusive inspections could stop and long-term
monitoring begin. The nuclear file was the only program close to
closure, with the same techniques used to detect Iraq's clandestine
nuclear program in the past expected to be used to monitor its
future compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Now the effectiveness of the monitoring plan is in doubt, the
agency's head, Mohamed Elbaradei, told the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must incorporate a robust detection and deterrence
capability so as to provide substantial assurance of the absence of
prohibited activities and material in Iraq,'' said Elbaradei,
adding that a restriction on site visits introduced in August
``seriously weakens'' the agency's work and makes it harder to give
assurances that Iraq is not engaging in clandestine activities.
</P>
<P>
   The agency maintains that Iraq no longer has the ability to make
nuclear weapons, an assertion that contradicts evidence from
William Scott Ritter Jr., an American specialist in the concealment
of clandestine programs who resigned from Butler's commission in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, who has accused the Clinton administration and the
secretary-general of adopting a new policy of deliberately avoiding
confrontations with Iraq, has said Iraq has the capacity to
assemble three nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the agency told the Security Council it had no
evidence for these assertions. Independent arms experts say they
have also been unable to substantiate the charge.

MARKET PLACE: ACQUIRERS TAKE ON GREATER RISKS IN NEW-ERA UTILITIES
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa., Mont., Mich., Calif., N.C.)  (af) 
 By AGIS SALKPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of major utilities announced a number of costly
transactions Monday aimed at helping make them more competitive in
a deregulated market. But the deals also demonstrate how
shareholders in these companies are facing greater risk and may
have to wait longer for a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Money that in the past was generally paid out in dividends is
increasingly being used to help finance major deals, as those of
Monday, in an effort to get into businesses where there is more
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings have become more volatile; the dividend is no longer
sacred,'' said Robert Rubin, a utilities analyst for Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, as utility companies enter into
faster- growing businesses, there is ``greater risk but there is
also the greater potential for rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   In a move to strengthen its position to sell power in the
wholesale market in the Northwest, where many states are opening
their utilities to competition, PP&AMP;L Resources, the parent company
of a major utility that serves Pennsylvania, announced that it was
buying 13 power plants in Montana for $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In another transaction, CMS Energy Corp., the parent company of
Consumers Energy, a big Michigan utility, said it had reached an
agreement to acquire Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. and other
related assets from Duke Energy Corp. Duke, which serves the
Southeast, is based in Charlotte, N.C. Under the terms of the deal,
CMS is paying $1.9 billion in cash and assuming $300 million in
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's horse trading is a good example of how utilities, once
stable companies that rarely entered into the fray of mergers and
acquisitions, have become rife with such transactions.
</P>
<P>
   That means much more volatility and risk for stockholders, some
of whom had sought utility stocks as a safe haven after the sharp
declines in stocks and mutual funds in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities are changing rapidly. Some are selling their power
plants and shrinking to become mainly transmission companies;
others are buying and building power plants to become major sellers
of electricity and natural gas; some are seeking mergers to become
bigger so as to compete more effectively, and a few large utilities
have gone after acquisitions overseas, particularly in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, representatives of large utilities based in
Europe are prowling around the United States looking for takeovers
to allow their companies to quickly enter the market here. One
state, California, has deregulated its utilities and eight others
plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to deregulate is also risky. In California, voters
will cast ballots Tuesday on a proposition, which if approved,
could put the state deregulation efforts in limbo. It would also
increase the risk to shareholders of the stocks of the state's
three major utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls, however, show that support for the proposition has
eroded in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the uncertainty deregulation has brought, some
analysts think that utilities still provide more stable earnings
and fewer nasty surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Pierce, head of mergers and acquisitions for the law firm
Dewey Ballantine, said that even after deregulation utilities are
still under the watchful eye of state commissions and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very surprised if you found one investing in hedge
funds and buying a casino,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements Monday were an example of how utilities are
pursuing transactions where the payoff may be years away.
</P>
<P>
   PP&AMP;L Resources, which delivers electricity to 1.2 million
customers in Pennsylvania, cut its yearly dividend in August to $1
a share from $1.67. While this was a blow to stockholders, Rubin
said it freed more cash for the company to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to buy power plants in Montana is aimed at getting
a source of low-cost power _ about 2,600 megawatts of generating
capacity _ to sell wholesale in a region where deregulation is
advancing more quickly than in some other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   William Hecht, chairman and chief executive of PP&AMP;L Resources,
said in an interview that the dividend reduction freed about $100
million in cash for the utility but that it was not directly linked
to help finance its power-plant purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of PP&AMP;L gained 6.25 cents Monday, to $27.1875. Montana
Power rose $1.6875, to $45.
</P>
<P>
   The move by CMS Energy is one of a series to strengthen its
position in the Midwest as a supplier of natural gas. Last summer
the region suffered power shortages, and the expectation is that
many new gas-fired plants will be built.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Scotto, the utility analyst for Carnegie, Childs &AMP; Co., said
that CMS is an example of a utility that is a growth company that
generally does not increase the dividend. Instead, he said, it uses
its cash to reinvest in its business.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of CMS rose $2.125, to $46.1875, while shares of Duke
Energy gained 18.75 cents, closing at $64.875.
</P>
<P>
   William McCormick Jr., chairman and chief executive of CMS, said
that the utility wanted to become a major supplier for the new
plants and that the acquisition helped to tie together its own
natural gas business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It links together our whole system,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is not on the ballot Tuesday and
Speaker Newt Gingrich faces only token opposition for re-election
to the House. But both used the final hours to stir turnout by
party loyalists and to draw contrasts between their visions of the
nation's future.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conducted radio interviews on Monday with
African-American and Latino journalists in an effort to bring
minority voters to the polls, where they are expected to heavily
favor Democratic candidates. Gingrich held an election-eve rally in
his district in Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich scaled back his earlier predictions about how well
Republicans will do, saying he expected the party to win a net gain
of six to 30 House seats. Earlier, he had predicted a net gain of
10 to 40 seats.
</P>
<P>
   White House strategists still expect the Democrats to lose three
to five Senate seats and as many as 16 House seats _ a blow, said
one senior White House official, but not as bad as it could be.
</P>
<P>
   This official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
maintained that if those projections hold, the result would be
worse for Gingrich than for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the history of midterm elections and what's gone on this
year, old Newtie is going to have some explaining to do to his
caucus,'' the White House official said. ``He's going to have to
come up with some reason why he hasn't done better.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in his interviews on Monday that electing Democrats
to Congress and to governors' offices is particularly important to
minorities because new congressional districts will be drawn after
the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   More Democrats means more money for education, for job training,
for health care and for other programs that benefit middle- and
low-income Americans, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal was unvarnished: Elect Democrats to Congress to
temper the selfish and reactionary impulses of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Clinton said in an interview with Tom Joyner, an
ABC radio personality with a largely African-American audience,
``the real problem now is that the Congress is basically dominated
by not only the Republicans, but the right wing of the party is in
the driver's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with four Latino journalists, Clinton said that
Democrats favored a more generous immigration policy and would
fight for a fairer count of minority communities in the 2000
census.
</P>
<P>
   In both interviews, he invoked the specter of the Democrats'
favorite bogyman, Gingrich, as an incentive to get out and vote,
telling each of his listeners that their vote counts as much as
that of the speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has been barnstorming the country, campaigning in 48
states this year, 15 in the last week, for Republicans. Although he
signed off on $10 million worth of television commercials reminding
voters of Clinton's scandal with Monica Lewinsky, Gingrich does not
refer to it on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gingrich tells his audiences that without a Republican
Congress, there would have been no tax cuts, no balanced budget and
no welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at a rally in Georgia, Gingrich said that Clinton
was using scare tactics to motivate voters to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tremendous efforts underway to turn out the
Democratic base,'' Gingrich said. ``Many of you have seen the
president and Mrs. Clinton going all over the place trying to make
sure that they scare enough people to win. We really do have a
choice here between the politics of hope and the politics of
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If you listen to their rhetoric, it is again and
again and again the rhetoric of fear _ divide Americans, frighten
Americans, scare Americans. Frankly, it's a little shameful for the
president of the United States trying to divide his own country and
trying to frighten people with false images of America.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``we all want every American to participate in
prosperity,'' and for Clinton to suggest otherwise ``is to do a
disservice to the country he is supposed to be leading.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have been delighted in recent days by news
reports linking Gingrich to the new Republican commercials
attacking Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's three things that every decent American can't
stand,'' said Paul Begala, a senior adviser to the president,
``it's negative ads, partisan investigations and Newt Gingrich. And
in the closing days of the campaign the Republicans gave us all
three wrapped together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton, in the interview with Latino journalists, said that the
Republican advertisements argue that voters should turn away from
Democrats because of Clinton's affair with Lewinsky and his lies
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words,'' the president said, ``they're saying `Punish
someone else for this.' And ultimately the argument is, they are
telling the voters they should punish themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration aides acknowledged that, from the president on
down, White House officials have tried in recent days to focus
attention on Gingrich. They argued that that was a legitimate
strategy since the first vote new House members will cast will be
for the next speaker.

GOVERNMENT SHOWS VIDEOTAPED TESTIMONY BY GATES IN MICROSOFT TRIAL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bill Gates on the courtroom screen was evasive
and uninformed, pedantic and taciturn _ a world apart from his
reputation as a brilliant business strategist, guiding every step
in Microsoft Corp.'s rise to dominance in computing.
</P>
<P>
   In two hours of videotaped questioning shown at the Microsoft
antitrust trial here Monday, a small part of the three-day
deposition he gave last summer, Gates professed ignorance of
several key charges in the government's case including allegations
that he was involved in plans to bully competitors like Apple
Computer Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp. to step back from
Internet software markets that Microsoft sought to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   When presented with e-mail messages he had written, he often
said he did not recognize the messages or recall the discussions
surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   To question after question he answered, ``I don't remember using
those words,'' or ``I'm not sure what you're trying to say.''.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases Gates' answers were so banal that even Thomas
Penfield Jackson, the U.S. District Court judge who is hearing the
the case, chuckled and shook his head. Asked once, ``who was at the
executive staff meeting'' where a key discussion took place, Gates
said simply: ``Probably members of the executive staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that the few hours of taped excerpts, drawn
from 20 hours of questioning by government lawyers, were often
taken out of context, selected merely to embarrass Gates and
Microsoft with little direct bearing on the case. Gates, Microsoft
says, was obviously not going to cooperate with prosecutors trying
to put words in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, both Gates, the nation's wealthiest man, and
his questioner, David Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer,
remained civil and polite. Boies, however, did show a flash or two
of irritation at Gates' plodding evasions _ so at odds with his
public image as a quick-witted tactician, immersed in every
significant detail of Microsoft's business. At times, Boies
pointedly reminded Gates that he was under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The pile of e-mail offered as evidence Monday vividly showed the
round-the-clock pace at Microsoft, a pace set by Gates. E-mail
messages sent to him at 4 a.m. were answered a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, through two hours of verbal thrusts and parries, Boies
never quite succeeded in trapping Gates, and Gates was generally
unable to discredit Boies' assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, dressed in a hunter green suit with a brown striped tie,
sitting at a plain conference table at Microsoft's headquarters
next to his attorney, seldom smiled but never raised his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Long pauses _ some more than 20 second long _ hung between many
of Boies' questions and Gates' answers. Microsoft's chairman seldom
looked his questioner in the eye, gazing down at the table instead.
As he read documents that were handed to him, sometimes, he rocked
back and forth in his chair.
</P>
<P>
   For the last week, the government has been trying to play the
Gates deposition in court, but Microsoft's drawn-out cross
examination of government witnesses by Microsoft's trial lawyer,
Jack Warden, had left no time. The announcement that it would be
played Monday came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   During the deposition, taped over three days in August, Gates
was confronted again and again by e-mail _ his own, and messages
sent to him by other Microsoft executives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The government's case, in its broadest terms, is that Microsoft
has used its market muscle to fashion a network of relationships
that would insure that the rise of the Internet did not weaken its
dominance. It began with trying, in a meeting that took place on
June 21, 1995, to divide up with its main rival, Netscape
Communications Corp., the market for software used to browse the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Gates said that during the period around June
1995 he had ``no sense of what Netscape was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft documents often seem to contradict Gates' profession
of ignorance. In an internal document titled ``The Internet Tidal
Wave,'' written on May 26, 1995, by Gates himself, he gives an
authoritative analysis of Netscape's strategy. He called Netscape a
``new competitor `born' on the Internet,'' whose goal was to
``commoditize'' the value of the personal computer operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The government asserts that Microsoft unfairly used its market
muscle to force Apple to choose its Internet Explorer instead of
Netscape's Navigator as the main browser on Apple Macintosh
computers. A key weapon in that campaign, the government says, was
to threaten to cancel developing the Macintosh version of its
industry-standard Microsoft Office software. This threat, Gates was
informed in an e-mail from a subordinate ``is certainly the
strongest bargaining point we have, as doing so will do a great
deal of harm to Apple immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, 1996, Gates sent an e-mail to two of his senior
aides, Paul Maritz and Brad Silverberg, that said one of his ``two
key goals'' in Microsoft's relationship with Apple was to ``get
them to embrace Internet Explorer in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Microsoft and Apple did announce a deal in which
Apple agreed to make Internet Explorer the default browser on its
Macintosh machines. But Microsoft says that the government is
presenting a skewed portrait of the deal, which included a $150
million investment in Apple and a separate payment estimated at
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The main element in the deal, Microsoft says, was settling a
long-running patent dispute in which Apple had demanded first $1.2
billion and then ``several hundred million dollars'' at two points
in 1997, accusing Microsoft of stealing its intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   At another point in the testimony, Boies, the Justice
Department's trial lawyer, brought up Sun Microsystems. He asked
Gates if he had tried to ``get Apple to agree to help you to
undermine Sun?'' He showed Gates an e-mail written on Aug. 8, 1997,
sent to Maritz and others. In dealing with Apple, Gates wants to
get ``as much mileage as possible'' in competing against other
Internet software companies. ``In other words,'' he writes, ``a
real advantage against Sun and Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes the e-mail by asking his aides, ``Do we have a
clear plan on what we want Apple to do to undermine Sun?''
</P>
<P>
   Boies then asked Gates what he meant when he asked that
question. Pausing and staring down at his own brief message, Gates
eventually replied, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is alleging that Microsoft has repeatedly used
its market power for anticompetitive ends, prodding partners and
competitors to divide, or stay out of, markets that Microsoft wants
to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about these allegations in general, Gates gave his
most unequivocal reply. ``Are you aware,'' Boies asked, ``of any
instances in which representatives of Microsoft have met with
competitors in an attempt to allocate markets?''
</P>
<P>
   Gates replied, ``I'm not aware of any such thing. And I know
it's very much against the way we operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies probed further to ask, ``It would be against company
policy to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gates answered, ``That's right.''

FRENCH BOTTLER OF WATER BUYING A U.S. RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Widening its reach in the bottled-water business, Groupe Danone
announced on Monday that it was buying the Aqua Penn Spring Water
Co. for $112 million, or $13 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The move gives Groupe Danone, of Paris, access to three
spring-water sources in Florida, California and Pennsylvania in
addition to the Utah and Quebec springs it now uses for its Dannon
brand of bottled water, which is distributed nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   It also links Danone for the first time to big customers like
McDonald's, where Aqua Penn sells bottled water in some areas, and
doubles the company's production capacity in the United States, a
spokesman, Michael Neuwirth, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will remain focused on the fastest-growing and most
profitable segment, natural spring water in packages of 1.5 liters
or smaller,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aqua Penn water will now be packaged under the Dannon label,
which Danone introduced as a cheaper alternative to Evian, its
imported brand. Groupe Danone's American depository receipts rose
37.5 cents Monday, to $53; shares of Aqua Penn were up sharply,
gaining $2.9375, to $12.625.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, which Aqua Penn's founder and chairman, Edward
J. Lauth III, described in a statement as ``a tremendous
opportunity for our shareholders, employees and customers,'' is the
latest example of the surging demand for bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   The noncarbonated water business grew by 13 percent last year,
said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, while sales of
single-serving packages jumped 25 percent. Pepsico began national
distribution of its own brand, a filtered water called Aquafina,
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Aquafina, which is made by running tap water through filtration
systems in bottling plants, has become the sixth-biggest brand in
grocery stores, a company spokesman, Larry Jabbonsky, said, citing
data compiled by Information Resources Inc. through early October.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the beverage industry expect Coca-Cola to introduce a
competing product before long. ``It would make a great deal of
sense,'' Sicher said. ``I think they're going to do it in the first
quarter of 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coke refused to confirm the speculation. ``At
any given time, we're looking at a whole host of opportunities and
we don't comment on anything,'' the spokesman, Polly Howes, said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola already packages and sells a bottled water called
Bonaqua in 35 countries. Analysts and others said getting into the
water business in the United States had been deliberately slow
because Coke executives wanted to be sure the economic model would
work.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pecoriello of Sanford C. Bernstein said bottled water would
be a good strategic move for Coke. ``You can't ignore water right
now,'' he said. ``You can put the brand marketing of Coke to work,
with Coke owning the brand and using their skill on the marketing
side, and give the bottlers a water that works with their economics
and their operations.''

FDA APPROVES IMMUNEX ARTHRITIS DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enbrel, a genetically engineered rheumatoid arthritis drug from
Immunex Corp., was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle biotechnology company's stock jumped 1 9/17 to close
at 70 5/8. The approval ended six months of nail-biting at
Seattle-based Immunex Corp., which submitted its data for
fast-track approval last May. It could also give Seattle's largest
biotechnology company its first blockbuster drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major event for Immunex. This product is likely to
transform them,'' analyst Carol Werther, of Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill,
told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have estimated the market for Enbrel could be worth
between $500 million and $1 billion in sales per year. Immunex has
spent about $150 million developing the drug.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 2.5 million people with rheumatoid arthritis in
the United States, of which about 500,000 have advanced disease
that no longer responds to drugs. There is no known cure for the
disease, which causes painful inflammation and destruction of
joints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most important advance since methotrexate was
introduced into our practice in about 1980,'' said Dr. Philip
Mease, director of the division of rheumatology at the Minor &AMP;
James Clinic in Seattle and an associate professor of medicine at
the University of Washington School of Medicine. ``This is the most
important new treatment since that time.'' Methotrexate, a
chemotherapeutic agent, is widely used to treat severe cases of
rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Enbel is the first of a new class of drugs called biological
response modifiers for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Based on a
molecule that occurs naturally in the body, it reduces symptoms by
interrupting the body's inflammatory response.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical studies, the drug reduced pain and the duration of
morning stiffness for patients with moderate to severe disease. It
also improved the number of swollen and tender joints, allowing
patients to resume or more fully participate in daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   For Laura Sagen-Hughes, 49, the drug let her resume her normal
life pain-free for the first time since she began suffering
symptoms of arthritis 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' said Sagen-Hughes, who was part of the
last stage of clinical testing for the drug in Seattle. ``Within
two days of my first injection, all my pain, swelling and
discomfort disappeared. I thought, `Whoa, whose body am I in?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The drug is given by injection using a needle similar to the one
diabetic patients use, she said. The twice-a-week shots are
painless, and the only side effects she experienced were
occasional, mild redness around the injection site.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies said they would examine the clinical data
before making decisions about coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Enbrel, which is expected to cost between $10,000 and $12,000 a
year, is more expensive than methotrexate, which costs about $2,500
a year, said Mease. But that comparison doesn't take into account
the costs of hospitalizing patients for side-effects and
complications of taking methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you simply compare the two, it's an unfair comparison,'' he
said. The costs of the two drugs are actually ``a lot closer than
you might anticipate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance companies have already indicated to Mease that
they will cover it, he said. ``Coverage is likely to depend upon a
rheumatologist's opinion on whether (the patient) is deemed an
Enbrel candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The most likely candidates are those who have moderate to severe
disease and who have tried but not been helped by at least one
other drug, such as methotrexate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sagen-Hughes, for example, had tried methotrexate but couldn't
take the side effects, which can include nausea, mouth sores and
other complications.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex and its partner Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories will market
Enbrel in North America. The drug is only available by
prescription.

ADVERTISING: GAME MANUFACTURERS LOOKING AT LONG-FORGOTTEN MARKET:
YOUNGER CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (af) 
 By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity poor Pac-Man.
</P>
<P>
   Once loved by young children, the yellow blob is now little more
than a campy joke as game companies chase aging customers with
commercials for bloody gun battles and vivid hard tackles.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pac-Man himself is not on the rebound, he may at least
have some younger siblings on the way as game makers look to a
long-forgotten market: young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to go after the younger market,'' said Andrew
House, vice president for marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Just how young children came to be viewed as a new audience at
Sony explains much of the cyclical nature, not to mention
forgetfulness, of the industry's marketers.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the industry is concerned, home video game players
grew up on Sept. 9, 1995, the day Sony released the Playstation.
The system was the first marketed directly at 18- to 35-year-olds
with advertisements on programs like ``Saturday Night Live'' and
``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years to the day had passed when House stood before his
board with a presentation acknowledging the need for an ad shift.
To capture new audiences, House proposed advertising during holiday
specials like ``Frosty the Snowman'' and the Thanksgiving Day
parade as well as on Nickelodeon and the Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   The new wave of games vying for the Saturday morning cartoon set
includes Tomba, a simple, colorful adventure game that appeals to
younger customers much the way Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers once
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the kind of game you would have seen two years
ago,'' said Sean McGowan, an analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison
Inc., a New York investment firm. ``It was Japanese animation,
sexy-looking women and lots of shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   The early Atari games bought by adults as a fad and taken up in
earnest by their children touched off a stampede. In 1991, Sega of
America and Nintendo of America released the first 16-bit machines,
offering children's games like Super Mario Brothers and sports
games with ever-better graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Playstation. While Sega swaggered across late-night
television with pitches for bone-crunching hits in its football
games and all manner of savagery in its fighting games, Sony
pinpointed technology aficionados with a campaign one former
executive described as ``viral marketing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wimms, former vice president for marketing at Sony Computer
Entertainment, said the company used radio and print ads only
serious game players would understand, counting on word of mouth to
spread the system's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Sony avoided the traditional children's market,
fearing that games that appeal to a young audience would be
anathema to technology enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to be all things to all people,'' Wimms said,
``you end up being absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The system has by no means been a flop. Home video game systems
and their hand-held spinoffs generated around $5.1 billion in
domestic sales for 1997, and sales are expected to reach $6.3
billion for 1998, according to NPD Research, a market tracking firm
in New York City. Playstation alone accounts for 60 percent to 70
percent of the market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But to build that following, Sony pursued a strategy that
depended on ``aspirational gamers'' _ little brothers and sisters _
while not marketing directly to them.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is walking on gilded splinters as it tries to expand its
market to include younger game players while retaining credibility
among technology enthusiasts and other older players.
</P>
<P>
   Because technology reinvents the market every few years, the
little brothers and sisters do not have time to fall in love with
their siblings' systems, said Chris Charla, editor in chief of Next
Generation, a trade magazine based in Brisbane, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stay cool for that many years,'' Charla said, adding
that younger customers are the only place to go for Sony's
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not be where they will go.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo, historically the system of choice with younger players
because of games like Super Mario Brothers, is fighting for a
larger share of the 18 and older market. George Harrison, vice
president for marketing, said Nintendo was putting half its ads in
magazines like Vibe and Rolling Stone and on ESPN and other sports
programs. In 1991, 90 percent of its ad budget was aimed at
children 14 and under.
</P>
<P>
   The company spends around $200 million annually on marketing,
including $70 to $75 million on television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   As those two companies' marketing strategists debate how to
attract older casual players to Nintendo and young children as well
as casual adult players to Sony, the elephant in the room is Sega's
release of a new system called Dreamcast, planned for the fall of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, it could start the industry cycle over again,
forcing Sony to drop Playstation's price and head back to the
drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone purposefully sets out to say, `I want
this one group,''' said Dan Stevens, director of public relations
for Sega. ``People are not viewing games as kids' toys anymore.
They're viewing them as a substantial form of entertainment that
anybody can enjoy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age groups aside, all three companies are making concerted
efforts to expand the popularity of home video games among casual
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the guys who wait until it costs $99 or $129 and
only buy four or five games and maybe rent some from Blockbuster,''
Charla said.
</P>
<P>
   Sports fans make up a sizable easy target in that market because
they can be cornered during immensely popular live-broadcast games
as well as on cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   For the industry as a whole, marketing revolves around the fact
that each new system must first appeal to a niche market, then
quickly seep in as a mainstream industry leader. The console
companies and their outside software contractors all depend on
mainstream credibility to market products to customers of different
ages and levels of enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the history of the video game business tells you is that
the most important factor in the system's popularity is the
software available for that system,'' said Doug Lowenstein,
president of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade
group in Washington. ``It's become much more of a science now to
market these products.''

PAID NEWSPAPER CIRCULATION IN U.S. CONTINUES TO DECLINE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a small hiccup upward last spring, daily and Sunday
newspaper circulation continued to decline, according to figures
released Monday, but the group that has kept these unflattering
industry measurements is on the verge of giving publishers a chance
to supplement the old numbers with new data about their sales and
readership.
</P>
<P>
   Paid circulation is now down almost 11 percent from its 1984
peak of 63.3 million readers, according to a report from the Audit
Bureau of Circulations. For the six months ended Sept. 30, total
paid circulation was down three-tenths of a percent compared with
figures from the period a year earlier. Sunday circulation slipped
more than twice as fast, down eight-tenths of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting later this week, the governing board of the audit
bureau is expected to give preliminary approval to the first new
reporting format in years, enabling publishers to supplement their
standard reports with an additional set of ``total distribution''
figures, which would include heavily discounted and complimentary
copies not counted in the current paid circulation figures.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, The Wall Street Journal, published by Dow Jones,
has prepared a ``statement of total circulation'' for the six-month
period ended in March. The total circulation listed was more than
75,000 more than the newspaper's official paid circulation.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, some publishers have been seeking to
expand the formal reporting options offered by the audit bureau,
whose 34-member governing board includes advertisers and newspaper
and magazine publishers. A second vote expected this week is likely
to approve standardized readership surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that many in the industry have been
frustrated and searching for new and better ways to grow
circulation,'' said Jeremy L. Halbreich, the former president and
general manager of The Dallas Morning News, who is moderating a
debate on the question at the audit bureau's annual meeting later
this week. The Dallas paper is owned by the A.H. Belo  &UR;  &LR;  Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a palliative for that,'' he added. ``It's a
recognition that in today's media market place, the competition is
stiffer than ever before. For certain segments of the potential
audience, newspapers need some additional marketing flexibility.''

   After years of decline in paid circulation _ which audit bureau
regulations define as copies sold at a discount of 50 percent or
less off the newsstand price _ industry executives had taken some
comfort from the figures released in March, which showed the first
overall gain in paid circulation in years. Monday's circulation
report, however, was a sobering reminder of the difficulty the
business has competing for attention with television, radio, the
Internet, magazines and other distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five largest newspapers in the country saw
circulation declines, including a steep drop of 25,000 copies at
The Wall Street Journal, the nation's best-selling newspaper. The
Journal's average daily circulation dropped almost 2 percent, to
1,740,450 from 1,774,880 in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times and The Washington Post also registered
declines. The Times dropped to 1,066,658, down more than 0.7
percent from 1,074,741 in the period a year earlier. The drop put
it behind The Los Angeles Times, which is owned by the Times Mirror
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times saw its average circulation gain 1.7
percent, to 1,067,540.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported a circulation of 759,122, down 1.8
percent from its September 1997 total of 772,937.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday circulation at The New York Times and The Washington Post
also decreased. Sunday circulation at The Times sank to 1,627,099,
down almost 2 percent, from 1,658,718 in the period a year earlier.
The Post's Sunday circulation dropped to 1,090,082, down about 1.7
percent from its 1997 total of 1,099,174.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the top five newspapers, Gannett's USA Today continued its
long upward trend, with circulation rising to 1,653,428, up 1.5
percent from 1,629,665 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The report, said John Morton, an industry analyst who runs his
own firm, Morton Research, in Maryland, ``shows the continued
weakness in newspaper circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the sluggishness in circulation continues unabated,''
he added. ``These figures are a hangover of the time when everybody
was raising their rates so rapidly. In the good old days, it used
to take six or eight months to recover form a price increase. Now
it takes anywhere from two to three years.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Sturm, the executive director of the Newspaper
Association of America, said that over all the September losses
were more than offset by the March gains, making the year's results
``basically flat.'' He acknowledged, however, that he had thought
the September figures would show ``more positive territory.''

AFTER NEGOTIATIONS, UNION OFFICIAL SAYS HE EXPECTS NO GAMES BEFORE
JANUARY
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the day before the season was supposed to start,
Billy Hunter, the executive director of the National Basketball
Players Association, said Monday that no agreement was imminent in
the labor impasse and that he thought the season would not begin
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's remarks dispelled any notion that the team owners and
the players were headed toward a settlement any time soon, despite
long, intensive bargaining sessions last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut tells me that in January we could be playing,'' he said
in a conference call with reporters. ``I would anticipate the
season would start around the first part of January.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, deputy commissioner of the National Basketball
Association, said he agreed with Hunter that an agreement was not
close.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's declaration came after representatives of the owners
and players met for about two and a half hours at a New York law
firm. Union officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
the divide was over the mechanics of an escrow system proposed by
the owners.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would have been put into effect after two or three
years of employing a luxury-tax system to curb salaries. In those
escrow plan years, the sides would determine at the end of each
season how much revenue was devoted to player salaries. If a target
number was exceeded, part of the escrow money would be returned and
distributed to all 29 teams. It was unclear how far apart the sides
were.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said that he was trying to stop recent news media
speculation that an agreement would be reached as early as this
week. ``I don't know where that information came from, but I can
indicate that I don't see any possibility at all of reaching an
agreement this week, and I can't say how soon it will be,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the disagreement on how the escrow system should be put
in place, the biggest stumbling block was what revenue percentages
should be after the system had been in place for a few years. The
players are asking for 60 percent; the owners are offering 50.
</P>
<P>
   No talks are scheduled until Tuesday, when NBA Commissioner
David Stern, Granik and the league lawyers will meet with Hunter,
union president Patrick Ewing and their legal team. Hunter said an
earlier plan to have full negotiating teams present was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said that Monday was used to iron out some of the
mechanics for calculating salary caps and other issues. ``There was
little or no progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a normal schedule, players would have gone through their
last practices Monday before openers around the country tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fans of professional basketball are split over who is
more justified in the labor dispute, according to the latest
nationwide New York Times/CBS News Poll. The players are supported
by 36 percent of fans, while 29 percent side with the owners,
according to the poll. Nine percent said neither side was more in
the right, and 25 percent didn't have an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Male fans are evenly divided: 32 percent support the players and
34 percent endorse the owners' position. Female fans' sentiment was
more inclined to be with the players: among the women interested in
professional basketball, 41 percent sided with the players and 24
with support the owners.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll was conducted Oct. 21-25 with 1,118 adults,
39 percent of whom said they were very or somewhat interested in
professional basketball. The margin of sampling error for
basketball fans in the poll is plus or minus 5 percentage points.

WILLIAMS WOULD FIT THE BILL AS VAUGHN REPLACEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ How to replace Mo Vaughn if he leaves?
</P>
<P>
   Well, while playing for the New York Yankees the last four
years, Bernie Williams has averaged .319, 24 home runs, and 95
RBIs, numbers that would have been even better if he hadn't missed
31 games with a leg injury this past season.
</P>
<P>
   He is a two-time All-Star, an American League batting champion,
and a Gold Glove center fielder, he passes with flying colors the
Friendly Fenway Family Values test, and he is an accomplished jazz
guitarist on the side, for those off-nights in which he might want
to do a gig in Harvard Square.
</P>
<P>
   At 30, he's also nine months younger than Vaughn (who turns 31
Dec. 15), he hits in Vaughn's No. 3 slot in the order, and he bats
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   He does not have Vaughn's commanding presence in the clubhouse,
but he has always been liked and respected by his teammates, and,
like Vaughn, is noted for his candor, even if he delivers his
message in a much quieter fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't throw the same fear into pitchers that a Vaughn does,
but his ability to deliver in the clutch is not to be dismissed: He
hit .335 with runners in scoring position last season, a number
better than any Red Sox regular, including Nomar Garciaparra (.329)
or Vaughn (.318).
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Scott Boras, offers another argument why Red Sox fans
should find Williams appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a double reason for signing a guy like Bernie,'' said
Boras. Monday ``You create a grand problem for your archenemy (the
Yankees) while improving yourself substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   So, where's the rub?
</P>
<P>
   Glad you asked. According to Boras, at least 10 teams so far
have expressed interest in Williams. Are the Red Sox on that list?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked not to say anything,'' said Boras.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is seeking a deal for a ``minimum'' of seven years,
according to Boras, and doesn't expect to be signing for an average
annual value south of Mike Piazza's number ($13 million a year).
</P>
<P>
   What this all means, of course, is that the Red Sox in all
likelihood would have to pay Williams more than it would take to
re-sign Vaughn. That's a pattern with which they're not unfamiliar.
This is the team, remember, that could not sign Roger Clemens
because the bidding became too rich for their tastes, then turned
around and signed Pedro Martinez a year later to the fattest
contract ever for a player until the (itals)piece de
Piazza.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo Vaughn will get a good contract,'' Boras said, ``but I
don't think anyone will give him seven years because of his body
type. Maybe he'll get five from somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   From Boras's perspective, what separates Williams from Vaughn is
that, outside of Ken Griffey and perhaps Andruw Jones, it's rare to
find a center fielder who is a run producer in Williams's class.
Put Vaughn among the slugger types who play first base, left field,
or DH, Boras said, and there are a number of players who can point
to similar production.
</P>
<P>
   Agent talk? Sure, to a degree. But the man makes a point, too,
which is why Williams may be in a position to name his price. Maybe
the only player better positioned in this free agent class is
pitcher Kevin Brown, who happens to be another Boras client. He's
looking for a six-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Boras expects that the Yankees will not give up Williams without
a fight, though published reports in New York say otherwise. Boras
expects the Orioles to be in the bidding, too. The Colorado Rockies
are said to be making a big push for both Williams and Brown, while
the Dodgers, who have targeted Vaughn as their top priority, could
be in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Boras does not expect Williams to make any snap decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got a lot of work to do,'' said the agent.
</P>
<P>
   Boras said the Red Sox also have interest in another of his
clients, pitcher Tim Belcher.

DEAL CLOSE TO MOVE NASDAQ AND AMEX TO TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City and state officials are close to a deal
to provide Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange with a $200
million subsidy package to build a new joint headquarters, probably
in a skyscraper a block from Times Square, people involved with the
talks said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of an agreement that was still being completed
on Monday night, the American Stock Exchange, which is based in
lower Manhattan, and Nasdaq, which is based in Washington, would
build a new trading floor and a combined headquarters in New York.
In turn, city and state officials would provide about $180 million
in tax breaks and investment tax credits and $20 million to $25
million in cash for the project.
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials and real estate executives say the
markets will probably move to a 40-story skyscraper that a
developer, Douglas Durst, plans to build on land between 42d and
43d Streets, from the middle of the block east to the Avenue of the
Americas. Next door, Nasdaq is already erecting the largest sign in
Times Square, a $15 million multi-media kaleidoscope, on the side
of Durst's 48-story Conde Nast building, which is on Broadway
between 42d and 43d Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate and financial executives say the midtown location
would be in keeping with efforts by Frank Zarb, chairman of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which owns Nasdaq and
the American Stock Exchange, to build a world financial market that
would rival the New York Stock Exchange. He acquired the American
Stock Exchange last week and has made a bid to acquire the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which would presumably also move to
New York should the bid be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   If the markets cannot strike a deal with Durst, Nasdaq and the
American Stock Exchange could transfer the $200 million benefit
package to a second site at Battery Park City in lower Manhattan,
people involved in the talks said. Another developer, World
Financial Properties, has offered to build a tower for the markets
there. Their first choice, though, is the Durst site in Times
Square, city and state officials and real estate executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking to the city about an offer,'' Michael Jones,
chief administrative officer of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, said on Monday night. ``We have also received
an offer from New Jersey. We are reviewing both.''
</P>
<P>
   Two people involved with the negotiations said a deal ``was very
close.'' A City Hall official said on Monday night, ``We expect to
have a deal within a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange might
seem to be alien to Times Square. But in recent years, corporate
law firms, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the investment firm, and
Reuters, the giant British financial information services company,
have found their way to the district.

EXCERPTS FROM VIDEOTAPED GATES TESTIMONY

   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from two hours of videotaped
testimony shown Monday in U.S. District Court during antitrust
proceedings against Microsoft Corp. David Boies, a trial lawyer for
the Justice Department, questioned the chairman and chief executive
of the company, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   DAVID BOIES: Have you ever had discussions within Microsoft
about the desirability of trying to undermine Sun because of what
Sun was doing in Java? BILL GATES: I said to you part of our
activity is to go out and work with customers to see what it takes
to have them choose to license our products. And that's in
competition with many other companies, including Sun. Q. I'm not
now talking about what you do in competition with other products or
other companies. What I'm talking about is whether or not you've
had discussions with people within Microsoft in which you talked
about the need to undermine Sun, using those words, if that will
help you, within Microsoft? A. I don't remember using those words.
Q. You don't? A. No. Q. Do you think you did use those words or you
just don't know one way or the other? A. I don't know. Q. Would it
be consistent with the way you felt about Java for you to have told
people that you wanted to undermine Sun? A. As I've said, anything
about Java you've got to show me a context before I can answer
because just the term Java itself can mean different things. Q. Did
you have discussions with Apple in which you were trying to get
Apple to agree to help you undermine Sun? A. There was some
discussion about what run-time A.P.I.'s [application program
interfaces) Apple would support, whether they would support some of
ours or some of Sun's. I don't think I was involved in any
discussions myself with Apple about that. Q. Well, let me show you
a document and try to probe what you mean by being involved. Let me
give you a copy of a document that has been previously marked as
Government Exhibit 265.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of this document is an e-mail message from you to Paul
Maritz and others and the portion I'm particularly interested in,
and you can read as much of the three-line e-mail as you wish, is
the last sentence, which reads, ``Do we have a clear plan on what
we want Apple to do to undermine Sun?''
</P>
<P>
   Did you send this e-mail, Mr. Gates, on or about Aug. 8, 1997?
A. I don't remember sending it. Q. Do you have any doubt that you
sent it? A. No. It appears to be an e-mail I sent. Q. You recognize
that this is a document produced from Microsoft's files do you not,
sir? A. No. Q. You don't? A. Well, how would I know that? Q. Do you
see the document production numbers down at the bottom? A. I have
no idea what those numbers are. Q. Let me go back to the e-mail,
Mr. Gates. What did you mean when you asked Mr. Maritz whether or
not, ``We have a clear plan on what we want Apple to do to
undermine Sun''? A. I don't remember. Q. Did you personally
participate in any conversations with Apple in 1997 and 1998? A. Of
any kind? Q. Let me be a little more specific. Did you participate
in any conversations with Apple in 1997 or 1998 concerning what
Apple would or would not do that would affect Microsoft
competitively? A. Well, there were some conversations with Steve
Jobs about Microsoft Office ... Q. And did you participate in those
conversations? A. I talked to Steve Jobs on the phone I think
twice. Q. And what was the nature of your conversations with Mr.
Jobs? A. Well, Steve had ... Steve called me up and said that he
had become the C.E.O. of Apple, sort of, and that Gil Amelio wasn't
the C.E.O. of Apple. And he raised the question of was there some
beneficial agreement that we could enter into different than we'd
been discussing with Gil. And it wasn't a very long call and the
conclusion was that Greg Maffei would go see Steve. Q. Was it your
understanding that Microsoft Office for Macintosh was believed by
Apple to be very important to them? A. I really have a hard time
testifying about the belief of a corporation. I really don't know
what that means. Q. Well, sir, in making the decisions as to what
you would ask of Apple, did you believe that what you were offering
Apple with respect to Microsoft Office for Macintosh was important
enough to Apple so that they ought to give you something for it? A.
I have no idea what you're talking about when you say ``ask.'' Q.
Well, let me show you a document that has been previously marked as
Government Exhibit 268 ...
</P>
<P>
   The first part of this purports to be a copy of an e-mail from
Don Bradford to Ben Waldman with a copy to you, Mr. Maritz and
others on the subject of ``Java on Macintosh/IE Control.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you receive a copy of this e-mail on or about Feb. 13, 1998?
A. I don't know. Q. Do you have any reason to doubt that you
received a copy of this e-mail? A. No. Q. The first paragraph
reads, ``Apple wants to keep both Netscape and Microsoft developing
browsers for Mac _ believing if one drops out, the other will lose
interest (and also not really wanting to pick up the development
burden.) Getting Apple to do anything that significantly/materially
disadvantages Netscape will be tough. Do agree that Apple should be
meeting the spirit of our cross-license agreement and that
Mac-Office is the perfect club to use on them.'' Q. Do you have an
understanding of what Mr. Bradford means when he refers to
MacOffice as the ``perfect club to use on Apple''? A. No. Q. The
second sentence of that paragraph, the one that reads, ``Getting
Apple to do anything that significantly/materially disadvantages
Netscape will be tough.'' Was it your understanding in February of
1998 that Microsoft was trying to get Apple to do something to
disadvantage Netscape? A. No. Q. Do you know why Mr. Bradford would
have written this in February of 1998 and sent a copy to you? A.
I'm not sure.

FEDEX CHIEF SEES LOSSES NOW IN STRIKE THREAT BY PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top executive at Federal Express warned last weekend that
the company was on the verge of losing several large customers
during the peak holiday season because of a threatened strike by
its pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came after negotiations between the company and
Fedex Pilots Association broke down late Friday. In a direct appeal
delivered to each of the union's 3,500 members on Sunday along with
the company's latest contract offer, Theodore Wiese, the chief
executive of Federal Express, wrote that the union's hard line
could permanently hurt the company and might cost some Fedex
workers their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Several big customers were asking for firm assurances that
Fedex, a unit of FDX Corp., would deliver their packages during the
peak holiday season, Wiese wrote. ``Our competitors are happy to
provide those assurances,'' he added. ``But only if our customers
make long-term commitments extending well past the end of our
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman would not say which customers Wiese had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Clement, a spokesman for the union, dismissed the letter as
a ``typical union busting'' ploy by the company. ``I'm shocked
every time I read it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the pilots voted overwhelmingly not to fly any
voluntary overtime beginning on Nov. 9, when a rising number of
holiday packages begin to flow, and the union said it would ask
members to authorize a strike in a vote later this month.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilots and the company reach an agreement, it would be
the first union contract at Fedex, which has grown from a
struggling start-up in 1973 into a $16 billion freight giant with a
brand that has entered the vernacular around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a strike at Federal Express, which dominates
the air delivery business with about half the market, comes less
than two years after a walkout by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters crippled the United Parcel Service, the biggest deliverer
of packages on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express and the pilots have been trying to negotiate a
contract for more than five years. Two previous attempts, by the
national Air Line Pilots Association and an earlier incarnation of
the Fedex Pilots Association, foundered because many pilots did not
back them.
</P>
<P>
   But support for the Fedex Pilots Association under new
leadership increased markedly over the summer after many pilots
were upset by a new computer scheduling system introduced by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, who earn an average of $130,000 a year, also say
they are paid much less than their counterparts at UPS and the top
commercial airlines. They are seeking a 24 percent pay increase
over three years; the company has offered a 17 percent increase
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Clement said the company walked out of negotiations Friday
night. William Margaritis, the Fedex spokesman, said the talks had
been suspended while ``both sides re-evaluate their positions.'' He
added that he could not predict when the talks would resume.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the pilots authorize a strike, it is not clear whether
they can actually walk off the job. Under the Railway Labor Act,
the pilots must receive permission by federal mediators. The Fedex
pilots say they have simply stepped into the shoes of the Air Line
Pilots Association, which received permission to strike in November
1995 but never followed through.
</P>
<P>
   Fedex will likely challenge that interpretation in court.
Experts say the case could go either way. Taking pre-emptive action
on Friday, the pilots union asked the U.S. District Court in
Washington to affirm its right to strike.

<P>
   Political contests, by definition, typically have a winner and a
loser. But in California, if final polls have it right, one of
Tuesday's contests is going to produce two losers: the Democratic
and Republican parties and, beyond that, maybe the whole state.
</P>
<P>
   On the ballot is an obscure proposal, labeled Proposition 3,
that calls for the state to revert to ``closed'' primaries, as
opposed to ``open'' primaries, when choosing presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The open system, which allows Republicans to vote for Democrats,
and vice versa, was adopted by the state two years ago, and is a
relative rarity in presidential politics. Both national parties
refuse to seat delegates chosen in open primaries, arguing that the
practice skews the political system.
</P>
<P>
   So if Proposition 3 fails, and it was behind by a margin of
roughly 2-to-1 in the final polls, California's Democratic and
Republican parties will have to come up with alternative voting
systems, like caucuses or conventions, for Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not the half of it.
</P>
<P>
   If Proposition 3 fails, the state might as well junk its new
plan to become a bigger player in the presidential nominating game
by holding its primaries in early March, rather than in early June.
The date was advanced because the national primary system has
become so heavily front-loaded these days that any primary held
after May is essentially moot.
</P>
<P>
   But if the proposition fails, even a March primary would be
moot. The political parties may then go to court.
</P>
<P>
   Two Candidates For the Price of One
</P>
<P>
   No election contest in the country has been more topsy-turvy
than the Alaska governor's race. And the confusion seems likely to
continue through Election Day _ and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   It began on Day 1, when John Lindauer, a retired newspaper
publisher, jumped into the Republican primary and questions were
raised about whether he was a full-time resident of the state. He
convinced election officials that he was and won the August
primary.
</P>
<P>
   But then in early September, questions were raised about whether
Lindauer was violating state law by hiding the source of the money
he was using to go after Gov. Tony Knowles, the Democratic
incumbent. Again he persuaded officials, including party leaders,
who were threatening to withdraw support, that all was above board.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out in early October, however, that Lindauer was
bankrupt, and that his wife was funding his race. A citizen filed
suit to have him thrown off the ballot, and the Republican Party
withdrew its support, calling for a write-in campaign for state
Sen. Robin Taylor, the runner-up in the August primary.
</P>
<P>
   Then last Thursday, with polls showing Taylor splitting the GOP
vote with Lindauer, Republican officials had second thoughts. They
asked a state court to delay the election, arguing that if it was
held before all the confusion could be cleared up, Knowles would
win almost by default.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the court ruled that the election should
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Appalachian Bids a Warm Hello
</P>
<P>
   Good humor has not been one of the hallmarks of this fall's
politicking, and in the final hours of the campaign, there has been
some downright mean television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevada voters, even some Democrats, are getting a yuk from a
spot the state's Republican Party is running against Sen. Harry
Reid, a Democrat who is locked in a dead heat with his Republican
challenger, Rep. John Ensign.
</P>
<P>
   The ad says that Nevada sends $2 billion more to Washington in
taxes each year than the state gets back in federal expenditures or
programs. It blames the shortfall on the senator, asserting that he
votes to help the hard-pressed people of West Virginia, but not
those in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon a red-bearded hillbilly appears on screen, sitting in
front of a tin-roofed shack, exuberantly tossing fistfuls of
dollars into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeeee-haaahh!'' he shouts. And across the screen flashes:
``Thank you from West Virginia.''

<P>
   OTTAWA, Ill. _ Since casting a ballot for Harry Truman in 1948,
Harold Hiles, a World War II veteran, has always deemed it an honor
and a duty to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But on this Election Day, he is staying home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't want any part of it,'' said Hiles, 76, over a piece of
apple pie on Sunday morning, as church bells pealed in this small
Midwestern city. ``Clinton, Starr, the whole bunch of them. Who do
you believe anymore? Who can you respect? People are just losing
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the handicapping about the races between Democrats and
Republicans on Tuesday, there is little doubt what a majority of
Americans will effectively choose: none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   It is a virtual certainty that fewer than half of all eligible
voters will visit the polls on Tuesday; some political analysts say
the number could plummet to about one-third.
</P>
<P>
   While grousing about politicians is a time-honored American
tradition, would-have-been-voters say this campaign season has
wallowed in far more than the usual level of muck _ vicious
name-calling, transparent pandering and, of course, the lascivious
details about President Clinton's sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like politics are spinning out of control,''
said Jerry Hanck, a 60-year-old liquor salesman, who will sit out
the election. ``There are bad actors on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in this old river town 140 years ago that 10,000 people
turned out at Washington Square for the first debate between
Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, a discussion that focused on
constitutional principles and the most fundamental of human rights.
It does not escape notice here that the last national election of
the 20th Century seems to be driven by sound bites, attack ads and
sex talk that brings an embarrassed blush even to a crusty old Navy
man like Hiles.
</P>
<P>
   But gauging the sensibilities of voters, especially when it
comes to Clinton's affair with a former White House intern, is a
tricky business.
</P>
<P>
   Hiles, a retired factory-glass union member, would surely fall
in the approval column on the president's job rating. ``He's been a
wonderful president,'' Hiles said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Hiles said he will boycott the ballot box on Tuesday
largely because he disapproves of Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, and the president's failure to tell the whole
truth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sentiment that surfaced frequently among nonvoters,
mostly among Democrats. These were not people who intended to bolt
to the Republican side. They had simply become dispirited.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats just feel kind of embarrassed right now,'' said
Connie Jolley, 29, a restaurant manager. Ms. Jolley, who described
herself as ``a majorly Democratic'' voter in most years, plans to
go to the polls on Tuesday, but only to vote on a local referendum.
</P>
<P>
   She intends to skip the races for governor, Senate and the
House, saying that she could not bring herself to vote for the
Republicans, but did not believe the Democrats had earned her vote.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to voters, nonvoters are younger, less educated, have
lower incomes and tend to support Democratic candidates for the
House of Representatives, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, taken Oct. 26 to 28, found that 32 percent of
nonvoters are under age 30, compared with just 13 percent of
voters. Nearly two-thirds of nonvoters have never attended college,
whereas 43 percent of voters have not attended college. Forty
percent of nonvoters have households incomes of less than $30,000 a
year, compared to 24 percent of likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of preferences for the House of Representatives races,
49 percent of nonvoters favor Democratic candidates and 27 percent
favor Republicans. The likely voters, meanwhile, were evenly split
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Congressional District here, which sweeps north and
east across Illinois farmland to the industrial city of Joliet, has
swung between Democrats and Republicans. It last changed parties in
1994, when Jerry Weller, a Republican, took office. Weller is
widely expected to win re-election against his Democratic opponent,
Gary Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like, `What's the sense?''' said Mike Malles, a
33-year-old house painter, who skipped past the political news in
the Sunday newspaper, and read the movie reviews. ``The noise is
just too loud. There's so much hype. A lot of people just want to
pull back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudslinging and scandal are surely not the only things keeping
voters from the polls. Many people say they simply do not find
politics interesting enough to spend much time dwelling on the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   When Melissa Reynolds, a 19-year-old college student, asked,
``What are we voting for?'' she was not posing a rhetorical
question.
</P>
<P>
   She was unaware that Tuesday was Election Day. ``I don't get
into that stuff,'' said Miss Reynolds, who plans to become a
grammar school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy in relatively good shape, many Americans have
taken a fairly pacific view of political affairs, not motivated
enough to demand sharp change. Others simply see the actions of
political leaders as increasingly irrelevant to their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dedra Phillips, who works as a quality analyst for a cookie
company, said she was enjoying some prosperity these days. But she
said politicians should leave her alone. And she plans to do them
the same favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are good for me because I make them that way,'' said Ms.
Phillips, 28, who pushed a stroller that held her two young
children. ``It has nothing to do with politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Harden, a 33-year-old custodian, said she would stay away
from the polls as a gesture of protest against politicians who she
claimed operated on a different standard than ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they're better than the people who pay their
salaries,'' said Ms. Harden, as she walked through a parking lot to
the Wal-Mart store. ``The only time you ever see them is at parade
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Harnisch, a 47-year-old teacher at a corrections facility,
said she would skip the voting booth because politicians had
skipped the issues most relevant to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wasting time on this investigation _ censure him,
throw him out, let him go, whatever _ but let's get on with it,''
said Ms. Harnisch, who usually splits her ticket.
</P>
<P>
   She blamed Republicans for dwelling on the Starr investigation,
but said the president, by his example, ``has made it much harder
for the average person who wants to go out and do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, she said, she was annoyed by
politicians who dwell on ``hot-button'' issues like gun control and
abortion, while ignoring the complicated matters that come up in
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they talk about things that hit home _ medical
expenses, credit card debt, men who don't pay child support,'' said
Ms. Harnisch. ``I'm not voting because it just doesn't seem to get
through to them.''

PHOENIX SCHOOL USES TECHNOLOGY TO HELP DEAF STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LORI BAKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Candice Carlton lives in a world where her eyes must
do what her ears can't.
</P>
<P>
   Deaf since birth, the 11-year-old has to communicate by writing
and reading notes, using American Sign Language, or typing on a
special telephone text device.
</P>
<P>
   But Candice recently has been able to use her eyes in new ways
to help her excel at Phoenix Day School for the Deaf.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old school is among the first in the nation to
install technological tools for deaf and hard-of-hearing students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is an equalizer for students with special needs
because it opens up the world through various types of
communication,'' said Lori Elliott, media and technology specialist
for the school.
</P>
<P>
   To practice math skills, Candice uses the Bowling for Numbers
computer program, which flashes a message saying whether her
answers to questions are correct. She soon will be practicing her
typing skills by exchanging e-mail messages with students around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of asking the teacher what's for lunch, Candice can
glance up at the television monitor in her classroom and see a text
message.
</P>
<P>
   Similar technology is being installed at the Tucson School for
the Deaf and Blind. Both schools are part of the Arizona State
Schools for the Deaf and the Blind.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Day, at 1935 W. Hayward Ave., serves about 300 preschool
to high school students who come from all over the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   During the past couple of years, about $500,000 worth of
state-funded equipment has been installed in the school's 60
classrooms, including a television monitor, a special phone system
and computers. Digital cameras and video cameras are shared among
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Some rooms also have FM listening systems to help
hard-of-hearing students more clearly hear their teachers through
their hearing aids.
</P>
<P>
   Internet access will be expanded to every classroom by December,
allowing students and teachers to e-mail one another at their
school and others worldwide. The school plans to have its own Web
site later in the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Curry, who teaches fourth- and fifth-graders at the school,
is excited about the opportunities that the technologies provide
for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do education without technology but it's motivating for
kids to use it,'' Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   She works on a statewide team of educators who train others in
using technology in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Second-grade teacher Kris Trainor, who is on the technology team
with Curry, brags about how her students were able to produce a
slide show with captioning for parents using a digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is technology helping students learn, it's giving
Phoenix Day a sense of unity.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, each classroom was isolated because there was no
way to communicate between rooms or from the classroom to outside
the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Now each classroom has phones equipped with voice and text
voice-mail systems. Text voice mail allows written messages to be
accessed or left at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has made life easier for students, teachers and
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 30 percent of our teachers being deaf or hard of hearing,
this makes it easier to communicate,'' said Gaby Sorenson, Phoenix
Day's principal. ``Before, if two deaf people wanted to communicate
they had to do it face to face or through notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many deaf schools use television sets to show videos
with closed captioning, Phoenix Day does much more with its
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors are the school's answer to the loudspeaker system
that regular schools use to make daily announcements or sound the
bell when it's time to change classes.
</P>
<P>
   On the television screen, text messages featuring the lunch
menu, school happenings and photos of students are shown throughout
the day. The universal clock on the screen allows students to know
when it's time to change classes. If there were an emergency, a
message would flash on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Day is one of a few deaf schools nationally that have
text messaging voice mail and television monitors in each
classroom, said Judy Harkins, director of Technology Assessment
Program at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., a university
designed for deaf students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unusual for schools for the deaf to have TTYs (phone
text systems) in every classroom,'' Harkins said. ``Most classrooms
don't have phones at all. The monitors also are rare and I would
think they would be preferable in hearing schools as well.'' &QL;

SANGSTAT DRUG CLEARED BY FDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sangstat Medical Corp. said Monday that the Food
and Drug Administration had approved its immune-suppressant drug,
Sangcya, for preventing organ rejection in transplant patients, and
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Sangstat
said it would bring out the drug within a month.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said Sangcya was therapeutically equivalent to Novartis
AG's Neoral, its proprietary formulation of cyclosporine, which is
projected to have worldwide sales of $1.3 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sangstat said it would price Sangcya about 20 percent below
Neoral, which would save transplant patients about $1,200 a year.
Although Sangstat was notified of the approval over the weekend,
the company did not plan to release the information until Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   In NASDAQ trading, Sangstat shares closed Monday at $21.675, up
87.5 cents. Analysts said the approval and pricing were both widely
anticipated, and the issue now would be how effectively Sangstat
could compete with Novartis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to face a number of hurdles and intense lobbying by our
competitor,'' Dr. Philippe Pouletty, Sangstat's chairman and chief
executive, said in a telephone interview, noting that two citizen
petitions filed by Novartis and one by a Washington law firm
attempting to block Sangcya had been denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic about the market acceptance of Sangcya,'' he
said. Novartis officials were not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Pouletty said the FDA's finding of therapeutic equivalence meant
that patients would not need a new prescription from their
physician to switch from Neoral to Sangcya, and he noted that more
than 70 percent of transplant patients had already switched from
Novartis' older Sandimmune to Neoral. At a lower price, and with a
more convenient formulation, Sangcya will compete effectively, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the transplant community would not take the
entry of a new drug lightly. Although bioequivalent, Sangcya
differs from Neoral in that it is taken in liquid form, with a
special dispenser developed by Sangstat, rather than in capsules.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid may be easier to take, as Sangstat suggests, but for
patients who depend on daily use of a drug to stay alive, the
change will not be an automatic one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if a new prescription is not required, I think physicians
will want to build up a great deal of experience and education,''
before switching patients to the new drug, said Viren Mehta, an
analyst with Mehta Partners. He noted also that safer, more potent
immune suppressant drugs are coming from both Novartis and American
Home in the next few years.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOBOKEN, N.J. _ With Clifford the Big Red Dog hovering above,
nearly 100 volunteers for Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade struggled
recently toward a degree in ``balloonology.'' In unison, they took
five steps to the right, then three to the left. They unrolled
their spools of line exactly six revolutions, then five more.
</P>
<P>
   They pranced around an empty soccer field in Hoboken, pretending
it was Broadway. ``You are now entering Columbus Circle,'' the team
captain shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the team practiced emergency drills _ pulling
the balloon almost to ground level and rapidly unzipping parts of
the inflated character to let the air out.
</P>
<P>
   These volunteers and the hundreds of others who will handle the
giant balloons in the parade were literally learning the ropes of a
vastly changed job. After last year's disastrous parade _ when high
winds played havoc with the balloons and a spectator was seriously
hurt after an out-of-control Cat in the Hat sent part of a lamppost
plunging to the street _ Macy's, under strong pressure from the
city, has revamped its procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making sure that everything is understood, that nobody
can make a mistake,'' said Michael Lynch, a three-year parade
veteran and a senior at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken,
where one of 14 all-day balloon training sessions was held on Oct.
25. In past years, he and others recalled training lasting, at
most, an hour or two.
</P>
<P>
   Besides adhering to stricter guidelines on how balloons are
handled _ including volunteers' passing a physical fitness test,
not to mention physics _ the 72-year-old parade will undergo other
major changes. Street lights along the route will be replaced or
modified; balloons will be tethered to 800-pound utility vehicles
for extra security; a meteorologist will be on hand to determine if
winds are dangerously high, and more team supervisors will
accompany each balloon to better monitor the floating procession.
</P>
<P>
   The changes came at the direction of a 12-member mayoral panel
that was formed after serious problems plagued last year's event,
when winds averaged 26.5 mph, with gusts up to 43 mph, and handlers
fought in vain to hold down Barney, the Pink Panther and other
wildly lurching balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Caronna, a 34-year-old woman from New York, was struck
by the shattered lamppost and remained in a coma for nearly a
month. Caronna has sued the city, Macy's and the manufacturer of
the lamppost. After the accident, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani demanded
major changes in the parade, openly wondering whether balloons
should be banned.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the mayor plans to meet with his aides to complete
the plans, which also include banning balloons in winds exceeding
23 mph and balloons more than 70 feet high or 78 feet long.

 &HT;    BCS complicates bowl picture, but not for top team
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Most Ohio State players still do not fully
understand how the new Bowl Championship Series rankings are
determined but they do understand this: The Buckeyes are No. 1 this
week and in their eyes, that means all is right again in college
football.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of scrunched noses and perplexed looks last
week when the Buckeyes were told they were No. 1 in the Associated
Press and USA Today /ESPN coaches' polls but No. 2 in the BCS
standings behind UCLA. Monday, when they were told they had jumped
to No. 1 in this week's BCS ratings, all of the number-crunching
seemed to make more sense to them.

   ``We were definitely disappointed we were No. 2 (last week),''
OSU quarterback Joe Germaine said. ``We definitely think of
ourselves as being a No. 1 team.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, so do the voters and the computers. OSU is first in the BCS
with 3.71 points, a lower total than last week. (The lower the
point total, the higher the rank.)
</P>
<P>
   Poll rankings, computer ratings, strength of schedule and
won-loss records each count 25 percent in determining the BCS
standings. The top two teams at the end of the season will be
invited to play in the national championship Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4 in
Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   A lackluster performance against a weak Stanford (1-7) team last
Saturday dropped UCLA in the polls and as a result in the BCS, from
No. 1 to No. 3 with 6.62 points. Tennessee, which features
Meadowdale High graduate Peerless Price at wide receiver, moved
into the No. 2 spot in the BCS (5.70 points) after its eighth
straight victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   OSU coach John Cooper said it's nice to be No. 1 across the
board. ``I'd rather be No. 1 than No. 2, 3 or 4,'' he said. ``But
I'm not going to worry about it like I didn't worry abut it last
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper still maintains that if OSU finishes the season
undefeated, the Buckeyes will play for a national championship. But
if UCLA, Tennessee and Ohio State each win the remainder of their
games, at least one undefeated team will be left out of the title
game. Kansas State, Wisconsin, Arkansas and Tulane also still have
shots at undefeated seasons. OSU offensive lineman Rob Murphy said
he just wants to make sure the Buckeyes stay on top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we're there, I'm a happy kid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine, too, said getting to the Fiesta Bowl is his main
focus. An emerging Heisman candidate and Arizona native, Germaine
said he thinks more about playing for a national title in his home
state than accepting the Heisman at the Downtown Athletic Club,
where the award is presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really all I think about in the back of my mind: Go to
Tempe and finish out the season there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If OSU and the rest of the teams vying for the top two spots
learned one thing about the complicated BCS this week it was this:
Squeezing out a victory against a weak opponent, as UCLA did
against Stanford, will cost you.
</P>
<P>
   Two of OSU's remaining three opponents are unranked: Michigan
State (4-4) on Saturday and Iowa (3-6) next week.

   TAPED GATES TESTIMONY SHOWN AT MICROSOFT TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   In two hours of videotaped questioning shown at the Microsoft
antitrust trial, chairman Bill Gates professed ignorance of several
key charges in the Government's suit, including allegations that he
was involved in plans to bully competitors like Apple Computer and
Netscape Communications to step back from Internet software markets
that Microsoft sought to dominate. When presented with e-mail
messages he had written, he often said he did not recognize the
messages or recall the discussions surrounding them, prompting, at
times, even the presiding judge to chuckle and shake his head.

NBA LOCKOUT IS NO VACATION FOR HEARN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike the NBA players, the refrigerator in the Hearn household
is working harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The 126-day labor dispute has made longtime Lakers announcer
Chick Hearn more restless than the nomadic Larry Brown. His wife,
Marge, confirmed that much the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fran,'' she sweetly chided him (Francis is his real name), ``I
hope you don't keep checking the refrigerator every chance you get
to see if the butter is getting hard and the Jell-O is jiggling.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the unpleasantness between the owners and the
players can't be over _ or ``in the refrigerator,'' in Hearnspeak _
soon enough to suit the octogenarian.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a stretch to say Hearn lives to work and works to live.
There's a reason why he hasn't had this much time on his hands in
more than six decades, since he took his first full-time job
straight out of East Aurora (Ill.) High.
</P>
<P>
   Words might be putty in his hands, to be shaped into wondrous
images. But Hearn has a tough time whittling leisure time into
anything worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most forlorn period I've had in my life,'' Hearn
said.
</P>
<P>
   A child of the Depression, Hearn learned early that to have a
job was a godsend. To enjoy what one does is to be twice blessed.
</P>
<P>
   These children of debauchery with their eight-car garages and
five-figure-per-game salaries who are crying foul, Hearn has a hard
time understanding. It's not a generation gap that separates Hearn
from the players who are fighting the owners for a bigger piece of
an already sickeningly sweet pie, it's a gentility gap.

 &HT;    Today's vote a bellwether for blacks
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hard to think of an election of greater import to
African-American voters in Georgia _ one in which they've been able
to vote, at least _ than the one being held today.
</P>
<P>
   This is true only in part because three black Democratic
candidates are on the statewide ticket for the first time _ and
none of them appear to have their races locked up going into
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The presence on the ballot of Thurbert Baker, Michael Thurmond
and Henrietta Canty represents progress, but of an uncharismatic
sort. There hasn't seemed to be a great wellspring of enthusiasm
among black voters for the attorney general who's prosecuting Ralph
David Abernathy III, the labor commissioner candidate who
spearheaded welfare changes and the insurance commissioner
candidate who's been serving in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the defeat of all three, if that happens, will in
all likelihood be taken as a stunning setback to black political
ambitions and prompt sober reassessments of how much political
progress has really been made in the state.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this year's election even more critical is that
whoever is elected governor will hold veto power over the next
redistricting map, which will set the course of state politics well
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   That veto will be particularly important to African-American
voters because the ground rules for how political power is to be
apportioned are much less clear heading into the 2000 census than
they were a decade ago, when the U.S. Justice Department mandated
the creation of new black-majority districts at the congressional
and legislative levels.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the U.S. Supreme Court rejected some of the
principles on which the redistricting of the early 1990s was based,
but an unprecedented partisan battle is already raging over how the
next census is to be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Every redistricting session comes down to hard choices, but
that's especially so for the next governor. He will have the final
say on a plan that is supposed to dole out political power fairly
to all groups, with fewer guidelines about what it means to be
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up, it's an election in which black people have more to
lose than to gain, in races that don't spark very emotional chords.
But the way in which this year's campaign has been conducted may
provide some of that spark.
</P>
<P>
   However white voters perceive the breathless Guy Millner ad
calling Roy Barnes a ``liar'' about affirmative action, or Mitch
Skandalakis's characterization of Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell as an
incompetent boob, or the polls that indicate a little-known,
75-year-old candidate could beat Thurmond, they are likely to be
enough to affront many black voters who might not otherwise have
seen much reason to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson, appearing on WCLK radio's
``Morning Jazz'' show Monday to urge listeners to turn out,
compared black voters to the kid who's tormented by the schoolyard
bully until he or she fights back _ which in his exhortation meant
to show up at the polls today.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they vote the way he advises or not, Jackson is
essentially correct. A low turnout in predominantly black
precincts, on a day when so much is at stake, sends a message to
both parties that diminishes respect for African-American votes.
What's most important for black Georgians today, who they vote for
is not as important as whether they show up.

IDENTITY THEFT PLAGUES BUSINESSES, BANKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sandy Darby is furious.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a couple masquerading as her company's business
associates passed phony corporate checks with her husband's forged
signature in laser printing. The thieves' take at two major retail
stores: $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a man tried to cash more than $600 in fake checks
at a cash-checking business. The checks bore her company's name and
even sported a counterfeit Bank of America logo, sans address.
</P>
<P>
   A check-cashing business approved a $500 check, which her bank
cashed. An employee at another check-cashing business got
suspicious and telephoned Darby. But before the police could be
called, the suspect left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is killing me,'' said Darby, the owner of a family-run
tour business with five employees in suburban Northridge. ``I'm a
small business.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for her, Darby won't have to pay the money lost on the
forged checks. The bank and retail stores will be paying for it.
But she must deal with the headache of clearing up credit reports
and changing the account number.
</P>
<P>
   Darby is among thousands of Americans confronted with identity
thefts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity thefts are overwhelming credit bureaus, postal
inspectors and the Secret Service,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, speaking
on behalf of the California Public Interest Group. ``We think the
trend is up, up, up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to estimate the actual size of losses incurred by
banks and businesses that grant credit, but estimates run up to $4
billion a year, said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights
Clearinghouse, a consumer information and advocacy group in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by the U.S. General Accounting
Office, the Secret Service estimates that $750 million was lost
last year from identity theft, up from $450 million in 1996. Credit
reporting companies received 523,000 fraud inquiries in 1997, up
from 35,000 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: It's so easy to obtain personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people can steal preapproved credit card
solicitations in the mail, dive behind dumpsters of office
buildings to get corporate documents, or access family Web pages on
the Internet to get personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Givens said one woman was victimized because her health
insurance company uses her Social Security number as her member
identification. Authorities believe that an employee of the
insurance company stole her Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   While consumers usually aren't charged for the fraud, it does
tangle up their credit records, Givens said. It takes from six
months to several years to fix the record, depending on the
severity of the problem, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Check fraud is one of the banking industry's biggest problems,
costing banks about $1 billion a year, said Sonia Barbara, a
spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But a new law signed by the president last week should help
consumers and business victims. The Identity Theft and Assumption
Deterrence Act of 1998 makes it a felony to commit identity theft.
While it already is a crime to impersonate someone else for fraud,
this law specifically focuses on ID theft.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the American Bankers Association launched a radio
campaign to warn seniors about this crime.
</P>
<P>
   The group's warning: Be careful about giving out personal
information such as Social Security numbers and bank account
numbers. Carefully monitor your bank and credit-card accounts to
spot any activity that wasn't yours, and contact the bank right
away if you find any.
</P>
<P>
   You also can have your credit report blocked, to be released
only when you call in with your personal identification number,
Mierzwinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who think they might be victims should contact the
nation's main credit bureaus right away: Transunion (800) 680-7289,
Equifax (800) 525-6285, and Experian, formerly TRW (888) 397-3742.
</P>
<P>
   To be taken off the mailing list for preapproved credit cards,
call (888) 5-OPT-OUT.

   &UR; WINDRIVER _ &LR;  As microchips become ubiquitous, so too does the
computer software that tells the chips what to do. That presents a
tremendous opportunity for fast-growing Wind River Systems of

11-2 -- Telegraph Avenue, the main business street of Berkeley, is
a haven for youths and the homeless, but not for much longer if the
city has its way. Whether they are scared or just plain fed up,
plenty of people in the nation's most famously liberal city want
the youths, panhandlers, drug addicts, drinkers, mentally ill
homeless swept off Telegraph Avenue, the shopping district here
mentioned in every tourist guide. (Audrey Shehyn/New York Times

Although sturdy bicycles remain the primary transportation for the
vast majority of Beijingers, their powerful gas-guzzling cousins
have been multiplying rapidly, literally edging cyclists off the
road. China's Xisidong Avenue was the first street in Beijing to
ban bicycles. A government worker with a megaphone turned away
cyclists from the avenue, instructing them to take other routes.

the Navy with 18-year-old William Waldron in Waldford. Recruiting
young men and women into the nation's all-volunteer military has
never been easy, but the military now faces a crisis in recruiting

11-2 -- With Clifford, the Big Red Dog hovering above, nearly 100
volunteers for Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade honed their
ballooning skills Monday in a soccerfield in Hoboken. After last
year's disastrous parade, when high winds played havoc with the
balloons and a spectator was seriously hurt after an out-of-control
Cat in the Hat sent part of a lamppost plunging to the street,
Macy's, under strong pressure from the city, has revamped its
procedures. (Dith Pran/New York Times Photo) *LITE

William Calvert's show had a roped off an area where the models
mingled and chatted. With this red dress, Calvert uses masterly
seaming that allowed the dresses to flow gracefully over the body,
outlining the figure without constricting it. Robert Danes kept the

this lacy openwork over the neckline. (Corina Lecca/New York Times

Rodriguez pairs well-cut tailored jackets with layered sheer skirts
for a play of hard against soft. Rodriguez uses these so-called
``shadowfold'' designs on the front of this jacket. Unlike much of
the origami pleating other designers have been using, these
shadowfolds are flat, like appliques, not bulky or awkward.

   (NYT8) WASHINGTON -- Nov. 2, 1998 -- ELN-CLINTON, 11-2 -- After
a campaign season distinguished more by President Clinton's
tribulations than by any raging national issues, Americans will
head to the polls on Tuesday in a mid-term election that will
inevitably be interpreted as a referendum on the fate of the
president. At a White House event Monday, President Clinton urged
voters to elect congressional candidates sympathetic to his
``Patient's Bill of Rights'' that calls for tougher restrictions on
managed-care organizations. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times Photo)

Little Vixen'' at the New York City Opera. Janacek's operas, once
the province of curiosity seekers, are gradually finding the place
in the repertory that they deserve. This one is the tale of a young
vixen and her encounters in both the village and the forest, the
characters and situations defined by a magnificent score. (Sara

CUT PRICES OR ELSE, LIBYA TELLS ITS SHOPS

<P>
   TRIPOLI, Libya _ The boutique owner said he had been lucky.
</P>
<P>
   He had heard from well-connected friends that Libya's dreaded
``purification committees'' would soon be back in action to enforce
the spirit of the 1969 revolution against the monarchy by insuring
that shopkeepers kept their prices at officially dictated limits.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader,
reinforced that message in a speech in early October that the
shopkeeper, who would provide only his given name, Mohammed,
realized just how lucky he had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices must be cut by whatever means, and if they are not cut,
there will be violence,'' Gadhafi declared, adding that shopkeepers
who did not act quickly might find that demonstrators would ``set
their shops ablaze.''
</P>
<P>
   No such violence has been reported. But on Tripoli's main
streets, the warning was enough to persuade at least half the
shopkeepers to close, fearful that raids by the committees would
expose their prices as too high.
</P>
<P>
   Only shopkeepers like Mohammed, who had hurried ahead of time to
negotiate revised prices for his foreign-made trousers, belts and
shirts that he said will barely allow him to scrape by, have
managed for now to remain in business. And what had become a
thriving private sector, rich with imported clothes, foods and
electronic and computer equipment, is again wrestling with the
uncertainties imposed by a government practiced at
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not fair, but what is fair in this country anyway?''
said the wife of a shopkeeper who had to shut his business when the
prices dictated by the committees meant that he would have to sell
his goods at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown by the purification committees, made up of army
officers and students, is the second since they were formed in 1996
as part of what Gadhafi called an effort to curb ``speculation and
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where most salaries have been frozen since 1981 and
most people rely heavily on subsidized government goods, the drive
has been popular among poorer Libyans, who cannot afford the
Italian-made chocolates and cheeses that had been on display in
now-shuttered shops on fashionable Gargarech Street here.
</P>
<P>
   But the enforcement tactics have infuriated many others, who
describe them as an example of the deliberate confusion that many
say can make living and doing business in Libya a maddening
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main purpose is to prevent people from getting too rich,''
a Western diplomat said. ``The conception is that people need to
know that there is a certain limit beyond which people are
punished, and punished severely, so that no one gets too
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Private business is encouraged, though 70 percent of Libya's
economy is still controlled by the state. But no one is free to set
his own prices, and every shopkeeper must post an official list
obtained from the government that in theory limits profits on each
sale to 10 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In practice, some traders, like those everywhere, try to earn
much more. But because Libya is officially a jamahiriya, or state
of the masses, anyone tempted to violate the rules must keep watch
not just for the police but also for members of ``revolutionary
committees'' who report at periodic ``popular conferences'' about
shopkeepers found to be charging prices that are too high.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1996 law, any Libyan can be punished by death for
speculating in currency, food, clothes or housing during a state of
war or blockade _ including the U.N. sanctions that have been
imposed since 1992, because of Libya's refusal to surrender
suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland. In practice, the penalties have been less severe.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first crackdown, which lasted from the summer of 1996
to mid-1997, Tripoli-based diplomats said they believed that many
dozens of people were arrested, while hundreds more were fined or
ordered to shut their shops for good. And as memories of that
episode have begun to fade, and prices began to creep back up,
Libyan officials said it was only natural that Gadhafi issued his
latest warning.
</P>
<P>
   On visits in which a reporter was accompanied by a government
escort, shopkeepers said they had nothing to complain about. They
said they believed that most of the shops that are closed now will
soon reopen, once their owners negotiate new price lists with the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But out of the escort's earshot, others said they feared that
the government's latest efforts to force prices downward would
eventually drive them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way the government wants it,'' complained a taxi
driver, Ahmed, who like everyone who criticized the government,
would not allow his full name to be published. ``They allow
business to be good for two or three years, and then they knock
everything back down.''

number online? &LR;
<P>
   A: Shopping on the Internet has always been at least as safe as
giving your credit card number over the phone to somebody you don't
know. And the latest encryption technology makes it extremely safe.
</P>
<P>
   Most shopping sites alert you with a warning box when you enter
a secure area to order a product. In addition, you'll see a closed
padlock on the status bar in newer versions of the Netscape and
Microsoft browsers, assuring you that your connection is secure.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean, however, that you can't get fleeced on the
Web. The wisest course is to shop with companies that have solid
reputations for reliability.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you're on America Online, you can shop with total
peace of mind, because AOL guarantees security when you buy from
its certified merchants.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: Help. My dad was fooling around on my computer and
accidentally reduced Windows Explorer from two viewing panes to
one. Now when I open the Explorer in Windows 98, I can only see the
file tree. When I double-click a folder to open it, I hear the
opening sound but nothing is displayed. Any suggestions for a
solution?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's what you get for letting dad mess with your PC. He
probably shrank the Windows Explorer window by using the mouse to
drag a side border of the window inward. When you do that (whether
you drag the left or right border), the window shrinks from its
right side, hiding the pane that shows the contents of folders. And
as you've discovered, once the window is shrunk, it stays that way
even if you reboot the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've scared you, here's an easy way to restore Windows
Explorer to its original size, and restore harmony to your family.
Just drag either the left or right border outward until you can
view both panes again.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Your dad may have inadvertently shrunk the window while
trying to drag it out of the way of something else on the screen.
Tell him that to move a window, you should drag it from the blue
border on the top.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to print out a sample of all the fonts
available to me on my computer? I'm running Windows 98 with
Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: A number of programs available on the Internet do exactly
what you're talking about. Two that I like are ListFonts, which is
free, and Win32 Font Lister, which you can try for free, and buy
for $5 if you like it. Both programs can easily print out a list of
all your fonts in any type size you wish. You can find them in
ZDNet's software library at  &LR; www.hotfiles.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've pretty much cleansed Windows 95 of Internet Explorer so
I can use Netscape Communicator unimpeded. My son recently acquired
a new computer with Windows 98 pre-installed. We wonder if it is
safe to attempt the same procedure with Win98, or is Internet
Explorer so intricate and deeply embedded that it would disable
Win98 to remove it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, Charlie. Internet Explorer is sunk into Windows 98
like Excalibur into the stone. According to Microsoft's own online
support library, ``Explorer is an integrated part of the operating
system and cannot be removed from Windows 98.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMAC UPDATE: &LR;  A couple of weeks ago, I gave some
recommendations for ways to transfer files from Macintoshes to the
new iMac _ which for some reason known only to Steve Jobs doesn't
have a floppy disk drive. Alternatives I suggested including using
an Ethernet connection, or transferring between modems. I also gave
the address for a Web site called FreeDrive ( &LR; www.freedrive.com &LR; )
that lets you upload files from your Mac to the Web, then download
them to your iMac _ sort of like a virtual disk drive.
</P>
<P>
   A reader alerted me to another site, iMacFloppy.com
( &LR; www.imacfloppy.com &LR; ) that does the same thing. Both sites are
free and can be used to store data as well as transfer it.
</P>
<P>
   And here's yet another option. Send files to yourself as e-mail
attachments using your Mac, then use your iMac to read the mail and
download the files.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Searching the Intranet can be frustrating, because simple search
words can turn up millions of results. For more precision, use the
advanced searching options that most of the major search engines
offer. Some engines have special forms for advanced searching, and
they all support Boolean logic, which lets you use words like
``and'' and ``not'' to narrow a search.

 Silicon Valley's Take on the Easy-Bake Oven  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Silicon Valley technology has put hundreds of millions of
transistors on a microchip and connected the world through the
Internet. Now it's roasting chickens and baking biscuits.
<P>
   The Flashbake oven, developed by a former Stanford Research
Institute scientist, is the first real oven to cook mostly with
light _ specifically, eight tungsten halogen lamps.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this microprocessor-controlled high-tech wonder,
the product of $20 million in development funding, is similar to
that of the old Easy-Bake _ a toy oven powered by a lightbulb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real difference between the Easy-Bake and the
Flashbake is the spectral shift,'' said Bill Minnear, chief
technology officer of Fremont's Quadlux Inc., which makes the
Flashbake.
</P>
<P>
   The Flashbake's lightbulbs are much more powerful than the
Easy-Bake's, and they use more deep-penetrating, infrared rays,
Minnear said.
</P>
<P>
   The Flashbake, which is about the size of a microwave, does not
require preheating, and its flickering bulbs _ four on the top and
four on the bottom _ cook many foods in half the time of a
conventional oven.
</P>
<P>
   The oven can do some things a microwave can't do, such as brown
meat and baked goods, and warm bread without making it chewy. It
defrosts more slowly than a microwave, however, and it cannot cook
in plastic because its temperatures get too high. It does work with
metal and Pyrex cookware.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than setting a temperature, the Flashbake user chooses
from cook modes such as bake, grill and reheat, which have been
programmed to send different amounts of power to the food during
the cook cycle.
</P>
<P>
   In bake mode, for example, the oven delivers a lot of energy at
the beginning, when dough is wet, and less as it cooks. At the end,
the oven sends a spurt of rays to the surface for browning, unless
the user tells it not to.
</P>
<P>
   Power levels are determined in part by an electronic eye on the
bottom of the oven, which tells the oven's microprocessor whether
the pan's finish is shiny or dull. The oven sends more energy to a
light and shiny surface, which will deflect many rays, than to a
dark, opaque pan, which absorbs energy efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   The Flashbake uses less energy than a conventional oven because
it does not require preheating and it cooks more quickly, said
Clifford Adams, president and CEO of Quadlux. Microwaves use 5 to
10 percent less energy than the Flashbake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Flashbake goes on sale at premium appliance dealers such as
the Contra Costa Appliance Center in Walnut Creek in mid-November
for a hefty $1,595 _ $1,695 for a built-in version.
</P>
<P>
   A small commercial Flashbake has been used by bars, restaurants
and convenience stores for five years, mostly for the quick baking
of pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our penetration will be 4 percent to 5 percent of
households with more than $120,000 or so in annual income, which is
about 5.5 million households,'' said Adams, the former chief
operating officer of the Mondavi wine empire.
</P>
<P>
   The company intends to release a downscaled model in 2000 for
about half the price of today's Flashbake, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   The current model, Flashbake/Wolf 120, is expected to appeal
mostly to well-to-do, two-income families who would like to be able
to cook a full meal quickly after work, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   In focus groups, some consumers see the Flashbake as a microwave
replacement while others see it as an add-on to their existing set
of appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Flashbake's market would be bigger if it could make a
product to replace conventional ovens rather than microwaves. But
that is not technologically feasible, said Adams.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that halogen lights cannot withstand the
900-degree temperatures necessary for self-cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that people prefer multirack ovens that can cook
several dishes at once. But although the hot air of a conventional
oven can circulate among different levels, the Flashbake's light
cannot. Installing multiple layers of lights would make the oven
prohibitively large, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Flashbake was invented by Silicon Valley computer scientist
Gene Westerberg, who began developing it in 1985. He now is
Quadlux's vice president of technology.

 Syquest Halts Operations, May File Chapter 11  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Syquest Technology, a disk drive-maker that has wallowed in red ink
for three years, suspended operations yesterday, throwing as many
as 900 people out of work.
<P>
   The company did not answer telephone calls to its Fremont
headquarters, limiting its communication to a brief press release
in which it said it may seek to reorganize under Chapter 11
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Syquest has asked Nasdaq to halt trading its stock, which was
valued at just 34 cents _ down from $4 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The capitulation came as no surprise, given the steady erosion
of Syquest's finances. In July, the company enlisted CIBC
Oppenheimer to try to find a partner or suitor. In August, it fired
950 workers _ half its workforce _ and halted manufacturing in
Fremont. The current number and location of Syquest's employees
could not be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Syquest was caught between falling prices for its
products, intensive competition from rival Iomega, and softness in
the personal computer market earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised at all,'' said analyst Howard Rosencrans of
HD Brouse &AMP; Co. ``The handwriting's been on the wall for several
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosencrans said the management of Chairman Ed Marinaro and CEO
Edwin Harper never had a chance to turn around Syquest after
inheriting ``unfixable problems'' from previous CEO Syed Iftikar
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely capital-intensive business, and their
financial situation didn't allow them to be viable,'' Rosencrans
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Syquest put its money on removable disk drives
that let users transfer about 100 megabytes of information from one
computer to another. But the company's products quickly fell behind
similar Zip drives marketed by Iomega.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Syquest attempted a comeback with a removable drive
that held more data, but it, too, failed to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company lost $68.7 million on sales of $122.72
million, which was down from a peak of nearly $300 million in 1995.
In its latest quarter, Syquest reported a loss of $42 million on
earnings of $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Syquest said it plans to maintain limited support for its
customers but did not offer details. The company also did not say
whether it will retain any employees.

 Taking On Microsoft _ Wind River's Big Opportunity Also
Its  Biggest Threat  By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
As microchips become ubiquitous, so too does the computer software
that tells the chips what to do.
<P>
   That presents a tremendous opportunity for fast-growing Wind
River Systems of Alameda, which makes the software that runs the
chips in cars, cameras, telephones and dozens of other everyday
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet where there's opportunity in the software market, Microsoft
Corp. usually looms _ and that presents the biggest risk for Wind
River.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies don't yet go head to head in many markets for
so-called embedded systems, but it's only a matter of time before
they do.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for its system that controlled the Mars Pathfinder
vehicle last year, Wind River also makes products for
Hewlett-Packard printers, Kodak digital cameras, and Cisco Systems
cable modems and networking hubs, routers and switches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't use the Internet without your voice or data going
through our software somewhere,'' said Jerry Fiddler, Wind River's
chairman and co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Windows CE system is used in handheld computers,
video-game consoles, phones, DVD players and set-top boxes, among
other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Microsoft wants to compete in this market.
Eventually, their technology will get better,'' said Fiddler. ``One
would be foolhardy not to take them seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Microsoft earned $4.5 billion on revenues of $14.5
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wind River earned $4.9 million on revenues of $92.4 million.
Even with profits up 64 percent so far this year, Wind River's net
income of $10.4 million on revenues of $57.6 million for the first
six months is still a drop in the bucket compared to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The entire market for embedded systems is only $250 million a
year, according to Tom Rhinelander, an analyst with Forrester
Research in Massachusetts. ``That's a rounding error for
Microsoft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market for embedded systems is growing much more
rapidly than the PC market and many see it as the next great
frontier for software companies.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is gathering at the San Jose Convention Center this
week for an Embedded Systems Conference, with 320 companies showing
off their wares. Information about the conference is on the
Internet at  &LR; www.embedded.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Wind River said it is the dominant player in the industry, with
a 35 to 40 percent market share. Other players include Integrated
Systems, Lucent Technologies and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Wind River ``has done an excellent job of executing. The
question now is, Can they continue to execute in the face of
Microsoft's thud?'' said software analyst Sheila Ennis with
Hambrecht and Quist. ``They've shown they can market, but it will
be a different game marketing against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   In its trial now under way in Washington, D.C., Microsoft faces
charges that it used its near-monopoly in desktop operating systems
to crush competitors such as Netscape Communications Corp., a maker
of a rival Internet browser.
</P>
<P>
   But in the embedded system marketplace, Microsoft's dominance in
PC software isn't necessarily an advantage. That's because most
embedded operating systems do just one thing.
</P>
<P>
   An embedded operating system for anti-lock brakes, for example,
``doesn't have to support games and word processing,'' Rhinelander
said. But it had better stop a car, without requiring re-booting
like so much irritating desktop computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, however, said that in the future, many people will
want their phones or televisions or other devices with embedded
systems to communicate with their PCs or computer networks. And
then Microsoft will have an advantage because Windows CE is
compatible with the versions of Windows that run on PCs and
corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area of non-PC computing is incredibly important to
Microsoft,'' said Tony Barbagallo, a former Wind River employee who
is now a group product manager for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Barbagallo conceded that Wind River's VxWorks operating system
is better able to run on small items like phones than Windows CE.
But he said Windows CE can run bigger applications, like factory
floor automation, at least as well as VxWorks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddler, 46, co-founded the company with David Wilner in a
garage in Berkeley in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The company was based on technology he developed when he was
getting his master's degree in computer science at the University
of Illinois. (As an undergraduate, he changed his major five times,
ending up with a dual major in music and photography.)
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office is the $1.50 Salvation Army tweed suitcase
in which he built the workings of a computer as part of his thesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was, as far as I know, the first portable terminal ever
built,'' Fiddler said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wind River employs 550 people, including 300 in Alameda.
At the end of the year it will move into the first two buildings of
a five-building complex it's erecting on the Alameda waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddler maintains the shaggy beard and baggy corduroys of a man
comfortable tinkering with technology. As the company grew, he
relinquished the role of chief executive officer, recognizing that
``I knew somebody could run it day-to-day better than I could.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he hired Ron Abelmann, 61, a native of South Africa who
had run the analytical instrument group at Varian Associates.
Abelmann, in his suit and loafers and button-down shirt, presents a
more corporate image than Fiddler.
</P>
<P>
   But he's just as determined to fend off the Microsoft threat.
Abelmann said Wind River's biggest advantage is its willingness to
stay invisible in the background, running other people's products.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants its name front and center on all products _ from
PCs to handhelds. While that has worked wonders for Microsoft, many
makers of phones and other consumer electronics may prefer to keep
their own name in the spotlight.

 Wells, Norwest Deal Done  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.'s $32 billion merger with Minneapolis' Norwest
Corp took effect yesterday, as the second of San Francisco's two
historic financial institutions was swept away in the merger wave
rolling through the banking industry.
<P>
   The combined institution, the nation's seventh-largest bank, is
keeping the Wells Fargo name and maintaining its headquarters in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hazen, Wells Fargo's top executive, remains chairman. But
he ceded the chief executive post, and effective control of the
bank, to Norwest Chief Executive Richard Kovacevich.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction took the form of a Norwest acquisition of Wells
Fargo, with stockholders of the California bank receiving 10
Norwest shares for each share they hold. The bank uses Wells
Fargo's WFC stock symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Finalization of this latest merger marks a sea change in
California's banking scene.
</P>
<P>
   Within the space of a few weeks, Wells Fargo and its larger
rival BankAmerica Corp. have disappeared as independent
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's largest banks raced to set up sprawling
multistate operations, bigger in scale than all but a handful of
existing banks, both Wells Fargo and BofA feared they would be left
behind. To remain competitive, they chose to merge with powerful
out-of-state institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite proclaiming their transactions ``mergers of equals,''
both banks agreed to be junior partners in what in fact were
corporate takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the new owner took the name of its California
partner, but the similarities end there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the headquarters remains in our city really
changes the dynamic,'' said San Francisco Supervisor Michael Yaki,
a critic of the BofA merger. ``We have a much higher comfort level
with Wells.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences in large measure reflect the buyers' sharply
different styles.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts describe BofA's new owner, North Carolina's NationsBank
Corp., and its CEO Hugh McColl as brutally effective acquirers.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank quickly flexed its muscle, appropriating key jobs,
including the top California retail banking position, for its own
people. It blamed the old BofA for investment and trading losses,
and sacked the bank's CEO David Coulter days after the merger took
effect.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Norwest is viewed as a more benevolent owner that
is trying to win over _ and not run over _ its new people. Analysts
described Kovacevich as a motivator who sees his prime task as
keeping the salesmanship and enthusiasm of employees at a high
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first acts of the combined bank was to announce
awards of 200 stock options to all of its more than 100,000
full-and part-time employees. Holders can exercise the options
withing five years if the combined bank's stock rises above $70 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank's stock closed yesterday unchanged at $37.19.
Still, there's no doubt who's in charge, as evidenced by
announcements of the departures last month of three of Wells
Fargo's top executives, including chief credit officer Michael
Gillfillan.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, many employees will lose their jobs. Analysts
estimated the new bank would cut several thousand jobs, including
roughly 1,300 in San Francisco and 800 in Minneapolis as duplicate
headquarters functions are closed.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest veteran Larry Haeg, top spokesman for the combined bank,
said he didn't know how many jobs would disappear. Cuts would take
place over two years, he said, during which time the bank will
carry out a ``retain and retrain'' program to find new positions
for displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a slash-and-burn merger,'' Haeg said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the thorniest issue at the new Wells Fargo is how to
combine the two banks' distinct cultures and business strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The old Wells Fargo thrived by being leaner and meaner than
rivals. It cut back traditional branches and personal service in
favor of cheaper, automated ways of handling customers, such as
ATMs, telephone and Internet banking.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Norwest emphasizes sales and service more than
efficiency on the principle that adding revenue is more profitable
than slashing overhead. It views its traditional branches, which it
prefers to call ``stores,'' as its main outlet for reaching
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest ``runs a people-driven business where the focus is on
revenue,'' said Jay Tejera, a Minneapolis-based analyst with the
brokerage Dain Rauscher.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo employees may benefit as the bank shifts to the
Norwest business model, Tejera said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having to do more with less, they may find they
have more resources to do their job,'' he said.  &LR;

 Century of National Geographic maps unfold on the PC  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Once in a while, a piece of software comes along that really
underscores the power of the personal computer in a refreshing way.
National Geographic Maps is such a program.
<P>
   It's a collection of eight CD-ROMs containing every foldout map
in the 109-year history of National Geographic magazine _ more than
500 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Published by Mindscape, the Novato division of the Learning Co.,
it carries a list price of $79.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the significance of National Geographic Maps, it
helps to know a little history. The National Geographic Society
probably has done more to further the science ( &LR; and art) &LR;  of
mapmaking than anyone this century.
</P>
<P>
   Maps accompanying National Geographic magazines have played
significant roles far beyond the pleasure they have given readers.
A 1944 map, Germany and Its Approaches, served as a key reference
for Allied troops on their march to Berlin, and Winston Churchill
used it as his official briefing map. Today, a copy hangs on the
wall of the historic War Rooms below Whitehall in London.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1969, at the height of the space race, National
Geographic brought out the first map showing the entire lunar
surface on a single piece of paper, including the dark side, which
had been viewed for the first time only recently by astronauts
circling the moon.
</P>
<P>
   A map appearing in November 1988 was touted as the most accurate
and detailed relief rendering ever made of Mount Everest. A
multinational team created the map using satellite images and
photographs taken from a special jet that flew over the towering
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Many National Geographic maps, depicting geography, history and
natural science, have become standard teaching tools in schools
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Creating National Geographic Maps posed both technological and
practical problems. Many of the older maps _ the oldest, depicting
the Ashville, N.C., area, dates from 1889 _ were in poor shape. Yet
they had to be transported from the National Geographic Society's
archives in Washington, D.C., to Kansas, where they were digitized
using large flatbed scanners. To ensure their safety, they were
carried in special wooden crates.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge was in creating a search engine so users could
look for specific maps by keywords, geographic location or theme.
To accomplish this, the Society's cartographers created a system of
coordinates known as a bingo grid. They then identified major
locations on maps, assigned number and letter coordinates to them
and indexed them so they could be searched. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The result is a product that preserves the beauty of the
original maps while going beyond them, bringing the power of the PC
to bear on what once were just pieces of paper. With National
Geographic Maps you can zoom in through a number of levels of
magnification and pan around a map to pinpoint an area of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The only major drawback is the size of the average PC monitor,
which cannot encompass most of the original maps. But you can print
out any map at its normal size using a technique that divides the
map into sections, each one taking up a standard piece of printer
paper. You have to put the sections together to get a complete map.
If you have a printer capable of photographic quality, your printed
map will rival the original.
</P>
<P>
   Also frustrating is the large number of CDs. They are divided
according to type of map _ history, geography, environment. But you
can't browse the contents of each disc. You're stuck using the
search engine, which tells you which disc contains the maps you're
looking for. Fortunately, you can use the search engine without
changing discs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Even more discs would have been required but for some clever
compression technology that shrinks a 200-megabyte map down to just
7 MB.
</P>
<P>
   Mindscape officials said that if the program is a financial
success, the company will put it on DVD, just as it has done with
its collection of National Geographic magazines. That would shrink
the number of discs to just two.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic Maps includes multimedia tours of nine
topics, including space and peoples of the past. And there are
features about milestones in mapping history, as well as milestones
for National Geographic.

 Gap Fills In Web Presence, Plans 2 New Online Shops  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Just in time for the holidays, San Francisco's Gap Inc. is upping
its investment in the World Wide Web by adding two new digital
stores and launching its first television commercials devoted to
online sales.
<P>
   The ventures _ sales and information sites for babyGap
 &LR; (www.babygap.com &LR; ) and GapKids ( &LR; www.gapkids.com &LR; ) _ represent a
bigger commitment to Web commerce by the country's largest
specialty retailer even as Web analysts predict a doubling of
online sales this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released yesterday, Jupiter Communications forecast
sales of $2.3 billion on the Web this November and December, up
from an estimated $1.1 billion in 1997's holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel, once thought to be the least-popular commodity to be
sold via the Web, is one of the top growth areas this year, along
with toys and consumer electronics, said Nicole Vanderbilt, a
Jupiter analyst who expects apparel sales to more than triple this
year to about $70 million from $18 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gap, which already operates a sales and information site for its
main chain of adult stores ( &LR; www.gap.com &LR; ) is ``making a real
commitment to (Web retailing),'' said Marcia Aaron, an analyst in
the San Francisco office of Bankers Trust New York.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Gap's Web sales, which it refuses to disclose,
are certainly a tiny percentage of the company's total. But ``if we
didn't think it was a viable part of our future, we wouldn't do
it,'' said Michael McCadden, executive vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Gap launched Gap.com in December 1996 and started taking orders
last November. GapKids.com went up in March 1997 but was not
``commerce-enabled'' until yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``What we really wanted to do was find out the tricks of
navigation for one online store and find out what (our customers)
want before we went full tilt'' with multiple sites, McCadden said.
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, Gap launched its first Web-oriented TV ads, in
San Francisco and Chicago, which carry the tag line
``surf.shop.ship.'' Signs bearing the same tag line were posted in
the windows of Gap's 1,500 domestic stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company will monitor its Web visits from the two test cities
during the next month to determine whether the ads are effective in
driving people to its sites, McCadden said. He declined to release
the cost of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gap has been laying groundwork for its Web business with outdoor
ads featuring made-up words like ``Webology'' and ``Geektronica''
that have appeared on billboards since September.
</P>
<P>
   The company's goal on the Web is to facilitate spending by
making the process as easy as possible, said McCadden.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers can order merchandise on all three sites and pay for it
in one order. Unlike most Web businesses, which cannot ship
merchandise bought in a single transaction to multiple addresses,
orders can be sent to as many as three different addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Gap will evaluate the performance of its Web sites through
Christmas before deciding whether to put its Old Navy and Banana
Republic stores online, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next logical step _ Web sales to customers outside the
United States _ is still down the road, said McCadden. ``You have
to have a system set up to mail and track packages around the
world. We want to get the first steps of the process really solid
before we take on the rest of the world,'' he said.

 This Election Night, the Internet Could Turn Out to Be a
Big  Winner  By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
When the votes are counted tonight, some of the most anxious
spectators will be the Harris pollsters who hope to make election
history by predicting 32 races based on surveys of Internet users.
<P>
   Currently, the vast majority of scientific polls are done by
phone. The whole polling industry will be waiting to see whether a
Harris poll released yesterday can accurately call Senate and
gubernatorial elections in 16 states, including California, based
on responses to surveys done by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been skeptical because we're not sure Internet users are
representative of the general populace,'' said Mark DiCamillo, who
runs California's Field Poll. ``But if their methods are
successful, it would open up a new frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern polling began in 1936. The key character, said University
of Rochester political scientist Richard Niemi, was a social
scientist by the name of George Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup then was a young maverick who believed that a few hundred
people, sampled at random, could predict election outcomes more
accurately than the millions of people who responded to the mass
surveys of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In that era, newspapers and magazines asked their readers to
mail in survey forms. The most prestigious mass survey was
conducted by a magazine called Literary Digest. In 1936, 2 million
Digest readers picked Alf Landon as the next president of the
United States. When Gallup's sample picked Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, it put scientific polling on the map.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 40 years, scientific polling was a door-to-door
affair. Pollsters choose neighborhoods that represented the income,
racial and age characteristics of voters. Then they knocked on,
say, every other door in a neighborhood and asked questions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, social scientists began experimenting
with phone surveys. In retrospect, phone surveys seem like a
no-brainer because they were cheaper and faster than face-to-face
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the conservative nature of pollsters, it took more
than a decade for the phone to replace face-to-face surveys. ``When
I first came to work for Merv Field in 1978, he sent me door to
door in the Marina district,'' DiCamillo recalled.
</P>
<P>
   University of California at Santa Barbara political scientist
Bruce Bimber said phone surveys ultimately triumphed because they
provide pollsters with a universe in which almost everyone from the
Archie Bunkers to the Murphy Browns stand an equal chance of being
selected in a random sample.
</P>
<P>
   Forget picking numbers from a phone book. Pollsters generate
numbers using computer programs that contain every area code and
prefix. The programs add the last four digits randomly, so people
with unlisted numbers can get called.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central problem with Internet surveys is that there is no
way to randomly identify people,'' Bimber said.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that only 40 percent of U.S. adults have
Internet access. By comparison, more than 90 percent of U.S.
households have phones.
</P>
<P>
   George Terhanian, director of Internet research at Harris, said
his company thinks that it can work around these shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Terhanian believes that Internet users are more like the U.S.
populace than generally is understood. Since 1995, he's tracked
Internet use through the Harris Poll. Each month, Harris phones a
random sample of Americans to ask questions about everyday life.
These polls show that women are online almost as much as men and
that 11 percent of blacks have Internet access, close to their 13
percent share of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Internet users represent all Americans, Terhanian knows
he can't get a random sample because there is no central directory
of Net users.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's built a database of 1.3 million Internet users.
Most are people who entered online sweepstakes sponsored by
Matchlogic, an Internet startup recently acquired by Excite.
</P>
<P>
   These people have agreed to answer political surveys by e-mail
and have provided information about their age, income, state of
residence.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 80,000 Net users in California volunteered to
participate in the Harris Poll. Terhanian selected 5,375 of them,
chosen to reflect the state's populace, as his survey group. His
theory is that if his Internet sample is weighted to represent the
state's populace, his predictions will be as accurate as phone
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his Internet sample, Harris predicted yesterday that
Gray Davis will trounce Dan Lungren in the governor's race by a
ration of 53 percent to 42 percent, while incumbent Barbara Boxer
will squeak past challenger Matt Fong, 48 to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   You can see his predictions for the other 30 races at
 &LR; www.harrisblackintl.com/electionpollresults/ &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   After the election, Harris will turn its data over to the
Unversity of Rochester so that social scientists can dissect the
results. ``We're trying to advance the state of the science,''
Terhanian said.
</P>
<P>
   Given how long it took for phones to replace face-to-face
polling, no one expects Internet surveys to become standard
overnight, even if Harris scores 100 percent with its Internet
picks.
</P>
<P>
   But cost and speed favor the Net. It takes six days and $50,000
for Field to do a telephone poll. E-mail surveys could be done
overnight and for a fraction of the cost, DiCamillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Terhanian is confident that the question is when,
not if, the Internet will replace the phone as the pollster's tool
of choice.
</P>

 FDA OKs Transplant Drug From Menlo Park's SangStat  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A Menlo Park biotech firm has received permission to start selling
the first generic form of cyclosporine, the drug that kidney, lung
and heart transplant patients must take twice a day to live with
their donated organs.
<P>
   SangStat Medical Corp. said yesterday the Food and Drug
Administration has rated its cyclosporine drug, called SangCya, as
the functional equivalent of Neoral, the drug now used by most of
the 140,000 transplant patients in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That FDA approval means SangStat can attack the
$500-million-a-year market for Neoral, which is made by the Swiss
firm Novartis. SangStat said it plans to start shipping SangCya
within the month.
</P>
<P>
   SangStat CEO Philippe Pouletty said his firm will price SangCya
about 20 percent below Neoral to take advantage of the fact that
insurers favor lower-cost generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients can be switched from Neoral to SangCya with no new
prescription,'' Pouletty said.
</P>
<P>
   Transplant patients must take up to nine different drugs a day,
every day, for the rest of their lives to prevent their own immune
systems from attacking the transplant. Cyclosporine is the most
important _ and costly _ of these drugs, currently running above
$6,000 per patient, per year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its price advantage, SangStat hopes to win over
transplant physicians by giving patients a handheld device that
will tell them when to take their twice-daily doses of SangCya and
record it if they do.
</P>
<P>
   Pouletty said 15 to 25 percent of all patients fail to keep
their drug regime, leading their bodies to reject the transplant.
He said Novartis does not have a similar dispensing and recording
device for Neoral.
</P>
<P>
   David Buck, a financial analyst with Sands Brothers &AMP; Co. in New
York, said the FDA approval of SangCya was expected and somewhat
overdue. It represents the first big revenue opportunity for
SangStat, which was founded in 1989 and went public in 1993 on the
promise of future remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approval is a positive catalyst for the company and its
stock,'' said Buck, who had a buy rating out on SangStat,
anticipating FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   SangStat closed yesterday at $21.63, up 88 cents before the FDA
news was released. The stock hit a 52-week high of $41.38 in
December.
</P>
<P>
   In February, SangStat applied for approval to sell SangCya in
Europe, where Novartis currently sells the only approved form of
cyclosporine. That application is pending.

REPORT: SEPTEMBER BUYING SURPASSES EARNINGS; SAVINGS AT RECORD LOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the first time in nearly 40 years, consumers
in September spent more than they earned, pushing the national
savings rate to its lowest level on record.
</P>
<P>
   But in the real world of grocery bills, mortgage payments and a
looming holiday season, the change was so slight few consumers
seemed aware that they'd played a part in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I had to renew my homeowners' insurance,'' said Gregg
Zuckerman, owner of Anna-Bella Designs, a women's clothing
manufacturer and boutique chain based in suburban Northridge. ``But
business wasn't especially bad or especially good. It was just one
of those months.''
</P>
<P>
   According to figures compiled by the U.S. Commerce Department,
personal incomes before taxes rose 0.2 percent in September, for a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $7.17 trillion. That's the
smallest increase since November 1994. After-tax, disposable income
also rose 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, spending grew a hearty 0.5 percent. The
combination made for a savings rate, or savings as a percentage of
disposable income, of negative 0.2 percent, the lowest since the
Commerce Department began tracking monthly rates in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say that while the low figure reflects an economy on
the edge, it's better that consumers spent in September than if
they had socked their money away. After all, they note, U.S.
consumers generate two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need the consumer to be spending,'' said Don Hilber, an
economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. ``They're pulling the
economy forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if income and job growth continue to fall, eventually
that likely could spook consumers away from purchases of big-ticket
items such as cars, washing machines and computers, further slowing
the economy. Indeed, sales of durable goods led the recent spending
increase, rising 2 percent, compared to September gains of 0.1
percent and 0.5 percent for nondurable goods and services,
respectively. How long such a confidence-eroding process would take
is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no precedent for what we're into now. We've never had
an extended period of time where we'd gotten to this low a level
and managed to stay there,'' Hilber said.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists argue that an anomaly related to the delayed
opening of thousands of schools in September skewed Monday's jobs
figures, and that the real savings rate was likely higher than what
was reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were clearly special factors in September that
suppressed the hours worked and the hourly earnings in the payroll
report,'' said David Orr, an economist at First Union in Charlotte,
N.C., told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   But even at a 0 percent rate, consumers are at best treading
water, Hilber said. ``It doesn't leave much room for out-of-savings
spending, which has been fueling the economy for the last couple of
years. There's no buffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Monday's grim spending news was word from the National
Association of Purchasing Managers that manufacturing activity in
October slowed for the fifth month in a row. The group's monthly
index dropped to 48.3 percent from 49.4 percent in September. A
reading under 50 percent reflects industrial contraction.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the weakness that Monday's reports reflect, stocks rose
sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 114 points
to close at 8,706.

D'AMATO AND SCHUMER END SENATE CAMPAIGNS ON HIGH, HOARSE NOTES

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With one last burst of spending and one final
intervention by the White House, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep.
Charles Schumer ended one of the most competitive and expensive
political races in the nation this year, with D'Amato pleading with
New Yorkers to re-elect him because ``Al D'Amato delivers,'' and
Schumer proclaiming himself ``on the verge of an historic
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   From Buffalo to Brooklyn to Mineola, D'Amato and Schumer _ both
looking a little fatigued and sounding a bit hoarse _ campaigned on
the kind of appeals that they hoped would close the political sale
with any wavering voters. And they were joined by the kind of
political celebrities who they hoped would motivate supporters to
actually vote Tuesday, as they urged at stop after stop.
</P>
<P>
   For Schumer, it was Hillary Rodham Clinton, flying to New York
for a fourth time during this campaign in a last-minute visit that
left no doubt that the White House considered unseating the
incumbent Republican senator among its highest political goals of
1998. Schumer was among a small handful of candidates who got this
much White House attention during the general election season, with
two visits by President Clinton, two by Vice President Al Gore and
four by Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato countered with a stable of celebrities, including two of
New York's more popular personalities _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
one of his predecessors, Ed Koch _ and a person who was a star from
his first campaign in 1980: his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will win,'' Antoinette D'Amato predicted Monday at the
Polish Community Center in Yonkers, peering over the top of a
lectern. ``Why? Because he is a good senator, he helps everyone in
this state!''
</P>
<P>
   Across the state, at street corners and union meeting halls and
in television studios, the three-term Republican senator and his
Democratic challenger were met with a crush of television cameras,
so intense that in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, for example, it made
it impossible for Giuliani, Koch or D'Amato to do much meeting and
greeting of voters.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of attention paid to the tempestuous Senate race on
its final day almost obscured the fact that there are, in fact,
other elections taking place in New York Tuesday. Among them are
contests for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and
comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   In the views of most politicians and late campaign polls, Gov.
George Pataki is well positioned as he seeks a second term against
Democratic challenger Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council
Speaker, and others.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, after waging a campaign that attacked Schumer for being
too liberal, too parochial and for missing votes, returned to what
has been the bedrock theme of his 18 years as New York's junior
senator. In a series of brief speeches, the senator asked voters to
re-elect him because he has tirelessly advocated the state's
interests in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato delivers,'' the senator said. ``I do it every day.
And I never stop fighting for New Yorkers. And if they want to have
somebody in the majority who is going to fight for them, make a
difference for them, it's Al D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   As D'Amato spoke to an audience of 300 at his campaign-ending
event _ a rally on the steps of the Nassau County Courthouse in
Mineola _ the sound system went dead.
</P>
<P>
   There were moans and disappointed shouts from the crowd. D'Amato
tried to speak without amplification, but at the end of the
campaign, his voice could not be heard from 10 feet away. The
audience, including more than a few friends who have known him
through three decades in New York politics, began shouting words of
encouragement _ ``We love you, Al!''
</P>
<P>
   Then Pataki spoke, with the help of a rigged portable
loudspeaker, and included words of praise for his political patron:
``Let me make one critical point: None of this would have happened
if we didn't have in Washington the greatest United States Senator
...''
</P>
<P>
   Then the sound system gave out again.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato campaigned in New York City and the suburbs. He did not,
unexpectedly, campaign upstate, the part of New York where he has
been most popular and which would be most likely to carry him to a
fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer campaigned from one end of the state and back again _
and then back again, impulsively deciding last night to fly back to
western New York for one more rally. He turned up at the American
Legion Hall in West Seneca, N.Y., for a final campaign rally in a
part of a state where the Brooklyn lawmaker has always been
considered weak by analysts assessing his prospects for unseating
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our last stop of this entire campaign,'' Schumer told
asbestos workers and other union members at the hall just outside
of Buffalo. ``And I wanted to be in Western New York to show the
people of Western New York how much I care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now in first place, and the momentum is on our side,''
he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Polls actually show the race to be a virtual dead heat. The
outcome could be decided by the fewer than 75,000 absentee ballots
that were returned to state election officials by midafternoon
Monday. And those officials are taking unusual steps _ including
having the unopened ballots impounded by the police _ to insure
that this year's paper votes are counted fairly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said
he was unaware of a statewide contest whose outcome was reversed
once the paper ballots were counted. Absentee ballots usually
account for only 3 percent of the total vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Daghlian added that this Senate race was as good a candidate
as any for such a turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's calling for a very close election, so it could
make a big difference,'' he said. ``If your margin on the voting
machines is about the same or less than the number of absentee
ballots that are out, it's going to be very meaningful.''

 (editors: changes `Intranet' to `Internet' in last graph.)   New Browsers Offer Excellent Online Security 
 &HT;     
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
What's the true status with online security these days? Is it good
enough so I don't have to worry about giving my credit card number
online?
<P>
   A: Shopping on the Internet has always been at least as safe as
giving your credit card number over the phone to somebody you don't
know. And the latest encryption technology makes it extremely safe.
</P>
<P>
   Most shopping sites alert you with a warning box when you enter
a secure area to order a product. In addition, you'll see a closed
padlock on the status bar in newer versions of the Netscape and
Microsoft browsers, assuring you that your connection is secure.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean, however, that you can't get fleeced on the
Web. The wisest course is to shop with companies that have solid
reputations for reliability.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you're on America Online, you can shop with total
peace of mind, because AOL guarantees security when you buy from
its certified merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Help. My dad was fooling around on my computer and
accidentally reduced Windows Explorer from two viewing panes to
one. Now when I open the Explorer in Windows 98, I can only see the
file tree. When I double-click a folder to open it, I hear the
opening sound but nothing is displayed. Any suggestions for a
solution?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's what you get for letting dad mess with your PC. He
probably shrank the Windows Explorer window by using the mouse to
drag a side border of the window inward. When you do that (whether
you drag the left or right border), the window shrinks from its
right side, hiding the pane that shows the contents of folders. And
as you've discovered, once the window is shrunk, it stays that way
even if you reboot the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've scared you, here's an easy way to restore Windows
Explorer to its original size, and restore harmony to your family.
Just drag either the left or right border outward until you can
view both panes again.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Your dad may have inadvertently shrunk the window while
trying to drag it out of the way of something else on the screen.
Tell him that to move a window, you should drag it from the blue
border on the top.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to print out a sample of all the fonts
available to me on my computer? I'm running Windows 98 with
Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   A: A number of programs available on the Internet do exactly
what you're talking about. Two that I like are ListFonts, which is
free, and Win32 Font Lister, which you can try for free, and buy
for $5 if you like it. Both programs can easily print out a list of
all your fonts in any type size you wish. You can find them in
ZDNet's software library at www.hotfiles.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've pretty much cleansed Windows 95 of Internet Explorer so
I can use Netscape Communicator unimpeded. My son recently acquired
a new computer with Windows 98 pre-installed. We wonder if it is
safe to attempt the same procedure with Win98, or is Internet
Explorer so intricate and deeply embedded that it would disable
Win98 to remove it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, Charlie. Internet Explorer is sunk into Windows 98
like Excalibur into the stone. According to Microsoft's own online
support library, ``Explorer is an integrated part of the operating
system and cannot be removed from Windows 98.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMAC UPDATE:  &LR; A couple of weeks ago, I gave some
recommendations for ways to transfer files from Macintoshes to the
new iMac _ which for some reason known only to Steve Jobs doesn't
have a floppy disk drive. Alternatives I suggested including using
an Ethernet connection, or transferring between modems. I also gave
the address for a Web site called FreeDrive (www.freedrive.com)
that lets you upload files from your Mac to the Web, then download
them to your iMac _ sort of like a virtual disk drive.
</P>
<P>
   A reader alerted me to another site, iMacFloppy.com
(www.imacfloppy.com) that does the same thing. Both sites are free
and can be used to store data as well as transfer it.
</P>
<P>
   And here's yet another option. Send files to yourself as e-mail
attachments using your Mac, then use your iMac to read the mail and
download the files.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Searching the Internet can be frustrating, because simple search
words can turn up millions of results. For more precision, use the
advanced searching options that most of the major search engines
offer. Some engines have special forms for advanced searching, and
they all support Boolean logic, which lets you use words like
``and'' and ``not'' to narrow a search.

NASCAR CHANGE AIMS FOR SIDE-BY-SIDE RACING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR officials yesterday implemented aerodynamic modifications
that effectively eliminate the ``5-and-5 Rule'' for all makes of
Winston Cup cars competing in Sunday's season-ending NAPA 500.
</P>
<P>
   Modifications to the rear spoiler and front air dams will be in
effect when qualifying at the 1.5-mile Atlanta Motor Speedway in
Hampton, Ga., begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR implemented the ``5-and-5 Rule'' at the start of the
season to make cars less stable through the corners and
theoretically force drivers to slow. The rule was expected to
promote side-by-side racing, but it has had the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make the cars more stable,'' said Larry McClure,
owner of the No. 4 Kodak Chevy driven by Bobby Hamilton. ``It will
bring side-by-side racing back into the sport. It will get rid of
some of these boring races. NASCAR needed to do this, and I'm sure
glad they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chevrolet Monte Carlo will run with a rear spoiler height of
6.50 inches (up from 5 inches) and a 57-inch width. Rear spoilers
on the Pontiac Grand Prix will be 6.875-inches high (up from 5.375
inches) and 57-inches wide. The Ford Taurus will maintain a rear
spoiler of 6.25-inches (up from 4.75 inches) and 55-inch width. Any
team running a Ford Thunderbird will do so with a rear spoiler
height of 6 inches (up from 4.50) and 55 inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   All models must run with a minimum spoiler angle of 65 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Front air dams on all cars will have a 3.50-inch ground
clearance, a reduction of 1.50 inches on Chevys and Fords and a
1.125-inch reduction for Pontiacs.

   LOS ANGELES _ The Bruins should be more concerned with their own
mess than the BCS. Bowl Championship Series rankings and Fiesta
Bowl invitations won't matter unless UCLA corrects its egregious
plays from Saturday's narrow victory over Stanford. There were
simply too many:
</P>
<P>
   __ Missed field goals. Chris Sailer's attempts from 53 and 50
yards were blocked, although protection was not the only problem.
Sailer, recovering from a strained right groin, had low trajectory
on both kicks. He has made 3 of 10 field goals this season, none
longer than 41 yards.
</P>
<P>
   __ Red-zone interceptions. Quarterback Cade McNown threw two
interceptions in a four-play sequence; both came deep in Stanford
territory. In the last three games, McNown has thrown four
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   __ Third-down deficiency. The Bruins converted only 4 of 12
third down chances, while Stanford succeeded on 11 of 18 attempts.
Several were longer than 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   __ Penalties, penalties, penalties. The Bruins committed 12 for
125 yards, many stalling or squashing scoring drives. They had a
touchdown called back because of a holding call on guard Jim
Ghezzi. Guard Andy Meyers received an unsportsmanlike penalty. Even
mild-mannered freshman DeShaun Foster lost his cool, throwing the
ball at a Cardinal defender after scoring the go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalties are killing us, and if we don't straighten it
out, it'll be catastrophic,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Left out:!off! Left guard is another problem, although
not as easily corrected as a penalty. Ghezzi, a transfer from
Glendale College, and sophomore Oscar Cabrera have shared playing
time since Cabrera's return last month from a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our Achilles' heel,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``Oscar's
our best physically, but he's a sophomore.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Josh Webb did not play because of a sprained shoulder
and is doubtful for Saturday's game at Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lewis update: X-rays on starting tailback Jermaine Lewis'
bruised right calf were negative. He is questionable for Saturday's
game at Oregon State on the Pac-10's worst AstroTurf.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was injured on the second series of the Stanford game.
Keith Brown played the rest of the first half and most of the third
quarter. When he grew fatigued, the Bruins inserted Foster, who had
not played in two weeks because of a sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's medical staff cleared Foster for action, but the knee is
not 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still unstable,'' Toledo said. ``I don't know if it'll be
100 percent the rest of the year because he'll get banged up.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Best in the West?: After facing UCLA and Arizona in the past
three weeks, Oregon coach Mike Bellotti favors the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right now, obviously, (Arizona is) the better team,''
Bellotti told reporters after a 38-3 loss to the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   __ Short stuff: Tight end Mike Grieb, safety Larry Atkins and
Tod McBride (special teams) were named UCLA's players of the game.
McBride blocked a punt, his second of the season; Atkins forced one
fumble and recovered two and Grieb had two catches. Joining McNown
and Atkins as captains this week are Meyers and fullback Craig
Walendy.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game at Oregon State will be shown on Fox Sports
West.
</P>
<P>
   Kickoffs for the Washington and USC games, Nov.14 and 21,
respectively, are set for 12:30 p.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a campaign season that lacked any raging
national issue greater than President Clinton's tribulations,
Americans are expected to trickle, if not stream, to the polls on
Tuesday in a midterm election that will inevitably be interpreted
as a referendum on the fate of the President.
</P>
<P>
   In election eve dashes around the country, Democrats and
Republicans sought to disprove forecasts that less than 40 percent
of eligible voters will participate. They implored voters to take
part in an election where the outcome of many important _ and
excruciatingly close _ races could hinge on a very small number of
votes. In fact, analysts predicted that of the millions of people
expected to go to the polls, the decisions of only about 200,000
people in 50 competitive House contests could make a 15-seat
difference.
</P>
<P>
   While the reverberations over Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky have not openly figured as a consequential issue on the
campaign trail _ and voters in both parties tell pollsters they
want to put the scandal behind them _Republicans and Democrats
alike agreed that the outcome cannot help but guide the House's
approach in its impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome also could affect the fate of Speaker Newt Gingrich;
conservatives in his party have warned that if the performance of
Republican House candidates is less than impressive, they may blame
it on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's fate is on the line and Gingrich's fate is on the
line,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Both politicians devoted the closing hours of the elections to
imploring their loyalists to vote. ``These races are very, very
close,'' Clinton said on Monday in a radio interview with Hispanic
reporters. ``There are almost three dozen close House races that
could go one way or the other,'' he said. ``There are seven close
Senate races that could go one way or the other. And we need a
strong turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, at a rally in Roswell, Ga., Gingrich said it
had been ``a great campaign'' for his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tomorrow we have a chance to win some very startling
victories all over the country,'' he declared, sarcastically
heaping praise on the president: ``Bill Clinton's contribution to
the demise of the Democratic majority has been significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Republican and Democratic strategists held firm with
predictions of modest Republican gains in the House, where all 435
seats are up for grabs, though a few pointed to recent surveys that
they said suggested that Democrats could gain seats. The
strategists also said they anticipated a Republican gain of no more
than a few seats in the Senate, and predicted that there would not
be an appreciable shift in the Republicans' domination of
governor's offices in the 36 gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
   Still, politicians and analysts in both parties noted that there
had been no obvious tide favoring Republicans or Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more uncertain now than '94 or '96 _ I'm a lot less
comfortable with predictions,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of a
nonpartisan newsletter that tracks races nationwide, as he pored
over the latest polls. ``I'm almost expecting a few major
surprises.'' But echoing other experts, he added, ``The most likely
outcome in the House is low to mid-single digit gains for the
Republicans and in the Senate, a Republican net gain of two or
three'' seats.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, the president's party has never gained seats
in the House in midterm elections; on only three occasions has it
won seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   While for months, much of the attention in the campaign of 1998
has centered on House races, in the closing days some of the most
dramatic contests have been for the Senate. Incumbent senators who
are in particular trouble are Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois and
Harry Reid of Nevada, both Democrats, and Alfonse D'Amato of New
York and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, predicted that turnout would be between 36
percent and 38 percent of eligible voters, a decline from the 38.8
percent who voted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But, noting that this campaign's subtext is ``the possible
removal of a president,'' Gans offered a caveat. ``Anyone in this
climate who would venture a hard prediction about either turnout or
result,'' he said, ``has a degree of hubris that will probably
suffer its comeuppance on Election Day.''

<P>
   The scrambling for votes on Monday capped a campaign season that
has been anything but predictable. Month after month, candidates on
both sides waited anxiously to see what impact the White House
scandal would have on their fates. But even on the eve of the
election, the answer was not entirely clear.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the year, it appeared to be an incumbent's
political season because voters seemed relatively content.
Certainly, they were not riven by the restlessness and
dissatisfaction that drove the midterm season four years ago _ and
led to the historic Republican takeover of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Because Republicans hold only a slim 11-seat advantage in the
House, many Democrats triumphantly predicted that they would take
back the House. Early this year, the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee put out a thick book of maps and statistics.
``These factors demonstrate the momentum needed to put Democrats
back in charge of the House of Representatives,'' the booklet said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-ELECT-RDP-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: booklet said. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many of the most optimistic Democrats stopped talking up a
Democratic triumph after Clinton admitted in late August that he
had had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and had
misled the public about it. And many of the party's candidates
complained that they could not capture any attention on their
issues _ from education to health care to protecting Social
Security _ because the press was preoccupied with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans who had gleefully predicted that the Lewinsky
matter was their ticket to huge victories have also scaled back
their expectations in the face of polls showing that voters do not
care to hear more about the scandal _ and may even blame
Republicans for trying to keep it alive.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that on the eve of the election, the dynamic may
be not so different from what it was 10 months ago: Voters do not
seem to want massive change. Races are being fought over local
issues. And many incumbents seem safe. In a contrast with the
election of 1994 _ an anti-incumbent year _ many lawmakers
highlighted their backgrounds as Washington insiders who knew how
to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the outcome, it is bound to influence how the Congress
handles the impeachment inquiry. ``If Democrats either hold their
own or pick up a few seats you could make the argument that voters,
through their inaction, said, `I don't want to deal with that
issue; leave it alone,''' said John Hutchens, a Democratic
strategist in Denver. ``If Republicans are much stronger than we
are anticipating right now, it would probably provide some real
momentum for those hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Brookover, political director of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, which channeled millions of dollars into
recent commercials in districts across the country to remind voters
of the Lewinsky matter, said, ``I still think that our voters are
turning out to send him a message. They don't like what he's done
and how he's conducted himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing Democrats who contend there will be a backlash
against the Clinton advertisements, Brookover said, ``We're not
having candidates screaming to take them off the air.'' At the
request of Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, Brookover said the
committee today began broadcasting one of the scandal commercials
in Portland, Maine, to help Ross Connelly, a Republican who is
trying to oust Rep. Tom Allen, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said an unimpressive showing for their party's
candidates could damage Gingrich. Already, officials of the
Republican Governors Association, which is meeting in New Orleans
after the election, has scheduled an unusual meeting with party
officials around the country and major donors _ congressional
leaders are not invited _ to decide how the party might be better
defined by politicians outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans don't do as well as either the political
class or the Republican base thought they should have,'' Reed said,
``it could accelerate the search for leadership outside
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   While national polls are not reliable indicators of how
candidates will perform in local races, several new polls on Monday
reinforced the impression of an evenly-matched competition between
both parties. The Gallup Organization polled 1,105 registered
voters Thursday through Sunday for CNN and found 49 percent
supporting Democratic candidates and 45 percent for Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center polled 743 voters from Wednesday through
Saturday and found 46 percent for Democratic candidates and 44
percent for Republicans. Another poll by CBS News of 509 voters on
Saturday and Sunday found 49 percent supporting Democrats and 48
percent for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And a poll by ABC News taken Thursday through Sunday, with 1,070
voters, found 49 percent preferring Democratic candidates and 46
percent preferring Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The results of each of the polls are within the margin of
sampling error.

<P>
   As the first head coach of the Houston Oilers, Lou Rymkus won
the inaugural American Football League championship. He was the
first AFL Coach of the Year. His .625 winning percentage is still
the best in the 39-year history of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But like a lot of Oilers coaches who followed him, Rymkus found
out that Bud Adams wasn't the easiest owner to please. Five games
into his second season, Rymkus was fired and replaced by assistant
Wally Lemm, who helped the Oilers win a second AFL title.
</P>
<P>
   Rymkus, who died Saturday at age 78 after a lengthy illness,
will be buried Wednesday. When his friends swap stories about his
legendary career as a player and coach, they will remember him as a
throwback to a time when players went both ways and played as long
as they could walk. They will use words like pride, toughness and
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known anyone who loved football as much as my
dad,'' Mike Rymkus said Monday. ``His heart was shaped like a
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad was tough but fair. He got the best out of his players. At
every level, guys who played and coached with him always told him
he was the best, and he took so much pride in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rymkus, the son of a coal miner, grew up in Chicago and became
an All-America offensive tackle at Notre Dame under Frank Leahy.
Drafted by Washington in 1943, Rymkus played one season until he
joined the Marines in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Rymkus played for the Cleveland Browns. In his
six seasons with the Browns, the 6-4, 245-pound Rymkus played both
ways, but he excelled at offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Browns coach Paul Brown called Rymkus the ``best pass protector
I've ever seen.'' Even though he went on to found the Cincinnati
Bengals, Brown never wavered in his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   As the offensive line coach in Green Bay (1954-57) under Lisle
Blackbourn, Rymkus helped develop such linemen as Forrest Gregg and
Jim Ringo for Blackbourn's replacement, Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   Rymkus was coaching the Rams' offensive line when Adams hired
him on Jan. 3, 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou had an impressive record as a player and coach, and he was
just the kind of guy I was looking for,'' Adams said Monday. ``Lou
was hard-nosed and outgoing. He demanded a lot from his players,
but he demanded a lot from himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou will always be an important part of our history. Our
thoughts and prayers go out to his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Rymkus' first Oilers team included such players as George
Blanda, Billy Cannon, Charlie Hennigan, Bill Groman, Bob Talamini,
Charlie Milstead, Al Jamison, Orville Trask and Jim Norton. They
helped the Oilers win the first two AFL championship games and play
in a third in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Rymkus returned to the Oilers as offensive line coach
at the request of Sammy Baugh. Baugh had been the head coach in
1964, and he stepped aside for Bones Taylor in 1965. Baugh stayed
on to help Taylor and asked Rymkus to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad returned to the Oilers because of Sammy,'' Mike Rymkus
said. ``He told Sammy, `You know what you're asking me to do?'
Sammy told him yes, but he needed him. That's the kind of guy Dad
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football was his heart and soul right up until he died.''
</P>
<P>
   Rymkus won a Super Bowl ring in 1971 when he coached the
Baltimore Colts' offensive line when they defeated the Dallas
Cowboys.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ Major Applewhite says he misses the way his Saturdays once
were. Sort of.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He used to do one thing and one thing only on Saturdays _ watch
college football. He would watch the quarterbacks to see how they
did what they did and read the defenses to see what they were
trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   The allegiance of the Baton Rouge, La., native was to LSU (and
still is), although he always appreciated good play from good
players.
</P>
<P>
   But Applewhite doesn't get to watch much college football on
television these days. Lately, he has been going to work on
Saturdays, putting together one of the best freshman seasons ever
by a University of Texas quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a dream,'' said Applewhite, who apparently has no
plans to wake up. ``But you can't have good games unless you have
good players (around you). We've got an outstanding offensive line,
great receivers and an unbelievable running back. They make
everything happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It is just like the unassuming Applewhite to let others share in
the glory of his dream. But though he may try hard to fade into the
background, this 20-year-old has been a rather bright star in this
season's burnt-orange rhapsody.
</P>
<P>
   How good has he been?
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite has thrown at least one touchdown pass in every
start, has participated in the longest play from scrimmage in
school history (a 97-yard TD pass to Wane McGarity against
Oklahoma) and is one game shy of matching the school record for
consecutive 200-yard passing games (seven).
</P>
<P>
   He has thrown for 1,571 yards, averaging 252 yards per start,
and is a threat to break UT's freshman record of 2,341 set in 1993
by Shea Morenz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many people would have given us a chance to win with a
freshman quarterback who's never played a game in his college
career,'' said McGarity, a senior receiver. ``To come out and play
the way he's played _ with a lot of confidence, staying in there
and taking those shots, and making plays for this offense _ he's
emerged as one of the leaders on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite is 5-1 as a starter, with the loss coming in his
first start at Kansas State against quite possibly the country's
best defense. That game was the only one in which he completed less
than 50 percent of his passes, and he has been simply superb since.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a quarterback, he won a lot in high school, and I think
that's important because he expects to win when he walks out
there,'' Texas coach Mack Brown said. ``He has always been a real
football fan. He was always an Alabama fan. He was named after
Major Ogilvie, the running back at Alabama. He was raised around
LSU football, so he's seen full stadiums before. So I don't think
any of that stuff bothers him. I think it excites him.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite may get excited about playing before a full house and
throwing for more yards than any player previously in the
Texas-Oklahoma game, one of college football's most storied
rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   He may get a charge out of leading the Longhorns to a
come-from-behind win over Baylor in front of UT's largest home
crowd of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And he may even get a little pumped up about tossing a touchdown
pass to McGarity with less than three minutes remaining to give
Texas a win over Nebraska, snapping the Cornhuskers' 47-game home
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   But if he does, he doesn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never see him change his expression,'' Brown said. ``The
guys have bought into it; they have confidence in him. With that
many seniors on offense, it's really difficult for a freshman to
lead those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns, who have seven senior starters on offense, said
all the right things when Applewhite was given the starting nod
after starter Richard Walton was hurt in the second game of the
season. But they had to have questions about their new
signal-caller.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of their minds, I'm sure they were kind of like,
`Oh, boy.' But I think as things have moved along (that changed),''
Applewhite said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has scored on 40 percent of its drives with Applewhite at
the helm, logging almost as many touchdowns (28) as punts (31).
More important, he has refused to be rattled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shows a lot of maturity for a guy that's a freshman when he
messes something up,'' Brown said. ``Usually, guys pout. When he
walks off the field if he throws an interception, he doesn't look
like he just threw an interception. He'll jog off like he just hit
another pass.''
</P>
<P>
   This has not escaped his teammates' notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes a lot of mistakes, but he never gets in the tank, and
he always keeps on coming back,'' said Ricky Williams, the
Longhorns' Heisman Trophy candidate. ``So you can't really tell
when he makes a mistake. He's a winner. He's done a lot of the
right things and made a lot of big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   With three regular-season games remaining for the 6-2 Longhorns,
there could be more big plays to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a whole lot more out of myself each and every week,''
Applewhite said. ``There's some mistakes you're going to make every
week, and the thing I try to do is eliminate those week in and week
out.''
</P>
<P>
   While letting the ``freshman-as-star'' dream continue.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
JOHN Elway could very easily have quit when he was on top, and I
for one believed he should have. Since it took him 15 seasons'
worth of muggings to win a Super Bowl, the odds were rather poor
that he could go claim another title just like that.
</P>
<P>
   Elway had everything _ his health, considerable wealth, a lock
on the Hall of Fame and, finally, The Ring. Yet two words must have
kept resonating in John's head before he chose to tempt fate and
rebuckle his chin strap in the pursuit of a Roman-numeral repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell. Davis.
</P>
<P>
   How do you retire when you can keep handing the football to
Terrell Davis?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, when you look around and see Warren Moon, a starter
closing in on 42, and Steve DeBerg, a backup at 44, in uniform, you
suddenly feel more like a colt than a Bronco. So, no sir, there
would be no Kerry Collins in John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Now look. There Elway sits at the season's midpoint, no worse
for wear other than a pesky hamstring, holding the reins of an
undefeated thoroughbred. After a shaky preseason, during which
Elway took a brief leave of absence to visit a motorcycle rally in
South Dakota to try to lure retired offensive tackle Gary Zimmerman
back into the fold, the Broncos are busting loose like never
before.
</P>
<P>
   Another first for Elway: Denver is 8-0 _ and clearly the class
of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Davis? He has 1,150 yards and 14 touchdowns, both historic
paces. Elway is quick to say that these days the Broncos are
Terrell's team, not his anymore, but most Denver folks would
disagree _ Davis among them _ voting for a co-stewardship instead.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially fitting that the Broncos are halfway to
perfection on the wings of an Elway-patented rally. Although he was
out of sorts for three quarters against a bad Bengals defense
Sunday, the fourth quarter almost always represents a clean slate
for Captain Comeback.
</P>
<P>
   For the 46th time in his career, Elway ambushed a hapless
opponent at the finish. Denver scored three touchdowns in the last
15 minutes, with Davis' five-yard game-winner, in reply to
Cincinnati's tying points at 2:54, coming inside the final minute.
Had anyone else been taking the snaps, we might call it a miracle
finish. For John, we smile and we shrug. Business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, and somewhat ironically given the one-two entry
punch of celebrated freshmen Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf, 1998 has
to date been the year of the old-codger quarterback _ all the more
reason to be thankful Elway opted to stay for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen falls ago, he was the exalted rookie, the No. 1 choice
in a draft arguably the best ever for QBs. His many travails should
serve as inspiration for Manning and Leaf, although it might
depress them a little if they knew of everything Elway endured to
get where he is today.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young, an Elway contemporary with a tale of his own to
tell, is also doggedly acting his name, rather than his age, having
turned the season's corner with a remarkable 21 touchdown passes
against six interceptions. OK, so he can't beat the Packers.
Nobody's perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Great _ and in the case of Collins' continuing sad saga, notably
un-great _ stories abound among the NFL's signal-callers, leaving
Elway a bit lost in the shuffle. A slew of them are having showier
seasons _ some with surprising names such as Flutie, Testaverde and
Cunningham _ but Elway remains conspicuous by virtue of that zero
following the hyphen in the Broncos' record.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie, still too little at 36 and still too stubborn to
admit it, beat the Dolphins on Sunday with a fourth-quarter
uprising of his own on Buffalo's behalf. That's four victories for
Flutie in relief of the banged-up Rob Johnson in this, his second
incarnation as an NFL quarterback after what once figured to be
permanent exile in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde, another Heisman Trophy owner presumed bound
for the NFL's refuse bin, is running a Jets machine that has five
wins in six starts. As was obviously the order of the day Sunday,
Vinny knocked off the Chiefs with two late scoring drives of his
own. One of them ended with his 12th touchdown pass, against only
two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham, two seasons removed from an aborted
retirement to the real world of laying marble tile for a living, is
the lone quarterback ahead of Testaverde in the passer ratings and
until Sunday had kept the Vikings unbeaten. Cunningham's own
salient stats: 16 touchdowns with just three picks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, down Dixie way, we have Chris Chandler, another
has-been-in-waiting who won't go away, either. Behind Chandler, the
Falcons are a best-ever 6-2 at the midpoint. Also, they are 12-4 of
late in games he manages to finish, always a problem for the
oft-injured former Oiler, Ram, Cardinal, Colt and Buc.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Manning and Leaf: Pay attention. At your job, patience
is a virtue.

N.Y. SLAYING SPOTLIGHTS FEAR AS ABORTION ACCESS FOR POOR IS CUT
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home
last week eliminated the mainstay of the only abortion clinic here,
but it has not eliminated women's access to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the availability of abortion in the Buffalo
area, as in much of the United States, is a complex reality, one
affected by class and education, medical training and the personal
convictions of individual doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable middle-class and affluent women here who find
themselves with an unwanted pregnancy can usually obtain an
abortion from their private gynecologists, or if a gynecologist has
a personal objection to the procedure, through a referral to a
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are poor, young or uneducated and have no such regular
relationships with doctors have to rely on specialized clinics like
the one Slepian worked in, or on hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   It is this group _ for whom unplanned pregnancies are far more
common than for prosperous women _ that faces a shrinking universe
of possibilities as a result of the fear set off by Slepian's
killing and the slayings of five other doctors and clinic workers
since 1993, medical experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're well off and well connected, you can get your
abortion,'' said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director of the center for
clinical ethics at the University of Buffalo, which trains doctors
for the Buffalo area's hospitals. ``For everybody else, it's less
and less available.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of abortions in the United States has been declining
steadily since the first years after the Supreme Court's Roe vs.
Wade decision legalized abortion in 1973, according to the Alan
Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive issues.
</P>
<P>
   They now number roughly 1.5 million a year, according to reports
by Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, according to the National Right to
Life Committee, the nation's largest anti-abortion group, which
calculates its estimate partly from the Guttmacher figures.
</P>
<P>
   The number of providers who identify themselves as performing
abortions as part of their practice is diminishing as well. A 1994
Guttmacher study, the last one published, found that the number had
decreased 18 percent between 1982 and 1992, to 2,380 from 2,908.
Moreover, the study said, only 12 percent of the nation's residency
programs routinely offer training in abortions during the first
trimester, though many do offer elective courses.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Echevarria, director of media relations for the National
Right to Life Committee, contends, however, that most teaching
hospitals do train gynecologists in procedures for treating
miscarriages that are similar to those used for performing
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Only in cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal cities like New
York does the availability of abortions continue at a steady level,
experts say, though even in these locales there is concern about
the decreasing number of young doctors who emerge from residencies
fully trained in performing abortions. The Guttmacher Institute,
which keeps the nation's most precise statistics, said that in
1992, the last year for which it has figures, there were 142,410
abortions in New York that were done by just 151 providers,
including 61 hospitals and 44 clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that provider figure greatly understates the number of
private doctors who perform them in their offices, medical experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many obstetricians and gynecologists in Manhattan provide
abortions as part of their palette of services, and have for many
years,'' said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, the medical director of
Planned Parenthood. ``Rich and middle-class women have always had
access to abortions, and they always will.''
</P>
<P>
   The major threat to availability in the city is less a result of
anti-abortion violence than of medical training. ``The bottom line
is that we're facing an impending shortage of physicians who are
adequately trained and willing to do the procedures,'' said Dr.
John Choate, chairman of the New York State division of the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of training programs is also a result of political
pressures on hospitals and universities by antagonists of abortion
and the same climate of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians tend to lie low,'' Choate said. ``They don't
publicize the fact that they do them. If they do them, they do it
quietly out of fear for their practice and for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   One development on the horizon that is expected to change the
outlook for abortions substantially is final  &UR; f &LR; ederal approval,
expected next year, of the RU-486 pill, the drug that ends an early
pregnancy without the need for surgery. When the pill was

FDA APPROVES NEW DRUG TO RELIEVE ARTHRITIS
</HEADLINE>

 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration Monday approved the first drug
developed by biotechnology for rheumatoid arthritis, opening a new
approach to treating the debilitating disease of the joints that
afflicts more than two million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, Enbrel, was shown in clinical trials to reduce pain
and swelling in the joints of many patients with severe arthritis.
It does not cure arthritis or reverse damage that has already been
done to bones and cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   The drug agency has approved Enbrel for use by people with
moderate or severe arthritis for whom existing drugs have failed.
It can also be taken with methotrexate, the most commonly used
drug, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Enbrel was developed by the Immunex Corp., a biotechnology
company in Seattle and will be marketed in conjunction with the
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division of the American Home Products
Corp., a large pharmaceutical firm that owns a majority of Immunex.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug is one of several recently approved or being
developed for rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex said the main side effect of Enbrel, which patients take
by giving themselves an injection twice a week, was irritation at
the site of the injections. But the drug agency is requiring the
company to continue studies to see if there are any long-term
safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   Enbrel is expected to face competition from Remicade, a similar
drug from Centocor Inc. of Malvern, Pa., that is in the final stage
of clinical trials. Last week, an advisory panel to the drug agency
recommended approval of a blood-filtering device made by Cypress
Bioscience Inc. of San Diego for use in severely arthritic patients
for whom drugs have not worked.

TROJANS BEEF UP DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's defensive line has been further bolstered as
Sagan Atuatasi, a 6-foot-2, 285-pound tackle from Los Alamitos has
orally committed to the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Atuatasi is a teammate of Bernard Riley, who committed to USC
earlier this month. Atuatasi is listed as the 19th-best defensive
lineman in the country, according to SuperPrep magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Atuatasi also considered UCLA, Washington and Colorado. He is
the third defensive lineman to commit to USC, which has benefited
early from the recruiting skills of defensive line coach Ed
Orgeron.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also have a commitment from defensive tackle Malcolm
Woolridge (6-2, 300) of Boca Raton, Fla. Six players have committed
to USC this year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Where's Soward?: USC's offense the past two games has barely
featured wide receiver R. Jay Soward, the Trojans' most explosive
player.
</P>
<P>
   Soward caught just three passes for 9 yards against Oregon, and
only one pass for 16 yards against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to do a little more, but you can't always
have your way,'' Soward said. ``Washington was really trying to
take our speed away.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward is no longer even USC's leading receiver. He has 27
receptions, which puts him six behind Billy Miller.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bastianelli tries kicking: Wide receiver Mike Bastianelli
tried his first attempt at kicking in nearly three years during
Sunday's practice, following Adam Abrams' 0-for-2 performance
against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both Abrams and David Bell continued kicking in practice,
however, and it would be surprising if Bastianelli actually kicked
in a game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Simmons honored: Cornerback Antuan Simmons was named the
Pacific-10 Conference's defensive player of the week after
returning two interceptions for touchdowns against Washington. It
was the third time Simmons has been honored by the Pac-10. He was
previously named defensive player of the week for the Purdue game
and special-teams player of the week for the Arizona State game.
</P>
<P>
   __ UCLA game time set: USC's game against UCLA at the Rose Bowl
Nov. 21 will be at 12:30 p.m. and televised by ABC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   __ Power rankings: USC is not in either top-25 poll, but the
Trojans have moved from 24th to 19th in the latest New York Times
computer rankings.

   Germany: Schroeder's Presidential Candidate
</P>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ The Social Democratic Party of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder nominated Johannes Rau, 67, as its presidential
candidate. Rau, a former premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, will be
the prime contender to succeed President Roman Herzog in May in the
largely ceremonial post.
</P>

   Germany: Coalition for Mecklenburg
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ For the first time the successor to the
Communist Party in East Germany reached a formal agreement to form
a governing coalition in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. The
organization, now called the Party of Democratic Socialism, will be
a junior partner in a coalition with the Social Democrats. The pact
was reached a month after the Communists had won a strong second
place in statewide elections.

   France: Report on Diana Crash Transmitted
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ The police turned over to investigating magistrates a
report on the car crash that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, last
year, but did not release it. The police have confirmed that the
report found that the driver, Henri Paul, was drunk and driving at
62 miles per hour, slower than previously reported but still two
times the legal limit, when he lost control and crashed into a
tunnel pillar. There was also no evidence reported of sabotage or
faulty brakes or air bags in the rented Mercedes-Benz.

China, which also promised trade and aid. That cuts the number of
countries that officially recognize Taiwan to 26, mainly poor
African and Latin American countries. South Africa, the Central

L.A. DOESN'T NEED NFL; NFL NEEDS L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the two rival Los Angeles groups seeking a pro football
franchise bow like royal servants at the altar of the almighty NFL,
offering its ownership everything except titles to the Getty Museum
and the MGM film library, I privately cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Why should we in L.A., which still holds all the NFL attendance
records from those glorious days when the Rams often had crowds
exceeding 100,000 at the Coliseum, be coerced into losing our
financial dignity like St. Louis and Memphis and Oakland and
Baltimore and Cleveland have been made to do in recent years?
</P>
<P>
   Why should we in L.A., second largest media center in America
behind New York, undisputed movie capital of the planet, have to
endure the obscene spectacle of dropping to our knees like a
desperate street corner cadger and beg those NFL robber barons to
throw us a crumb?
</P>
<P>
   Why should we in L.A., which in my biased view is the greatest
area in the world because of its mild year-round weather and unique
cultural diversity, act as though the very fiber of our existence
here is contingent on us securing an NFL team?
</P>
<P>
   I found the drama that unfolded last week in Kansas City to be a
tawdry exercise in corporate bullying by the NFL, with the
competing groups from L.A. and one from Houston displaying their
wares to their potential suitors in the same toadying manner
courtesans do from their apartment windows in the alleys of
Amsterdam's notorious red light district.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, I miss having an NFL team in our midst, if for no
other selfish reason that I no longer have such local column
staples to write about as Al Davis and Georgia Frontiere.
</P>
<P>
   I think the NFL National Football League has become a laughable
misnomer because how can a league pass itself off as being national
if L.A., which once had two NFL teams and still has two major
league baseball teams, two NBA teams, two NHL teams, isn't a part
of it?
</P>
<P>
   Those greed-driven NFL owners like Jerry Jones and Al Davis and
Pat Bowlen and Georgia Frontiere and all the others will tell you
their monopolistic confederation is progressing healthily without
L.A., which seems to be the case at the moment with each team
earning $32 million in TV revenue before it even opens its summer
training camp gates.
</P>
<P>
   But we in L.A. also seem to be existing nicely without the NFL,
managing our Sundays in a more orderly, if not docile ways,
checking out delightful places like the Huntington Library out
</P>
<P>
   in Pasadena, or even taking in a matinee at the Ahmanson Theatre
rather than duking it out with Raider fans at the Coliseum, or
booing dear Georgia at old Anaheim Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we have saved millions of dollars shunning NFL hats and
jerseys, much to the dismay of those in the league who have noticed
the precipitous decline of its apparel revenues in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL claims it doesn't need L.A., to which I counter we don't
need the NFL and shouldn't act as though we do as our
representatives so humiliatingly did last week.
</P>
<P>
   I want an NFL team here as much as anyone, but I don't think a
single dollar should be fleeced from any of us L.A. residents to
subsidize the emergence of a new team and the construction of a new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As I watched the Seattle-Oakland gamematch
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, I felt a bittersweet sense of nostalgia because
it's become obvious that the team that was once such an integral
part of our existence, the Raiders, no longer is the dysfunctional
weakling of recent years and clearly is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   You find it difficult applauding the eccentric Raider owner, Al
Davis, who in an impulsive fit of pique after the 1994 season
abandoned L.A. when his jilted paramour, Oakland, waved too much
money in front of his gold-rimmed spectacles for him to resist.
</P>
<P>
   But, grudgingly, you must admit Davis seems to have revived his
long-suffering franchise, and put together a fast, strong,
aggressive, smart team reminiscent of glorious predecessors rather
than last season's 4-12 flameouts who so diminished Davis'
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Amid slightly more serious issues rampant gang warfare, the
terrible deterioration of its school system, etc., the L.A. City
Council last week somehow found enough time to pass a resolution
against Al Davis bringing the Raiders back to our celestial
community.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself is a rousing endorsement for Al Davis because the
L.A. City Council just might be the most obtuse, doctrinaire,
divisive, incompetent government body in America, which,
considering the fierce competition in so many sectors, is quite an
ignoble accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a person who holds grudges, unlike many of my friends
and former friends. Anger quickly abates in me. Amnesia clouds old
feuds. I shook hands with John Robinson after we had engaged in a
long jihad and now consider him a friend again. I speak to all
former lady companions. I hold no bitter feelings toward a former
radio station general manager who fired me over finances when Joe
McDonnell and I had the highest ratings at the station. I find it
incomprehensible that Tom Lasorda no longer talks to me because I
did something so appalling as to write the truth about what Bill
Russell thought about him.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I detest Al Davis for departing L.A., I would gladly
forgive old grievances if he decided to lam it out of Oakland again
for L.A. This life is far too short to maintain vengeful hatreds.
I'd rather have the Raiders here than go through the growing pains
endemic to an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   But, please, no taxpayer handouts, not to Al Davis, not to those
L.A. supplicants who last Tuesday so shamelessly threw themselves
at the mercy of those haughty NFL owners who must be made to
understand we can live quite tranquilly without them.

WHO ARE THESE GUYS? JETS' DEFENSE SPARKLES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ In the Jets' resurgence to a four-way tie atop
the American Football Conference East, the unheralded defense is
playing a critical role. But exactly who are these guys who baffled
the Kansas City Chiefs and a national television audience on
Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   Who exactly is Rick Lyle, the lineman who batted away two Elvis
Grbac passes as if he were a free safety? Who is Dwayne Gordon, the
linebacker who ran back an interception for a touchdown? Or Corwin
Brown, a backup defensive back who intercepted Grbac on the 1-yard
line?
</P>
<P>
   It's simple. They are a collection of bargain-basement free
agents. Not a million-dollar acquisition among them. Seven starters
were acquired during the Bill Parcells era. All of them were let go
by their previous teams. At least one came with some baggage packed
with controversy. In fact, since one of those players, middle
linebacker Pepper Johnson, splits the position with another former
free agent, Gordon, the Jets are using eight free agents for the
bulk of the defensive work.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for a unit that will never be compared to the Sack Exchange
_ it is ranked 25th in the National Football League in sacks _ the
Jets' defense boasts favorable numbers:
</P>
<P>
   _ They are co-leaders in the NFL with fewest touchdown passes
permitted (seven).
</P>
<P>
   _ They rank seventh in the league in yardage allowed; a
turnaround after finding themselves 30th, and last, after Game 1 at
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only four teams in the league have given up fewer points a
game than the Jets (17.3).
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, almost all the free agents (Lyle and his
fellow linemen Ernie Logan and Anthony Pleasant, linebackers
Johnson and Bryan Cox, cornerback Otis Smith and free safety Jerome
Henderson) have a connection with Bill Belichick, who runs the
defense, and Scott Pioli, whose personnel evaluations have been
pivotal in the Jets' reversal of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The three linemen all played for Belichick in Cleveland, where
Pioli was a personnel scout. Johnson, who starred under Parcells
with the Giants, eventually performed in Cleveland under Belichick.
Smith and Henderson played for New England, where Parcells was head
coach and Belichick his top assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Only Cox and Gordon didn't have a history with the Jets' brain
trust, although Parcells and Cox often ran into each other at
Gulfstream Park race track in Florida. Each owned horses.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells wasn't bothered by Cox's history of being fined by his
own teams for his outspoken comments or by the league for
on-the-field behavior. Cox has replaced last season's top draft
pick, James Farrior, who suffered a season-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   So after half a season, this mostly no-name defense has helped
the Jets win five of their last six games, and may erase the
remaining questions, if there are any left, of Parcells' ability to
judge talent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday about Parcells' success with reclamation projects,
Gordon replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just taking chances. I think maybe he sees some things in
people that others don't. When I came here, one of the first things
he said to me, after one of our first scrimmages, `Why didn't you
play in San Diego?' Right then and there, I knew he appreciated
what I could do on the field. He's going to tell each and every
player what he needs, so there is no confusion. There is no: `I
don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't know why I'm not making
the trip.' You know why and you need to work on correcting that
problem so you can go on trips.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, for example, was beaten for nine touchdowns last season.
He has not been touched for one this year. He didn't even permit
Andre Rison one reception in the 20-17 victory at Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson wasn't even starting until two games ago, when an
angry Parcells benched rookie Kevin Williams, who was late for a
team meeting. Now Parcells has decided to leave Henderson in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got going now,'' Lyle said, ``is knowing how to do
it _ and to make sure we carry it forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is one of Parcells' trusted special-teams lieutenants from
the Patriots days. A year ago, the Jets were winning games with
their special teams as the offense was trying to establish itself.
This season the unit hasn't had a big Leon Johnson punt return as
it did last year, nor has it generated a crushing kickoff _ until
Aaron Glenn's 62-yarder on Sunday.
</P>

ZAMBRANO DECISION WEEK OR TWO AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Los Angeles Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano
will have the first of several meetings with the team's new
ownership this morning, but club president Tim Leiweke says he
shouldn't expect a answer on whether he will remain in charge for
another week or two.
</P>
<P>
   There is much talk in soccer circles that Zambrano, a Major
League Soccer coach of the year finalist who guided the Galaxy to a
24-8 regular-season record and into the Western Conference finals,
won't be returning next season, but Leiweke insists no decisions
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the next two weeks we owe Octavio a decision,''
said Leiweke, who took charge of the Galaxy when Philip F. Anschutz
purchased the club nearly two weeks ago. ``(Right now) what we know
is that we don't know the answers yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke, also president of the Anschutz-owned Los Angeles Kings
and Staples Center, said he has been talking to players, staff and
figures within the soccer community about Zambrano. He and Anschutz
plan to meet with the coach several times through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you've got new ownership, some changes are made,''
said Leiweke, who earlier indicated there had been feedback that
suggested looking deeper at the coaching position. ``It's not
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people, this isn't the first company they've acquired,
and I think they have a blueprint of how to go about doing things,
and that process includes a thorough review of everyone,'' said
Zambrano, who has posted a 37-15 record in a little more than a
season and a half in charge. ``I have full confidence that once
they've reviewed everything that everything will be fine and I
fully expect to be back. It would surprise me if I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   ``My record stands on its own merits, and I think that the job
that was done was quality work. ... But as a coach, you must always
be aware that your tenure in a team can change.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano's chances could be hurt by his relationship with some
of his players. Several have been unhappy with how he communicates
decisions -- ``I think Octavio has burned a lot of bridges with his
players,'' said one -- and Leiweke said that chemistry between the
coach and players would play a role in whether Zambrano remains
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a professional relationship (with the players),''
Zambrano says. ``When you have 20 players that could start for any
team, it's obvious there are going to be some unhappy guys when it
comes to playing time. My job as coach is to maximize their output,
and I think I did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great relationship with the guys. I can't think of
any guy I have a bad relationship with.''
</P>
<P>
   GALAXY NOTES: Leiweke said he'd like to hire a general manager
with the next week or two, before a decision on Zambrano is made,
if possible. ... Paul Caligiuri, waived Saturday, wasn't taken in
Monday's MLS Waiver Draft and will be available in the supplemental
draft next spring if he signs a new contract. Zambrano said
salary-cap issues forced him to drop the 34-year-old defender, who
needs to renegotiate his pact with MLS after league officials
failed to exercize their option on his current contract. ``It was
very sad, but we hope he can come back to out team,'' Zambrano
said. ``It all depends on his salary.'' MLS doesn't release salary
figures, but Caligiuri was believed to be making $105,000 a year.

THE DAY AFTER THE N.Y. MARATHON, MEMENTOS AND MEMORIES REMAIN
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Puerto Rico, Texas, Mass.)  (fb) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking like the runner he is in Adidas warm-ups and
Asics athletic shoes, Jose Cruz was strolling down Seventh Avenue
on Monday morning in search of a few souvenirs to carry home to
Bayamon, Puerto Rico. The day before, the 59-year-old Cruz had
completed his second New York City Marathon in 3 hours 14 minutes _
good enough to qualify in the 60-and-over age group for next year's
Boston Marathon, which he plans to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my second New York City Marathon,'' said Cruz, who
arrived in the city last Thursday and was booked on a 3 p.m. flight
to Puerto Rico on Monday. ``There are 20 of us here. We belong to a
runners group back home, and I did better than guys half my age.''
</P>
<P>
   All along Central Park West and South on Monday were pleasant,
colorful reminders and remains of Sunday's 26.2-mile race, from the
metal bleachers and blue wooden police barricades, to the
winter-green Royal Flush portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Red, blue, green, yellow and black balloons were still hovering
above the 59th Street entrance to the park, serving as a beacon for
any stragglers. They signaled home Zoe Koplowitz, who has multiple
sclerosis, as she finished her 11th consecutive New York City
Marathon on Monday afternoon, more than 31 hours after she stepped
onto the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Stopping every two hours for
diabetes blood tests and walking overnight with two custom-made
canes and an unreal perseverance, Koplowitz was greeted by about 60
friends and fans as she crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   None less than Carl Lewis, the nine-time Olympic gold medalist,
complimented her feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she's done is an illustration to all of us that it's not
enough to be good, you have to have the will and determination to
be the best,'' Lewis said. He just happened to be in Central Park
as a host to a Nike-sponsored event in which 200 New York City
schoolchildren got to meet five elite runners, among them the
marathoner Tegla Loroupe, who had been their Internet pen pals.
</P>
<P>
   John Kagwe of Kenya, who won the men's race, and Franca Fiacconi
of Italy, the winner of the women's race, spent Monday figuratively
on the run. In the morning, the two were given the keys to the city
by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at City Hall. Then, it was the
Official All-Star Cafe in Times Square for a celebratory lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rest of the field was lingering in the lobby of the
Wellington Hotel, which at times looked like Sunday's finish-line
chutes. Women and men in various states and styles of athletic wear
waited in line at the front desk to check out. Most were wearing or
carrying mementos from Sunday: a 1998 marathon cap, their
blue-and-orange-beribboned finishers' medals, a badge from Saturday
night's Ronzoni pasta party at Tavern on the Green.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in a lobby chair with his Nike-clad feet atop his
suitcase was Edwin Melendez Jr. Melendez was headed back to Corpus
Christi, Texas, on a 1:50 p.m. flight. His father, Dr. Edwin
Melendez Sr., who had coaxed his son to run his first New York City
Marathon and had just completed his fourth, would occupy the aisle
seat. His uncle, Ernesto Melendez, was headed back to San Juan,
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a family affair,'' Edwin Jr. said. ``My aunt, Roxanna,
also ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of the Melendez clan, she did not have a flight
to catch: she lives in New York.

WITH NEW JERSEY FAMILY CAP, BIRTHS FALL AND ABORTIONS RISE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey's so-called family-cap policy, which
cuts off extra cash benefits to welfare recipients who have more
children, has led to an overall decline in birth rates among
welfare recipients and has also contributed to a temporary increase
in abortions, according to the final version of a Rutgers
University study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A draft version of the report, released earlier this year,
reached similar conclusions. Researchers re-examined their
methodology at the request of the Whitman administration and found
larger numbers of abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million, 1,000-page study, which was commissioned by the
state and federal governments, found a significant decline in the
number of births among welfare recipients after New Jersey became
the first state to impose a family-cap law in 1992. The researchers
estimated that there were 14,000 fewer births between 1992 and 1996
than would have been expected because of trend and population
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The team of researchers also concluded that the law contributed
to an increase of 1,400 abortions among welfare recipients over and
above what would have been expected during the same period. The
researchers said the abortion rate increased sharply after the new
law took effect, but then leveled off to about the same rate as
before the family-cap law took effect. The study also found an
increase in the number of women who used family planning and
contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman, who has been under pressure from some
legislators, women's groups and abortion rights opponents to repeal
the law, said Monday that the study's findings had persuaded her to
maintain the state's family-cap policy because of the decline in
the number of births.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about abortion,'' Whitman said, calling the law a
success. ``It's about accepting responsibility for your actions and
personal responsibility and planning.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey first adopted its law in 1992 under a federal waiver
that allowed states to try alternative policies and programs.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty other states have adopted similar family-cap laws since
the federal government cleared the way two years ago for states to
design their own welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some welfare policy experts contend that family-cap laws help
promote individual responsibility and discourage welfare recipients
from having more children than they can support.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for the poor, conservative Christian groups, the
Roman Catholic Church and women's organizations say the laws lead
to more abortions and plunge children even deeper into poverty.
They have tried to repeal the laws.
</P>
<P>
   The National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education
Fund and other groups filed a lawsuit challenging New Jersey's
family-cap law. In September, legislation was introduced seeking to
repeal the law.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Diane Allen, a Republican who is sponsoring the bill,
said the Rutgers study would bolster the legislation's chances for
passage.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said 28,000 children have been born into
families who were dependent on welfare benefits and were denied
extra cash assistance. Officials said the families did, however,
continue to receive extra food stamp benefits and state Medicaid
coverage.

EDITORIAL: THE VACANT COMMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 3:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Sentencing Commission is a small, independent federal
agency with a big job _ setting sentencing guidelines for federal
crimes. Right now, the agency has one other distinction. It has no
members, the absurd result of months of partisan bickering in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member commission had been limping along with three
vacancies for more than a year. In August the chairman, Richard
Conaboy, announced that he was leaving as of Oct. 31, and the terms
of the three other commissioners automatically expired when
Congress adjourned last month. By statute, the commission is meant
to be nonpolitical, its members appointed by the president and
confirmed by the Senate. At least three of the members must be
federal judges, and no more than four may belong to the same
political party.
</P>
<P>
   These requirements are supposed to keep the commission free of
politics. But Senate Republicans have had a hard time agreeing on
the three Republican slots, and the individuals they have offered
have been rejected by the White House as too rigidly conservative.
In retaliation, the Republicans have balked at names proposed by
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is crucial to the federal criminal justice
system. Congress routinely creates new crimes or stiffens penalties
on existing crimes. The commission sets the guidelines used by
federal judges to determine sentencing. Often Congress will set a
maximum penalty but let the commission determine when that maximum
would apply and under what circumstances a lesser sentence might be
justified. Congress recently asked the commission for new
sentencing guidelines for crimes involving telemarketing fraud,
identity fraud, child sexual abuse, the theft of cellular phone
services and methamphetamine sales.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's staff will continue its research, but no new
guidelines will be issued until there are some new members. That
should shame both sides into finally producing a slate of qualified
individuals who are above partisanship.

<P>
   Former Crowley High School basketball standout Brian Brookhart
will enroll at Texas A&AMP;M for the second semester of classes and
walk on to the men's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Brookhart, a 6-foot-10, 225-pound freshman, was signed by TCU
during his senior season at Crowley, but was released from his
scholarship in August by TCU coach Billy Tubbs after the coaching
staff suggested Brookhart enroll in a junior college to further
develop his game. Since then, Brookhart has been attending classes
part time at TCU under an institutional aid plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas A&AMP;M is a first-rate program with first-rate coaches, and
I plan on spending the next four years there,'' Brookhart said.
``They \RA&AMP;M coaches\S said that they would give me the chance to
earn a scholarship for next season, because they had none left this
season, and that's all I asked for.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookhart said that Texas offered a scholarship beginning
immediately but that he declined. Other schools in Texas showing
interest included Lamar and UT-Pan American.

RED WINGS' REMARKS IRK STARS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said yesterday he took
exception to comments from the Detroit Red Wings that the Stars had
used ``illegal picks'' on two goal-scoring plays en route to a 3-2
victory Saturday night. He added that the Red Wings could have been
penalized on either play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the issues they bring to focus, those issues
are wrong,'' said Hitchcock, stirring up a war of words in the
budding rivalry. ``The right call was made in a no-call. If
anything, it could even be a dive the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings claimed that Mike Modano knocked down Detroit
center Steve Yzerman on one play, opening a path for Jere Lehtinen
to take a shot deflected in by Brett Hull. They also complained
that Modano knocked down winger Brendan Shanahan in the neutral
zone, creating the open ice for Hull to score the game-winner with
six minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two goals came because of interference and picks,'' Red
Wings goalie Chris Osgood said. ``Those are called 95 percent of
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano said he and Yzerman got tangled on the first play and
Shanahan was grabbing his stick on the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grabbed my stick and then dropped like I was grabbing
his,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   NHL rules state a player can be called for embellishing a
penalty or ``diving.'' The Stars already have been whistled twice
this season for dives. If Modano's account is accurate, Shanahan
could have been called for a dive as easily as Modano could have
been called for interference.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Hitchcock said, the no-call was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the Red Wings have become experts at the diving
ploy and that was one reason they were given nine power-play
opportunities during Saturday's game. He pointed specifically to
penalties called on Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig against Martin
Lapointe and defenseman Shawn Chambers against Yzerman ``that were
in our view no-calls and ended up being two-minute penalties,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit has become a very good hockey club in the little areas
of getting away with things, so you have to learn from them,''
Hitchcock said. ``They're smart. They have people who know when to
go down, and smart players do that. We've just got to become
smarter than them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock isn't above a pre-emptive strike to counteract all
the posturing the Red Wings are doing _ posturing, he said, he
believes is aimed at getting a competitive advantage for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for the competitive edge. They're trying to
get the referee to look in some areas and I'm trying to get the
referee to look in some areas. It's about competition,'' Hitchcock
said. ``But in the end, the players have to decide the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hitchcock wasn't above getting in his two cents before
the next game against Detroit, scheduled Nov. 13 at Joe Louis
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team that's focused on winning hockey, they're looking for
an edge,'' Hitchcock said. ``What's important is things the next
time we play are called on the upfront and called fairly, and then
we'll deal with it.''

IRAQ'S AUDACIOUS DEFIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times will say in an editorial for Tuesday, Nov.
3: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by its past successes in curtailing U.N. arms
inspections, Iraq has now virtually banned all monitoring efforts.
Before Saddam Hussein will let this vital work resume, he
unreasonably demands that the Security Council guarantee an early
end to international economic sanctions against Iraq. Such a
commitment would relieve Baghdad of its obligation to prove it has
eliminated all illegal biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and
missiles that can deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   This contempt for security council resolutions has spurred even
previously equivocal council members like Russia, China and France
to condemn Baghdad's decision and demand that Iraq comply in full
with all resolutions. This show of unity is important, and welcome.
But experience suggests that resolutions alone will not be enough
to make Iraq live up to its obligations. Washington, together with
whatever partners it can mobilize, must once again be prepared to
enforce the council's demands with military action.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, Iraq has prohibited U.N. investigators from
carrying out surprise inspections of new locations where they
believed weapons ingredients or documentary evidence might be
hidden. That seriously undermined the inspection program, but at
least previously identified sites were still visited by inspectors
and kept under surveillance by cameras and chemical detection
devices. Now even those routine inspection visits have been barred.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Iraq is not interfering with technicians who
maintain video cameras and replace batteries at locations where
these devices have been installed. But maintaining this equipment
is much less important than the physical inspections by trained
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Until early this year Washington consistently backed the U.N.
inspection program with the threat to use force, the only language
that seems to move Saddam. But White House resolve weakened last
spring and Washington responded meekly when Iraq halted surprise
inspections in August.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Saddam senses hesitation he moves to gain advantage,
and Washington is now dealing with the predictable consequence of
its desire to avoid another confrontation with Iraq. The threat of
Iraqi chemical and biological weapons is too grave to treat
exclusively as a diplomatic matter, as the White House now seems
belatedly to recognize. If diplomacy backed by the threat of force
does not budge Saddam, military action itself may be needed. &QL;

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Baseball's all-time home-run king saw how
much the New York Mets are going to pay Mike Piazza. He didn't say
he would be worth that much today.
</P>
<P>
   But Hank Aaron did say if he was still playing, he would go have
a talk with the Atlanta Braves owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go up to Ted Turner and say, `Hello partner,''' Aaron
said. ``If Piazza can get $91 million, then I might be able to own
one of \RTurner's\S television stations.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron retired from baseball 22 years ago, before the escalation
of salaries, and had to settle for _ among many other post-career
honors _ the Lifetime Achievement Award presented to him by the
Bobby Bragan Youth Foundation at a banquet last night at the
Worthington Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The award honors Aaron for his achievements off and on the
field, both as an ambassador to the game and one of its greatest
players. Bragan, a longtime Fort Worth-area baseball figure,
managed Aaron with the Braves in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron finished his career with a record 755 home runs, but there
was much more to his career. So much that Aaron said last night,
``I wish people would think of me for more than home runs ... but
that's never going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With this year's home-run record chase, national attention was
focused once more on Aaron's accomplishment and on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home-run chase kept baseball on people's minds and talking
about baseball,'' Aaron said. ``Whether they were fans of \RSammy\S
Sosa or fans of \RMark\S McGwire, it was good for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said his goal each year was not to hit home runs, but to
bat .300, drive in 100 runs and score 100 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember what the late Jackie Robinson told me,'' Aaron
said. ``We were sitting around a room in Chattanooga, \RTenn.\S
four or five of us, just talking. He said the only way you're going
to be any good to your team is if you touch each base and you touch
home base. If you pop out or strike out, you don't help your team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I remember something my late manager Chuck Dressen once
said. We were at a banquet and he was just kidding, but I thought
he was serious. He said, `Here's Hank Aaron, he batted .292 (in
1960) and he drove in 100-something runs ... and if he had hit
.300, we would have won the pennant.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuck with me. I was embarrassed if I didn't hit .300 or
drive in 100 runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron did do that most of the time, finishing his 23-year with a
lifetime average of .305, along with 2,297 runs batted in, which
falls just short of an average of 100 RBI per season.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everybody knows Aaron is the all-time home run leader.
Not quite as many know he's the all-time RBI leader as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'm most proud of is finishing with a .300 batting
average for my career,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Aaron said, would be his consistency. He was the National
League's most valuable player in 1957, when the Milwaukee Braves
won the pennant, but he never had one signature year. Instead he
hit 40 or more homers eight times and 30 or more another seven. His
career best was 47 homers in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even fantasize about hitting 70,'' said Aaron who,
like all other baseball fans, watched with great interest as
McGwire and Sosa shattered Roger Maris' single-season home-run
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, the pennant races were over with early so people
weren't interested in them, and people weren't interested in the
wild-card race because they didn't know anything about it. Plus, we
didn't have a commissioner for much of the season, so those things
were working against us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a year that nobody will ever forget, one that was
really remarkable,'' Aaron said. ``It was one, I think, looking
back, if it had not been for the home-run chase, baseball would
probably have some severe problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron was in the spotlight in 1974 when he broke Babe Ruth's
career home-run record, first tying it with his 714th off Reds
pitcher Jack Billingham and then passing it with his 715th on April
8 against Dodgers left-hander Al Downing.
</P>
<P>
   He went through some of the same things _ and more _ that Maris
encountered when he broke Ruth's single-season record in 1961. The
worst was the racial hatred of a few people who didn't want a black
man to break a hallowed white man's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed some of it,'' Aaron said. ``I had some ups and
downs. The hard part was seeing my kids unable to enjoy it because
they were isolated in some ways. But my chase was different from
what happened this year. My chase took years and years, this thing
just happened. Mine took 21 years to accumulate.''
</P>
<P>
   The honor will remain with him for years and years to come, even
if he doesn't get paid $91 million for doing it.

LINEBACKER HICKS EMERGING AS VITAL COG IN UT'S RESURGENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A role player to his core, Texas linebacker
Anthony Hicks laughed yesterday when asked about a correlation
between his emergence in the starting lineup and the start of the
Longhorns' five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Both events trace their roots to Sept. 26, when Hicks made 10
tackles during a 59-21 rout of Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The junior from Richardson is so unassuming, he even joked about
being surprised no one handed him a specimen bottle when he came
off the field after making a career-high 13 tackles in last week's
20-16 upset of then-No. 7 Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I came from nowhere, I thought they might drug-test
me,'' said Hicks, who recorded more sacks (2) and tackles for
losses (5) against the Cornhuskers than during the first 25 games
of his college career. ``They can test me all they want. I'm clean.
There's nothing in me but water and Gatorade.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks neglected to mention heart and desire. But those are the
two attributes coach Mack Brown cited as vital to the success of an
undersized player, scheduled to make his sixth consecutive start
when No. 20 Texas (6-2, 4-1 Big 12) meets Oklahoma State (3-5, 2-4)
at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Royal-Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brown acknowledged Hicks, who missed spring drills with an ankle
injury suffered last season, hardly wowed coaches during fall
two-a-days with his size (6-foot, 232 pounds) or speed (4.6 in the
40-yard dash).
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't make any of our recruiting lists right now,''
Brown said. ``But he's smart and he plays hard every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks also happened to be an available, fresh face at a time
when Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese was searching for
answers to correct a unit that allowed 44.3 points and 490.6 yards
per game in its first three outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know much about Anthony,'' Brown said. ``We just
knew we weren't stopping anybody, so we were looking for anyone to
give us some relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief eventually came in the form of a player who expected 1998
to be ``a long season for me.'' Unable to showcase his talents to
first-year coaches during spring drills, Hicks watched Brown switch
several players from other positions to outside linebacker. All
were faster than Hicks. All moved ahead of him on the depth chart
while he rehabilitated his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this year started, it was like I was a freshman again,''
said Hicks, who started the final five games of the 1997 season.
``I was way behind. I knew the coaches wanted fast guys and I'm
thinking, `Where do I fit in?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, as of Sept. 26, proved to be strong-side linebacker.
Hicks has made 37 tackles since becoming a starter (7.4 per game).
None proved more pivotal than against Nebraska, where both of
Hicks' sacks stopped potential scoring drives that reached Texas
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You visualize days like that, but you never expect to have
them,'' Hicks said. ``Every time something started to unfold, I was
there. Wherever I ran, the ball kept coming at me. I was in a zone
out there.''

PROMINENT CHEF ACCUSED OF CREDIT THEFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former boxer who rose from the streets of Brooklyn
to become one of New York City's most flamboyant celebrity chefs _
with his own restaurant, cookbook and cable television show _ was
charged Monday with stealing $190,000 from a credit card company by
falsifying credit card receipts for payment, in one case by as much
as $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The chef, David Ruggerio, 36, whose television program
``Ruggerio to Go'' premiered on the Food Channel only three weeks
ago, was arraigned on felony grand larceny charges in Manhattan
Criminal Court Monday night. He faces up to 15 years in prison if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Ruggerio falsified credit card payments by inflating the
gratuities left by 26 customers at his restaurant, then known as Le
Chantilly, in May and June by amounts ranging from $5,000 to
$30,000, prosecutors said. Last summer, he renamed the restaurant
David Ruggerio.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's credit card processing company, Paymentech
Merchant Services of Dallas, apparently noticed the large amounts
being charged and contacted law enforcement officials in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of each day, William Bart, the maitre d'hotel, was
to total the day's credit card purchases and submit them by
computer to Paymentech. Beginning on May 9, Ruggiero had Bart
inflate the gratuities, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Paymentech then wired money matching the credit card total
directly into the restaurant's bank account. After the money
arrived, checks signed by Desmond Brusch, the bookkeeper, and
Ruggerio were drawn against the account, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Ruggerio's lawyer, Charles Carnesi, portrayed the
$190,000 in overcharges as a mistake, not a theft. He said that
Ruggerio, who recently began an episode of ``Ruggerio to Go'' with
a visit to a boxing gym, would repay any money he owed.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors painted a picture Monday that appeared to go far
beyond simple problems of arithmetic. They said Ruggerio ordered
Bart and Brusch to inflate the tips paid by 26 different customers
at his restaurant on East 57th Street and Park Avenue between May 9
and June 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Merchan, a prosecutor with the Manhattan district
attorney's office, said at the arraignment Monday that the three
men tried to steal $225,000 from Paymentech, but managed to get
only about $190,000. Judge James Sullivan of Manhattan Criminal
Court released all three men without bail. They are scheduled to
appear in court again on February 14.
</P>
<P>
   John DeLucia, the lawyer representing Brusch, the bookkeeper,
said his client had only followed orders. ``He's just a workman,''
he said. ``He's a bookkeeper. He does what he's told.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Bart, the maitre d'hotel, could not be reached
for comment Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carnesi described Ruggiero as a self-made culinary prodigy who
grew up in a working-class family in Sheepshead Bay and
Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. A professional boxer when he was younger,
Ruggerio fought in roughly 10 professional bouts, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the courthouse Monday night, Ruggerio declined to
answer questions from reporters. A woman who answered the phones at
Ruggiero's restaurant said it would remain open.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Carnesi, said: ``He's a terrific chef, an excellent
author. But he's not necessarily a great businessman.''

ABC WORKERS STAGE 24-HOUR STRIKE; NETWORK RESPONDS BY LOCKING THEM
OUT
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About 2,000 employees of ABC walked off their jobs
without warning Monday for a 24-hour strike, and the television
network's management responded by saying it would lock out any
striking workers who try to return Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The network said temporary workers would be hired to replace the
employees who took part in the strike, which started at 5 a.m. and
which union officials said was staged over a health care issue.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers included camera operators, technicians and
videotape editors. The union said their absence led to technical
glitches in programs broadcast over the ABC network and to the
suspension of the taping of two soap operas, claims that ABC said
were overstated.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman for ABC, said employees hoping to
return to work Tuesday would be turned away because the union
refused to guarantee that workers would not strike without warning
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were locked out because we need to protect our
programming from further unannounced job actions,'' Hoover said.
``This is something we've done reluctantly. We have a perishable
product. It's not like a house that if it's not shown to a
prospective buyer one day, it can be shown the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover said she did not know how long the lockout would last.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the National Association of
Broadcast Engineers &AMP; Technicians, which represents camera
operators, videotape editors, couriers, technicians, engineers and
some writers, said the ABC strikers were protesting because the
network would not provide details about the costs of out-of-network
care under its Disney Signature health plan.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co., is ``breaking the
law by not providing requested information about the health plan,
and by demanding that our 2,200 members enroll in a stealth health
care plan,'' Donahue said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover said that the health care issue was ``a pretext'' and
that the information requested was regarded by insurance companies
as proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to put pressure on us on the negotiating
table,'' Hoover said. ``For two years we've been negotiating with
NABET. ABC's contract with NABET is the most restrictive and most
expensive in the business. All of our direct competitors have more
flexibility.'' ABC's contract with the union expired on March 31,
1997. The union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations
Board this summer on the medical dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of technical workers picketed outside the studios and
offices of ABC Monday morning, wearing red sweatshirts with a
silhouette image of Disney's Mickey Mouse that was dubbed ``Mickey
Rat,'' an ABC logo and the words ``Stop Union Busting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``No one wants a lockout situation,'' said John A. Ahlers, 49, a
supervisor of the company's videotape library, as he walked the
picket line Monday at ABC's studios at 7 Lincoln Square. ``Going on
strike for one day is too long. But this company won't negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Joyce, an executive board representative of Local 16 of
NABET, said there were a series of technical glitches in programs
Monday. ABC broadcasts shows like ``Live With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee,''
``Monday Night Football,'' ``World News Tonight,'' ``20/20,''
``Nightline'' and the soap operas ``All My Children'' and ``One
Life to Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee, the camera was zooming in and out
uncontrollably, and you couldn't hear Regis and Kathie Lee,'' Joyce
said. `` `All My Children' and `One Life to Live' were not taped.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover confirmed that the soap-opera taping was delayed but
described Joyce's report of technical glitches as an overstatement.
``I think they're talking about less-than-exquisite camera shots,''
she said. ``They're trying to create a nonexistent situation.''
</P>
<P>
   NABET staged a one-day strike over contract talks during a PGA
golf tournament in Houston last fall, forcing ABC to broadcast
taped coverage of an old tournament.

<P>
   OTTAWA, Ill. _ Since casting a ballot for Harry Truman in 1948,
Harold Hiles, a World War II veteran, has always deemed it an honor
and a duty to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But on this Election Day, he is staying home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't want any part of it,'' said Hiles, 76, over a piece of
apple pie on Sunday morning, as church bells pealed in this small
Midwestern city. ``Clinton, Starr, the whole bunch of them. Who do
you believe anymore? Who can you respect? People are just losing
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the handicapping about the races between Democrats and
Republicans on Tuesday, there is little doubt what a majority of
Americans will effectively choose: none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   It is a virtual certainty that fewer than half of all eligible
voters will visit the polls on Tuesday; some political analysts say
the number could plummet to about one-third.
</P>
<P>
   While grousing about politicians is a time-honored American
tradition, would-have-been-voters say this campaign season has
wallowed in far more than the usual level of muck _ vicious
name-calling, transparent pandering and, of course, the lascivious
details about President Clinton's sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like politics are spinning out of control,''
said Jerry Hanck, a 60-year-old liquor salesman, who will sit out
the election. ``There are bad actors on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in this old river town 140 years ago that 10,000 people
turned out at Washington Square for the first debate between
Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, a discussion that focused on
constitutional principles and the most fundamental of human rights.
It does not escape notice here that the last national election of
the 20th Century seems to be driven by sound bites, attack ads and
sex talk that brings an embarrassed blush even to a crusty old Navy
man like Hiles.
</P>
<P>
   But gauging the sensibilities of voters, especially when it
comes to Clinton's affair with a former White House intern, is a
tricky business.
</P>
<P>
   Hiles, a retired glass-factory union member, would surely fall
in the approval column on the president's job rating. ``He's been a
wonderful president,'' Hiles said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Hiles said he will boycott the ballot box on Tuesday
largely because he disapproves of Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, and the president's failure to tell the whole
truth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sentiment that surfaced frequently among nonvoters,
mostly among Democrats. These were not people who intended to bolt
to the Republican side. They had simply become dispirited.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats just feel kind of embarrassed right now,'' said
Connie Jolley, 29, a restaurant manager. Ms. Jolley, who described
herself as ``a majorly Democratic'' voter in most years, plans to
go to the polls on Tuesday, but only to vote on a local referendum.
</P>
<P>
   She intends to skip the races for governor, Senate and the
House, saying that she could not bring herself to vote for the
Republicans, but did not believe the Democrats had earned her vote.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to voters, nonvoters are younger, less educated, have
lower incomes and tend to support Democratic candidates for the
House of Representatives, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, taken Oct. 26 to 28, found that 32 percent of
nonvoters are under age 30, compared with just 13 percent of
voters. Nearly two-thirds of nonvoters have never attended college,
whereas 43 percent of voters have not attended college. Forty
percent of nonvoters have households incomes of less than $30,000 a
year, compared to 24 percent of likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of preferences for the House of Representatives races,
49 percent of nonvoters favor Democratic candidates and 27 percent
favor Republicans. The likely voters, meanwhile, were evenly split
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of political apathy this year will not be fully
measured until the votes are counted, but at least two studies
suggest an increase.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago in a Times/CBS News poll, a third of voters said
they were paying a lot of attention to campaigns in their state,
and 20 percent said they were paying little or no attention. This
year, the Times/CBS News poll shows interest in the campaigns
slightly down, with fewer than three in 10 voters saying they were
paying a lot of attention, and about a quarter saying they were
paying little or no attention.
</P>
<P>
   And a report released on Friday by the Committee for the Study
of the American Electorate, a nonpartisan research institution in
Washington, found that turnout was likely to be between 36 percent
to 38 percent of eligible voters, down from the 38.8 percent who
voted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   No one can yet accurately measure how much of the expected
decline can be attributed to disgust with the Lewinsky scandal, or
for that matter, the Starr investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom predicting a lower turnout in November
is generally based on the relatively low turnout in this year's
primary elections. But Thomas Mann, director of governmental
studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, cautioned that
turnout was difficult to predict.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said some political analysts were expecting something
of a surge in voting by blacks, who have been among Clinton's most
loyal defenders. He added that union members, whatever their
feeling about the Lewinsky affair, were unlikely to sit out the
election, given strong get-out-the-vote efforts by labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Congressional District here, which sweeps north and
east across Illinois farmland to the industrial city of Joliet, has
swung between Democrats and Republicans. It last changed parties in
1994, when Jerry Weller, a Republican, took office. Weller is
widely expected to win re-election against his Democratic opponent,
Gary Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like, `What's the sense?''' said Mike Malles, a
33-year-old house painter, who skipped past the political news in
the Sunday newspaper, and read the movie reviews. ``The noise is
just too loud. There's so much hype. A lot of people just want to
pull back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudslinging and scandal are surely not the only things keeping
voters from the polls. Many people say they simply do not find
politics interesting enough to spend much time dwelling on the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   When Melissa Reynolds, a 19-year-old college student, asked,
``What are we voting for?'' she was not posing a rhetorical
question.
</P>
<P>
   She was unaware that Tuesday was Election Day. ``I don't get
into that stuff,'' said Miss Reynolds, who plans to become a
grammar school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy in relatively good shape, many Americans have
taken a fairly pacific view of political affairs, not motivated
enough to demand sharp change. Others simply see the actions of
political leaders as increasingly irrelevant to their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dedra Phillips, who works as a quality analyst for a cookie
company, said she was enjoying some prosperity these days. But she
said politicians should leave her alone. And she plans to do them
the same favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are good for me because I make them that way,'' said Ms.
Phillips, 28, who pushed a stroller that held her two young
children. ``It has nothing to do with politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Harden, a 33-year-old custodian, said she would stay away
from the polls as a gesture of protest against politicians who she
claimed operated on a different standard than ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they're better than the people who pay their
salaries,'' said Ms. Harden, as she walked through a parking lot to
the Wal-Mart store. ``The only time you ever see them is at parade
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Harnisch, a 47-year-old teacher at a corrections facility,
said she would skip the voting booth because politicians had
skipped the issues most relevant to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wasting time on this investigation _ censure him,
throw him out, let him go, whatever _ but let's get on with it,''
said Ms. Harnisch, who usually splits her ticket.
</P>
<P>
   She blamed Republicans for dwelling on the Starr investigation,
but said the president, by his example, ``has made it much harder
for the average person who wants to go out and do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, she said, she was annoyed by
politicians who dwell on ``hot-button'' issues like gun control and
abortion, while ignoring the complicated matters that come up in
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they talk about things that hit home _ medical
expenses, credit card debt, men who don't pay child support,'' said
Ms. Harnisch. ``I'm not voting because it just doesn't seem to get
through to them.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. and general manager Gerry Hunsicker
made a quick, one-day trip to Arizona on Monday to gauge Randy
Johnson's interest in re-signing with the Astros.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The duo were so convinced, they left the free-agent pitcher with
his first lucrative contract offer to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Astros would not give any contract details, they are
believed to have offered Johnson a three-year deal worth between
$33 million and $36 million. It's possible the third year would be
at the club's option.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has filed for free agency, intends to test the
market and won't have an answer for the Astros until he has fielded
offers from other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson did tell McLane and Hunsicker that the Astros
were on his short list, and Monday's offer should be competitive
enough to keep the Astros in the thick of the Big Unit sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offer we made was created to send a serious message to
Randy and his family about just how important we feel he is to this
franchise,'' said Hunsicker, who declined to disclose details of
the offer. ``It's more than we've ever offered a player, and it
shows that re-signing Randy is our No. 1 priority. It would allow
Randy to be compensated among the elite pitchers in the game, which
he most certainly is.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson accepts the Astros' proposal, he would become the
highest-paid player on the team and the third-highest-paid pitcher
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Jeff Bagwell is the highest-paid Astro, at $8
million a year. Boston's Pedro Martinez, in the second season of a
six-year, $75 million deal, averages $12.5 million a year; Greg
Maddux of Atlanta averages $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have exclusive negotiating rights with Johnson
through Thursday. After that time, he may field offers from other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, Texas, Cleveland, Arizona, Colorado and the New York
Yankees have expressed interest in the 6-10 lefthander, who was
10-1 with a 1.28 ERA after the Astros acquired him in a July 31
trade with Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He was 9-10 with a 4.33 ERA in 23 starts with the Mariners and
led the major leagues with 329 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I stop short of saying we're the
front-runners,'' Hunsicker said. ``I don't feel like we're the
front-runners; we're one of a handful of teams that he is seriously
considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't leave the meeting confident (the Astros could re-sign
Johnson), but I didn't leave there discouraged, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his agent, Barry Meister, indicated they intend to
whittle their list of suitors to as few as three teams before the
pitcher and his family begin visiting prospective clubs. Although
Johnson has 10 years of service time, this is his first experience
with the free-agency process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels obligated to go through the process, so nothing is
going to happen during our exclusive period,'' Hunsicker said.
``It's going to take some time to get through this. He does have a
genuine interest (in the Astros), but at this point it's hard to
tell if we have any advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he appreciates the support he received here, and that
doesn't hurt. But family is very important to Randy, and he wants
to get his family involved in the decision-making process, and we
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting took place at Johnson's home in Glendale,
Ariz., which is near Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks managing partner Jerry Colangelo visited Johnson at
his home over the weekend, and the Big Unit no doubt will do more
entertaining before he decides on an offer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros were first to weigh in, and _ by all indications
_ they weighed in heavily.

SERIAL KILLER IN CONNECTICUT MAY HAVE TRIED SUICIDE WITH DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ A convicted serial killer who had asked to be
executed apparently attempted to commit suicide early Monday
morning, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A guard making the twice-hourly patrol of the state's death row
at the Northern Correctional Institution in Somers found the
inmate, Michael Ross, lying on the floor of his cell, said Capt. S.
Scott Semple of the state Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half hours later, Ross was taken to the University of
Connecticut Health Center in Farmington, Semple said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, Ross was removed from a respirator and his
condition was upgraded from serious to fair, according to a
hospital official and one of Ross' lawyers. Prison officials and
state police are investigating if Ross hoarded a prescription
medication he was taking and then ingested several doses at once,
said James Walter, a spokesman for the University of Connecticut
Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections instructed the health center not
to release the name of the drug, Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Butler, one of Ross' lawyers and a public defender, said
his client suffered from mental illness and was on two medications,
only one of which he could have been hoarding. Butler refused to
say what medication Ross was taking or what specific ailments his
client was being treated for.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, a 1981 graduate of Cornell University who worked as a
door-to-door insurance salesman before his arrest, was charged with
killing six young women between 1981 and 1984. He confessed on the
day of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   After a jury rejected Ross' claim that he was ``emotionally
disturbed,'' he was sentenced to death in 1987. In 1994, the state
Supreme Court upheld the guilty verdict in the case but ordered a
new sentencing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross entered an agreement with a special prosecutor, C.
Robert Satti, in March in which Ross said his crime had aggravating
factors that warranted the death penalty and no mitigating factors.
That pact would have allowed the state to skip the sentencing
hearing and hasten Ross' execution.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Thomas Miano of Superior Court in New London threw out
the agreement in July. A new trial on the penalty phase is
scheduled for Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Ross had said he was pursuing the pact because he did not want
the families of his victims to have to endure another trial. His
lawyer, Karen Goodnow, acknowledged that Ross' wishes and
motivations were complex. ``He wants to live, and he wants to spare
the victims' families,'' Ms. Goodnow said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's last execution was on May 17, 1960.

POLLS ARE HARD TO BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA learned its first Bowl Championship Series
lesson Monday afternoon: Style counts with the computers, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins fell from No. 1 to No. 3 in the latest BCS poll
because they did not defeat last-place Stanford convincingly
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the message sent by the New York Times and USA
Today/Sagarin computer ratings, each of which dropped the Bruins
four places after a 28-24 victory, their 17th in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times computer poll, which does not include victory
margin, ranked the Bruins No. 1 for the second consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in the Sagarin and New York Times ratings _ combined
with UCLA's expected plunge in the opinion-based top-25 polls _
raised the Bruins' BCS point total from 3.04 to 6.62, behind No. 1
Ohio State and No. 2 Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``What it
tells us is, it doesn't matter if you win, you've got to do it
convincingly. Sometimes, that leads to running up the score. That
sends a bad message.''
</P>
<P>
   Two coaches apparently heard the message Saturday, and both have
scoffed at sportsmanship in the past: Florida's Steve Spurrier
ordered a reverse with 40 seconds left and a 31-7 lead over
Georgia; and Kansas State coach Bill Snyder left star quarterback
Michael Bishop in the game in the fourth quarter despite a 40-6
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it means you've got to run up the score to win the national
championship, we're doing the wrong thing,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins expected to fall in the BCS rankings after dropping
one spot in the Associated Press poll and two spots in the coaches'
poll Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not concerned with style,'' safety Tod McBride said.
``Yeah, it's disappointing to look in the papers and see we've
dropped. But we don't care if we win 2-0. As long as we keeping
winning, at the end of the year the rest will take care of
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   So they hope.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS formula combines a team's average in the top-25 polls,
its average in the computer polls and a strength-of-schedule
quotient, then adds one point for each loss. The teams with the
fewest points in the final poll (Dec. 6) will play for the national
title in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In dropping to third, the Bruins (7-0, 5-0) relinquished control
of their own destiny. There's no guarantee that four convincing
victories, beginning Saturday at Oregon State, will catapult them
past Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's alarming. We've got to get on it,'' Bruins fullback
Durell Price said. ``But we're not where we feel our Fiesta Bowl
shot is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about the bowls. I look at it like if we finish
11-0, we'll be where we should be, and that's the Fiesta Bowl. We
can't worry about playing the computers. We've got to beat Oregon
State.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's greatest advantage is the strength of its schedule, which
will affect the BCS quotient and the three computer ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins finish with Washington, USC and Miami _ a seemingly
tougher path than either Ohio State (Michigan State, Iowa,
Michigan) or Tennessee (Alabama-Birmingham, Arkansas, Kentucky,
Vanderbilt and the SEC title game).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't concerned when we were up on top and I'm not
concerned that we're a couple notches down,'' UCLA quarterback Cade
McNown said. ``We'll have a chance to prove what sort of team we
are in the next couple weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo believes the No. 1 ranking last week _ and resulting
attention _ was a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to (be distracted),'' he said. ``We're picked
No. 1 and everybody starts thinking they're better than they are.
But we've got to put that aside and seize the moment.''

FOR LOROUPE, NEW YORK IS 26 MILES OF TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trouble began on Saturday night for Tegla Loroupe
of Kenya, but she shrugged it off as tension. After consecutive
victories, she had finished seventh at the 1996 and 1997 New York
City Marathons. Now she was returning as the world record-holder
and a heavy favorite. Her stomach bothered her, but she was sure it
was just nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Sunday's race, though, she suspected again that this
would not be her day. Suffering from diarrhea, she ran in the lead
at the start, but after only 3.2 miles the cramps began in her
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the midpoint of the 26.2-mile race, Loroupe thought
about dropping out. She hung on, caught back up to the leaders and
tried to slow the pace. But she faded again, dehydrated now, and
finished third in 2 hours 30 minutes 28 seconds, more than five
minutes behind the winner, Franca Fiacconi of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   From seventh a year ago, Loroupe had improved to third on
Sunday. But third is not first. She had set the world record of 2
hours 20 minutes 47 seconds last April in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands. Now she had run nearly 10 minutes slower in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I finished,'' Loroupe said. ``For that I'm happy. I
had my doubts at 20 kilometers, but I was thinking that if I drop
out, it can become a habit. And it is a bad image.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, she owned New York. Now, nothing seems to go right. Two
years ago, she started too fast. Last year she overcompensated and
started too slow. Then this, a stomach virus.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Steinfeld, the race director, said he believed that
Loroupe may be succumbing to internal pressure to do well in New
York, which launched her career. And because she is so popular in
New York, he said, ``I think she gets caught up in the crowd, and I
don't think she stays focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe disagreed. She limited her public appearances this year
and got plenty of rest, she said. ``This time, I didn't do
anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Roberts, the race coordinator, said that a stomach virus
was going around, and that two of the favorites, Madina Biktagirova
of Russia and Irina Kazakova-Gras of France, were so affected that
they dropped out during the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she didn't have bad luck,'' Roberts said of Loroupe,
``she'd have no luck at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Thugwane's Costly Misstep
</P>
<P>
   Josia Thugwane, the 1996 Olympic champion from South Africa,
told his agent, Luis Posso, before Sunday's race that he felt he
was in world-record shape. Thugwane pushed the pace but stepped
awkwardly as the race descended the Queensboro Bridge in the 16th
mile and strained a groin muscle. By Mile 20, he dropped out, while
John Kagwe of Kenya won in 2:08:45.
</P>
<P>
   Abel Anton, the 1997 world champion from Spain, dropped out at
18 miles without explanation and was so disgusted, he caught a
plane home on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   A Record 31,456 Finishers
</P>
<P>
   Some 32,398 runners started Sunday's marathon, and an unofficial
31,456 finished, which is a record, Allan Steinfeld, the race's
director, said. The oldest male finisher was 91-year-old Sam
Gadless of the United States, who clocked in at 8:26:00. The oldest
female finisher was 83-year-old Carolina Bottichio of Italy, who
ran 8:48:15.
</P>
<P>
   Among the finishers was 31-year-old Ketil Moe of Norway, who has
cystic fibrosis, and who ran with two transplanted lungs and a
transplanted liver. Escorted by Grete Waitz of Norway, the
nine-time winner in New York, Moe crossed the finish line in 7
hours 17 minutes 54 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Why the 97 percent finishing rate in New York, where a third of
the field is local, a third national and a third international?
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of our runners come from far away and spend
thousands of dollars to come here,'' Steinfeld said. ``They'll be
damned if they aren't going to finish the race. If they drop out at
13 miles, they have no clue where they are. They might as well go
to the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions Groundless
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions arose Sunday about one runner, Roberto Barbi of
Italy, who did not show up among the leaders during the race, but
finished sixth in 2:10:55. The race's director, Allan Steinfeld,
said Monday that Barbi's time was legitimate, that he had been
trained by Orlando Pizzolato, the 1984 and 1985 winner, and that
Barbi had taken a bus to the start with other runners.

MAKING ROOM FOR MENSWEAR  
 RANDOLPH DUKE GOES IT ALONE  
 A NEW OUTPOST FOR J.P. TOD'S.
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Menswear designers, too, will now have a chance to
raise their flags above the Bryant Park tents. In February, when
American designers show en masse ahead of the Europeans (this
season the New York shows bracketed the European shows), menswear
will also be on the schedule. The announcement was made Monday by
Fern Mallis, executive director of Seventh on Sixth, organizer of
the Bryant Park shows. The men's shows will run from Feb. 11 to 13;
Feb. 14 is being suggested for designers who want to combine
menswear and women's wear on the same runway, and the women's
collections will be shown from Feb. 15 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   The combined shows answer designers' concerns about having to
present a women's-wear collection two weeks after showing menswear,
a problem that arose when Americans switched from their traditional
March or April presentations. Some retailers and foreign editors
had also complained about the inconvenience of traveling to New
York twice within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to designers of participating in Seventh on Sixth _ now
$7,500 to $32,500, depending on tent size _ is also expected to
fall, because the combined shows are expected to attract more
sponsors, Ms. Mallis said.
</P>
<P>
   Designers who abandoned the tents because of the cost, and those
who bid farewell for esthetic reasons, will be urged to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will bring back some of the bandits who left us,'' said
Stan Herman, the president of Seventh on Sixth. ``I think it will
be beneficial for the menswear industry, which has been so
fractured. We've never been able to offer them the park. The best
thing is, the park is allowing us to take the extra three or four
days. In February, no one is in the park, not even the pigeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Duke Solos
</P>
<P>
   Not everything intriguing in fashion this week is on the runway.
Randolph Duke, the designer who resuscitated the Halston brand
before departing abruptly last summer, is quietly showing a capsule
collection in his Chelsea loft.
</P>
<P>
   Duke seems to have landed on his feet after leaving his Halston
job, following the label's purchase by new investors. Although his
widest recognition has come from the work he did at Halston, before
that Duke had his own signature label. So far, he is underwriting
his new line himself, but he said Monday that he expects to sign a
deal with an investor shortly.
</P>
<P>
   His new collection for spring consists of about 25 evening-wear
pieces. ``It ranges from what I consider more separates, component
pieces, to gala gowns _ drop-dead entrance makers,'' Duke said.
There are T-shirts of viscose spandex and gowns of stretch silk
crepe or chiffon, in shades of sea foam, gray, white or black.
Retail prices are from $850 to $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Duke said he has learned from the experience of preparing a
collection directly for retailers, rather than for the runway.
``When you're not showing on runways, it's different,'' he said.
``Retailers don't buy groups, they buy singles, so it's almost
about each dress being in a different color.''
</P>
<P>
   Another J.P. Tod's
</P>
<P>
   Diego Della Valle, the Italian shoe designer, is reaping the
rewards of the current interest in shoes and handbags. For many of
fashion's top companies, like Gucci and Prada, accessories are
outselling clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Della Valle, who a few years ago shifted his focus from his
delicate signature footwear to the more functional J.P. Tod's line,
will open a new J.P. Tod's store at 650 Madison Ave. (61st Street)
in February, carrying shoes and a handbag line.
</P>
<P>
   The store is within four blocks of an existing J.P. Tod's
emporium at 41 East 57th St. (Madison Avenue), which will remain
open, selling footwear exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   The Hogan collection, a more youthful athletic-inspired line of
footwear, introduced in the United States last year, will not be
sold in the new store. Plans are to open the first Hogan store in
America in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough space to display the entire line, since
the bags have been so successful,'' said Claudio Castiglioni, chief
executive of Diva Inc., Della Valle's U.S. subsidiary. Worldwide
sales for the company reached $400 million this year, Castiglioni
said.

TV SPORTS: PLAYERS HEAVE AIR BALL WITH BOYCOTT THREAT 
 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 BY RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC and Turner Sports are not quaking at the prospect of
National Basketball Association players boycotting interview
requests during the lockout and then during the season, whenever it
is to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a serious threat,'' said Craig Sager, a Turner
reporter. ``It came out of uneducated comments. I don't think
they'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they plan no comment,'' Bob Costas, NBC's lead
play-by-play announcer, said with a barely contained chuckle, ``I
have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we see Michael Jordan barring NBC's Ahmad Rashad from a
pajama party where he would exclusively reveal his irksome hangnail
to his faithful Boswell, and Karl Malone shunning Sager after
scoring 45 points. Just envision Malone telling Sager, ``Forget it,
Craig, I don't like your network's contract.''
</P>
<P>
   How many future Bartlett's quotations will be lost to this venal
plot against public discourse? If Bill Wennington doesn't tell
NBC's Jim Gray his innermost thoughts as his perspiration drenches
the microphone, can we survive?
</P>
<P>
   Think of this: Charles Barkley turning down a chance to chat _
about anything. Even about deciding not to talk. As soon as he
heard the boycott threat, Doc Rivers, the TNT analyst, ascribed it
to a small group of agents. ``I just didn't think it would hold
water,'' said the former Knick, who has been working out in San
Antonio with the Spurs' David Robinson and Tim Duncan. ``Tensions
are high, but they won't be once things get settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Rivers added, ``As long as Barkley's around, we're
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of a possible boycott came out of a players' meeting in Las
Vegas last month. The players were incensed that NBC and Turner
were paying the NBA in full this season, which is required during a
lockout. If NBC and Turner did not agree to such a payment clause,
the NBA would have found willing customers elsewhere ``and the
players would be talking to CBS and ESPN,'' Rivers said.
</P>
<P>
   For the perfidy of making guaranteed payments _ bankrolling the
lockout and emboldening the league to be resolute, it is alleged _
players talked of denying NBC, TNT and TBS their oratory. In Las
Vegas, Patrick Ewing, the union president, said, ``When all is said
and done, this lockout will have cost the players a lot of money
and NBC's role will not be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny how Ewing never made public his distaste for the same
lockout payment clause in past NBC and Turner contracts that helped
his salary soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players who are informed know most of the money we pay
goes to them,'' said Sager, who was at the Las Vegas meeting.
``When I was there, they didn't shun me. Someone kiddingly said to
me, `There's the enemy.' I interviewed 300 players last year. They
know I'm there to publicize their achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   And to provide a forum for future work. On Turner's roster are
former players like Rivers and Reggie Theus. On NBC's roster are
Isiah Thomas, Bill Walton, Steve Jones and Matt Guokas. After last
season, NBC jettisoned John Salley, who had replaced Julius Erving,
as a studio show analyst.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Turner have each made the first payments on their
contracts, which total $2.6 billion over four years. NBC will be
repaid for missed games (the network's season does not start until
Christmas Day) with rebates on their next three years' fees.
Turner, which started missing games Monday night, will get games
added to its TBS schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The damage of a boycott to NBC and Turner would be small. There
will be holes in the studio shows where relaxed player interviews,
some illuminating, some dull, will have to be filled. But as a
whole, being denied the cavalcade of pre-game and post-game player
talk is like being barred by your mother from playing your CD of
Sebastian Cabot singing ``Blowin' in the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Players not playing during the lockout harms NBC and Turner by
forcing them to insert replacement programs that generate reduced
advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But players not talking? Can you say ``empty, misguided
threat''?
</P>
<P>
   `Monday Night' Strike
</P>
<P>
   If ``Monday Night Football'' looked less technically
sophisticated last night, it was because of the 24-hour strike
called against ABC by the National Association of Broadcast
Employees and Technicians. Since last season, ABC has sent a
backup, nonunion production crew to all ``Monday Night'' sites in
case of a strike. But ``Monday Night Blast,'' the pre-game show
that emanates from Baltimore, was not to be seen because that crew
does not have a backup. Instead the pre-game show was scheduled to
come from Veterans Stadium.
