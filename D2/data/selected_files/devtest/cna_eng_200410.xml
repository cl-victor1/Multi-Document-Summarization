SETTLEMENT OF TAIWAN ISSUE MUST BE ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES: POWELL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By W.C. Lin and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell
said Thursday that the ultimate settlement of the Taiwan issue has to
be acceptable to the people of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Powell made the comments while responding to media questions at a
joint press conference held after he had a working lunch with
mainland Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, who was recently in
New York to deliver a speech at the 59th General Assembly of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support our 'one China' policy, which has stood the
test of time, " Powell said, adding that the policy "has benefited
the people in Taiwan, the people in the mainland, the international
community and certainly the United States."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the United States does not support Taiwan
independence as this would be inconsistent with its obligations and
commitments to its "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that his meeting with Foreign Minister Li was his
fourth this year, Powell said that as always, they talked about the
Taiwan issue, which is of uppermost concern to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"I once again reaffirmed our 'one China' policy and the three
comuniques and also noted our obligations under the Taiwan Relations
Act and reaffirmed what President Bush has said a number of times,
that we do not support any movement toward independence on the part
of Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Li said that Beijing is ready to do its utmost to
realize a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question. However, he
strongly reiterated China's opposition to Taiwan independence, saying
that "we will never, ever allow anyone to use any means to separate
Taiwan from China."

PREMIER CALLS FOR CALM OVER RED FIRE ANT PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun on Friday called for
calm among the public in the face of the spread of the imported red
fire ant from Taiwan's farmlands to urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Yu said that the government has
set up a red fire ant prevention center to systematically battle the
serious new pest problem. The red fire ant was first detected in
Taiwan in September of last year in the southern county of Chiayi and
in the northern county of Taoyuan.
</P>
<P>
Yu urged the people not to panic and the media to refrain from
sensationalizing related reports. He said the media should instead
inform the public about the problem and how to counter it, especially
how to protect children.
</P>
<P>
The red fire ant, which is native to southern Brazil, was
detected in Taipei City for the first time four days ago.
Environmental protection and public health officials said they have
no clues about when and how the red fire ant spread to Taiwan's
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Council of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal and
Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine said they believe that the red
fire ant -- which becomes aggressive when its anthills are disturbed
-- was probably brought into Taipei City via potted plants or
landscaping sod.
</P>
<P>
The red fire ant was first spotted in Taipei City on a traffic
island on Chunghua Road, where about 16 anthills of the dangerous
pest were found Tuesday. Although environmental protection personnel
from Taipei City Government quickly applied pesticide to the area, 20
new anthills up to 3 centimeters high were discovered Thursday. It is
estimated that close to a hectare of lawn on the traffic island has
been occupied by the ants.
</P>
<P>
Farmers consider the insect a nuisance because of its painful
sting. Although the ants do not endanger crops, their bite is
annoying, and for a small number of people who are allergic to the
ants, a single bite could be fatal.
</P>
<P>
The council called a meeting Thursday to build an islandwide
monitoring, information and prevention system to battle the pest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Administration has said
that it will host seminars around the island to help local
environmental officials to check the spread of the pesky insect.

ACADEMIA SINICA RESEARCHER TO BE NEW MAC VICE CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) has decided to name Huang Wei-feng, a scholar versed in
European affairs, as its third vice chairman, a senior official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Huang, an associate researcher at Academia Sinica's European and
American Studies, is scheduled to assume the MAC post next week, "
said Chiu Tai-san, the MAC's first vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
hopes Huang can help make its policy formulation more comprehensive
and circumspect, Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan-mainland China relations are not just an issue
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait but also an issue of
international concern, Chiu said the MAC must care about the views of
major countries around the world, including the 25-state European
Union.
</P>
<P>
"Huang's European academic background will contribute to our
policy planning work," Chiu added.
</P>
<P>
Huang, 40, has a master's degree from the prestigious
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a doctoral degree in
political science from Oxford University. He is noted for his
research in contemporary Western political theories, American and
British politics, European Union politics, election strategies, and
political sociology.
</P>
<P>
Huang, a son of former Central Election Commission Chairman Huang
Shih-cheng, is expected to play an active role in mainland policy
planning and communications with the international community
regarding Taiwan's stance and basic policies on cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Huang joined a Taiwan delegation to brief E.U.
countries that President Chen Shui-bian's plan to hold a "defensive
referendum" along with the March 20 presidential election had nothing
to do with changing Taiwan's status quo.
</P>
<P>
Huang lost a bid for a legislative seat in a Changhua County
constituency in 1998. At that time, he was only 33 years old. Huang's
father once served as Changhua County magistrate for two terms.

TAIWAN, OHIO TO BOLSTER BIOTECH COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ohio Governor Bob Taft is currently leading
a large delegation from the U.S. state to promote bilateral exchanges
in Taiwan, particularly in research, development and
commercialization of bioscience.
</P>
<P>
Taft has led a multi-dimensional effort to make bioscience a
pillar in the economic future of Ohio, which is one the strongholds
of bioscience and biotechnology in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Members of Taft's entourage took part in a forum being sponsored
by Taiwan's Development Center for Biotechnology (DCB) Friday on
Ohio's international efforts to promote the research and development
cooperation as well as commercialization of the state's bioscience
and technology.
</P>
<P>
The members include executives from contract research
organization big names such as Battelle Memorial Institute; Omeris
Bioscience; Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc.; and Ohio University's Edison
BioTechnology Center.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jui-lien, president of the non-profit Development Center
for Biotechnology, and John Lewis, director of Omeris' International
Business Development department, are scheduled to sign a letter of
intent later Friday to bolster R&amp;D as well as commercialization of
bioscience and technology between Taiwan and the state of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will vow to increase bilateral cooperation in the
fields of bioenergy, pharmaceuticals, life sciences, virus tests,
molecular biology, commercialization of R&amp; D results, and fund
raising techniques, DCB officials said.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the DCB-Ohio cooperation -- featuring R&amp;D
cooperation, product development, clinical applications and
joint-venture operations -- will help promote Ohio-originating
bioscience products, technologies and services to the vast Asian
market using Taiwan as a gateway.
</P>
<P>
Taft and the Ohio mission arrived in Taiwan Thursday for a
three-day trade-promotion trip. The mission -- made up of about 50
representatives from more than 30 companies and organizations from
Ohio -- is visiting mainly to identify local companies interested in
investing in the state and to promote the state's exports to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is one of Ohio's top-20 export markets, and advanced
technology collaboration between the two sides has been growing in
recent years. In 2003, Ohio's exports to Taiwan totaled some
US$201.48 million.
</P>
<P>
Taft met with Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou at Taipei City Hall
Thursday evening. He is scheduled to meet with President Chen
Shui-bian at the Presidential Office later Friday afternoon. Taft and
his group are set to depart Taiwan Saturday.

BEIJING URGED TO DISCUSS TWO-WAY CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) won't rule out the possibility of two-way cross-strait
charter flight services for the 2005 Chinese New Year holiday, but
Beijing must send an envoy so that the two sides can discuss related
matters as soon as possible, an MAC spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said that charter flight services
were launched two years ago on a trial basis during the holiday
period for the convenience of Taiwan businesspeople operating in
mainland China, but only Taiwan carriers were allowed to operate via
a third location, such as Macau or Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Noting that mainland China has requested the mainland Chinese
carriers be allowed to join the cross-strait charter flights and on a
non-stop basis during the holiday period, Chiu said the MAC doesn't
rule out the possibility of such flights, but added that the two
sides must first sit down at the negotiating table to discuss related
matters.
</P>
<P>
Two-way cross-strait charter flights were not opened during the
2004 Chinese Lunar New Year holiday season due to Beijing's refusal
to engage in bilateral consultations.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait charter flight services during the Chinese New Year
holiday period are seen as important as there are some 500,000 to one
million Taiwanese businesspeople operating in mainland China.

ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN DO NOT VIOLATE "ONE CHINA" POLICY: U.S. OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By W.C. Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States' policy of selling
weapons to Taiwan has always been based on the island's self-defense
needs and have not violated Washington's "one-China" policy, U.S.
Secretary of State Colin Powell said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Powell made the remarks in response to media questions at a joint
press conference held after he had a working lunch with mainland
Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, who visited New York to deliver
a speech at the 59th General Assembly of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed at the conference the mainland's firm opposition to
the sale of arms by any foreign country to Taiwan, Powell defended
the U.S. policy of continuing to sell weapons to the island.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Beijing does not think such sales are in the
interests of its "peaceful efforts" to resolve the so-called "Taiwan
question, " nor do they serve the interests of peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait and the interests of those countries who are
prepared to sell weapons to the country.
</P>
<P>
Powell said he told Li that "our obligations under our domestic
law with respect to the Taiwan Relations Act in our judgment are not
in any way inconsistent with our one China policy and our obligations
under that one China policy and the three communiques."
</P>
<P>
"We always measure what is sold to Taiwan on the basis of what
they need for their self-defense, and I think our policy has served
both nations, the United States and China, very, very well -- and
Taiwan very, very well -- over the course of a number of years, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and U.S. are discussing arms sale plans and Taiwan's
Cabinet has proposed a special budget of NT$610.8 billion over 15
years to purchase arms, including eight diesel-electric submarines,
six sets of Patriot-III anti- missile systems and 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft from the United States.

A nationwide campaign encouraging Taiwan
people to turn in illegal firearms and ammunition concluded

NATIONAL ASSETS OUTPACE NATIONAL DEBTS: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that
Taiwan's national assets still outpace its debts by more than NT$10
trillion.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks to refute an independent lawmaker's claim
that Taiwan's national debts are approaching NT$12 trillion, which
translates into a debt of NT$520,000 for each Taiwan citizen.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Su Ying-guei claimed at a Legislative Yuan
interpellation session that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration has not honored its promise to balance the central
government's budget and has even widened the public debt in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
This year alone, Su said, the DPP administration has requested a
total special budget of more than NT$1.1 trillion to finance its new
"Ten Major Construction Projects" and arms procurement projects. "The
figure surpasses the accumulated special budget earmarked in the past
seven years," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Su said the central government's debts stood at NT$2.6 trillion
in 2000 when the DPP came to power. The debt surged to NT$3.3
trillion in 2003 and will break the NT$3.9 trillion mark this year,
Su said, adding that if potential national debts are included, the
aggregated national debts are approaching NT$12 trillion.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the NT$610.8 billion special budget over a 15-year
period for procuring eight diesel-electric submarines, 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft and six PAC III Patriot anti-missile
batteries from the United States, Su claimed that it would add up to
a financial burden for posterity.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that President Chen Shui-bian opposed a NT$50 billion
special budget proposal to purchase 150 F-16 jet fighters back in
1993, when Chen was a legislator.
</P>
<P>
"Chen's opposition indicated that using special budget to finance
arms procurements is unreasonable and would 'hollow out' the
government's finances and undermine the existing fiscal system,"
according to Su.
</P>
<P>
In response, Yu said the DPP administration had to propose a
special budget plan for the arms procurement project mainly because
of constraints set forth in the new Public Debts Law.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yu said, the government will pay the NT$610.8 billion
arms procurement bill over a 15-year period. "The arrangement will
enable us not to leave any debts to posterity, " he said, adding that
the nation still has more than in NT$29 trillion in assets.
</P>
<P>
Yu further urged Su to take the changing times into consideration
when commenting on the government's policy initiatives, pointing out
that when Chen opposed a special budget to finance the F-16
procurement plan, the nation had not yet implemented a public debt
law to restrict the government's floating of state bonds to finance
major arms procurement or infrastructure construction projects.

COA HOPES TO CONTROL SPREAD OF FIRE ANTS BY END OF YEAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) aims to
control the spread of red fire ants, an alien species, by the end of
the year, COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks when he observed ways of controlling the
ants in a COA-sponsored seminar held by the Taoyuan County Farmers'
Association in northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Amid heightened alert in the wake of the discovery of the ants in
Taipei over the past few days, Lee said Premier Yu Shyi-kun has
instructed the formation of a supra-government agency team to
coordinate with local governments to grapple the problem of the
imported pests.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he and Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lung have
reached an agreement to purchase up to 12,000 kg of related
environmental and farmland pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the COA is adopting a two-stage strategy. In the
first stage, the COA aims to control the proliferation of the pests
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the next stage, the COA will develop even more effective ways
to kill the pests, taking reference from the approach of the United
States and Australia, in the hope that they can be exterminated in
two or three years.
</P>

Lee noted that since April this year, the ants have made inroads
into Taiwan. Currently, Taoyuan, Taipei and Chiayi counties, as well
as Taipei City, have reported the pests. No reports have come from
other cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Lee Cheng-nan of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party said Friday that unidentified black bugs have
recently plagued the farmlands of Kuangying township in Taoyuan,
becoming a nagging problem for residents.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the bugs, which can inflict a painful bite, have come in
great multitudes, not only invading farmland, but also infesting
households.
</P>
<P>
The speed at which the bugs can consume crops is especially
stunning, he went on, citing a local farmer who claimed that his more
than 2,400 pings (one ping equals to about 3.3 square meters) of yams
were eaten completely in about seven days.

CAPITAL RATED TOP BUS SERVICE IN TAIPEI FOR 10TH CONSECUTIVE TIME
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capital Bus was rated the top bus company in
Taipei Friday in terms of services and vehicle condition, according
to a report by the Taipei city government.
</P>
<P>
Capital Bus received a score of 92.6 points to win the title for
the 10th consecutive time in the rankings rated by the Taipei City
Bureau of Transportation aimed at monitoring bus services in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Transportation Director Lin Chih-ying said that Capital
Bus is considered by many Taipei residents as the best bus company in
the city, not only because its buses are newer and cleaner, but more
importantly because its drivers, who are required to wear ties and
freshly ironed white shirts, do not treat the passengers rudely.
</P>
<P>
Capital Bus is also the only bus company in Taipei to require
that its drivers wear small microphones on duty to announce the name
of every stop along their routes, enabling passengers to know where
they are.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, some Capital drivers on certain routes have
also been announcing the name of every stop in English.
</P>
<P>
Drivers from Capital have registered the highest rate of
enrollment in English conversation lessons that have been offered by
the Taipei City Drivers' Training Center.
</P>
<P>
An official of Capital attributed the keen interest demonstrated
by the company's bus drivers to several factors, including that
Capital offers paid leave to those who enroll in the classes, as well
as paying their tuition and providing a small allowance to give them
the feeling that "they are not on their own" and have the company's
support.
</P>
<P>
He added that many of the Capital drivers themselves feel that
they need to hone their English conversation skills for their job, as
the company operates buses on routes that include the up-scale Min
Sheng Residential District in eastern Taipei where many foreigners
live, as well as routes around the Ta An Forest Park and Yong Kang
Street, leisure spots for many foreigners in Taipei.

NUMBER OF TAIWAN'S LOW-INCOME FAMILIES ON RISE: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of Taiwan's low-income families
had reached 78,000, involving 192,000 people, as of the end of June,
according to the newest government statistics released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The tallies compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , show that the figures
account for 1.1 percent of the total number of Taiwan's families and
0.85 precent of the country's overall population, respectively.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,816 people, a decrease of 5.3 percent from the
previous year's level, in the low-income families are individuals who
rely solely on government subsidies as they are unable to work and
have no family assets or income, according to the DGBAS tallies.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45,034 people, down by 0.9 percent from the
year-earlier level, are individuals in low-income families who earn
less than NT$7,750 (US$228) a month, while 143,372 people, up by 11.7
percent compared to the previous year's level, are citizens from
low-income families who earn an income ranging between NT$ 7,751 and
NT$13,797 per month.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials attributed the growth in the third group of
low-income people to greater government care for the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the government spent NT$1.37
billion (about US$40 million) in subsidies for low-income families,
as well as NT$430 million in subsidies for school tuition for
children from poor families.

ARMS PROCUREMENT CRITICAL TO CROSS-STRAIT PEACE: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian defended his
administration's NT$610.8 billion arms procurement plan Friday,
saying that maintaining Taiwan's defense capability is a prerequisite
to safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with a U.S. academic
delegation headed by Henry E. Catto, chairman of the Atlantic Council
of the United States, which id dedicated to promoting the
effectiveness of the U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that beefing up Taiwan's defense capabilities and
maintaining a balance in military strength are crucial to keeping
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, Chen said Taiwan must
purchase advanced defensive weapons to protect its national security
and dignity.
</P>
<P>
"We believe maintaining our defense capabilities is the biggest
support for our future negotiations with mainland China, " Chen said,
adding that arms procurement has nothing to do with promoting Taiwan
independence. "Beijing should not link our arms procurement plan to
boosting independence because they are completely unrelated."
</P>
<P>
The president told his guests that the mainland often accuses
Taiwan of provocation and alleges that every Taiwan move, ranging
from arms procurement, bids for joining international organizations
or activities, abbreviation of the national title to constitutional
re-engineering, are actions designed to promote Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing's accusations are all wrong and not true, " Chen said,
adding he has on many occasions explained that his administration's
constitutional re-engineering plan is aimed at creating a modern and
efficient administrative system and will not touch on the sensitive
sovereignty, territory and unification vs. independence issues. After
more than 50 years of development, he said, Taiwan needs a new viable
constitution that fits its present situation.
</P>
<P>
As to Taiwan's pursuit of "international space, " Chen said the
quest reflects the Taiwan people's desire for respect in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot understand why mainland China would oppose our
participation in international security dialogue and the global
campaign against terrorism and the spread of contagious diseases, "
Chen said, adding: "Taiwan's participation can contribute more to the
common well-being of mankind and global peace."
</P>
<P>
Chen also cried foul about Beijing's criticism of his
administration's decision to use "Taiwan" as the abbreviated form of
the country's formal title -- the Republic of China -- asking why
calling Taiwan Taiwan is a provocation.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming that Taiwan looks forward to forging a stable
relationship with the mainland for peaceful development, Chen
stressed that such a relationship should be developed in line with
the principles of democracy, parity and peace.
</P>
<P>
He further said Taiwan does not have any preset stance on
resuming cross-strait dialogue. "While we hope mainland Chinese
President Hu Jintao demonstrates a new leadership style and shows
more flexibility in dealing with cross-strait relations, we will not
harbor unrealistic illusions before the one-party dictatorship
undergoes a fundamental change," he added.

An apartment complex in Taipei County's
Hsinchuang area that was destroyed in the disastrous earthquake of
Sept. 21, 1999 finally reopened to residents Friday after
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
A housewarming ceremony was held to celebrate the rebirth of the
complex, which has discarded its old name of "Doctors' Home" and has
been renamed "Peaceful Sail."
</P>
<P>
Li Kuo-min, head of a committee coordinating the complex's
reconstruction, said the residents shared a common memory of sadness
and suffering in this place, but they are now "standing up" again to
welcome their new life ahead.
</P>
<P>
Li thanked the assistance of the Taipei county government,
financing from the 921 reconstruction foundation, support from a
group of volunteer lawyers and donations from the general public,
which made the reconstruction possible.
</P>
<P>
The apartment complex was originally comprised of 12 stories with
137 housing units. The earthquake left 45 residents dead, 28 injured
and another 136 homeless.

PRESIDENT INVITES HEADS OF FIVE YUANS FOR A MEETING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has invited the
heads of the five government branches to discuss major issues,
probably next week, Presidential Office staff said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Amid media reports that Chen has invited the heads of the
Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination and Control Yuans for a
dinner meeting next Monday, the officials said they hope it can take
place later in the week.
</P>
<P>
Chen last met the five heads in early July to inquire about their
views on setting up a commission to probe the March 19 assassination
attempt, as well as other political issues.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen also showed them the gunshot wounds on
his abdomen, hoping to end doubts surrounding the shooting which
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People
First Party claimed to have been staged to help him win the bitterly
contested election.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Chen promulgated a special statute passed by the
Legislative Yuan to allow the formation of a commission to
investigate the shooting, but he added a rare note that while the
government supports the investigation, it should not be
unconstitutional. Since the statute has generated major
constitutional controversy, it should seek a ruling from the Council
for Grand Justices with regard to its constitutionality, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also proposed to give a state-of-the-nation address to the
Legislative Yuan to address such major issues as arms procurement,
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations, and peaceful cross-Taiwan
Strait development, but said he will not accept questioning by the
legislators, pointing out that under the Constitution, they can only
question the premier and the government heads.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition "pan-blue alliance" legislators claim it is up
to the legislature to invite the president to give such a report and
that he should also accept questioning.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office would not confirm if all the recent
developments will be on the agenda of the proposed meeting, but only
stressed that the president "will discuss major national issues of
mutual concern with the heads of the five yuans."

Tony Blair is to have a heart operation today after a period in

He broke the news himself last night to three television channels

before what would be his fourth term.

Financial Times: Merck hit as $2.5bn painkiller is withdrawn.

Shares in Merck, the US pharmaceuticals giant, plunged by 27 per
cent on Thursday after the company withdrew Vioxx, its $2.5bn-a-year
painkiller, because of fears that it increases the risk of heart
attacks and strokes.

Merck said it was taking the drug off the market voluntarily
after a patient trial showed that those taking Vioxx were twice as
likely to suffer cardiac problems than patients taking a placebo.

</P>
<P>
Trying to make a case for the government's NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.07 billion) arms procurement from the United States, Yu said
last Saturday that "Taiwan will be safe if it has the capabilities to
counterattack Shanghai in the event of the mainland attacking Taipei
and Kaohsiung."
</P>
<P>
The argument was reported by local media as a "balance of terror"
theory and drew criticism from Beijing authorities that Taiwan was
attempting to "provoke a war" and "promote independence with military
power."
</P>
<P>
Also during the session, opposition People First Party Legislator
Lin Te-fu challenged the legitimacy of the arms procurement, pointing
out that a referendum held on the issue of enhancing the country's
weaponry on March 20 was determined invalid because of a low voter
turnout.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Yu said the procurement had been planned before the
referendum and that the referendum was "declaratory" in nature.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he will take the responsibility if the government breaks
the law, urging the lawmaker not to underestimate the wisdom of the
Taiwanese people.

PREMIER YU FORECAST 4.5 PERCENT ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR 2005
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday Taiwan's
economic growth rate for 2005 is projected at 4.5 percent despite a
slowdown in global economic development.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan plenary session, Yu said
the global economy grew fast in the first half of this year thanks to
robust expansion in the U.S. and major Asian economies. The growth,
however, has lost some steam since the middle of the year due to
continued oil price hikes and rising interest rates in major
countries.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Yu said, Taiwan's exports -- a major
driving force behind Taiwan's economic growth, may return to normal
growth from the unusually robust growth seen this year. Consequently,
he added, the government forecasts a 4.5 percent growth rate for the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, Taiwan registered 7.2 percent growth in the first
half of this year with the annual growth reaching 5.9 percent, the
highest in seven years.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, Yu said, Taiwan's
unemployment rate dropped to 4.5 percent, the lowest in four years.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the government's 2005 budget plan, Yu said the
projected expenditure will increase 2.4 percent from this year's
level to reach NT$1.64 trillion, while the revenue will increase 3.9
percent to NT$1.4 trillion. The budget gap will be filled by floating
state bonds and by surplus budgets left in previous years, Yu added.

TAIWAN EYEING OPTO-ELECTRONICS TALENT FROM JAPAN

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is seeking to recruit skilled
individuals from Japan's hi-tech sector for its domestic
opto-electronics industry, a spokesman for the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government agencies have maintained contacts with about
200 professionals in Japan's opto-electronics sector after an
official recruitment delegation visited Tokyo, New York, Chicago,
Dallas, Los Angeles and San Francisco in late September, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Japan's hi-tech workforce is highly competitive and
that some 200 of them have shown interest in coming to work in
Taiwan, he said that government authorities will further work out
preparations and arrangements to make it possible for them to
relocate.
</P>
<P>
Citing CEPD statistics, he said that the supply-demand gap in
Taiwan's hi-tech spectrum is deteriorating fast. He pointed out that
domestic high-tech companies will need about 248,000 professionals
with an advanced education over the next three years, while supply is
estimated at 198,000, resulting in a shortfall of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities are actively promoting the
opto-electronics industry, which has been targeted by the Cabinet in
its flagship "two-trillion, two-star" program that also includes the
biotechnology and digital-content industries.

PREMIER CALLS FOR SINGAPORE COOPERATION IN KEEPING CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-lun urged Singapore Friday
to cooperate with Taiwan in preserving the longstanding cordial
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the appeal in a media statement. It marked the first time
that Yu publicly touched on the Taiwan-Singapore relation issue since
MInister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen's verbal gaffe.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan and Singapore share a common language and
similar social customs and cultural backgrounds, Yu said the two
countries have long enjoyed a cordial relationship and have always
helped each other.
</P>
<P>
"The Republic of China government and people have cherished the
enduring friendship with Singapore, " Yu said in the news statement.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Yu said the continuation of congenial relations
requires concerted efforts by both sides based on the universal
principle of "equal national sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
"We should respect each other's sovereignty, " Yu said, adding
that both sides should refrain from interfering with internal affairs
of the other.
</P>
<P>
As to Minister Chen's verbal gaffe, Yu said he has directed the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to strengthen communications and
coordination with Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"The MOFA should more clearly expound on our official policy
goals and stances, " Yu said, adding that he looks forward to seeing
Taiwan and Singapore continue reinforcing bilateral exchanges and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the MOFA issued a statement in the evening urging
local people to view the country's "relations with Singapore in a
rational and calm manner."
</P>
<P>
The MOFA made the call after 20-plus local demonstrators set fire
to a Singaporean flag in the southern port city of Kaohsiung earlier
in the day, protesting recent comments by the city-state's foreign
minister who warned that Taiwan's pro-independence supporters are
risking a war with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"We must treasure our friendship with Singapore, " MOFA said in
the statement issued after the flag-burning protest. The ministry
further said it will ask the nation's representative office in
Singapore to brief the city-state on Taiwan's basic stance.
</P>
<P>
Singaporean Foreign Minister George Yeo gave a speech at the U.N.
in New York last week in which he blamed cross-Taiwan Strait tensions
on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yeo claimed that cross-strait relations "went from bad to worse"
while pro-independence forces in Taiwan became "increasingly
adventurous" during the term of former President Lee Teng-hui, who
has described himself as "Moses leading his people out of Egypt."
</P>
<P>
Yeo further said the international community should not allow
"the deteriorating relationship" across the Taiwan Strait to get out
of control and warned that the pro-independence movement in Taiwan is
likely to trigger a war with the mainland and upset stability in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In response, Minister Chen took advantage of a meeting with a
group of pro-independence activists on Monday to express his
displeasure with Yeo's statements.
</P>
<P>
Chen described Singapore as "the size of a piece of snot" and
said Yeo was pandering to mainland China by unfairly criticizing
Taiwan.

INTEREST RATE HIKES MAY AFFECT STOCK MARKET IN SHORT TERM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent decision by Taiwan's central bank
to raise its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point is
expected to cause a short-term impact on the domestic stock market,
market watchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Their analysis came after the Taipei-based Central Bank of China
(CBC) announced a day earlier that it will raise its key interests
rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, making the discount rate 1.625
percent, the accommodation with collateral rate 2 percent and the
short-term accommodation rate 3.875 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CBC said it made the move to tackle looming inflationary
pressures arising from contagiously rising oil prices since late last
year in the international market.
</P>
<P>
It was the CBC's first interest rate hike since 2000, when the
domestic stock market began to plummet from its full swing at near
10,000 points, analysts said, adding that it is an indication that
the historically low interests rates in the home market will
gradually bottom out.
</P>
<P>
The experts pointed out that the move is set to have a negative
impact on the domestic bourse on the grounds that the rate increases
will unavoidably add pressure to companies' operating costs, because
most of them are capital-intensive and export-oriented businesses.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the domestic stock market will fall in the
coming months, but claimed that its middle- and long-term performance
will mainly depend on in which cycle the bourse is for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the export sector could get hurt if the
interests rate raises are too fierce.
</P>
<P>
However, they also pointed out that foreign capital could not
enter Taiwan should the CBC fail to have made the move to plug the
interest gap.
</P>
<P>
The United States has three times adjusted its key interests
rates upward since late June, with the latest being made last week.

POLITICS, NOT ARMS ARE STICKING POINT FOR NEGOTIATIONS: KMT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political differences are keeping Taiwan and
mainland China away from the negotiating table and not the current
issue over Taiwan' s U.S. arms procurement plan, a Kuomintang (KMT)
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Rung-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland Affairs
Department said as long as political differences exist, negotiations
between Taiwan and China are impossible no matter how many weapons
Taiwan acquires.
</P>
<P>
Disputing President Chen Shui-bian's claims earlier in the day
that Taiwan's proposed arms procurement will give the country the
capability to negotiate with the mainland from a strong position,
Chang asked whether anybody would be convinced that China's
deployment of missiles targeting Taiwan is only to facilitate
negations?
</P>
<P>
Citing as an example, Chang said when former U.S. President
George Bush approved the sale of 150 F-16 jet fighters to Taiwan in
1992, Taiwan and the mainland had already engaged in negotiations for
more than a year, which led to the first meeting of Koo Cheng-fu and
Wang Dohan, the chief negotiators for Taiwan and the mainland in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chang suggested that President Chen Shui-bian has offered to give
a state-of-the-nation report to the Legislative Yuan to make a case
for the arms procurement package in an attempt to boost the campaign
for a certain presidential candidate in the United States, and his
claim that the weapons will give Taiwan the wherewithal to open
negotiations with the mainland is unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
The truth is, Chang cautioned, the more weapons on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait amid the absence of contacts between Taiwan and the
mainland, the greater the possibility of military conflict.

PRESIDENT CHEN REFUSES TO APPOINT MEMBERS OF INVESTIGATION COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian turned down a
request from the Legislative Yuan Friday to appoint nine opposition
party members and one independent to the "319 Truth Investigation
Commission, " but they will assume their positions on the commission
nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, secretary-general to the president, said at a
news conference that the president considers the statute, which
mandates the creation of the commission, to be unconstitutional and
would rather not appoint anyone. The 10 seats will be filled anyway
since the statute passed by the opposition-controlled legislature
calls for them to automatically be assigned 15 days after they have
been chosen.
</P>
<P>
Su said the president felt the statute was contradictory given
that it requires the president to appoint the members but still
allows them to take their posts even without his appointment.
</P>
<P>
The statute provides for 17 members for the commission, each of
them being named by political parties at the legislature according to
their percentage representation. As the ruling Democratic Democracy
Party (DPP) and its political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, have
boycotted the commission, only the Kuomintang and the People First
Party have named members -- nine altogether -- and one has been
appointed by an independent party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Executive Yuan urged the Council of Grand Justices
to freeze the statue while determining its constitutionality as
requested by 93 lawmakers from the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai said it is the
understanding of the Executive Yuan that the Council of the Grand
Justices will consider the case carefully, but as the statute will
serious damage the public interest, the Council should immediately
suspend it before handing down a ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Justices asked the Legislative Yuan Friday to send
representatives of the political parties involved to argue before the
Council on Oct. 14 over whether the statute should be frozen
immediately as requested by the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng promised to consult with
various political parties on the issue Monday.

EU WARNED NOT TO LIFT BAN ON ARMS SALES TO CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's Foreign Minister Tan Sun Chen has warned
the European Union not to lift its ban on arms sales to China because
it is not only morally wrong but also against European economic
interest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In an article published in the Financial Times Friday, Chen reminded the EU
that the regime behind the 1989 military crackdown on student demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square is still in power and that lifting the ban would be a positive
reward to the regime.
</P>
<P>
Chen said arms sales to China would impose costs on ordinary people
throughout Asia. For example, people in Taiwan would prefer to spend more
on social welfare, but faced with China's ever-increasing military capabilities,
they would have no choice but to use their resources in national defence.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, European weapons sales to China would slow East Asia's
economic growth and reduce opportunities for European business to expand
its Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that China already has more that 500 ballistic missiles
targeting Taiwan. "Enhancing the quality of its weapons could only magnify
China's threat to the region and embolden hardliners in Beijing. The cost of
any conflict for Europe would be grave, with around one-quarter of total EU
exports directly at risk, not including the knock-on effects from the global
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Using Taiwan again as an example, Chen said that any military conflict
would not only cost Europeans billions of euros of trade with Taiwan but also
cause massive disruption in world markets for key items such as computers
and mobile phones. "Japan, Korea and southeast Asia would suffer severely,
as indeed would China's own coastal regions, where most of the country's
recent boom has occurred."
</P>
<P>
Chen urged EU officials and European governments to take every opportunity
to impress on Beijing the need to refrain from using force.
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, offering China offensive weaponry is not the best way to
send this message," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan foreign minister reminded the EU that it is not just the United
States that is concerned about lifting the ban on arms sales to China but
rather all democratic countries in the Asia-Pacific region, because these
countries are directly in the front line. 
</P>
<P>
Chen called on EU member countries to continue engagement with China
and help it develop into a modern, peace-loving member of the international
community.

from reports on Russian national television and the business
associate of the owner of the detained fishing vessel in Russia
immediately requested that the office help in resolving the matter.

Meanwhile, under the assistance of the office, a lawyer of the
owner of the fishing boat has been sent to Russia to deal with the case.

including five Taiwanese, 23 mainland Chinese, and eight others from
Vietnam and the Philippines. All crew members have been reported
to be safe.

Los Angeles, Oct. 1 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chang Chun-hsiung, secretary-general of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), arrived in Los Angeles
Friday to attend celebrations for the party's 18th anniversary and
drum up support for the party's candidates for the year-end
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the DPP's U.S. West Coast
chapter office in Rosemead on the outskirts of Los Angeles, Chang
said he will take advantage of his current U.S. tour to campaign for
the DPP candidates for expatriate legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
Chang said all DPP legislative candidates and party workers are
making concerted efforts to win voter support ahead of the Dec. 11
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
"Our top goal is to win more than half of the seats in the new
Legislative Yuan to facilitate the DPP's political reform programs, "
Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the legislature has long been controlled by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and its ally, the
People First Party, Chang said the DPP administration has been unable
to put many of its policy initiatives into practice since it came to
power in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the DPP is determined to closely cooperate with its
ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- in the year-end elections with
the ultimate goal of winning a majority in the new legislature. A
total of 225 seats will be up for grabs, with 168 regional seats,
eight seats each for aboriginal and expatriate communities, and 41
at-large seats.
</P>
<P>
Following his Los Angeles visit, Chang will travel to Houston,
Texas to attend celebrations for the party's anniversary.

<TEXT>
<P>
A huge crowd of Kaohsiung residents took
part in the 2004 Terry Fox Run in the southern port city of Kaohsiung
Saturday to raise funds for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
The non-competitive, recreational run was organized by Kaohsiung
Medical University (KMU) . Kaohsiung City Deputy Mayor Yao Kao-chiao
and KMU President Wang Kuo-chao joined the run.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign expatriates also participated in the run through the
city's major thoroughfares to show their support for the cause.
</P>
<P>
KMU President Wang said the annual Terry Fox Run is an
international fundraiser aimed at encouraging cancer research.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the KMU is carrying out many innovative cancer
treatment research programs, Wang said financial support from the
Terry Fox Foundation has contributed much to the university's
research work and has benefited many cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan began to sponsor the annual Terry Fox Run in 1995. This
year, the event will be held in four cities around the island --
Kaohsiung, Taipei, Taichung and Hualien. The Taipei run is scheduled
for Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
The annual Terry Fox Run commemorates Terry Fox, a Canadian track
and field athlete who had his right leg amputated in 1977 at the age
of 18 due to bone cancer. He managed to run across Canada with a
prosthetic leg to raise funds for cancer research before dying of the
cancer in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Despite his death, Fox's courage, perseverance and love spread
around the world through his cross-Canada run. Nowadays, 8,000 cities
in more than 50 countries around the world hold the Terry Fox Run
annually to commemorate him and raise funds for cancer research.

PFP ANXIOUS FOR PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP)
urged lawmakers Saturday to schedule a date for President Chen
Shui-bian's state-of-the-nation address at the Legislative Yuan as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, whip of the PFP caucus in the legislature, made
the call ahead of a second consultation meeting between ruling and
opposition parties on the matter, set for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liu argued that President Chen's request to address the
legislature in person indicates that Premier Yu Shyi-kun is losing
the president's trust.
</P>
<P>
This is a "very serious matter" that lawmakers must deal with
immediately, Liu said, urging the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) to stop obstructing the progress of arranging the address over
technical details such as whether the president can take questions
from lawmakers after his address.
</P>
<P>
Chen sent a letter to the Legislative Yuan earlier this week
asking that he be permitted to give a state-of-the-nation report on
major national policies including arms procurement, Taiwan's bid to
join the United Nations and peaceful development of cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
The last inter-party consultation meeting held Thursday to
discuss the arrangements concerning the report failed to come to any
conclusion because of differences between the two sides on a number
of technical issues.
</P>
<P>
The DPP insisted that the president should not be questioned by
lawmakers after the address, saying that they can only question the
premier and Cabinet ministers according to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the PFP,
meanwhile, believed lawmakers should be allowed to debate the
president. They also claimed that it should be up to the legislature
to invite the president to give such a report, instead of the
president taking the initiative.

LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER UNSURE IF REPRESENTATIVES CAN BE CHOSEN FOR DEBATES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Saturday that he is not sure if the legislature will be able to come
up with representatives before next Tuesday to attend three open
debates on the constitutionality of a bill to investigate the March
19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after receiving an urgent letter from the
Judicial Yuan, asking the legislature to name the persons by Tuesday
for the debates of the special statute.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the legislature can only discuss the matter Monday
at the earliest, and even if the people are selected, they will need
the approval of the legislature. If the process is not completed by
Tuesday, he hopes the Judicial Yuan will "take into consideration the
reality and make some adjustment."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said that before the
alleged "lobbying" of grand justices on the matter is clear, the
impartiality of the entire Council of Grand Justices is in question,
and the Grand Justices should not ask for open debates and the
Legislative Yuan shouldn't send representatives to attend them.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee, was referring to and allegation that several grand
justices had lobbied legislators for the DPP over the statute.
</P>
<P>
On their part, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
that if the KMT won't send representatives, it shows that they are
afraid of the interpretation because they know they will lose, and
that the result will seriously affect their chances in the year-end
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, DPP whip in the legislative caucus, said legal
proceedings cannot be put on hold, and that if the KMT won't send
representatives, it is forfeiting its rights.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen grand justices said in Friday's meeting that due to the
controversy of the bill, they decided that the process of
interpretation should be as transparent as possible, and it is
necessary to hold open debates.
</P>
<P>
The first debate, scheduled for Oct. 14, will focus on whether to
put the controversial bill on hold for the time being, while the next
two sittings will be on Oct. 27 and 29 to discuss whether the statute
has violated the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Those who attend the debates will include representatives,
deputies and experts from both sides -- the one who requested the
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan asked the opposition-control legislature for a
reconsideration of the special statute passed in August, but failed
to overturn it in September. The DPP lawmakers then filed a petition
with the Council of Grand Justices, asking it to interpret whether
the special statute is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People
First Party wants an independent commission to be formed to probe the
presidential election-eve shooting, which it claims was staged to
give President Chen sympathy votes in the bitterly contested
election.
</P>
<P>
The DPP believes the commission set up under the bill will
encroach on the judiciary's powers and seriously infringe on human
rights, and will be a violation of the division of power and legal
proceeding protected by the Constitution.

The number of aborigines has increased 23.8
percent over the past decade while the nation's total population has
grown only 7 percent during the same period, the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to MOI tallies, Taiwan had 452,000 indigenous people at

In terms of administrative districts, Hualien, Taitung and
Pingtung had the largest aboriginal communities, with 48.59 percent
of aborigines living in the three counties. The offshore frontline
island of Matsu, which lies closer to mainland China than to Taiwan,
had the smallest aboriginal population of 67 individuals.
</P>
<P>
The MOI statistics also showed that the indigenous people's
"greying index" is only half that of the total population, indicating
that aborigines are generally younger than other local citizens.
</P>
<P>
The indigenous people's "greying index" is 23.01 percent, far
lower than the overall population's "greying index" of 48.05 percent.

12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Houh said his trip will mainly focus on representing National
Defense Minister Lee Jye at the annual meeting. The United
States-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference will be held in Scottsdale,
Arizona Oct. 3-5. Scottsdale is north of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
He will also give a speech at the invitation of the U.S.-Taiwan
Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Houh said during his visit to the United States, he will have no
activities related to the arms purchase. But if he has the chance to
meet with U.S. officials, he will stress to them that the arms
purchase must meet the overall interests of the nation, combat needs
as well as the monitoring of the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he will have contacts arms manufacturers in the U.S.,
Houh stressed the conference aims to address national defense, the
future of U.S. defense cooperation with Taiwan, and the defense
procurement process, and that he will "have no chance to contact the
arms manufacturers."
</P>
<P>
This year is the third in a series of conferences to address
these issues. The first conference was held in St. Petersburg,
Florida in March 2002, and the second was held in Feb. 2003, in San
Antonio, Texas.

<TEXT>
<P>
The March 19 truth investigation commission
to investigate the presidential election-eve shooting of President
Chen Shui-bian will convene its first meeting Monday, an official
of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, head of the KMT Central Policy Committee, said
that after President Chen decided not to appoint members to join the
commission, the commission was put into effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said the 10 members appointed by the Kuomintang, the People
First Party and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, will select the
conveners and decide the operational procedure and meeting venues
during the first meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission will be a supra-partisan and impartial
body, hoping that it will operate according to the special statute
passed by the Legislative Yuan to shed light on the election-eve
shooting.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-backed commission is supposed to be made up of 17
members recommended by various political parties according to their
representation in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, have refused to name
members to the commission, believing it is unconstitutional and in
violation of judicial and prosecutorial powers.

500,000TH 'NATURAL PERSON CERTIFICATE' APPLICANT TO BE AWARDED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 500,000th "Natural Person Certificate"
(NPC) applicant will be awarded a full set of personal computer,
including terminal, monitor, laser printer and NPC card reading
machine, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Natural Personal Certificate is an electronic identity IC
card on the Internet. The certificate is a protocol of the electronic
signature and electronic code between the smart card holder and the
government.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the certificate is an infrastructure service for the
promotion of e-government to upgrade administrative efficiency and
strengthen services for ordinary citizens, an MOI official said more
than 280 public services can now be provided through the Internet
with the NPC card. The number of such services will break the 1,000
mark in three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MOI began to accept NPC card applications April 30, 2003, and
more than 490,000 cards have been issued so far. The number is
growing by 1,000 pieces a day, the official said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to encouraging local people to apply for the NPC
cards, the official said, the ministry will award a personal computer
plus all necessary accessories to the 500,000th applicant.
</P>
<P>
"The application procedures have been simplified. Prospective
applicants can apply with the household registration offices near
their homes," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Before the end of this year, the NPC card is free of charge.
Starting Jan. 1, 2005, applicants will have to pay IC card fees.

<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) urged Matsu
residents Saturday not to smuggle agricultural and poultry products
from mainland China to prevent spread of epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The Matsu station of the COA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine Bureau made the call after coast guard officials
busted a spate of livestock smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
Quarantine officials said mainland China remains an area stricken
by many diseases communicable among both humans and animals and
infested by certain pests. Worse still, the officials said mainland
China's epidemic information system is not transparent.
</P>
<P>
"Against this backdrop, Matsu residents should refrain from
smuggling live animals or poultry products from the mainland.
Otherwise, local public health and livestock industry could be at
stake," said a quarantine official. Matsu lies closer to the mainland
than to Taiwan.

TAIWAN DESERVES MORE FEEDBACK IN CYBERCRIME PREVENTION: U.S. OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having made significant contributions to
cybercrime prevention efforts around the world, Taiwan deserves more
feedback in this regard in return, according to a senior U.S. Justice
Department official.
</P>
<P>
Richard W. Downing, a senior counsel in the Computer Crime and
Intellectual Property Section of the U.S. Justice Department's
Criminal Division, said in Taipei Saturday that the fact that Taiwan
is "giving much more than taking" in cybercrime prevention efforts
has been noticed and that this unfair situation should be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Downing, co-chair of the APEC e-Security Task Group, was in
Taipei Sept. 27-Oct. 2 to meet with Taiwan law enforcement
authorities to discuss the Cybercrime Legislation and Enforcement
Capacity Building Project -- one of the important issues that APEC is
actively dealing with this year aimed at cracking down on cybercrimes
in the Asia-Pacific region, the largest economic bloc in the world.
</P>
<P>
Downing said that Taiwan and Japan are on an identical level in
terms of computer and Internet crime prevention and that the two
countries' capacities in this regard are better than those of most
APEC member countries.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Alan J. Peters, an FBI specialist on Internet
crimes, Downing met with 67 Taiwan prosecutors, inspectors and police
officials during his stay to exchange views on the feasibility of the
Cybercrime Legislation and Enforcement Capacity Building Project in
Taiwan, as well as on ways of solving and addressing cross-border
computer-related crimes, and security and protection of electronic
evidence.
</P>
<P>
The ROC military also sent specialists to the APEC e-Security
presentations hosted by Downing and Peters.
</P>
<P>
Downing said that as Internet use becomes globally prevalent, the
surveillance and prevention of cross-border cybercrime is critical
for governments, adding that they need to tackle the problem not only
through law enforcement, but also by passing legislation to
facilitate the enforcement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, APEC economies should build counterpart
communication units to collaborate in the identification and rounding
up of cyber criminals as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Peters shared with his Taiwan audience the FBI's
experience in arresting those involved in computer-related crimes in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Both Downing and Peters gave the thumbs-up to Taiwan law
enforcement authorities, including prosecutors from the Ministry of
Justice and members of the Ninth Squad of the Criminal Investigation
Bureau, for successfully helping other Asian countries crack down on
cross-border hacking and intellectual property rights infringement
cases in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan -- with the passage of new statutes on cybercrime
prevention, as well as high-caliber law enforcement personnel -- is
at the "advanced" level among APEC economies in this regard, they
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan law enforcement authorities, Taiwan received
32 requests filed by other APEC governments in 2003 for assistance in
cracking down on crimes that were endangering e-security or for
information to help solve related criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan successfully and efficiently responded to 25 of the 32
requests, the authorities added. By comparison, Taiwan issued 19
similar requests to other APEC countries, but received responses for
only three cases.
</P>
<P>
Despite mushrooming cybercrime globally, only a few regional
blocs, such as APEC, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) , and the Organization of American States (OAS) ,
have established groups to exclusively deal with Internet-related
crimes. So far, Taiwan participates in such groups established by
APEC and by the G8.
</P>
<P>
The APEC e-Security Task Group is scheduled to focus its work on
six APEC economies, namely Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Thailand and Peru, this year to promote the
implementation of the Cybercrime Legislation and Enforcement Capacity
Building Project.

PREMIER CALLS FOR SECURITY DIALOGUE WITH JAPAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged Japan Sunday to
play a more active role in ensuring regional peace and to open
dialogue with Taiwan on the issue of regional security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 2004 Taiwan-Japan Forum, Yu said a
security dialogue between Taiwan and Japan, coupled with Japan's
defense cooperation with the United States and the U.S. commitment to
helping Taiwan meet its self-defense needs can help form a close
cooperation triangle among Taipei, Tokyo and Washington, and improve
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, Yu said, mainland China and North
Korea have become the biggest threat to security in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the six-nation talks aimed at dissuading North Korea from
developing nuclear weapons has not yielded any progress thus far, and
mainland China's military build-up has helped lead U.S. President
George Bush to shift away from the doctrine of "static defense" to
one of "preemptive strike."
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that Japan must have realized after 1996 when
mainland China lobbed missiles into waters near Taiwan that any
military conflict across the Taiwan Strait would compromise Japan's
interests, adding that this is why Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi's advisors recommended that he list China as a potential
nearby threat.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States, Japan and Taiwan all believe in
democracy, liberty and human rights, the premier said closer
cooperation among the three countries is natural as well as vital for
regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the security in the region, Yu urged Japan to
assume a bigger share of responsibility for regional security and to
open dialogue with Taiwan in this field.

Taiwan ranks first in the world in terms of
government online services and information, according to the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).
</P>
<P>
Citing the recently released fourth annual Global e-Government
Survey conducted by researchers at Brown University in the United
States, DGBAS officials said that Taiwan topped the list of 198
countries around the world surveyed with 44.3 points in overall
e-government performance, followed by Singapore with 43.8 points, the
United States with 41.9 points, Canada with 40.3 points and Monaco
with 39 points.
</P>
<P>
The study reviewed 1,935 government Web sites in the 198 nations
during June, July and August of this year. Among the sites analyzed
were those of executive offices, judicial offices, Cabinet offices
and major agencies serving crucial functions of government, such as
health, human services, taxation, education, interior, economic
development, administration, natural resources, foreign affairs,
foreign investment, transportation, military, tourism and business
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Using the number of services plus access to information,
disability access, privacy, security, and foreign language
translation as the criteria, the researchers rated each country on a
point scale of 0 to 100.

NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR LIKELY TO CONTINUE APPRECIATING THIS WEEK: ANALYSTS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar is expected to gain in
value against the U. S. dollar this week if the domestic stock market
continues to rise in the coming days, foreign exchange analysts said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by a strong Japanese yen and a stock market rally last
Friday as well as the Central Bank of China's announcement of a key
interest rate hike of 0.25 percentage points a day earlier, the new
Taiwan dollar finished at 33.94 against the U.S. dollar Friday. It
appreciated by NT$0.041 against the greenback over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts predicted that the local currency will hover
between 33.85 and 33.95 against the greenback during this week should
the domestic bourse maintain its rising streak and the Japanese yen
remain stable.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research President Wu Rong-i
forecast over the weekend that the central bank is very likely to
allow the local currency to gradually appreciate in the months ahead
to curb looming inflation.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the time is ripe for the central bank to do so, as
local commodity prices have been adjusted upward various times this
year as a result of rising oil prices since late last year in the
international market. The international price of oil has remained at
the historic high of more than US$50 per barrel in recent days.
</P>
<P>
As the United States has raised its interest rates three times
since late June, Taiwan's central bank should be planning to make
further moves in this direction to plug the interest rate gap between
the two countries, Wu said.

TAIWAN-AUSTRALIA WORKING HOLIDAY PROGRAM TO KICK OFF NOV. 1
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan and Australia will begin issuing
working holiday visas to each other's young citizens from this Nov.
1.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and Australia signed an agreement July 15 on the exchange
of working holiday visas to facilitate tourism development in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Australia is the second country to sign such an agreement with
Taiwan after New Zealand. The Taiwan-New Zealand working holiday visa
agreement was implemented in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the Taiwan-Australia working holiday agreement -- signed in
Taipei by Yang Chin-tien, Taiwan's representative to Australia, and
his Australian counterpart, Frances Adamson -- Taiwan citizens aged
between 18 and 30 can apply for working holiday visas for a maximum
one-year stay in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Such Taiwan citizens can take on short-term employment during
their stay, but their main purpose of entry must be for vacation or
pleasure trips, and not work. Therefore, they cannot work for the
same employer for more than three months and cannot take full-time
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Australian officials present at the opening of the Australian
Education Exhibition in Taipei Sunday solicited Taiwan students and
young working people to go to Australia for leisure trips or study by
taking advantage of the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Australian officials said that Australia offers much better
treatment to Taiwan students and young working people than the United
States does. They noted that the United States allows only students
to "work and tour" in America during summer vacations and that the
applicants must be aged between 18 and 28.
</P>
<P>
There will be no limit in terms of the number of Taiwan students
or young working people who can apply for Australian working holiday
visas, the Australian officials said. The applicants cannot take any
children with them on their trip, and they must produce proof that
they have at least A$5,000 (US$3,598), the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is the 17th country or area to sign a working holiday visa
accord with Australia, which issued 90,000 such visas last year.

SECURITY CHIEF URGES JAPAN TO NORMALIZE TIES WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan should normalize relations with Taiwan
by discarding its policy of only developing economic ties with the
island, Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the National Security
Council said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During his speech to the Taiwan-Japan Forum which opened in
Taipei Sunday, Chiou said Japan's current policy toward Taiwan has
hampered the normalization of bilateral ties and is compromising both
sides' capability to deal with the changing situation in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Some sixty years after the end of World War II, Chiou said, Japan
has emerged as the most powerful democracy in East Asia and exercises
the most influence on China in the region. He called for Japan to
throw off the past and join the other Asian states in embracing the
future as a regional leader should do.
</P>
<P>
Chiou said Taiwan supports Japan's bid to play an active role in
reforming the United Nations and encourages it to assume the role of
leader in Asia which he claimed will help ensure peace and prosperity
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Just as Japan underwent difficulties in stepping onto the
international stage and contributing to the international community,
Taiwan now also faces challenges in its bid to take part in and
contribute to the international community.
</P>
<P>
Facing the emergence of mainland China, Chiou said, Taiwan and
Japan share the same interest in seeing mainland China move toward
democracy, but he cautioned that Japan should not to be so naive as
to have any illusions about China which is still ruled by a
dictatorial communist regime.
</P>
<P>
While mainland China is aggressively modernizing its military
forces, Chiou said, Taiwan and Japan share the common interest of
prodding it to be a responsible member of the international
community. This requires that Japan discard its economic-only policy
toward Taiwan and begin to normalize relations with it, he added.

CROSS-STRAIT ISSUE SHOULD BE VIEWED AS INTERNATIONAL: JAPANESE ENVOY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cross-Taiwan Strait question should be
viewed as an international issue which affects the interests of other
countries, a Japanese representative to Taiwan said in Taipei Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Uchida Katsuhisa, director-general of the Taipei Office under the
Interchange Association of Japan, told the 2004 Taiwan-Japan Forum
that the international community is shifting away from the
conventional notion that the "Taiwan question" is a Chinese internal
affair as Beijing has consistently claimed.
</P>
<P>
Katsuhisa said that as cross-strait tensions increase, other
countries must pay closer attention and see it as an issue of
international concern.
</P>
<P>
He also said President Chen Shui-bian's May 20 inaugural address
has convinced the international community that Taiwan is pulling its
weight to maintain cross-strait peace.

MOFA TO CONTINUE TO PROMOTE SUBSTANTIVE TIES WITH SINGAPORE: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 3 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
continue to promote substantive ties with Singapore based on the
existing communication channels, a spokesman for the MOFA said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the conciliatory remarks by Singaporean Foreign
Minister George Yeo on Taiwan-Singapore relations a day earlier,
Michel Lu said that the MOFA hopes that the recent verbal controversy
between the two countries has come to an end and that the two sides
can maintain the existing good communication channels and continue to
promote substantive bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Taiwan is aware of the goodwill Yeo demonstrated in
his remarks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the burning of the Singaporean national flag by a
group of pro-independence demonstrators in Taiwan on Saturday, Yeo
told Singaporean media that he was sad rather than angry about the
incident because of the longstanding friendship between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan can disagree with the position taken by Singapore, but it
should not take extreme actions against it, Yeo noted.
</P>
<P>
The verbal controversy arouse in late September when Yeo gave a
speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York in which he blamed
cross-Taiwan Strait tensions on Taiwan and warned that
pro-independence forces in Taiwan risked provoking a war with
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In response, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen took
advantage of ameeting with agroup of pro-independence activists Sept.
27 to express his displeasure with Yeo's statements, describing
Singapore as "the size of a piece of snot" and claiming that Yeo was
pandering to Beijing by unfairly criticizing Taiwan.

ELIGIBLE FOREIGN SPOUSES MAY RECEIVE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES: CLA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eligible foreign spouses of Taiwan nationals
will be able to receive temporary subsidies aimed at helping them
improve their lives here, according to a draft plan of the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the draft being worked on by the CLA, foreign
husbands and wives of Taiwan citizens of low-income families who have
remained jobless for more than 12 weeks will be able to receive
financial aid of up to NT$16,000 (about US$470) from the council each
month for a maximum period of six months, if they get work through
public-run employment service agencies.
</P>
<P>
Employers who hire this type of job seekers through public-run
job agencies will be given NT$5,000 per month in government subsidies
for a maximum period of one year.
</P>
<P>
To help foreign spouses set up their own small businesses in
Taiwan, the CLA will also offer free career development consultation
and low-interest loans, a CLA official said.
</P>
<P>
CLA statistics show that more than 100,000 foreign husbands and
wives in Taiwan are qualified workers, but only about half of them,
with an average age of 35 and a low level of education, are currently
employed.
</P>
<P>
There are about 310,000 foreign spouses in Taiwan at present,
with more than 200,000 coming from mainland China (including Hong
Kong and Macau) and 110,000 from countries in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The number is expected to rise to 400,000 -- a level to be on
par with that of Taiwan's aboriginal citizens -- in two years at the
current rate, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 50,000 Taiwan nationals got married to
foreigners, with 30,000 of them coming from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan lifted a ban on cross-Taiwan Strait travel in 1987,
a large number of mainland brides has entered Taiwan every year,
creating an unprecedented immigration experience for Taiwan society,
experts said.

<P>
Taiwan will continue to promote cross-Taiwan
Strait peaceful interactions, President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the mid Autumn conference of Taiwan businessesmen
operating in mainland China held in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, Chen
said that his administration will continue to create friendly
evironment for economic, educational and cultural exchanges between
the two sides of the strait, including the direct cross-strait trade,
transportation and postal services, or the so-called three links.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has no illusion of the Beijing authorities despite of the
fact that mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao has successfully
assumed to the leadership, Chen noted, adding that the Chinese
Communist "one-party" authoritarian rule has not changed.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen went on, Taiwan will continue to carry out its
promise of creating a friendly environment for the establishment of a
peace and stability framework for cross-strait interactions.
</P>
<P>
Thepresident also revealed that he will issue an "important
statement" on the development of the cross-strait relations on Oct.

he will reply to the statement jointly issued by the Chinese
Communist Party's Taiwan Affairs Office and State Council's Taiwan
Affairs Office on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Beijing urged Taiwan leaders with intimidating words in its
statement to forgo Taiwan independence and recognize that there is
only one China so that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume
talks and end animosity.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also gives two options to Taiwan leaders: stop the
independence movement and recognize that there is only one China to
promote the development of cross-strait relations, or try to split
Taiwan from China and risk the consequences.

300 SOLDIERS TO BE SENT TO PINGTUNG TO HELP COMBAT DENGUE FEVER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Pingtung,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 300 soldiers will be sent to
Taiwan's southernmost city of Pingtung beginning Monday to help
combat dengue fever, Pingtung County Government reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 64 cases of indigenous dengue fever, a mosquito-borne
disease, have been reported in the Pingtung area over the past two
weeks, with 61 cases in Pingtung City and three cases in Pingtung
County, the county government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The military personnel will conduct intensive disinfection work
in 16 boroughs in Pingtung City over the following three days to
clean up mosquito-infested areas in an effort to stave off the spread
of dengue fever.
</P>
<P>
Some schools in Pingtung City have been found to have stagnant
water in ponds and sewers, as well as standing water that did not
contain pesticides, all of which are believed to have allowed
mosquitos to multiply.
</P>
<P>
According to Pingtung County Government regulations, a school
principal could be fined up to NT$30,000 under the Disease Control
Law and the Waste Management Statute if mosquito-infested areas are
discovered on the campus of their school.
</P>
<P>
Small-scale dengue fever outbreaks occur about every three years
in Taiwan, with a major outbreak happening about every decade, dating
back to the early 1930s when nearly 80 percent of the population
contracted the disease in a major outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Four types of the virus that causes dengue fever have been found,
and patients with more than one type of virus can develop symptoms
that include bleeding of the gums, the skin and the intestinal tract,
in addition to the classic symptoms of sudden high fever, severe
headaches, nausea and vomiting, and muscle and joint pain.

BEIJING TRIED TO HAVE TAIWAN EXCLUDED FROM WTCA: CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of a world leading trade-promotion
organization revealed that 20 years ago, Beijing tried to make
Taiwan's withdrawal from the World Trade Center Association (WTCA) a
precondition for its own entry into the association.
</P>
<P>
WTCA President Guy Tozzoli made the revelation in a speech he
delivered at the 35th WTCA assembly, which kicked off the same day in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Tozzoli said that when he invited Beijing to join some two
decades ago, then mainland Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping insisted that
Taiwan should first exit the association.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the WTCA's goal is to push for world peace and
stability through the promotion of trade, Tozzoli said that he
resolved the problem by telling Beijing that WTCA membership is given
on the basis of city status rather than nationhood status.
</P>
<P>
The WTCA is a non-political and non-profit international
organization which groups some 300 world trade centers from more than
100 countries around the world and serves more than 750,000
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei World Trade Center is one of the WTCA's main members,
and its chairman, C.J. Hsu, who is heading a delegation to
participate in the current assembly, is also one of the association's
administrators.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the outstanding performance of the Taipei World Trade
Center in the organization has won affirmation from other WTCA
members, Hsu said that this is why Taiwan has been among the 22 WTCA
administrators for many years.
</P>
<P>
The operations of the Taipei World Trade Center, which combines
the operations of other establishments nearby, including the Taipei
World Trade Building, the Taipei International Convention Center,
Taipei World Trade Center Exhibition Hall and the Taipei Hayatt
Regency, have become a model for other world trade centers, Hsu said,
adding that the 1994 WTCA assembly, which was held in Taipei, is
regarded as the organization's most successful assembly ever by its
members.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, also chairman of the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council, expressed his admiration for Tozzoli's leadership
in the association and his efforts to promote world peace, saying
that the WTCA chairman's name has been forward several times as a
Nobel Peace Prize candidate. Tozzoli has actively pushed for peace in
the Korean Peninsula over the years.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsu, world trade centers in various important cities
on the both sides of the Taiwan Strait are WTCA members, and there
has never been any confrontation among them in the organization over
the years.
</P>
<P>
The 36th WTCA assembly will be held in Shanghai next year.

2,600 ROC EXPATS TO RETURN FOR NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 2,600 Taiwan expatriates will return
to attend the Republic of China's Double Ten National Day
celebrations, a senior official of the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission (OCAC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, OCAC
Chairwoman Chang Fu-mei said the number of ROC expatriates intending
to return for Oct. 10 National Day celebrations this year is lower
than in previous years because many expatriates already returned
between March and May either to vote in the March 20 presidential
election or to attend the May 20 presidential inauguration.
</P>
<P>
"I admire the expatriates' patriotism as they are returning at
their own expense for the National Day celebrations, " Chang said,
adding that the OCAC will only offer a NT$3,000 subsidy for each
returning expatriate for local tour packages.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the OCAC has commissioned 17 selected local
travel agencies to organize three-day tour packages for returning
expatriates so that they can see for themselves Taiwan's latest
progress in political, social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the returning expatriates will include members of some
pro-"pan-blue alliance" groups, but she admitted that the number is
indeed limited.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" refers to the coalition of Taiwan's two
major opposition parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
Chang attributed the limited number of pro-"pan-blue alliance"
expatriates willing to return for National Day celebrations mainly to
the disputes over the result of the March 20 presidential election in
which the "pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate KMT Chairman
Lien Chan lost to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian by a slim
margin.
</P>
<P>
Lien has since filed two lawsuits challenging Chen's re-election
victory and even the validity of the election. The Taiwan High Court
is scheduled to hand down its judgment on the validity of Chen's
re-election victory on Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the election, Chang said, the OCAC has made
strenuous efforts to communicate with overseas "pan-blue alliance"
supporters, asking them to refrain from making unfounded allegations
against the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration over
the election disputes and to patiently wait for the court's verdict.
</P>
<P>
Except for a few radical "pan-blue alliance" stalwarts in the
United States, Chang said, most overseas expatriate groups have
stopped anti-government demonstrations for the sake of maintaining
Taiwan's national image and sustainable development.

CPC, FORMOSA BEING INVESTIGATED ON COLLUSION SUSPICIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's two oil suppliers, Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) and Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPCC) , are
being investigated on suspicions of adjusting oil prices in collusion
in recent years, the Fair Trade Commission chairman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Executive Yuan, Hwang Tzong-leh said
the government has begun probing possible collusion between the CPC
and FPCC, which he said would be in violation of fair trade laws and
consumers' rights.
</P>
<P>
The Fair Trade Commission has received numerous complaints from
ordinary gas station customers that the CPC and FPCC have raised or
lowered prices in sync 20 times since 2002, Hwang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that solid evidence is required to enable the Fair Trade
Commission to determine that the two companies have violated fair
trade laws and to mete out penalties, adding that it will be
difficult to prove the two companies worked in concert to manipulate
domestic oil prices.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Fair Trade Commission will publicize the
results of the investigations in three weeks and that a commission
will then decide if and how the CPC and FPCC will be dealt with --
including possible fines ranging from NT$50,000 to NT$25 million.
</P>
<P>
The state-run CPC currently controls about 75 percent of the
island's entire oil market. The FPCC has a 25-percent market share,
with 525 gas stations islandwide.

<P>
Streamlining the central government will be
done gradually and there will be no mass layoffs in the short term,
Lee Yi-yang, director-general of the Central Personnel Administration
(CPA), said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks when he was fielding questions at a joint
meeting of three committees in the Legislative Yuan to screen a draft
bill concerning the total number of workers in the Central Government.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft bill, the total staff of the Presidential Office
and the five government branches -- the Executive, the Legislative,
the Judicial, the Examination and Control yuans -- should have a
ceiling of 200,500, Lee noted.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the draft bill will move along the line of
streamlining the staff as well as reforming the government so as to
make the operations more flexible.
</P>
<P>
According to CPA officials, the number of central
government-level staff has continued to decline over the past three
years, down 3.45 percent, 5.6 percent and 1.7 percent in 2002, 2003
and 2004, respectively.

PRESIDENT'S LEGISLATIVE ADDRESS ON HOLD AS LAWMAKERS DISCUSS DETAILS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislators on Monday failed to reach a
consensus on President Chen Shui-bian's request to give a
state-of-the-nation address in the Legislative Yuan and the chance of
him delivering such a report soon seems remote.
</P>
<P>
Legislators across the political spectrum held another round of
consultations Monday to discuss President Chen's request. As no
conclusions were reached, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
that the matter will be turned over to the Rules Committee of the
legislature to deal with. The legislature held the first consultation
meeting last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Since the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and
the People First Party dominates the Rules Committee, and given they
have asked to amend legislative regulations so that delivering a
state-of-the- nation address can be institutionalized, the chance of
the president giving such an address before the year-end legislative
elections, or Dec. 11, seems slim.
</P>
<P>
The caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
proposed inviting President Chen to give the address, hoping that the
proposal could be passed quickly by the Rules Committee Tuesday so
that it can be put on the legislature's agenda.
</P>
<P>
The president sent a letter to the Legislative Yuan Sept. 27
expressing his intention to give a state-of-the-nation address in
the legislature on major national policies, such as arms
procurements, Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations and peaceful
development between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The president
also asked the Legislative Yuan to arrange for him to give the
address during the current session, which ends in December, as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
If his request is accepted, Chen will become the first Republic
of China president to deliver a state-of-the-nation address in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" believes that it is up to the legislature
to decide if the president can give the address and they want the
rules of the legislature changed to make it possible for presidential
addresses to governed by set rules.
</P>
<P>
The DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, for their part
think that the president should have the right to take the initiative
to ask for a state-of-the-nation address, and not have to wait for an
invitation from the legislature.

TAIWAN MUST KEEP ABREAST OF ECONOMIC CHANGES IN CHINA: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has to be aware of the changes taking
place in mainland China's economy and the country's current trends if
cross-strait economic and trade exchanges are to be peacefully
developed, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan and mainland China have maintained
inextricably close economic relations, with Taiwan enjoying a trade
surplus of over US$200 billion between 2000 and 2003, Hu said keeping
abreast of changes in mainland China's economic situation is a
vitally important task that the ROC government must undertake.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on "Cross-strait Peace and Development"
sponsored by the think tank Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, Hu
said that while celebrating its expanding economy, mainland China is
also facing challenges from economic globalization as well as other
internal economic variables, which are poised to have an adverse
impact on the development of cross-strait economic and trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
As mainland China's economy matures, Taiwan could lose its
competitive edge before long, Hu asserted.
</P>
<P>
In order not to lose out, he said, Taiwan should accelerate the
10 new major construction projects by 2008; advance the development
of core, high-tech industries; upgrade the structure of industries;
allow the private sector access to low-interest loans and taxation
incentives; and help the industrial and service sectors to secure
higher value-added production.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan enterprises continuously expanding and strengthening
global operations to sharpen their international competitiveness
would be another way of bolstering Taiwan's bargaining power to seek
a cross-strait peace framework, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
Hu quoted CEPD tallies as indicating that currently there are
about 40,000 to 50,000 Taiwan companies operating throughout mainland
China, with investments totaling over US$70 billion.
</P>
<P>
Between 2000 and 2003, cross-strait trade totaled US$311 billion,
with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$201.3 billion, the CEPD
statistics showed.

REGULAR TAICHUNG-SEOUL CHARTER FLIGHTS BEGIN AT CCK AIRPORT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regular charter flights between Taichung and
Seoul will begin Tuesday, marking the start of international air
travel service for Chingchuankang (CCK) International Airport in
central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for Mandarin Airlines, which operates
the charter flights, the airlines will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony
Tuesday at the CCK Airport to celebrate the Seoul-bound flight, the
first in 12 years between the two countries. The plane will take off
at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Scores of Mandarin Airlines officials and more than 100
passengers will take part in the ceremony and witness the historic
event, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Air links between Taiwan and South Korea were cut in 1992 after
Seoul switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
earlier the same year.
</P>
<P>
Mandarin Airlines will use 108-seat FK-100 airplanes to ply the
route, which will be a round trip in one day, with the return flight
at 7: 10 p.m., he explained. Travel time is about two hours and 40
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The first Mandarin Airlines charter plane for Seoul will go fully
loaded, while 95 percent of the seats on its return trip have been
sold, bringing in some 100 tourists from South Korea, he said, adding
that the South Korean visitors will sightsee for five days in central
Taiwan -- a region famous and most frequented by local people for its
resorts and tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
The Taichung-Seoul charter service will fly once every five days
in the initial stage, and starting from Nov. 14 the service will be
increased to twice a week on every Wednesday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-based aviation company has begun arrangements for a
charter service in November from CCK International Airport to Japan.
</P>
<P>
In view of the warm public response for the Seoul-bound charter
service, local travel agencies are optimistic about making the CCK
airport a transshipment center of charter flights in Taiwan by
offering more services to destinations in Japan and countries in
Southeast Asia.

'PEACE BREEDS WEALTH' SAYS TAIWAN BUSINESS LEADER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Taiwan's business leaders on Monday
called for friendliness and reconciliation across the Taiwan Strait
for sustainable development in cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
From a businessman's point of view, peace is the supreme
principle of all conduct, said Huang Mao-hsiung, chairman of the
Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, one of the
largest and most influential organizations of businessmen in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Saying that "peace breeds wealth," Huang called for both sides of
the Taiwan Strait to try to defuse military tensions and reduce
hostility when making economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on "Cross-strait Peace and Development"
sponsored by the think tank Taiwan Institute of Economic Research,
Huang offered seven tips to "breed wealth" by achieving cross-strait
peace.
</P>
<P>
First, Huang called for the mainland Chinese authorities to allow
Taiwan and mainland Chinese companies to maintain separate but
complementary operations for producing at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Second, Huang called for rulers from both sides not to force
civilian businessmen to take sides or make known their political
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Third, he said unfair trade barriers and discriminatory economic
policies should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Other tips include having both sides cooperate under the World
Trade Organization framework and help each other face dumping charges
or other unfair competition from countries beyond Taiwan and mainland
China and encourage both sides to enter regional free trade
arrangements, Huang said.

Michael Howard and the Conservatives start their conference today
in a worse position in the polls than a year ago, a month before Iain
Duncan Smith was forced out as leader. A new Populus poll for the
Times unerlines how large a mountain the Tories stall to climb to be
credible challengers at the next election, even though party
activists will be told today that they are already set to win enough
target seats to deny Labour a majority.

Financial Times: Brown leads call for unity.

Gordon Brown and John Prescott yesterday called on Labour to
unite in the run-up to the next general election as they sought to
stabilize the government after Tony Blair's vow to serve a full third
term if re-elected. As the prime minister prepares to return to work
today following last week's treatment for a heart flutter, the

PRESIDENT CHEN TO GIVE MAJOR SPEECH ON DOUBLE TEN NATIONAL DAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The public can expect a major speech by
President Chen Shui-bian on the Republic of China National Day on Oct.
10, Vice President Annette Lu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lu's spoke a day after President Chen said that for Taiwan's
long-term security and the normalization of cross-strait relations,
he would deliver a major speech, which will include a response to the
May 17 statement by mainland China, in which a "carrot-and-stick"
approach was adopted.
</P>
<P>
Beijing issued the statement three days before the inauguration
of President Chen for his second term May 20 in which it sternly
warned against advocating Taiwan independence, saying doing so would
be playing with fire. At the same time, the statement offered to
resume cross-strait dialogue, build a mechanism for mutual trust and
settle the issue of Taiwan's maneuvering space in the international
community commensurate with its status through contacts and
consultations.
</P>
<P>
President Chen reaffirmed Monday that he hoped his speech will
help ease cross-strait tensions, saying, "There is no need for
rivalry between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
The vice president said that cross-strait relations are like
relations between the genders and should be based on the principle of
"peace, mutual benefit and equality."
</P>
<P>
Lu also said that Beijing's May 17 statement excluded its
favorite rhetoric of national unification, use of force against
Taiwan, and the "one country, two systems" formula for unification,
which could be construed as a gesture of goodwill.

TAIWAN ECONOMY PROJECTED TO GROW BY 4.5 PERCENT FOR 2005: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's economy will grow by a moderate 4.5
percent in 2005 due to a slowed global economic expansion, Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng
predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD chief made the forecast while reporting at the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the domestic economy will perform less
brilliantly in 2005 than it has this year, Hu attributed the lower
economic growth rate to weaker international demand as a result of
high oil prices and interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
Although continued high oil prices in the global market has
fueled inflationary pressures, Hu claimed that the overall impact on
Taiwan has eased due to the changes in its industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Citing estimates by Global Insight, Inc., Hu said that the world
economy will grow by 3.4 percent in 2005, a slide from the 4.1
percent forecast for this year.
</P>
<P>
However, he explained that spurred by the government's investment
in public construction and private-sector investments at home, the
country will still be able to manage a moderate economic growth rate
of 4.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
According to assessments made in August by the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the
domestic economy will expand by 5.87 percent for the whole of this
year, up by 2.56 percentage points over the 2003 level and its best
performance since the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to a continued decline over the past three years,
consumer product prices in the domestic market in the first eight
months of this year were higher than the previous year's levels by
1.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hu ascribed this year's higher commodity prices to rising oil
prices and the devastation caused by recent typhoons, factors that
have noticeably pushed up vegetable and fruit prices.
</P>
<P>
He said that domestic farm produce prices are unlikely to
continue climbing, as they have started showing signs of decline in
recent weeks with the new harvest hitting markets.

EU URGED TO PASS LAW MODELED ON TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The European Union should pass a law similar
to the U.S. Taiwan Relations Act to establish a foundation for closer
ties, the head of Taiwan's top mainland China policy agency said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks while meeting with a group of officials from the European
Union Commission.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act
in 1979 after the United States severed diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China. The law has since become the major document
governing relations between the U.S. and Taiwan in the absent of
official ties.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Relations Act, among other things, says: "The United
States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and
defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable
Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability."
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed the hope that the EU would consider passing a
similar law.
</P>
<P>
Wu also explained to the visiting officials that mainland China's
military intimidation and diplomatic blockade of Taiwan will only
have negative effects on cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
Instead, mainland China should remove its missiles targeting
Taiwan and end its diplomatic boycott to facilitate peaceful and
stable development between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU should understand that human rights in
mainland China are poorly protected, and Beijing has not given up its
threat of the use of force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The EU should cautiously assess the possibility of lifting an
arms embargo against mainland China that was put into place after the
bloody 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, so that the military balance across
the Taiwan Strait is not changed in Beijing's favor, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wu also exchanged views with the guests on
various situations in Asia and future cooperation between Taiwan and
the EU.

PRESIDENT PITCHES FOR CLOSER TAIWAN-JAPAN COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday there
is ample room for Taiwan and Japan to cooperate in forging a
comprehensive Asian security mechanism or promoting Asia-Pacific
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of Taiwan and
Japanese scholars attending the 2004 Taiwan-Japan Forum on
Asia-Pacific Regional Security Issues, which opened in Taipei a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen lamented that mainland China has
consistently attempted to exclude Taiwan from regional security
cooperative mechanisms and economic dialogue frameworks.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Chen said, Taiwan's participation in those
fields would contribute greatly to regional economic prosperity and
peaceful dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Touching on recent developments in Taiwan and Japan, Chen said he
sees similarities in the two countries' pursuit of constitutional
reforms and a greater role in the international community.
</P>
<P>
"I have noticed that there have been many discussions in Japan in
recent years about constitutional amendments that would allow Japan
to become a 'normal country' and play a more active role in world
affairs, " Chen said, adding that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi's appeal for a permanent seat for Japan in the U.N. Security
Council in a speech at the just-concluded U.N. General Assembly
symbolized Japan's desire for a greater role in the international
arena. The current Japanese constitution imposes strict restrictions
on the country's military buildup.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Chen said, Japan is mulling new ways and new
strategies to shed its historical shackles and face up to the
challenges of the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, he went on, Taiwan is also re-thinking its national
identity now that it has succeeded in its political democratization
and economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to becoming a normal and complete country by
writing a new constitution that fits our status quo and facilitates
the upgrading of our administrative efficiency and overall national
competitiveness, " Chen said, referring to his constitutional
re-engineering plan.
</P>
<P>
Amid the wave of economic liberalization and globalization, Chen
said, the people of Taiwan also yearn to take part in international
organizations and activities.
</P>
<P>
"We are more than willing to share our economic and democratic
development experiences and work hand-in-hand with other countries to
promote the common well-being of all mankind," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president further said that Taiwan and Japan not only have
similar development experiences but also have shared geopolitical and
strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan and Japan will be the most-affected countries
by several major developments in the Asia-Pacific region in recent
years, such as the rise of China as an economic powerhouse, Chen said
the two countries should cooperate even more closely in security
affairs and economic development for their mutual benefit.

NEW JIA KAOHSIUNG CHIEF MEETS WITH MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan is more than willing to assist
Kaohsiung in organizing the 2009 World Games, Yasuo Makita, director
of the Kaohsiung office of the Japanese Interchange Association
(JIA), said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Makita made the remarks during a courtesy call on Kaohsiung Mayor
Frank Hsieh. The JIA is a quasi-official organization authorized by
the Japanese government to handle exchanges with Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
In his first meeting with Hsieh since assuming office last week,
Makita said Japan would offer counseling to Kaohsiung in organizing
the 2009 World Games, an international contest for events not
included in the Olympic Games. The 2001 World Games took place in the
northern Japanese prefecture of Akita.
</P>
<P>
Makita once worked in Kaohsiung 34 years ago. "I have fond
memories of my work experience in the city. I take great pleasure in
being able to work in Kaohsiung again after all these years. I have
worked in 11 different countries and I think Kaohsiung people are
among those who are most familiar with Japanese culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Kaohsiung has about 1,500 Japanese expatriates and
Makita said they are grateful for the Kaohsiung city government's
concern and assistance for them, particularly in the education of
their 180-plus children.
</P>
<P>
Makita assured Hsieh that he will do his utmost to promote
exchanges and cooperation between Kaohsiung and Japan during his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hsieh said the city government has given priority
to promoting the high-tech industry and tourism. "We will step up
efforts to attract more tourists from Japan, South Korea and
Southeast Asian countries," he added.

MARCH 19 SHOOTING INVESTIGATION COMMISSION BEGINS OPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A commission to probe the March 19 shooting
of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu held its
first meeting Monday amid calls for a boycott by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
The 10 members of the commission -- nine people recommended by
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People
First Party and one suggested by the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union --
convened the meeting at the Legislative Yuan following the passage of
a special statute authorizing the commission in August.
</P>
<P>
Shih Chi-yang, a former Judicial Yuan president who was elected
convener, claimed that the commission will act in "an impartial
manner" and hopes to complete an investigative report within three to
six months.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the election-eve shooting had a big impact on the
nation's image and added that "the dignity and image of the president
and the vice president is the dignity and image of the Taiwan
people."
</P>
<P>
"The president should not shoulder so much misunderstanding, "
Shih said, adding that the perpetrator must be found early and
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
He also said the commission will act in a supra-political party
manner, and will not suffer interference by any government agencies.
</P>
<P>
"The commission will conduct its investigation in a way that
conforms to the Constitution and the law," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that many people have tried to block the formation of
the commission, saying it is unconstitutional and illegal, but
according to Shih, the constitutionality should be left for an
interpretation by the Council of Grand Justices. He also said that it
is "too early" to say if its operation violates the law.
</P>
<P>
But to "assuage the misgivings of others, " he suggested that the
legislature should simply revise the law.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ching-feng, spokeswoman of the commission and a former
Control Yuan member, said the commission plans to interview Tainan
Prosecutor's Office and Criminal Investigation Bureau officials this
week and to invite National Security Bureau members for a briefing
next week.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the Executive Yuan should pay for the
commission and provide administrative resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DPP reaffirmed that the commission is both
unconstitutional and illegal and that the Executive Yuan will not
accede to its requests or appropriate a budget for its operation.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , a DPP ally, said it opposes
the operation of the commission before the Council of Grand Justices
returns a verdict on the constitutionality of the bill.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-dominated legislature passed the special statute
authorizing the establishment of the commission in August, upon which
the Executive Yuan requested a reconsideration. After failing to
overturn the bill, the DPP caucus in the legislature then asked the
Council of Grand Justices for an interpretation of its
constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
According to the special statute, the commission should have 17
members, chosen by the various parties in proportion to their
legislative representation. The DPP and the TSU have refused to
recommend anyone to sit on the commission, saying the law encroaches
on judicial and prosecutor's rights and is a serious violation of
human rights.

FOREIGN INVESTORS CASH IN ON TAIWAN SHARES

Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan share prices were sharply higher
Monday on the back of strong buying by foreign investors, who bought
domestic stocks with a net value of NT$15.362 billion (US$4.52
billion) during the day's trading, according to the Taiwan Stock
Exchange (TAIEX).
</P>
<P>
The figure -- a gap between the NT$26.358 billion worth of shares
they bought and the NT$10.996 billion worth of shares they sold --
represents the seventh-highest level for a single day in the TAIEX
history, the tallies show.
</P>
<P>
The weighted index, the key barometer for the domestic stock
market, jumped by 132.61 points to break the 6,000-point level by
finishing at 6,077.96. Market turnover expanded to NT$147.345
billion.
</P>
<P>
Market watchers said that the domestic bourse is expected to gain
momentum in the peak fourth quarter, to be fueled by the effects of a
Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) announcement in late June
that it will increase the inclusion weight of the MSCI Taiwan Index
from 75 percent in late November to 100 percent in May 2005.
</P>
<P>
Financial and hi-tech DRAM shares are targets worthy of
investment, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to TAIEX statistics, foreign institutional investors
purchased Taiwan shares last week with a total value of NT$42.291
billion, outstripping the NT$31.815 billion worth of shares they
sold.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance of NT$10.476 billion brings the total gap to
NT$109.774 billion in Taiwan shares' favor for the year ending Oct.
1.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors currently hold Taiwan shares worth a total of
NT$2.8484 trillion, an increase of NT$45.5 billion over the Sept. 24
level of NT$2.8029 trillion and accounting for 21.72 percent of the
overall scale of the domestic stock market.

KMT REBUTS RICHARD GERE'S COMMENTS ON MARCH 19 SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Monday
rebutted Hollywood movie star Richard Gere's comments on the March 19
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian as "not circumspect."
</P>
<P>
KMT spokeswoman Kuo Shu-chun made the remarks after Gere told
Taiwan's TVBS cable TV channel that he did not believe Chen staged the
shooting that grazed his stomach on the campaign trail on the eve of
the March 20 presidential election in which he won re-election by a
slim margin. It was not clear why Gere's opinions were being sought
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"What I thought was kind of bizarre was that the opposition
assumed that he had set it up, in some way had himself shot, " Gere
said. "That doesn't sound right."
</P>
<P>
Gere was promoting his latest film, "Shall We Dance? " when he
talked to TVBS in the United States. TVBS broadcast Gere's interview
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In response, Kuo claimed that Gere's comments reflect an
"insufficient understanding" of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"As Gere just read media reports about the incident, he was
unable to gain a full understanding of suspicious behind-the-scenes
maneuvering in Taiwan's presidential election. He shouldn't make
judgment purely based on his impression of Taiwan during his
previous visit, " Kuo argued, adding that she hopes foreigners can
focus on whether the principles of fairness and justice prevail while
commenting on Taiwan's presidential election disputes.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who narrowly lost to Chen in the bitterly
fought presidential election, insinuated that Chen might have staged
the shooting to win sympathy votes. Although he has offered no
evidence to support his allegations, he has filed two lawsuits to
challenge Chen's re-election victory and even the validity of the
election.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities have not yet arrested any suspects in
the assassination attempt and have not announced many solid leads.
The Taiwan High Court is scheduled to hand down a judgment Nov. 4
on whether Chen's re-election victory should be nullified because of
the shooting and other allegations of irregularities.

VICE MINISTER REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO SELF-DEFENSE AT U.S. MEETING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Phoenix,  Arizona,  Oct. 4 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's commitment to defending
itself against any invasion has remained firm and unchanged, Vice
Minister of National Defense Houh Shoou-yeh said Monday at the
opening of an annual Taiwan-U.S. defense industry conference.
</P>
<P>
"Although different opinions may arise in the policy formulation
and budget screening process following Taiwan's democratization,
we'll never waver on our determination to defend our national
security," Houh said.
</P>
<P>
Houh was referring to a special NT$610.8 billion budget bill that
will cover the cost for purchasing six PAC III anti-missile
batteries, eight diesel-powered submarines, and 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft from the United States. The bill is pending
legislative approval and has drawn a heated debate in Taiwan society.
Some private groups have spoken loudly against the package.
</P>
<P>
In the face of mainland China's growing missile threat, Houh said
Taiwan needs the new arsm package to beef up its defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Houh is heading a Taiwan delegation of military officials and
defense strategists to attend the conference, the third of its kind.
Former Vice Defense Minister Lin Chong-pin will deliver a keynote
speech at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials, including Deputy Asistant Secretary of
State Randall Schiver, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard
Lawlless and Daniel Blumenthal, a Pentagon division chief in charge
of China affairs, will attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is organized by the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council.
Rupert Hammond-Chambers, the council's president, said 20 percent of
the participants are Taiwan government officials, 20 percent are U.S.
government officials and the remaining 60 percent are U.S. defense
contractors and scholars.
</P>
<P>
As lawmakers have played an increasingly important role in
Taiwan's defense policy formulation, Hammond-Chambers said the
council will invite Taiwan's legislators from across the political
spectrum to attend the conference next year.

BEIJING SHOULD ASSUAGE CROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China should take steps to assuage
cross-Taiwan Strait tension, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks when he spoke to around 300 Taiwan
businessmen operating in mainland China who had returned for the
mid-Autumn Festival holiday and met in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan for
an annual autumn gathering.
</P>
<P>
Yu said cross-strait peace must be built on the basis of mutual
respect and that peace will not be achieved by pressuring Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's military buildup and its increased deployment of
missiles against Taiwan are the major causes of the present
cross-strait tension, according to the premier.
</P>
<P>
It is up to the mainland, not Taiwan, to assuage the tension, he
added.
</P>
<P>
To promote cross-strait exchanges, the premier said the Executive
Yuan will follow the guidelines set by President Chen Shui-bian in
his May 20 inauguration speech and will continue to promote mutually
beneficial trade exchanges, including the easing of restrictions on
mainland businessmen visiting Taiwan, opening of Taiwan to
mainlanders for tourism, allowing more mainland products into Taiwan
and promoting consultation on direct cross-strait transport links.
</P>
<P>
The premier also instructed the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
and related government agencies to help the estimated 500,000 to 1
million Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland and their
dependents to return to Taiwan for Chinese New Year, which will
include the expansion of the transport links between Fujian Province
and the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, as well as charter
flight services during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said that Taiwan is willing to send
delegates to the mainland to exchange views with Beijing on the
charter flight services, which were launched two years ago on a trial
basis, but only Taiwan carriers were allowed to operate the
service, and they had to travel via a third location such as Macau or
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has demanded that mainland carriers be allowed to
offer the cross-strait charter flights on a non-stop basis during the
holiday period. The MAC has said that it does not rule out the
possibility of such flights, although both sides have to discuss
related matters.
</P>
<P>
Two-way cross-strait charter flights were not offered during the
2004 Chinese New Year holiday season due to Beijing's refusal to
engage in bilateral consultations.

understands the nature of man."

TSU CALLS FOR NO RASH OPENING OF DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORT LINKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian must not act rashly
and open direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait at the
expense of a majority of average local citizens, an opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) caucus legislator said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming, deputy convener of the TSU legislative caucus,
made the appeal amid reports that the Cabinet plans to open direct
two-way cross-strait passenger and cargo flight services and that
President Chen will announce this an other major cross-strait policy
initiatives in his upcoming Double Ten National Day address.
</P>
<P>
To the best of his understanding, Chen Chien-ming said, the
Presidential Office received information in September from the other
side of the Taiwan Strait that the two sides can negotiate direct
cross-strait shipping and air links.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming claimed that Kuo Tai-chiang, president of the
Council for Industrial and Commercial Development, a private trade
association, has been acting as messenger for the proposed
cross-strait negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We are afraid that such negotiations would mainly be based on
the interests of business people rather than on the overall interests
of the nation, " Chen Chien-ming alleged, adding that a rash opening
of direct cross-strait transportation links could exacerbate capital
and personnel flows from Taiwan to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Should that be the case, Chen Chien-ming warned that Taiwan's
industries will hollow out and its unemployment rate will get worse.
Chen Chien-ming reminded President Chen that he should honor his
campaign promise to give top priority to safeguarding Taiwan's
separate national identity in dealing with cross-strait issues.
</P>
<P>
"The president should insist on negotiating with Beijing through
official channels on an equal footing, " Chen Chien-ming said, adding
that Taiwan should stand firm on defining cross-strait shipping and
air links as "special state-to-state" routes in such talks.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming also urged the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration not to commission any "secret envoys" to negotiate
direct cross-strait transportation links because such moves violate
the government's basic policy of "official authorization" and the
principle of transparency in all cross-strait dealings.
</P>
<P>
"We have the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council and the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation to handle cross-strait
affairs. The DPP administration should refrain from authorizing any
private organization or individual to handle direct air and shipping
links negotiations with Beijing that would avoid legislative and
public supervision," Chen Chien-ming added.

KEYSER'S CASE WILL NOT IMPEDE INVITATIONS TO U.S. FOR DOUBLE TEN DAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent case involving a former U.S.
State Department official and two Taiwan National Security Bureau
(NSB) staff is irrelevant in relation to inviting U.S. dignitaries to
attend the Oct. 10 ROC National Day celebrations, an official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Victor Chin, director-general of MOFA's Department of North
American Affairs, was referring to the case involving Donald Keyser,
former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia and
Pacific Affairs, and two NSB intelligence operatives posted in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Keyser was recently arrested by the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation on charges of concealing a trip he made to Taiwan last
September and was later released on US$500,000 bond. Media reports
said Keyser was also found to have passed files to the two Taiwan
operatives.
</P>
<P>
Chin said that the case has nothing to do with inviting former
U.S. government officials and congressmen to Taiwan to attend
the Double Ten celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chin also said that MOFA will continue to assist the
Ministry of National Defense in communicating with the U.S. on the
proposed arms procurement.
</P>
<P>
Chin said members of the think tank Atlantic Council of the
United States said during a recent visit to Taiwan that if the
Legislative Yuan does not approve a NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion) special budget for arms procurement from the United States
mainly for six PAC-III anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-powered
submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, it will
certainly have an impact on Taiwan-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He said MOFA has no way of knowing if the arms procurement
proposal will be approved by the legislature, but he is sure that the
U.S. will understand the government's efforts and sincerity in
promoting the arms deal.

TAIWAN TO HAVE AT LEAST SEVEN FREE TRADE HARBOR ZONES BY 2008
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has to actively promote free trade
harbor zones to improve the island's edge in global logistics, and it
is estimated that by 2008, there will be at least seven such zones,
an official from the nation's top economic planning agency said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) official
said that faced with the globalization, global logistics management
will be the cornerstone of many enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To keep Taiwan's edge in global logistics, the government will
have to actively promote free trade harbor zones, creating the zones
in international harbors or areas around the airports, waiving
custom tariffs and commodity and business taxes, streamlining the
flow of goods within the zones to create benefits from transshipments
and increasing industries' high value-added products, the CEPD
official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that harbor authorities in Kaohsiung, Keelung,
Taichung and Taipei, as well as some export processing zones, have
already applied to set up free trade harbor zones. Among them,
Keelung and Kaohsiung harbors have already been approved by the
Executive Yuan to operate this month and in January 2005,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 export processing zones in Taiwan, the official
said, and it is estimated that at least two will be transformed into
free trade harbors.
</P>
<P>
Even by the most conservative estimates, there will be seven free
trade zones by 2008 in Taiwan, with 1,000 manufacturers stationed in
them, employing 31,000 people and creating a value of NT$162.5
billion (US$4.779 billion).

EXECUTIVE YUAN PLANS TO SUE KMT OVER ILL-GOTTEN PROPERTIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will file a lawsuit against
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) unless it returns all the properties
it obtained through unlawful means, Executive Yuan spokesman Chen
Chi-mai said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to prevent the KMT from selling the properties to a
third party, Chen said Premier Yu Shyi-kun has ordered that a
"retroactive clause" be added to a bill aimed at restoring the
properties, which will subject whoever owns the properties to the
legal responsibility of returning them to the government.
</P>
<P>
Chen accused the KMT of attempting to "cheat the world" by
claiming that it has returned 80 percent of these properties,
pointing out that there is a big difference of opinion between the
KMT and the Control Yuan on the number of properties that are
supposed to belong to the government.
</P>
<P>
According to the Control Yuan's report, the KMT appropriated from
the government or took over from the Japanese colonial government a
total of 114 pieces of land, but the KMT claims only 24 pieces of
land and five buildings were obtained in this manner, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Of the properties in this category, the KMT has only returned 10
pieces of land and two houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the cinemas taken over by the KMT from the Japanese
colonial government, the Control Yuan determined there are 19 of
them, but the KMT only promised before the March 20 presidential
election to return seven, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
While the KMT has never honored its promise, Chen said, it sold
the Lotung Cinema in Ilan County in May.
</P>
<P>
In another category, properties presented by local governments to
the KMT total 123 as shown in the Control Yuan report, compared with
134 counted by the KMT, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the KMT has returned 80 percent of the properties in this
category but has refused to return another 191 pieces of land and 32
buildings purchased by KMT-controlled media.
</P>
<P>
If the KMT still shows no intention of returning the remaining
properties during a fresh round of negotiations with the Ministry of
Finance on Thursday, the Executive Yuan will take legal action
against the party, Chen said.

New York Times: At least 26 die as three
car bombs explode in Iraq.

Three powerful car bombs exploded across Iraq on Monday morning,
killing at least 26 people and wounding more than 100 others in a day
of carnage that demonstrated the relative ease with which insurgents
are striking in the hearts of major citie. The first blasts hit
Baghdad, where two suicide car bombs exploded within an hour of each
other, one on either side of the Tigris River. The bomb in the west
detonated after a car loaded with explosives rammed into a recruiting
center for Iraqi plainclothes police officers. The attack took place
near a checkpoint to the fortified headquarters of the interim Iraqi
government and the American Embassy.

Wall Street Journal: As election nears, counting the vote faces
new pitfalls.

Four years after electoral chaos in Florida sent the Bush-Gore
presidential battle to the Supreme Court, sparring is erupting around
the country over the very procedures intended to prevent a repeat,
even as some familiar problems loom just weeks before Election Day. A
new federal election law that was meant to bring more uniformity to
locally run elections is itself spawning a patchwork of inconsistent
policies in different states. Language in the law allowing voters to
cast "provisional votes" when their registration is in doubt has
already set off legal battles over which provisional ballots will
ultimately be counted. New voting technology has sparked debates over
the possibility of computer hacking, even as the infamous punch-card
machines, outlawed in Florida and elsewhere, are still in use in
parts of 22 states.

ROC FOREIGN MINISTER SUPPORTS JAPAN'S BID FOR UNSC PERMANENT SEAT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Tuesday he supports Japan's bid to become a permanent member of
the U.N. Security Council (UNSC).
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after meeting with Chen Hung-chi,
Taiwan's new deputy representative to Japan, who left for Tokyo to
assume his new post the same day.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that during his recent visit to the United States, he
was asked about his view on Japan's quest for a UNSC permanent seat.
</P>
<P>
"I told my U.S. hosts that I support Japan's bid and will be
pleased to see Japan enter the Security Council as a permanent
member," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that Japan donates 20 percent of the annual U.N.
budget and has had outstanding economic achievements over the past
decades.
</P>
<P>
"The world should not continue to restrict Japan's role in
international affairs due to its aggressive military action 60 years
ago. I think the United Nations should work out a more reasonable
UNSC organic framework with Japan, Germany, India and Brazil being
given permanent seats," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the fact that the Republic of China lost its U.N.
seat in 1971, Chen said that since the ROC was a founding member of
the world body, Taiwan could possibly help Japan's efforts to obtain
a permanent seat, but the issue would need further study.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang Fu-mei, chairwoman of the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Commission, also gave moral support to Japan's quest for a
UNSC permanent seat on the grounds that Japan has on many
international occasions spoken for Taiwan's cause and that the two
countries have traditionally maintained close relations.
</P>
<P>
Chang said Japan cast a "yes" vote in the World Health Assembly
-- the World Health Organization's governing body -- held in Geneva
in May on Taiwan's bid to join the organization as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the result of a recent public opinion poll conducted by
the Japanese daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, Chang said 81 percent
of Japanese citizens responding to the survey gave a thumbs-up to
Taiwan's goal of U.N. representation. The poll results indicate that
a majority of Japanese people support Taiwan's pursuit of greater
"international space," Chang added.

SHOOTING COMMISSION MUST BE SUSPENDED PENDING RULING: CABINET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The operations of a commission authorized
under a controversial bill to investigate the March 19 shooting of
the president must be suspended until the Council of Grand Justices
can rule on the statute's constitutionality, a spokesman for the
Executive Yuan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai made the remarks after Shih Chi-yang, the convener
of the commission to investigate the presidential election-eve
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu,
suggested the previous day that the statute be revised during the
first meeting of the commission to assuage public misgivings. The
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) accepted Shih's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the KMT and PFP caucuses in the Legislative Yuan
proposed a revised draft of the special statute to probe the March 19
shooting. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , while
mocking the opposition for "returning to the correct path after going
astray, " said the action vindicates what they have been saying all
along -- the statute as passed is unconstitutional. As such, the DPP
did not oppose the move and the issue of revising the bill will now
be put on the agenda of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai noted that the Presidential Office and the Executive
Yuan have repeatedly warned that the special statute was
unconstitutional and illegal, but the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan went ahead anyway and passed the bill in August and
rejected the Executive Yuan's request for reconsideration the
following month.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Chi-mai said that even though the "pan-blue
alliance" has agreed to take another look at the bill, the fact is
that the statute violates the ROC Constitution and various laws and
even if the bill is revised down from being "85 percent in violation
of the Constitution and laws to 75 percent, " the effort would be an
exercise in futility as the statute would still be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai cited as an example that under the bill, the 17
members of the commission are to be recommended by the
legislature in accordance with the proportion of each political
party; however, this would create a political force that would
interfere with judicial investigations. The DPP and its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, were designated to have seven people sit on
the commission, but they decided to boycott the proceedings by not
recommending any members.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Chen Chi-mai said that if the opposition is
unable to handle this situation, the operations of the commission
should be frozen until the Grand Justices hand down a ruling "so as
not to cause irreversible damage to human rights."

Eating in style has a new meaning in Nantou
County with the creation of sets of ceramic "butterfly-style" cups,

</P>
<P>
A pottery studio founded in 1955 has released the butterfly-motif
dishes as part of the government's efforts to promote a combination
of ceramic arts and local delicacies.
</P>
<P>
The "Ten Shing Yao" ceramic art company in Chi Chi township, the

pottery manufacturers selected by the Council for Cultural Affairs to
carry out the project aimed at encouraging local ceramic artists to
create distinctive tableware.
</P>
<P>
The pottery studio's butterfly-style series comprise 103 pieces
of various utensils from the smallest chopsticks holder to the
heaviest ceramic pot. The creations were inspired by Taiwan's image
as a kingdom of butterflies, according to Ten Shing Yao's master of
ceramic arts, Lin Ching-ho.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the creations add aesthetic and historic value to
local foods.

THREE MORE MAINLAND CHINESE TOURISTS ABSCOND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three more mainland Chinese tourists
absconded from Taiwan hotels between late August and September, a
Tourism Bureau official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As the tour guides and travel agents involved immediately
reported the cases in accordance with relevant regulations, they will
not be disciplined," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the official said, the Tourism Bureau will tighten
supervision of travel services, including demanding local travel
agencies to "prudently select" their mainland cooperative partners in
organizing local tour packages for mainland tourists.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan opened its doors to select mainland citizens for
pleasure trips two years ago, the official said, more than 40
mainland tourists have absconded, either upon arrival or from the
hotels where they were staying.
</P>
<P>
"The absconding rate is relatively low in comparison with the
ratios in other countries," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The absconding rate was 0.23 percent in Taiwan, compared to 0.37
percent in Japan, 3 percent in Australia and 10-13 percent in South
Korea, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official further said the Travel Agent Association (TAA) of
the Republic of China, which has been commissioned by the Tourism
Bureau to screen the backgrounds of prospective mainland visitors in
advance, has adopted a new disciplinary system to tighten
the management of local travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Under the new supervisory system, any travel agency that reports
two absconding cases within one month will be banned from receiving
mainland tour groups for a month.
</P>
<P>
TAA officials said the system was implemented Sept. 1 after two
en-masse absconding cases were reported between July and August. Only
one of the three latest absconding cases took place after the new
disciplinary system was put into practice, the officials said. The
other two cases occurred in late August.
</P>
<P>
Since the disciplinary system's implementation, the TAA has
screened more than 2,000 mainland tourists. During the period, the
TAA rejected applications by two mainland tour groups, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The case reported Sept. 13 involved a woman surnamed Qin. Police
have located a local man who had contact with Qin following her
arrival, but the man claimed not to know the woman's current
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
Police said they have stepped up the search in places where
illegal mainland immigrants traditionally take jobs, such as
restaurants and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Immigration and aviation police authorities have also adopted
stricter measures, including demanding that local tour guides receive
mainland tour groups at special waiting rooms at airports instead of
in the usual arrival lounges, to prevent absconding en masse.

MOTC TO STUDY TICKET PRICE RISES FOR TRANSPORT SECTOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Transport and Communications
(MOTC) will study the feasibility of price hikes for air carriers,
trains and buses in view of high oil prices that show no signs of
cooling, a ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will discuss adjustment ranges in the coming days,
as the domestic transport sector has been dogged by the soaring oil
prices since the beginning of this year, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Lin Ling-san told a legislative committee a
day earlier that the ministry will revise the current air, rail and
bus ticket rates in the face of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the amount of the increases for the various forms
of transport has not been decided, as oil prices have fluctuated
noticeably in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Chang Kuo-cheng, director-general of the MOTC's Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA), said that the present air fares were worked out
when the international oil price was about US$34 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Now, with the price having surged to nearly US$50 per barrel,
operating costs of the aviation companies has jumped, Chang pointed
out, adding however that the CAA feels it is better to impose further
fuel surcharges on tickets rather than directly increasing fares.
</P>
<P>
Four Taiwan-based carriers -- Far East Air Transport Corp.,
Mandarin Airlines, UNI Airways Corp. and Trans Asia Airways -- each
filed an application with the CAA last month requesting a ticket
price hike.
</P>
<P>
Pushed by the rising oil price, the four airlines, through a
transport industry association, again raised a fuel surcharge request
recently for their domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
CAA officials said the carriers will be allowed to make the
increase either way on their domestic routes to avoid a double hike.
</P>
<P>
Business sources forecast that the fuel surcharge on domestic
routes will be around NT$80 (US$2.4) per ticket.
</P>
<P>
The CAA first permitted six airlines to impose a fuel surcharge
on their international routes from July 1 until the end of September.
The practice was extended to last until mid-March next year.

COURT REJECTS RETRIAL APPEAL INVOLVING WEEKLY AND VICE PRESIDENT

(By Lilian Wu)

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan High Court rejected Tuesday an appeal
for a retrial of a case involving Vice President Annette Lu and local
weekly the Journalist.
</P>
<P>
The Journalist asked for a retrial after the Supreme Court threw
out an earlier appeal by the magazine for a reversal of a lower court
ruling in Lu's favor in April.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court upheld the High Court judgment and instructed
the magazine to publish the court ruling against it in newspaper
advertisements, as well as to apologize to Lu for failing to check
its facts when it published a story in 2000 claiming that Lu
circulated a rumor that President Chen Shui-bian was having an affair
with one of his aides.
</P>
<P>
The High Court ruling said that evidence the Journalist claimed
the Supreme Court failed to examine did not constitute conditions to
ask for a retrial under the Code of Civil Procedure.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yen-jen, a lawyer commissioned by the Journalist, said he
regretted the decision and said that the magazine has already asked
the Council of Grand Justices for an interpretation of the
constitutionality of the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the verdict, the magazine will decide whether to
ask again for a retrial, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who brought the lawsuit against the weekly as well as its
president, editor-in-chief, and writers of the story, asked for a
"restoration of her reputation" damaged by the story.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court said in April that the judges hearing the case
fully agreed with a Council of Grand Justices' opinion that it would
unnecessarily limit the freedom of the press and jeopardize the mass
media's role as a monitor of society if they were required to report
only "accurate " stories.
</P>
<P>
But the court found that the appellants in the case failed to
reasonably verify the truth of the story and should be held
responsible for damaging Lu's reputation.
</P>
<P>
The Journalist attributed its sources to its editor-in-chief Lee
Ming-chun, who goes by the pen name of Yang Chao, claiming that Yang
was told by Lu on the phone about the alleged affair at the
Presidential Office. However, neither the Journalist nor Yang were
able to prove their claim and the telephone company's records did not
show any such calls being made by Lu.

Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two-day 2004 International Conference on
Slopeland Disaster Mitigation began Tuesday in Taipei with the hope
of elevating Taiwan's capability in disaster prevention.
</P>
<P>
The issue of landslides prevention drew special attention after
Taiwan suffered significantly from a series of typhoons that struck
the island this summer.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the United States, Japan, Switzerland, Austria,
Italy, Hong Kong and Vietnam were invited to the conference,
organized by the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau under the Council
of Agriculture (COA) , to share their experiences in slopeland
disaster mitigation.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Yao-chi, chairperson of the Cabinet-level 921 Earthquake
Post-Disaster Recovery Commission, also attended the conference.
Reconstruction is still going on in some areas five years after the
island was hard hit by the devastating earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
COA Vice Chairman Tai Chen-yao noted that the Soil and Water
Conservation Bureau is working actively in determining which rivers
and creeks around the island that may cause landslides during natural
disasters, and is raising its ability to prevent landslides.
</P>
<P>
Tai expressed hope that discussing the issues and sharing
experiences with foreign experts, Taiwan's disaster prevention can
reach that of advanced countries.

GOVERNMENT DEFICIT TOPS NT$297.2 BILLION IN 2003
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deficit of the central government hit a
record high of NT$297.2 billion (US$8.74 billion) in 2003, while the
payable debts of the government topped NT$3.29 trillion,
Auditor-General Su Chen-ping said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount of payable debts increased NT$264.1 billion over the
previous year, with the interest payable to the government reaching
NT$144.3 billion, according to a report delivered by Su to the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
On the financial condition for this year, Su said the
government's tax revenue accounts for only 49.77 percent of its
expenditure, which is a record low. He noted that the increase of tax
revenue is lagging far behind the rise of government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Su said rising spending on sectors such as social welfare,
education, science, culture, retirement benefits for civil servants
and debts is severely squeezing the spending on economic development
and public infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, he went on, a number of the government's
policies have been financed by additional or special budget plans
relying on the issuance of government bonds.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, tax revenue has failed to meet the government's
target for five consecutive years because of the large amount of
unpaid taxes and the large amount of tax deductions and waiving
measures.
</P>
<P>
On the deficiencies of the government in implementing its annual
budget, Su said the funding for major public infrastructure projects
has decreased over the years and has limited its investment capacity,
while the government's measures to boost employment are lacking a
comprehensive control mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Other deficiencies include the lack of proper planning for the
government's social security and welfare programs, as well as
inefficiency in implementing forestation projects and restoring
government property illegally occupied by the private sector.

PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE REGRETS LEGISLATURE'S SNUB OF PRESIDENT'S REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office expressed regret
Tuesday over the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan's snubbing of
President Chen Shui-bian's proposal to deliver a state-of-the-nation
report on the legislative floor.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-chung, director of the Presidential Office's Public
Affairs Department, made the remarks after the legislature's
Procedure Committee killed a bill jointly initiated by the
legislative caucuses of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) inviting Chen to deliver an
unprecedented state-of-the-nation report in the legislature by a vote
of 11:18.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-chung said the legislature has missed a good opportunity
to "write a new page in Taiwan's constitutional democratic history" by
rejecting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"The report could have provided opportunities for the executive
and legislative branches to communicate and forge trust so as to
break the domestic political stalemate. We feel deep regret over the
legislature's decision," Chen Wen-chung said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed interest in addressing the legislators on
major policy issues in a letter sent to the legislature Sept. 27. In
his letter, the president said he would focus his report on three
major issues -- the NT$610.8 billion arms procurement plan, Taiwan's
bid to joint the United Nations and the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
As the Constitution does not contain clear provisions regarding
state-of-the-nation reports, the legislature declined a day earlier
to put the president's request on its meeting agenda after two rounds
of cross-party consultations.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) claimed that it is up to the legislature
to decide whether to invite the president to deliver a
state-of-the-nation report and that the president himself is not
eligible to propose such a report.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the DPP and the TSU legislative caucuses jointly
initiated the bill inviting the president to deliver the report. As
the "pan-blue alliance" dominated the Procedure Committee, however,
the bill was killed and failed to make the legislative meeting
agenda.

PENTAGON URGES TAIWAN TO ACCEPT MILITARY DEFENSE PLAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Phoenix,  Arizona,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's legislators should put
aside their partisan strife and pass a major military procurement
program for the sake of the interests of the country, the United
States and the rest of the world, a ranking Pentagon official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech at an annual defense industry conference
sponsored by the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council here, Richard Lawless,
deputy assistant secretary of defense, said Taiwan should seek to
display a keen desire to beef up its defense capabilities by
approving the controversial military procurement plan.
</P>
<P>
Such a move would make Taiwan's resolve to safeguard its national
security clear to the whole world, and the United States would honor
its commitment by rallying behind Taiwan to deter attack from
mainland China from generation through generation, Lawless said.
</P>
<P>
He warned of serious consequences in the long term should Taiwan
fail to do this.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the people of Taiwan will have the final say in
the arms procurement program, he claimed, however, that failure to
give the green light would invite repeated military threats from
mainland China and relay a message to the world that Taiwan is not
yet a fully fledged democracy in which national security is above
political interests.
</P>
<P>
Should Taiwan's parliament fail to approve the budget for the
purchase plan, friends and foes alike might well begin to regard
Taiwan as a liability rather than a partner, at a time when many
countries in the world, including the United States, are highly
skeptical of Taiwan's determination to safeguard itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
National Defense Vice Minister Houh Shoou-yeh also took part in
the conference, the third of its kind, at the head of an official
delegation from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The expensive military procurement plan, estimated to cost Taiwan
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) over a 15-year period, has
stirred heated debate between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition camp claims that the military buildup plan is no
more than pork barrel politics that will leave Taiwan's younger
generations strapped with huge debt.

NO SIGNS OF INFLATION: DGBAS OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government officials said Tuesday that
Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in the first nine months of this
year registered a growth of 1.54 percent over the same period of last
year and that there is no sign of inflation for the moment.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released that day by the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), the
CPI for September stood at 102.24, which represents 0.54 percent
growth over August, and a 2.78 percent increase over the same month
of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the wholesale price index (WPI) stood at 113.4 in
September, an increase of 0.23 percent over August, but a notable
11.43 percent growth over the same month of last year, the highest
increase since May 1981.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials said the CPI growth in September was due largely
to price hikes for vegetables and fruit resulting from flooding
caused by typhoons that occurred in late August and heavy rain in
September, and stressed that the price hikes are temporary.
</P>
<P>
According to the DGBAS statistics, the core CPI (excluding prices
of vegetables, fish products and energy) only grew 0.99 precent in
September, and 0.65 percent during the first nine months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the CPI growth of 1.54 percent and core CPI increase
of only 0.65 percent, the officials added, the price rise is
moderate.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the officials noted, although international oil
prices have topped US$50 per barrel recently, local public transport
fares have remained unchanged, leaving them unworried about possible
inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials said they will study whether to adjust
upward the CPI and WPI increases for this year, which were originally
estimated at 1.49 percent and 16.99 percent, respectively, at a
conference on national income to be held in November.

U.S. SEES NO CAUSE TO RETHINK 'ONE CHINA' POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no cause for the United States
to rethink its "one China" policy, U.S. State Department Deputy
Spokesman Adam Ereli said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ereli made the remarks after Koo Kwang-min, a senior adviser to
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian, took out a 2,000-word,
full-page advertisement in the Washington Post that day urging the
U.S. government to reassess its "one China" policy, which Koo claims
has only benefited the communist totalitarian regime in mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
"Our China policy remains the same. There's no cause to rethink
it," Ereli said at regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Koo said in the advertisement, paid for by himself, that the "one
China" policy is already outdated and that many practices of
Washington today are making people wonder if the United States has
deviated from its founding philosophy.
</P>
<P>
The veteran pro-Taiwan independence activist said that more than
60 percent of the people of Taiwan now perceive themselves as
Taiwanese rather than Chinese and that the ratio continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
In his advertisement, titled "US Adherence to One China Policy
Only Benefits Communist Dictators: Let Taiwan Speak Out for Lasting
Peace, " Koo said the U.S. "one China" policy based on the 1972
Shanghai Communique no longer fits political reality in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Koo said he hopes the U.S. government can reassess its "one
China" policy in light of Taiwan's new mainstream public opinion and
its new political reality.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Koo's
advertisement does not represent the ROC government's position.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the article reflects only Koo's personal opinion,
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said the government had no knowledge
beforehand that the advertisement would be run. The advertisement
also appeared in the English-language Taipei Times.

CHINA'S MISSILE DEPLOYMENT IS MAIN FACTOR OF INSTABILITY: MOFA

<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China's missile deployment is the
main reason for the instability of Taipei-Washington-Beijing
relations, according to a report presented to the Legislative Yuan
Tuesday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).
</P>
<P>
Citing a U.S. Congress report, the MOFA noted that the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) has continued to build up its military forces
to intimidate Taiwan and deter the United States from intervening in
a Taiwan Strait crisis.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has so far deployed 500 to 550 missiles and the number
continues to increase by about 75 per year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The missiles pose a threat not only to Taiwan but also to U.S.
and Japanese military deployments in east Asia, the MOFA claims in
its report.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA also extended a welcome to a suggestion by U.S. think
tanks that both the U.S. Congress and administration should review
Washington's "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan and the United States share the same ideals
and values of democracy, freedom and human rights and that the two
countries have common interests and benefits in cooperation on
security, trade, agriculture, fishery, education and cultural
affairs, the MOFA predicted that bilateral ties will continue to
steadily improve.

International passenger flight services at
Chingchuankang (CCK) International Airport in central Taiwan kicked
off Tuesday with the inauguration of regular charter flights between
Taichung and Seoul.
</P>
<P>
A Mandarin Airlines FK-100 plane with 108 passengers aboard took
off from the commercial-cum-military airport on the outskirts of
Taichung City at 2: 30 p.m. amid cheers from government officials,
elected representatives and airline executives.
</P>

Among the well-wishers were Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san, Taichung County Magistrate Huang
Chung-sheng and Liao Yung-lai, director of the Cabinet's Central
Taiwan Liaison Office.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first international flight from the airport since
its inauguration March 5 when three outbound international charter
flights used the facility. At that time, the return flights had to
land at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in northern Taiwan as
CCK Airport had not yet been fully completed.
</P>
<P>
This time around, the return flight from Seoul, with 70-plus
South Korean travel agents and journalists aboard, landed smoothly at
CCK Airport at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
From now on, Taichung-Seoul charter services will fly once every
five days. The first seven Seoul-bound charter flights are all fully
booked. Starting Nov. 14, the service will increase to twice a week,
every Wednesday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In light of the warm public response for the flights, Mandarin
Airlines has begun preparations for charter flights to several
southern Japanese destinations in November. In the future, the
company said, it will also operate charter flights to Southeast Asian
nations from CCK Airport.

PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE REBUTS SECRET ENVOY RUMOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office rebutted Tuesday a
rumor regarding a secret envoy in connection with mainland China,
calling it a "fabricated and groundless" story.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office issued the rebuttal in a press release in
response to a comment aired earlier the same day by opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union Legislator Chen Chien-ming, who accused the
Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan of sending Kuo Tai-chiang,
chairman of the Council for Industrial and Commercial Development
(CICD), as a secret envoy to engage with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the matter is a clear reflection of the
government's softening stance toward the mainland and it goes against
Taiwan's national interests.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office expressed deep regret over the rumor and
stressed that such rhetoric will seriously mislead the public
judgment and viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has not met Kuo since Aug. 17 at the
Presidential Office, it said, adding that it is out of the question
that the president would send Kuo as a secret agent to deal with the
mainland. The president fully respects the government system in terms
of cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, it added.
</P>
<P>
However, in the latest development, CICD Secretary-General Wang
Tiao-chun, admitted that Kuo, in his capacity as CICD chairman, did
meet ranking mainland officials during a recent trip to Beijing from
Sept. 21-28.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he was also present at the meeting and explained that
the purpose of Kuo's visit was only to transmit President Chen's hope
of designating the direct transport, trade and postal services
between the two sides as "cross-strait" routes instead of
international links as Beijing insists upon.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the proposal has gained a positive response from
Beijing, Wang refused to reveal where the meeting took place or which
Beijing officials were present, citing a mutual agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Wang added that neither Kuo nor he himself were "secret
envoys" of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
People on both sides of the strait are hoping fervently for the
opening of direct three links, and the CICD will do its best to push
toward that end, he said.

PRESIDENT LAMBASTS SO-CALLED `TRUTH' COMMISSION AS OUTRAGEOUS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian lambasted a
commission created under a controversial statute to investigate the
the March 19 assassination attempt against him as "outrageous and
disgraceful."
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed his views on the March 19 Shooting Truth
Investigation Commission during a meeting with Jerome A. Cohen, a
Harvard University professor.
</P>
<P>
Chen told his guest that Shih Chi-yang, the convener of the
commission, which his administration believes is illegal and
unconstitutional, had called for revisions to the controversial
statute even before the commission began formal operations.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that the statute is indeed problematic, " Chen
said, adding that the statute violates the ROC Constitution and a
number of critical laws.
</P>
<P>
Chen's administration has asked the Council of Grand Justices to
interpret the constitutionality of the statute and the legislative
caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has also asked for
a temporary injunction of the statute before the council hands down
its judgment.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he hopes the commission can suspend its operations
until the Council of Grand Justices has determined whether the
statute is constitutional or not.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is not afraid of investigations of the shooting
since he did not stage it. "I was a victim of the election-eve
incident," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Chen narrowly won re-election a day after the shooting on the
campaign trail grazed his stomach. His challenger, opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan insinuated that Chen might have staged
the shooting to win sympathy votes. Although he has offered no
evidence to support his allegations, he has filed two lawsuits to
challenge Chen's re-election victory and even the validity of the
election.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and its ally -- the People first Party -- jointly
authored and railroaded the controversial statute through the
legislature to create the all-powerful commission to investigate the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the commission is a joke and can lead nowhere because
its existence is unconstitutional.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT URGED TO ASK BEIJING TO ABANDON OPTION OF FORCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris,  Oct.5 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China's new representative to
the European Union and Belgium urged the members of the European
Parliament Tuesday to request that mainland China abandon the option
of the use of force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Cien-jen, who arrived in Brussels Oct. 4 to officially
assume his new post, made the appeal in a speech delivered at a
gatherIng held by Gerog Jarzembowski, chairman of the European
Parliament Taiwan Friendship Group, at the parliament's Brussels-based
headquarters the same day.
</P>
<P>
Apart from briefly introducing the history of Taiwan's political,
economic and social development, the envoy also told the 24 European
Parliament members attending the gathering that the island has made
great democratic achievements, such as the establishment of direct
presidential elections and the complete lifting of a ban on the
organization of political parties.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with other Chinese societies of neighboring countries,
including mainland China, Singapore and Hong Kong, Taiwan is the most
democratic and free country," he further said.
</P>
<P>
Calling for the European parliamentarians to request that Beijing
give up the option of force against Taiwan and to help push for the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in dialogue as soon as
possible, Chen also expressed the island's opposition to idea of the
European Union lifting its arms embargo against mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The European Union put in place a ban on arms exports to mainland
China in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, but some
E.U. members, including France and Germany, have been pushing for the
removal of the ban since last year following a request by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the lifting of the ban would help mainland China in the
development of its military forces and affect Taiwan's security as
well as peace and stability in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
"A lifting of the ban would be an undesirable encouragement to
mainland China which has yet to improve its human rights record, "
he continued.
</P>
<P>
In response, several of the European parliamentarians voiced
their concerns over cross-Taiwan Strait developments, saying that
they will urge the mainland to develop its democracy and the rule of
law and to pay more attention to human rights, as well as to promote
a positive development in cross-strait relations.

TAIWAN BUSINESS LEADER DENIES MEETING WITH HU JINTAO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan business tycoon Kuo Tai-chiang
categorically denied late Tuesday that he had acted as an "emissary"
between Taiwan and mainland China and that he had met with mainland
Chinese President Hu Jintao during his trip to the mainland in
September.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Kuo, chairman of the Council for
Industrial and Commercial Development (CICD) , denied that he had
represented President Chen Shui-bian in Beijing as an emissary in
meetings with ranking mainland Chinese officials in September.
</P>
<P>
Kuo, a high-technology industry tycoon, said he did not meet with
Chinese President Hu Jintao as claimed by a rumor Tuesday. Kuo said
he met with Hu Deping, first vice chairman of the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Li Bingcai, executive deputy
director of the Central Office for Taiwan Affairs, during his visit
in Beijing Sept. 21-23.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said that he attended the two meetings accompanied by other
CICD officials and that the meetings were purely business.
</P>
<P>
At the head of a Taiwan delegation, Kuo and several CICD
officials, as well as other Taiwan business and political figures,
including Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Chen Chien-ming, visited
mainland China Sept. 21-28 to drum up cross-strait business and
industrial cooperation. The itinerary of the visit included trips to
Beijing and Hangzhou, Kuo said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The highlights of the visit included the signing of a memorandum
on bilateral cooperation between the CICD and the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce, Kuo said, adding that the
memorandum was inked by CICD Secretary-General Wang Tiao-chun and
All-China Vice Chairman Xie Boyang in Beijing Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
Kuo issued the denial statement in the wake of comments made
Tuesday by Legislator Chen, who accused the Presidential Office and
the Executive Yuan of sending Kuo as a secret envoy to engage with
the mainland. Chen claimed that the trip is a clear reflection of the
government's softening stance toward the mainland and that it runs
counter to Taiwan's national interests.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said that the CICD, one of the largest and most influential
trade associations in Taiwan, has continuously urged the leaderships
of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to put aside their political
differences and work to open the "direct three links" across the
strait at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
People on both sides of the strait are fervently hoping for the
opening of the direct trade, postal and transportation links, and the
CICD will do its best to push toward that end, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said that in his capacity as the head of the CICD, he had
also urged the Chinese leadership during his visit in Beijing to be
more concerned about the interests of Taiwan businesspeople operating
in mainland China and heedful of the impact of China's measures aimed
at cooling its overheated economy on the Taiwan businesses.
</P>
<P>
He said he thinks the CICD's recent visit to Beijing was fruitful
as the group received favorable responses from the Chinese leadership
to many of their appeals.
</P>
<P>
Refuting Chen's accusation, Kuo said that Chen himself was among
the group and should certainly know well the mission and purposes of
the CICD.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said that the CICD has vowed to play a bridge role between
Taiwan's private business and industrial sectors and the government,
but the organization will never represent any political party or
government agency in dealing with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
He added that he has not met with President Chen Shui-bian or any
other government officials since the trip to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Presidential Office rebutted Tuesday the rumor
regarding Kuo's being an emissary between Taiwan and mainland China,
calling it a fabricated story.

<P>
The influenza vaccines ordered from a
British company have yet to arrive in Taiwan, an official of the
Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of DOH's Center for Disease Control,
made the remarks amid reports that British health authorities have
suspended the license of Chiron Corp. for three months because of
fears of contamination of the vaccines it produced.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has ordered 170,000 doses from the British flu shot
manufacturer, but they have yet to arrive in Taiwan, Shih said,
adding that this will not affect the current free flu shot drive.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has ordered 2.5 million doses of influenza
vaccine this year for senior citizens and infants aged between six
months and two years old, as well as medical staff and those employed
in the poultry industry.
</P>
<P>
The doses from Britain account for only a small fraction of the
total ordered, Shih stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the CDC has asked Chiron to pay compensation according to
the terms of the contract or supply shots from other manufacturers.

KOO'S AD DOESN'T REPRESENT GOVERNMENT'S STANCE: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The advertisements placed in the Washington
Post and the New York Times Monday by senior presidential advisor Koo
Kwang-ming do not represent the government's stance, the Presidential
Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office also did not know in advance about Koo's
plans to take out the ads urging the U.S. government to reassess its
"one China" policy, said James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Koo took out 2,000-word, full-page advertisements in both the
Washington Post and the New York Times Monday urging the U.S.
government to face the reality concerning Taiwan and rethink its "one
China" policy, which Koo claims has only benefited the communist
totalitarian regime in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In the ad, titled "U.S. Adherence to One China Policy Only
Benefits Communist Dictators: Let Taiwan Speak Out for Lasting Peace,
" Koo said America's "one China" policy based on the 1972 Shanghai
Communique no longer fits the political reality in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Koo said he hopes the U.S. government can reassess its "one
China" policy in light of Taiwan's new mainstream public opinion and
its new political reality.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the ads, Randall G. Shriver, U.S. deputy assistant
secretary of state for East Asian affairs, reportedly has suggested
that President Chen Shui-bian or the Presidential Office clarify
Koo's advertisements and Taiwan's position.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the running of these ads was Koo's personal move
which had nothing to do with the government. He added that the
Presidential Office has also become aware of Shriver's message via
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koo, a veteran pro-Taiwan independence activist, said
in an exclusive interview with the CNA in Washington, D.C., Tuesday
that he guarantees with his personal reputation that the ads have
nothing to do with the government of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Koo said that his son who resides in Japan helped with the
composition of the advertisement and that he himself handled all the
affairs regarding having the ad placed in the two major U.S. dailies.
</P>
<P>
"I myself paid for the ads, and the Taiwan government knew nothing
about it in advance, " he added.
</P>
<P>
On U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli's response
to the ads that there is no cause for the United States to rethink
its "one China" policy, Koo said that bureaucracy and reform are
usually slow and reserved.
</P>
<P>
Koo said that the "one China" policy is already outdated and that
many practices in Washington today are making people question whether
the United States has deviated from its founding principles.

FARMERS URGE GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS CAUSED BY MONKEYS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 farmers from central Taiwan
appealed Wednesday to the Legislative Yuan and the Council of
Agriculture (COA) to address the problem caused by the Formosan
macaque.
</P>
<P>
The farmers, accompanied by Legislator Tseng Tsai Mei-tsou of the
opposition Kuomintang, first protested outside the legislature
building in downtown Taipei, urging the government to protect their
rights.
</P>
<P>
The farmers complained that the monkeys take their fruit, ravage
farmland, and even sometimes harass women and children.
</P>
<P>
They asked the government to consider taking the monkeys off the
conserved animal list and that the COA also compensate them for their
crop losses.
</P>
<P>
They said that although the macaques repeatedly wreak havoc to
farmland, they cannot be rounded up or killed because they are
conserved animals, so that the only way of dealing with them is to
chase them away.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the COA conduct a comprehensive census of the
animals to investigate their numbers and seriously consider removing
them from the conserved animal list.
</P>
<P>
The farmers later went to the COA with their requests. In
addition to compensation for crop losses and removal of the monkeys
from the conserved list, they also suggested that an exclusive
tourism zone be set up to shelter the macaque.
</P>
<P>
They brought with them two rock macaques in cages, along with
pineapple plants that have been damaged by the macaques and pointed
out how the animals gnaw the roots of the plants, seriously affecting
the crop.
</P>
<P>
COA Vice Chairman Tai Chen-yao said the council will set up a
task force soon to investigation the damage done by the animals and
study ways to subsidize the farmers.

CAL, EVA AIR STRONG ENOUGH TO COMPETE IN INT'L AIR CARGO MARKET: IATA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,   Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The International Air Transportation
Association (IATA) affirmed the performance of Eva Air and China
Airlines Tuesday, saying that facing tough competition, the two
Taiwan carriers have established successful and competitive business
operations.
</P>
<P>
The organization also said that even in the highly competitive
international air cargo market, Eva Air and CAL hold a strong
position.
</P>
<P>
According to an assessment by Taiwan's Ministry of Transportation
and Communications, the new aviation agreement signed recently by
mainland China and the United States could impact on the Taiwan
carriers' air cargo business.
</P>
<P>
However, an IATA spokesman said the same day that he is confident
about the future development of Eva Air and CAL, pointing out that
despite the fact that the agreement will create more opportunities
for the American and mainland Chinese airlines, the sustainable
economic development in mainland China will also provide new business
opportunities for other airlines.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the rapid liberalization of the global air cargo
market has increased competition among airlines, Anthony Council, who
is responsible for the IATA Communication Department, said however
that both Eva Air and CAL are successful airlines with strong
positions in the air cargo market.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the problem of establishing direct air links between
Taiwan and mainland China, the spokesman said that its a political
issue and beyond the scope of the IATA to resolve.
</P>
<P>
IATA represents more than 270 airlines comprising 95 percent of
international scheduled air traffic.

AUSTRALIAN ENVOY PUSHES FOR CLOSER EXCHANGES WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The de-facto Australian ambassador to
Taiwan paid a visit to Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsiung
Wednesday as part of efforts to further boost bilateral exchanges and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Frances Adamson, representative of the Australian Commerce and
Industry Office, which represents Australian interests in Taiwan in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties, told Yang that Taiwan is
Australia's ninth-largest trading partner and that there is still
ample room for the two countries to expand their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Adamson briefed Yang on the highlights of a Taiwan-Australian
working holiday visa agreement to be implemented from Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, the two countries will issue
working holiday visas to each other's young citizens to boost tourist
exchanges and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Many Taiwan citizens make sightseeing trips to Australia each
year and the number of Taiwan students study in Australia has also
increased steadily, Adamson said, adding that in 2003 alone, Taiwan
people made 190,000 visits to Australia and the number of Taiwan
students studying in Australia has already reached 10,000.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the working holiday visa agreement will further
facilitate student exchanges between our two countries, " Adamson
said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Yang said Australian citizens are welcome to visit
Kaohsiung County, either for sightseeing or investment.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that he has traveled to the United States, Europe,
Russia and Scandinavian countries in the past few years to woo
investment in the southern Taiwan county.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the county's general investment climate, Yang said
Kaohsiung is been one of Taiwan's most important agricultural and
manufacturing bases. In recent years, he went on, the county
government has also given priority to promoting tourism.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the county government has also adopted many measures to
attract foreign investors to its new environmental protection
industry park and telecommunication industry park.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Australian business groups to invest in these two new
industrial parks," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and Australia signed an agreement July 15 on the exchange
of working holiday visas. Australia is the second country to sign
such an agreement with Taiwan after New Zealand. The Taiwan-New
Zealand working holiday visa agreement took effect in June.
</P>
<P>
Under the Taiwan-Australia working holiday agreement, Taiwan
citizens aged between 18 and 30 can apply for a working holiday visa
for a maximum one-year stay in Australia.

TAIPEI MAYOR TOUTS SUNGSHAN AIRPORT FOR DIRECT LINKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou was keenly touting
Sungshan Airport as a hub for direct transport links with mainland
China, saying that the opening will reduce travel time for Taiwan
businessmen traveling between the two sides by more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks at a seminar Tuesday with local business
community leaders and representatives.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that direct air links between Taipei, Shanghai and
Dongguan will save passengers a great deal of time, Ma contended that
Taipei's Sungshan Airport should be made into an exclusive gateway
for cross-strait travel, while Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
in neighboring Taoyuan should continue to handle international
passenger and cargo travel.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that Taiwan should make the move to sharpen its
competitive edge and create business opportunities in view of the
grouping of economies in Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia by 2010,
when mainland China is slated to sign a free trade agreement (FTA)
with member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
By that time, the economic development in Northeast Asian and
Southeast Asian countries will be integrated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, he pointed out, the closer economic partnership
arrangements inked by the mainland with Hong Kong and Macau will put
Taiwan at a disadvantage, as a large number of products from the two
territories are set to enjoy "zero-tariff" treatment.
</P>
<P>
Should Taiwan fail to make breakthroughs in FTAs with other
countries, it will lose the vast mainland market to Japan, South
Korea and other Southeast Asian countries, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the mainland, which absorbs US$50 billion in
foreign investment per year, Taiwan took in only US$3.6 billion last
year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei mayor said that Taiwan cannot afford to overlook the
mainland market, citing a forecast by the Far Eastern Economic Review
that the mainland will have replaced the United States as the world's
largest economy by 2020.

PREMIER WANTS RED FIRE ANTS ERADICATED IN THREE YEARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun instructed relevant
government agencies Wednesday to control the proliferation of red
fire ants by the end of the year and have the alien pests completely
exterminated from Taiwan in three years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a supra-division meeting at the Executive Yuan, Yu
said that the invasion of red fire ants into Taiwan not only
threatens human safety and health, but is also endangering the
island's ecology, necessitating the government at all levels to make
concerted efforts to stamp out the pests.
</P>
<P>
Amid heightened alert in the wake of the discovery of the ants in
Taipei at the end of September, Yu has instructed the formation of a
supra-government agency team to coordinate with local governments to
grapple the problem.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, he instructed the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture (COA) to build a standard operating procedure (SOP) to
allow agencies, local governments and schools to follow when dealing
with red fire ant infestations.
</P>
<P>
For their part, the COA officials said that relevant government
agencies, including the COA, the Environmental Protection
Administration, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of
National Defense, will all pitch into the concerted efforts to battle
the insects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who was also present at the
meeting, said the city has formed a contingency task force, since red
fire ants were first detected in the capital city Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
The city task force, led by Deputy Mayor Yeh Chin-chuan, will see
to it that all potted plants, construction earth and landscaping sod
that enter Taipei is examined and certified ant-free before being
distributed, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The red fire ants, which are native to southern Brazil, were
first spotted in Taipei City on a traffic island on Chunghua Road,
where about 16 anthills were found Sept. 28. Although environmental
protection personnel quickly applied pesticide to the area, 20 new
anthills up to 3 centimeters high were discovered Sept. 30. It is
estimated that close to a hectare of lawn on the traffic island has
been occupied by the ants.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine said they have no clue as to when or how
the ants spread to Taipei, but believe that the ants -- which become
very aggressive when their anthills are disturbed and bite and sting
repeatedly -- were probably brought into the city via potted plants
or landscaping sod.
</P>
<P>
While racing to control the proliferation of the red fire ants,
COA officials said that they will try to develop more effective ways
to kill the pests, taking reference from the approaches of the United
States and Australia, which have been battling the ants for many
years with little success.
</P>
<P>
Farmers consider the insect a nuisance because although they do
not endanger crops, their bites and stings are annoying and very
painful, and for a small number of people who are allergic to the
venom, a single sting could be fatal.

ITEMS, PRICES OF ARMS PROCUREMENT FROM U.S. SHOULD BE `REASONABLE'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday that the items in the proposed arms procurement plan should
be "reasonable" and that the prices should conform with international
market prices.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks amid reports that a Pentagon official said
Monday that Taiwan should display a keen desire to beef up its
defense capability by approving the controversial military purchase
plan.
</P>
<P>
Richard Lawless, the U.S. deputy under-secretary of defense, also
warned in an annual defense industry conference in Phoenix, Arizona,
of serious consequences in the long term should Taiwan fail to do so,
saying that if the legislature fails to approve of the procurement
plan, friends and foes alike might well begin to regard Taiwan "as a
liability rather than a partner."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan need not pay too much attention to the warning, Wang
claimed, adding that "our stance is clear -- we need to consider the
overall defense needs of Taiwan and to adopt the right policy."
</P>
<P>
He said he expressed clearly to Minister of National Defense Lee
Jye that a statute governing the arms procurement from the United
States could be sent to the legislative caucuses of the various
political parties, so that it can be reviewed quickly.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the defense ministry will take stock
of the views of the Legislative Yuan and consult with the United
States to obtain a new quotation for the arms.
</P>
<P>
At stake is the Executive Yuan's proposed NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) special budget in June over a 15-year period
starting 2005 mainly for the purchase of six batteries of the
Patriot-III anti-missile system, eight diesel-electric submarines and
a squadron of 12 anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the delivery of the arms will be between three and
15 years, and that "a few months shouldn't make too much difference"
when reviewing the statutes for the arms purchase and special budget.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the three principles of the legislature: the major
purchase statute should be sent to the committee for screening before
the Dec. 11 legislative elections; the statute for the purchase
should be reviewed first and then the budget should be reviewed; and
the legislature must not squander money and should judge what is in
Taiwan's best interests.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current legislative session will be put on hold
Nov. 12 for the year-end elections. Returning to the legislature
after the elections, the lawmakers can start to review the special
budget if the arms procurement statute has already passed the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Defense Ministry will still have two months
to haggle over the price with the United States, he added.

U.S. OFFICIAL CAUTIONS TAIWAN OVER POSSIBLE ATTACK BY CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Phoenix,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-chi and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is facing a serious threat from
mainland China, which is exploring every possible coercive means
against Taiwan that might include a "non-traditional military action"
similar to the 911 terrorist attacks on the United States, U.S.
Deputy Under-secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Affairs
Richard Lawless said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 2004 U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference held
in Phoenix, Arizona, Lawless expressed Washington's concern that
Taipei has so far failed to recognize the consequences of such a
threat.
</P>
<P>
The disastrous earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999, which resulted in
massive blackouts around the island, exposed the weakness of Taiwan's
infrastructure, Lawless pointed out.
</P>
<P>
At that time, many people were worried that the mainland might
take advantage of the chaos to launch a surprise attack on Taiwan,
Lawless said.
</P>
<P>
A similar situation of chaos occurred after the election-eve
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian on March 19, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan must beef up the security of its public
infrastructure and central command against a possible swift invasion
and decapitation campaign by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech to the conference, Lawless urged Taiwan's
lawmakers to pass a special budget plan aimed at financing arms
procurement from the United States to show the island's resolve in
defending its security.
</P>
<P>
The procurement plan will cost NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23

EX-PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS TAIWAN-U.S. TELECONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui will address a
Taiwan-U.S. videoconference Friday to explain the gist and
necessity of Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering movement, local
organizers of the teleconference said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar on Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering and the
triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations will be jointly
organized by the Taipei-based Alliance to Promote a New Constitution
for Taiwan and the Washington-based Center for Taiwan International
Relations.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kang-hou, the alliance's spokesman, said this will be the
first time the alliance has sponsored an international teleconference
to help other countries understand the importance of writing a new
constitution for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"By holding the videoconference, we hope the international
community will come to know that our new constitution movement will
not change Taiwan's status quo nor will it cause regional
instability, " Wang said, adding that similar teleconferences will be
held in Japan and major European countries in the future.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. venue for the videoconference will be the conference
hall of the Senate Hart Building on Capitol Hill, while the Taipei
venue will be the Ambassador Hotel.
</P>
<P>
In his 30-minute speech, Wang said, Lee will stress what he
describes as the "absurdity" of the current Constitution and the
importance of formulating a new constitution that fits Taiwan's
status quo.
</P>
<P>
Following Taiwan's democratization and its decades of economic
and social development, Wang said, the country needs a new
constitution to facilitate efficient governance and allow it to
become a "normal" country.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese delegates to the videoconference will include Koo
Kwang-min, a senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, Evergreen
University Professor Lee Hsien-jung and Chen Lung-chih, chairman of
the Taiwan New Century Cultural and Educational Foundation.
Examination Yuan President Yao Jia-wen will travel to Washington,
D.C. to attend the seminar.
</P>
<P>
American participants will include former American Institute in
Taiwan Chairman Nat Belocchi and several noted scholars, including
John Tkacik, Arthur Waldron, Larry Niksch and James E. Auer.

WASHINGTON DOES NOT TAKE TAIWANESE AD SERIOUSLY: U.S. OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Washington is not taking seriously an
advertisement by Taiwan Senior Presidential Advisor Koo Kwang-ming
urging the United States to reassess its "one China" policy, U.S.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for China Randall Schiver said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Schiver said the advertisement, which he said contains a number
of factual errors, looks more than a statement of Koo's personal
political stance than the policy of the Taiwan government.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he expects clarification from Taiwan's
Presidential Office, since Koo published the advertisement using his
official title.
</P>
<P>
Both President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell
have said the United States has no plans to change its "one-China"
policy, Schiver pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Schiver was referring to a 2,000-word full-page advertisement
that ran in the Washington Post Monday, in which Koo says the
"one-China" policy has benefited the communist dictators in mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
Koo also says the "one China" policy is already outdated and
claims that many practises of Washington today make people wonder if
the United States has deviated from its founding philosophy.

RESEARCH UNIT UNVEILS AMOLED TECHNOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI) unveiled its AMOLED technology Wednesday, saying that the
development places it in the world's second spot behind only South
Korea's Samsung.
</P>
<P>
The ITRI will display the country's first 3.8-inch
double-emitting mold based on its AMOLED (active-matrix organic light
emission display) at an international exhibition of key electronics
components that will kick off Friday in Taipei, a researcher at the
ITRI's Opto-Electronics and System Laboratories said.
</P>
<P>
According to the researcher, Taiwan is only the world's second
developer capable of producing cellphones of two caps with just one
double-emitting device display, largely slashing the coating, breadth
and weight of cellphones with conventional flat panel displays.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the success to the application to LTPS TFT -- low
temperature poly silicon thin film transistors -- by the ITRI team.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liang-chi, director-general at the ITRI laboratories, said
that Taiwan companies have been exploring advanced TFT LCD expertise
amid fervent interest in the booming sector around the world.
</P>
<P>
OLEDs -- organic light emitting device displays -- are widely
viewed as the technology for the next generation of flat panel
displays due to their bright, vibrant colors, full viewing angles and
low power consumption for a wide range of products from cellphones to
laptops and video monitors.

FOREIGN INVESTORS COULD  HAVE 100 PERCENT STAKE IN TAIWAN BANKS
</HEADLINE>

(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will not rule out the
possibility of allowing foreign investors to own a 100 percent stake
in a privatized government-run bank as Taiwan works to become a
financial hub in the Asia-Pacific region, Financial Supervisory
Commission Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kong made the remark after a financial and economic meeting of
the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Kong said the government is actively promoting mergers between
banks and the privatization of government-owned banks and is
encouraging local financial firms to expand to become international
or regional corporations.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that foreign capital is essential to helping Taiwan
achieve the goal of becoming an Asia-Pacific financial hub, Kong said
the government is considering allowing foreign investors or those in
the local private sector to have a 100 percent share in privatized
government-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
Kong said what Taiwan needs are large-scale banks with an
international competitive edge and that he expects one of the
existing banks in Taiwan will emerge to become a giant enjoying a
20-percent market share in three years.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the five biggest banks in Taiwan enjoy a total market
share of 26 percent, which is far behind most developed countries
where the combined market share of the three biggest banks reaches 70
percent to 80 percent, Kong noted.

CABINET TEAM TO MEET WITH 'TRUTH COMMISSION' HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A team of senior government officials will
meet with the convener of a special commission investigating the
March 19 assassination attempt against President Chen Shui-bian
Thursday to discuss how to amend the controversial statute under
which the commission was created.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Wednesday Premier Yu Shyi-kun
ordered the meeting with Shih Chi-yang, convener of the "truth
investigation commission, " after listening to a Ministry of Justice
(MOJ) report on the difficulties that would be faced in implementing
the statute, commonly known as the "319 statute," at a weekly Cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Chen Chi-mai, members of the Cabinet team to meet
with Shih will also include Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan,
Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan, Minister-without-Portfolio
Hsu Chih-hsiung and Hsu Chang-yao, director-general of the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai said the Cabinet team will discuss with Shih the
60-plus provisions in the statute that are deemed hard to implement
as well as budget appropriations to finance the operations of the
"truth commission."
</P>
<P>
Noting that even Shih, a former Judicial Yuan president himself,
had at the commission's inaugural meeting earlier this week said that
the statute should be revised to comply with the Constitution, Chen
Chi-mai said the Cabinet team hopes to forge a consensus on amending
the statute.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the two sides will have good interactions to pave the
way for amending the statute to facilitate operations of the "truth
commission,'" Chen Chi-mai said.
</P>
<P>
The "319 statute" was authored and railroaded through the
legislative floor by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) to create the
all-powerful "truth commission." The statute was promulgated only
after the "pan-blue alliance"-dominated Legislative Yuan overrode the
Cabinet's veto in a narrow showdown vote last month.
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
has asked the Council of Grand Justices to impose a temporary
injunction on the statute before the council decides whether the
statute is unconstitutional. The council will hold a hearing on Oct.
14 to decide whether to impose a temporary injunction and will hold
two additional hearings on Oct. 27 and Oct. 29 before issuing its
"constitutionality" interpretation.
</P>
<P>
President Chen took advantage of a meeting with Harvard
University law professor Jerome A. Cohen Tuesday to express his views
on the "319 statute," lambasting it as "lawless and outrageous."
</P>
<P>
Chen narrowly won re-election a day after the shooting which
happened on the campaign trail. He was only lightly injured.
</P>
<P>
His challenger, KMT Chairman Lien Chan, insinuated that Chen
staged the shooting to win sympathy votes. Although he has offered no
evidence to support his allegations, he has filed two lawsuits to
challenge Chen's re-election victory and even the validity of the
entire election.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is not afraid of investigations into the shooting
since he did not stage it. "I was a victim of an election-eve
incident, " he asserted, adding that he hopes the commission can
suspend its operations until the Council of Grand Justices determines
whether it is constitutional or not.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that
he believes that there will be no conflict across the Taiwan Strait
during his final term as president, since Taiwan will not do anything
provocative during that time.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Terry Meguid, head of Investment Banking at
Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) , Chen stressed that if
Taiwan does nothing to provoke Beijing, he can almost assure that
there will be no war between the two sides before 2008, when he will
step down as president.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that his administration has used economic and
non-economic enticements to lure more foreign investments to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As for non-economic incentives, Chen said he puts a great deal of
importance on cross-strait ties and wishes to maintain the status quo
between the two sides, since peaceful cross-strait relations are key
to attracting foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The president added that he will give an important speech on
cross-strait issues on the Oct. 10 National Day.
</P>
<P>
In addition to welcoming Meguid to Taiwan at a time when the
island is promoting financial reforms, Chen said he admired the MSCI
for its increase of market weighting of the MSCI Taiwan Index.

The United States will not improve
relations with China at the expense of Taiwan, U.S. Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for China Randall Schiver said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at Arizona State University, Schiver said
that the U.S. has maintained good relations with Taiwan even though
Washington-Beijing ties are now in the best shape they have been in

The U.S. and Taiwan are also cooperating closely in

Schiver praised Taiwan for its active participation in

In addition to participating in the reconstruction of Iraq,
Schiver explained, Taiwan has played an important role in blocking
the smuggling of firearms and drugs from North Korea and is the
world's third-largest donor for the reconstruction of Afghanistan,
behind only the U.S. and Great Britain.

BEIJING INTENSIFIES DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE AGAINST TAIWAN: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Wednesday that mainland China has intensified its diplomatic
offensive against Taiwan, including sending senior officials to visit
Taiwan's diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while delivering a report on the nation's
diplomatic situation at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the intensity and scope of Beijing's diplomatic
offensive against Taiwan have continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the minister said, mainland China has often taken
advantage of Taiwan diplomatic allies' presidential elections to try
to drive a wedge between Taiwan and their new governments.
</P>
<P>
In addition to sending high-ranking officials to visit countries
that diplomatically recognize Taiwan, Chen said, mainland China's
mission at the United Nations has also often approached Taiwan's
allies to forge friendships and lobbied them to exchange trade
offices.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Chen also expressed regret over a few countries'
issuing unbalanced or unjustified statements against Taiwan on
international occasions to appease Beijing leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chen didn't identified those countries. But it was believed that
he was referring to Singapore and Australia. Foreign affairs
ministers of the two countries recently publicly alleged that
Taiwan was pursuing independence, which they said could disrupt
regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said Taiwan's relations with the United States
could suffer if the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan fails to
approve the NT$610.8 billion special budget bill for procurement of
advanced U.S. weapons.
</P>
<P>
"If the arms deal fails to clear the legislative floor, it will
affect the foundation of mutual trust between Taiwan and the United
States," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The special budget is expected to be reviewed by lawmakers during
the current legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Chen's warning came after U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defense
Richard Lawless said at an annual U.S.-Taiwan defense industry
conference in Arizona a day earlier that Taiwan could face grave
repercussions if the deal for eight diesel submarines, 12
anti-submarine aircraft and six PAC III Patriot anti-missile
batteries was delayed.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan would be viewed as 'a liability rather than a partner, '"
Lawless was quoted as having said at the conference.

A shipment of about 14 tons of Taiwan's

<P>
The shipment becomes the first of its kind since Aug. 30 when the

Japan imposed the ban Jan. 16, shortly after officials of the

EMERGING MAINLAND CHINA THREATENS WORLD IF DEMOCRACY DOESN'T BLOSSOM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China is rapidly emerging as a
strong economy, but being an undemocratic and large country means
that it poses a great threat to the world, a prominent mainland
dissident based in the United States said Wednesday in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Giving a keynote at the Central News Agency on mainland China's
crises and the prospects of cross-Taiwan Strait ties, Wang Dan said
that a continued influx of foreign capital has made mainland China
superficially prosper.
</P>
<P>
However, mainland China may face serious crises arising from the
so-called "relative deprivation" in the years ahead, a sentiment
which Wang ascribed to the result of a fervent chase for wealth and
prosperity among its people in the process of a social revolution.
</P>
<P>
Mainland people are increasingly feeling a "relative deprivation"
due to both short-term and long-term divulgence in a wide range of
fronts about economics, education, politics and urban-rural gaps,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Citing a forecast by some observers, he said that a crisis would
occur in 2012 within mainland society.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his strong belief that the Beijing regime is doomed to
collapse sooner or later, because "all the authoritarian governments
have the same destination -- dismantled overnight."
</P>
<P>
Should mainland China fail to turn into a democracy, a surging
military power, irrational like it is, will become a big threat to
the whole world, he contended, suggesting that a democratized Chinese
mainland provides the best guarantee for Taiwan's permanent security.
</P>
<P>
Although many analysts opined that Beijing will not attack Taiwan
for the time being, he claimed that such a possibility cannot fully
be ruled out as the actions of a dictatorship like that in Beijing
are hard to be assessed in advance, evidence being the June 4, 1989
massacre of the student-led pro-democracy movement in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds or even thousands of students were killed by troops sent
into Beijing in the Tiananmen Massacre, but the Beijing leaders
denied such an incident.
</P>
<P>
A separation of more than five decades between Taiwan and
mainland China due to historical factors is the root cause for the
many existing differences between the two sides, he said, pointing
out the course of cross-strait relations will in principle depend on
the internal changes of both sides.
</P>
<P>
According to the former student leader in the Tiananmen
pro-democracy movement, Chinese Communists are very likely to resolve
the Tibet issue under the current leadership formed by President Hu
Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.
</P>
<P>
Settling Tibet's pro-independence movement will be in Beijing's
interest to later deal with the Taiwan issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Taiwan leaders and its people to pay greater
attention to changes on the mainland and encouraged President Chen
Shui-bian to forge a better and positive relationship with Beijing to
pave the way for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wang, currently exiled in the United States after being released
from a Beijing prison in 1993, is now studying at Harvard University.
He is on an academic research tour in Taiwan.

Today is Thursday, Oct. 7, or the 24th day
of the eighth month of the Year of the Monkey according to the
lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events that have
occurred on this date in the past:

1900: Heinrich Himmler, head of the Gestapo, and from 1929, Adolf
Hitler's second-in-command, is born.

early 1900's, creates the world's first assembly line to build the
model T cars.

1919: KLM, the national airline of the Netherlands and the world's
first airline, is established, and flights are scheduled to begin in
1920.

1949: East Germany, or the German Democratic Republic, is
proclaimed, with Wilhelm Pieck as president and Otto Grotewohl as
prime minister.

1950: Communist Chinese troops enter Tibet.

1958: Communist Chinese begin to launch a mass movement in
Tientsin to make iron and steel, in which about 100 million people
would eventually participate. The movement, which proved to be a
waste of both human and material resources, resulted in the loss of
100 billion yuan in industrial production.

1959: Mario Lanza, U.S. tenor and film actor, dies at the age of
38. His films included "The Great Caruso."

1986: President Chiang Ching-kuo tells Katherine Graham, head of
the board of the Washington Post and Newsweek, in an interview that
the Republic of China government will soon propose lifting martial
law to actively promote democracy, but adds that new political
parties should abide by the ROC Constitution and anti-Communist
policy. He also emphasizes the ROC will never negotiate with the
Communist Chinese.

1990: The National Unification Council is established under the
Office of the President to help plan the policy framework for
national unification and to integrate various opinions on the issue
at all levels of the society.

1998: Thousands of Russians take to the streets to protest against
unpaid wages and to call on President Boris Yeltsin to resign.

2000: Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan confirms that the Ministry of
Justice's Investigation Bureau will formally phase out its
controversial "political surveillance" work soon.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "It is only the man with the most
perfect divine moral nature who is able to combine in himself
quickness of magnanimity, generosity, benignity, and gentleness:
qualities necessary for the exercise of patience."

NO MAJOR CHANGES IN BEIJING'S TAIWAN POLICY FORESEEN: MAC HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing's Taiwan policy is seen as not
altering dramatically in the near future despite the fact that the
make-up of the mainland Chinese leadership has changed recently,
Taiwan's top mainland policy planner said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the remarks that mainland Chinese President Hu
Jintao has made publicly since his succession to the chairmanship of
the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party Sept.
20, the overall tone of China's policies toward Taiwan has remained
unchanged, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent Fourth Plenum of the 16th Communist Party of
China Central Committee, the basis of Beijing's stance toward Taiwan
remains "peaceful unification, " "one country, two systems, " and
"the eight-point peace overture of Jiang Zemin," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu made these remarks at a Legislative Yuan Interior Affairs
Committee meeting, recapping the latest political situation across
the Taiwan Strait and analyzing the new era of mainland China under
the leadership of Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
Although mainland China's fourth-generation leadership under Hu
is now firmly established, this does not necessarily mean the
internal power struggles and competition have ceased, Wu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is foreseeable that the new mainland Chinese leadership under
Hu will make internal reorganization and internal affairs the top
administrative priority for a certain period of time, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing measures to cool down mainland China's overheated
economy -- measures that have drawn mixed reactions -- will be one of
the new leadership's top priorities, Wu continued.
</P>
<P>
Despite Taiwan's continual peace overtures, including calls for
concerted efforts to open the cross-strait "three direct links" and
extended charter flight services during the Chinese New Year season,
the new mainland leadership has refused to renounce the option of the
use of force against Taiwan, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates that the new leadership under Hu is not ready
to make any new readjustments in the short term to address the
cross-strait political deadlock, Wu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some 600 foreign dignitaries, including
Swazi Prime Minister Absalom T. Dlamini, will travel to Taipei to
attend the Republic of China's Double Ten National Day celebrations,
a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a regular news conference, Lai Chien-chung,
director of the MOFA's Protocol Department, said the ministry has
continued to invite foreign celebrities and politicians to visit
Taiwan to boost friendship, mutual understanding and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We have a well-organized plan for inviting foreign dignitaries
to visit Taiwan, " Lai said, adding that the work has been proceeding
smoothly in accordance with the plan.
</P>
<P>
According to Lai, 64 percent of the MOFA's annual budget for
hosting foreign dignitaries' Taiwan visits had been used as of the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
A total of 573 foreign guests will attend this year's National
Day celebrations, compared to last year's number of 529, Lai said.
The head of state of one of the ROC's diplomatic allies was
originally scheduled to attend the National Day celebrations, but he
informed the MOFA a few days ago that the travel plan had to be
delayed for certain reasons, Lai said.
</P>

Lai further said the prime minister of a member state of the
British Commonwealth will visit Taiwan shortly after the Double Ten
National Day.

PFP CHAMPIONING CROSS-STRAIT PEACE BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong is actively championing cross-strait peace safeguarding
legislation aimed at securing peace across the Taiwan Strait for the
next 30 to 50 years, PFP sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The cross-strait peace safeguarding law envisaged by Soong and
PFP lawmakers will be conducive to facilitating cross-strait peace
talks and helping secure a breakthrough in the current cross-strait
political stalemate, PFP legislators said.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the law has already been penned, and it is expected to
be submitted to the Legislative Yuan before Oct. 10 for discussion,
PFP Legislator Lee Yung-ping noted.
</P>
<P>
Other highlights of the cross-strait peace acceleration draft
bill include an insistence that the Republic of China is a sovereign
state and that its sovereignty be safeguarded at any cost; principles
for peaceful interactions across the Taiwan Strait; and a requirement
that a peace executive committee be formed and manned by legislators
from across Taiwan's political spectrum, PFP legislators said.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that through the cross-strait peace safeguarding law,
the leaderships of the two sides will commit themselves to pursuing
peace based on the principle that as long as Taiwan doesn't declare
independence, Beijing will not resort to force against Taiwan, Liu
Wen-hsiung, a PFP party whip at the Legislative Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Liu added that the peace acceleration law should not only be
passed by the Legislative Yuan, but also endorsed by the Taiwan
people in a nationwide referendum.
</P>
<P>
The peace acceleration bill is seen as being the primary "selling
point" in the PFP's campaign for the year-end legislative elections.

665 ORGANIZED CRIMINAL RINGS SUBJECT TO SPECIAL POLICE MONITORING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 665 organized criminal rings,
with 6,461 members, have been placed under intense police monitoring,
according to a National Police Administration (NPA) report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As underworld gang activities have traditionally been shrouded in
secrecy and having underworld gangs closely monitored requires
certain prerequisites and procedures, the report said, the actual
number of organized gang members should be higher than the officially
listed figure.
</P>
<P>
Of the listed underworld gang members, the report said, 1,171
belong to the Bamboo Gang, accounting for 18 percent of the total and
making the Bamboo Gang Taiwan's largest organized criminal ring.
</P>
<P>
The Four Seas Gang come in second, with 726 members; followed by
the Heavenly Gang, with 632 members. These three gangs account for 40
percent of all the gangsters subject to close police monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Two other gangs -- the Sunglien Gang and the Peilien Gang -- also
have members exceeding 100 each, while all the remaining gangs have
memberships smaller than 100.
</P>
<P>
In terms of area, Taipei City boasts the largest number with
2,119, followed by Taipei County with 736, Taoyuan County with 639,
Keelung City with 418, Taichung City with 338, Changhua County with
288, Hsinchu City with 210, Kaohsiung City with 208, and Kaohsiung
County with 204.
</P>
<P>
The number of listed gangsters falls below 200 in all other
cities or counties. The figures indicates that gangsters tend to
converge in northern Taiwan and urban areas, the report said.

VICE PRESIDENT VISITS FORMER FIRST LADY FAINA CHIANG IN HOSPITAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu paid a short visit
Thursday to former ROC First Lady Faina Chiang who checked into
Taipei Veterans General Hospital the day before suffering from
inflammation of the windpipe and acute asthma.
</P>
<P>
After Lu greeted Chiang in her hospital room, the vice president
said that Chiang is greatly respected, and although a native of
Russia, she spent most of her prime in Taiwan with her husband, the
late President Chiang Ching-kuo, and their children.
</P>
<P>
Although Faina Chiang, who is 88, has led a secluded life over
the past decade, she deserves the concern of all the people of
Taiwan, particularly during now that she is ill, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Veterans General said that Faina Chiang developed
breathing problems Wednesday stemming from chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, but she is now in stable condition after receiving
medication.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Feng Chang-feng said that there is no timetable at present
for Faina Chiang to be released from hospital since she is still
undergoing testing.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiang Fang Chih-yi, Faina Chiang's daughter-in-law,
her mother-in-law has had a poor appetite recently and became
lethargic Wednesday, prompting the family to rush her to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Chiang suffered a stroke in October 1994 and still suffers from
atherosclerosis -- or hardening of the arteries, emphysema and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
</P>
<P>
Chiang was dealt a series of blows in her later life. Her health
began to decline after President Chiang died in 1988 following a
heart attack. Her eldest son, Chiang Hsiao-wen, died the next year,
and her second son, Chiang Hsiao-wu, at the time just retired from
the post as the ROC representative to Japan, died in 1991.

help relieve food shortages there, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) official said Thursday.
</P>

He added that after discussions with Mongolian authorities, it
was decided that the rice will be distributed to the Mongolian people
based on a "work relief" program, namely giving the rice to the
people who suffer from food shortages but engage in certain community
services.

CIVIC GROUP LASHES OUT AT PENTAGON OFFICIAL'S REMARKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ranking Pentagon official is trying to
blackmail Taiwan into buying expensive arms by saying that if Taiwan
does not go through with the purchase, others might begin "to regard
Taiwan as a liability rather than a partner," a civic group said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Democracy Action Alliance, which is comprised mainly of
scholars, was referring to the remarks of U.S. Deputy Undersecretary
of Defense Richard Lawless at an annual Taiwan-U.S. defense
industry conference in Phoenix, Arizona earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Lawless advised Taiwan to display a keen desire to beef up its
defense capabilities by approving the controversial military
procurement.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ya-chung, convener of the alliance, claimed that with the
upcoming U.S. presidential election on Nov. 2, collaboration between
politicians and arms dealers is closer than ever. However, he pointed
out that the interests of the U.S. arms dealers do not represent the
general sentiments of the American people.
</P>
<P>
Not all Americans agree that Taiwan should purchase U.S. weapons
to show its goodwill toward the U.S., Chang said, adding that many
Americans have also been reflecting on whether mixing arms purchases
and politics will create problems for international security.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that arms procurements do not guarantee Taiwan's
security. According to Lawless' logic, Chang claimed, Taiwan will
need to acquire high-altitude missile defense systems, and more
advanced destroyers and fighter planes after the special NT$610.8
billion (US$18.23 billion) package of six PAC-III anti-missile
batteries, eight diesel-powered submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft is purchased.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Chang said, if Taiwan over-purchases, it will
find itself financially in the red, which will sap its economic
strength. At that point, it would be pointless to acquire more
weapons, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people of Taiwan shouldn't believe the rhetoric
of U.S. arms dealers and politicians that "arms will buy security, "
adding that the way the ROC government has fawned over the U.S. for
affirming the need to purchase the arms is disappointing and
denigrating to the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that cross-strait problems are political, not
military issues and the government should use the money to pay its
debts first. The government should also communicate with the public
about which weapons are needed, he said, adding that the alliance
wants to debate with the arms procurement with the Ministry of
National Defense.
</P>
<P>
The alliance initiated a rally last month to protest the arms
purchase, saying it is against financing the package through selling
national lands and stakes in state-controlled enterprises.

CABINET REGRETS UNFRIENDLY TREATMENT BY 'TRUTH COMMISSION'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executive Yuan officials expressed their
regret Thursday over the unfriendly treatment they received during a
meeting with members of the "truth investigation commission."
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said the Executive Yuan will
continue to coordinate with the commission to schedule another
meeting for both sides to discuss the possibility of amending a
special statute governing the commission's formation.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-backed commission is aimed at probing the
presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan considers the statute unconstitutional and has
had the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) request a
constitutional interpretation from the Council of Grand Justices.
</P>
<P>
It sent five officials, including the spokesman, Minister of
Justice Chen Ding-nan, Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan,
Minister-without-portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung, and Hsu Chang-yao, head
of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to
visit the commission on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the atmosphere of the meeting was unpleasant right from
the beginning, with both sides trading accusations.
</P>
<P>
Commission convener Shih Chi-yang was especially unhappy with
President Chen's recent comment that the commission is a "lawless"
organization, and he questioned the purpose of the meeting since this
is considered a "lawless" agency.
</P>
<P>
Shih called off the meeting halfway and showed the visitors the
door after it became clear that no common ground would be found
between the two sides, according to spokesman Chen.
</P>
<P>
He said the way the commission members treated their guests was
regrettable but the Executive Yuan will not give up on its effort to
communicate.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Chen said he hopes the commission will suspend
its operations until the Council of Grand Justices releases its
interpretation on the case, citing problems in implementing the
statute.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, however, said, "Even a
bad law is a law and the Executive Yuan has no power to resist its
implementation."
</P>
<P>
Wang said the commission should operate according to the statute
unless it is determined unconstitutional by the Council of Grand
Justices.

INTERMENT OF TWO LATE PRESIDENTS SCHEDULED FOR JULY OR AUG. IN 2005
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The late presidents Chiang Kai-shek and his
son and successor Chiang Ching-kuo will be permanently interred in
July or August 2005, an official of the Ministry of National Defense
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lu Lin-tsu, director of the defense ministry's Bureau of Armament
and Acquisition, said that the bidding for the construction of the
tombs for the two late presidents will open later this month or early
next month. The work is scheduled to be completed next June.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will fully respect the views of the Chiang family
concerning the design and construction of the tomb, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the construction is complete, the Ministry of the Interior
will also discuss with the Chiang family about interment
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"The Chiang family understands the situation and they have not
pressured the defense ministry to speed up the process," Lu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks after a local newspaper reported Thursday
that the wishes of the Chiang family to have the two men buried in a
military cemetery in Hsichih, Taipei County next spring may fall
through.
</P>
<P>
The report in the China Times said that the ministry has
appropriated NT$27 million (US$801,180) for the burial and
construction after receiving a request from the Chiang family earlier
this year. But the bidding for the first stage of the project,
including a geological survey and the repair of connecting roads
failed to attract suitable contractors and the work was delayed
numerous times.
</P>
<P>
Late president Yen Chia-kan and many generals are also buried in
the Wutzushan military cemetery known for its serene and beautiful
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese
mainland to the Mao Zedong-led communist party in a bloody civil war.
Chiang died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
His remains lie embalmed in a temporary mausoleum at Tzuhu in the
northern county of Taoyuan, awaiting a proper burial on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chiang ruled Taiwan with an iron fist, using martial law to
suppress democracy. However, some view him as a hero for keeping the
island out of reach of the Chinese Communists and claim that it was
he who fostered a freewheeling market economy.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Ching-kuo is respected for ending martial law in 1987,
shortly before his death, thus unleashing the democratic forces that
broke his family's dynastic grip on power and eventually ended the
Kuomintang's half-century rule of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chiang died in 1988 and his remains also lie embalmed in an
interim mausoleum at Touliao in Taoyuan County, awaiting a final
burial.

MAC CHIEF SAYS INCIDENT WITH CHINA POSSIBLE, BUT NOT WAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The possibility of an incident in the
future with mainland China cannot be ruled out, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Thursday, but he stressed that
this would not equate to the outbreak of war.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Wu said, Taiwan looks forward to
negotiating with mainland China on military confidence-building
measures to avert any possible sporadic conflicts and ensure
permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top mainland policy planner made the remarks at a
meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Home Affairs Committee in response
to questions from Legislator Chung Jung-chi of the opposition People
First Party about the probability of a cross-strait war.
</P>
<P>
Noting that although the possibility of an occasional incident
similar to the situation after the U.S.-mainland Chinese military
aircraft collision in 2001 indeed exists, Wu said this differs from a
war.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Wu said his statement didn't contradict President Chen
Shui-bian's declaration a day earlier that there would be no war
across the Taiwan Strait before his term expires in May 2008.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed the importance of maintaining cross-strait peace,
saying he believes that the international community would not keep
silent if Beijing attacked Taiwan without being
provoked.
</P>
<P>
With a view to avoiding any possible sporadic cross-strait
conflicts, Wu said mainland China should negotiate with Taiwan for
the establishment of a military confidence-building mechanism as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wu also reaffirmed the government's sincerity
to send a delegate acceptable to both sides to Beijing to negotiate
special cross-strait charter flight services during the upcoming
Chinese New Year holiday to facilitate the return of Taiwanese
business people operating on the mainland for family reunions.
</P>
<P>
"It's now up to Beijing to decide whether and when negotiations
for such charter flight services can get underway," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the principle of division of power, Wu said, the
administration cannot commission any lawmaker or lawmakers to
represent it in negotiation with Beijing over the holiday charter
flight services.
</P>
<P>
Asked why the MAC has not followed its previous practice of
organizing a legislative delegation to attend the Republic of China's
Double Ten National Day celebrations to be hosted by the ROC
representative office in Hong Kong this year, Wu said this is mainly
because the Hong Kong government declined to issue visas for some
Taiwan lawmakers last year.
</P>
<P>
As to when Pao Cheng-kang, the new ROC representative to Hong
Kong, can obtain a working visa to travel to Hong Kong to assume his
post, Wu said that day will come soon.

OFFICIAL DELEGATION TO ENTICE INVESTMENT ABROAD FOR PUBLIC BANKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A delegation to be formed of chiefs of
government finance and economics agencies is planning to go abroad by
the end of this year to woo foreign investment for public banks, an
official of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEPD official, the delegation is expected to
embark on a mission to the United States and Europe by year-end at
the earliest. Destinations may include New York, London, Zurich and
Paris, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after an Executive Yuan meeting held a day
earlier, in which Premier Yu Shyi-kun, CEPD Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng,
Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan, Minister of Finance Lin
Chuan, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh and Financial
Supervisory Commission Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng took part.
</P>
<P>
Citing Yu's remarks in the meeting, CEPD Vice Chairman Yeh
Ming-feng said that the government is encouraging Taiwan-based banks
to develop themselves into groups with regional and global influence
through mergers, consolidation or business alliances with their
foreign counterparts to sharpen their competitive edge and grab a
larger slice of the world market.
</P>
<P>
According to Yeh, Yu said that the government expects to see the
emergence of one to three regional banking groups headquartered in
Taiwan by 2008, and he instructed the delegation to prepare for the
mission as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
To increase the possibility of cooperative ventures between local
banks and large-scale foreign-based banking institutions, the
government will first set its sights on state-run banks, Yeh said,
adding that the Central Trust of China, the Bank of Taiwan and the
Land Bank of Taiwan are the main targets in the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, the government will allow foreign banks to hold a
100 percent ownership in local banks to serve that end, Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the new development, foreign bankers in Taipei
hailed the idea but were very reserved about the feasibility,
pointing to the large payrolls of Taiwan's public banks.
</P>
<P>
A foreign bank executive acknowledged their low interest in
acquiring or merging with Taiwan's public banks but voiced a greater
interest in local private banks.
</P>
<P>
Merging with Taiwan's state-run banks will not be profitable due
to their large assets and workforce, he pointed out.

New York Times: U.S. report finds Iraqis
eliminated illicit arms in 90's.

Iraq had destroyed its illicit weapons stockpiles within months
after the Persian Gulf war of 1991, and its ability to produce such
weapons had significantly eroded by the time of the American invasion
in 2003, the top American inspector for Iraq said in a report made
public Wednesday. The report by the inspector, Charles A. Duelfer,
intended to offer a near-final judgment about Iraq and its weapons,
said Iraq, while under pressure from the United Nations, had
"essentially destroyed'' its illicit weapons ability by the end of
1991, with its last secret factory, a biological weapons plant,
eliminated in 1996.

Wall Street Journal: Report disputes U.S. assertions on Iraqi
weapons.

The chief U.S. arms inspector in Iraq says in a new report that
Baghdad abandoned its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
programs a decade ago and they remained largely dormant even as the
Bush administration was asserting that the U.S. had intelligence
indicating the programs were active. The 1,400-page report, described
by U.S. officials as the government's most definitive assessment of
Iraq's weapons activities, undercuts one of the administration's main
rationales for the war.

<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui will underline
the necessity of Taiwan's drafting of a new constitution in a
teleconference scheduled with a group of American scholars Friday,
organizers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar on Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering and the
triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations is being jointly
organized by the Taipei-based Action for Constitution Taiwan, led by
Lee, and the Washington-based Center for Taiwan International
Relations.
</P>
<P>
Lee is expected to deliver a speech at the seminar at 8:30 p.m.
(Taipei time).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. venue for the teleconference will be the Senate, while
the Taipei venue will be the Ambassador Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said the seminar is aimed at highlighting the
absurdity of the existing Constitution and the urgent need for a new
one.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan is now a model of rising countries in Asia, it
cannot become a "normal" country because of mainland China's
obstruction and the shackles of the Constitution, they said.
</P>
<P>
They said the Constitution has become an obstacle for Taiwan to
participate in the international community, and that drafting a new
constitution will be the only option to help the country out of the
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that the movement promoting a new constitution is
not intended to provoke any other country and said that changing the
constitution is a right enjoyed by normal countries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese delegates to the seminar will include Senior
Presidential Adviser Koo Kwang-ming, Evergreen University Professor
Lee Hsien-jung and Chen Lung-chu, chairman of the Taiwan New Century
Cultural and Educational Foundation.

Wu Ming-yung, organizer of the demonstration, said Yeo's speech
at the 59th session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York last
month hurt the feelings of the people of Taiwan and claimed that it
will impair Taiwan-Singapore relations.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Singapore travel office met with Wu shortly
after the demonstration began and said as the office is only a
quasi-official body, it cannot issue any statement on behalf of the
Singapore government. However, the official promised to convey their
protest to Singapore's representative office in San Francisco. The
demonstration ended peacefully one hour later.
</P>
<P>
Yeo's said at the U.N. General Assembly that the international
community has a strong vested interest in supporting a peaceful
resolution of cross-Taiwan Strait conflict, based on the "one China"
policy adopted by the United Nations in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Yeo also blamed cross-strait tension on Taiwan, claiming that
cross-strait relations "went from bad to worse" as pro-independence
forces in Taiwan became "increasingly adventurous" during the office
of former President Lee Teng-hui, who has described himself as "Moses
leading his people out of Egypt."
</P>
<P>
Yeo further said the international community should not allow
"the deteriorating relationship" across the Taiwan Strait to get out
of control and warned that the pro-independence movement in Taiwan is
likely to trigger a war with the mainland and upset stability in the
Asia-Pacific region.

TAIWAN'S FOREIGN TRADE CONTINUES TO GROW IN SEPTEMBER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's foreign trade continued its strong
momentum in September, with both exports and imports registering
double-digit growth for the 11th consecutive month since last
October, the Ministry of Finance reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's statistics show that outbound shipments amounted
to US$14.96 billion in September, while imports stood at US$14.21
billion, up 19.2 percent and 29.4 percent, respectively, from the
previous year's levels.
</P>
<P>
The figures represent the second- and third-highest single-month
export and import values, with the monthly trade surplus totaling
US$750 million, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the ministry's Department of
Statistics, attributed the growth to robust demand from Hong Kong,
mainland China, Japan, Southeast Asia and South Korea, which rose
more than 17 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, inbound shipments from Hong Kong, the mainland,
Japan, South Korea and the United States also increased by over 26
percent, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that trade will continue to expand in the fourth
quarter as a result of seasonal demand.

MADAME CHIANG'S PERSONAL EFFECTS TO GO ON DISPLAY SATURDAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large collection of personal effects that
once belonged to Madame Chiang Kai-shek will go on display at the Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei Saturday to mark the anniversary of
the most famous ROC first lady's death, organizers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shao Ming-huang, director of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's)
party history department, which organized the rare show, said many of
the exhibits were loaned by Madame Chiang's relatives in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"The Oct. 9-Nov. 5 exhibition will be the largest of its kind
ever held in Taiwan," Shao said.
</P>
<P>
Among the exhibits will be 28 Chinese brush paintings created by
Madame Chiang, who died at her New York home Oct. 24, 2003 at the age
of 106, Shao said, adding that many of the paintings carry the late
President Chiang Kai-shek's handwriting. Major painting utensils used
by Madame Chiang will be also on display.
</P>
<P>
Other exhibits will include a number of her personal effects,
including costumes, handbags, shoes, hats, jewels and other
accessories.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, photos featuring Madame Chiang wearing those
fashionable articles will be shown to allow the audience to remember
her grace and fashion taste," Shao said.
</P>
<P>
On display will also be Madame Chiang's manuscripts and personal
letters, as well as historical documents and photos featuring her and
her husband.
</P>
<P>
Madame Chiang, whose life traversed three centuries, helped the
late president rule mainland China and later Taiwan during years of
war, upheaval and Cold War tension.
</P>
<P>
The Chiangs were once one of the most famous couples in the world
-- a dashing general married to a beautiful, urbane woman. Time
magazine publisher Henry Luce named them "Man and Woman of the Year"
in 1938. Chiang Kai-shek headed the KMT and the Republic of China for
decades until he died April 5, 1975.
</P>
<P>
Madame Chiang led a reclusive life at her Manhattan home for much
of her later life after her husband's death. Born Soong Mei-ling, she
became widely known in the West as a spokeswoman for Chinese efforts
to resist the Japanese forces that began invading China in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
After the Chinese Communist Party took control of the mainland,
the Republic of China government, under her husband's leadership,
moved its seat to Taiwan in 1949. Chiang and his wife became Asia's
foremost anti-communist symbols.

ACADEMIA SINICA HEAD CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT PEACE TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
clamored Thursday for peace across the Taiwan Strait, urging Taiwan
and mainland China to hold talks to avoid military conflict that
could affect the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Lee issued the call while reporting at a legislative committee.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the government's plan to purchase NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) worth of defensive weapons from the United States,
Lee suggested that the two sides hold talks to build peace.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this aim, he said, the mainland should forswear its
military intimidation of Taiwan and Taiwan should drop the expensive
military procurement plan.
</P>
<P>
"Peace will be built upon joint efforts from the two sides, " he
said, adding that "my stance and keen desire is to seek peace."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that promoting Taiwan independence is highly risky
that could undermine the whole world's interests, the Academia Sinica
chief said it is good that the mainland is increasingly involved in
the world's economic system today -- more than 30 years after the end
of the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
A more democratic mainland China will provide greater security
for Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the breakout of "a third world war across the strait,"
the leaders on both sides should exercise extra caution in their
words and deeds to stave off misunderstanding and
miscalculation that could bring about massive destruction, he said.

<P>
More than half of the people who responded
to a recent survey said they want the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) administration put its NT$610.8 billion arms procurement
package to a referendum, the Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The KMT caucus conducted the telephone poll of 1,069 randomly
chosen adult residents Sept. 29-Oct. 1 to explore their views on the
Cabinet's plan to purchase six PAC-III Patriot anti-missile
batteries, eight diesel-electric submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft from the United States with a price tag of
NT$610.8 billion.

According to the poll results, 50 percent of the respondents said
the price is too high and 33 percent said the price should be cut by

<P>
The poll also found that 56 percent want the procurement package
put to a referendum, while 30 percent oppose such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 55 percent said they are worried that the arms
procurement package could accelerate the cross-Taiwan Strait arms
race, while 28 percent said they hope to see the package clear the
legislature for the sake of safeguarding national security.

YU SEEKS SPEEDY CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION ON TRUTH COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun called Thursday for a
speedy constitutional interpretation by the Council of Grand Justices
of an opposition-backed "truth investigation commission, " which he
said will seriously damage the country's constitutional order.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the call during an inspection visit to a free trade zone
being planned at Kaohsiung Port, on which he was accompanied by
Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai and lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
In addition to encouraging the port authorities to achieve a
target of handling 10 million containers next year based on an
estimated performance of 9.7 million for this year, the premier also
harshly criticized the establishment of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that he hopes for an early constitutional interpretation
by the Council of Grand Justices on the controversial commission to
minimize the damage it could cause to the country's constitutional
order.
</P>
<P>
The premier was referring to a special 10-member body set up by
the opposition, supposedly to "dig out the facts" behind the March 19
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian. A statute paving the way for
the formation of the commission cleared the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan in August and was promulgated by President Chen late
last month.
</P>
<P>
He also called for greater public support for the DPP in the Dec.
11 legislative elections. Giving the ruling party a majority in the
225-member legislature will provide the administration with a boost
and allow it to carry out sweeping reforms on a wide range of fronts,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-led "truth investigation commission" began its
operations Monday but the Executive Yuan called it an unlawful body
and refused to allocate a budget for its operations.
</P>
<P>
Shih Chi-yang, a former Judicial Yuan president, serves as
convener of the commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
Local TV variety show host Wu Tsung-hsien
will run in the year-end legislative elections under the banner of
the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) , according to reports
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It has not been decided yet whether the newly-formed party will
arrange for Wu to run for a regional legislative seat representing
the NPSU or instead have him listed as an NPSU candidate for a
legislator-at-large seat, NPSU Secretary-General Chen Jung-chieh
said.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Hao, who is the incumbent vice chairman of the
NPSU, said that Wu will formally announce his election bid at a press
conference next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu, a TV celebrity who has been one of the hottest targets of
local paparazzi because of his colorful private life, has reportedly
amassed a fortune over the years in his career as an entertainer and
a businessman.
</P>
<P>
Wu has said that if he were a lawmaker, one of the areas he would
like to straighten up is the local media.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin Su-mei, one of the 11 current NPSU legislators, is a
movie-star-turned-lawmaker who has focused her attention on the
welfare of Taiwan's aboriginal people.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 legislative elections are scheduled to be held Dec. 11,
according to the Central Election Commission (CEC).
</P>
<P>
All 225 seats will be up for grabs, including 168 regional
legislative seats, eight Aboriginal seats, eight overseas Chinese
seats and 41 at-large seats.
</P>
<P>
The 168 regional legislators will be elected from the special
municipalities, counties and cities around the country, including the
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, while the 41 at-large
legislators will be chosen based on the total number of ballots each
political party garners in the elections.

The parties fielding candidates are the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, its ally the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union,
the Kuomintang, and the People First Party, as well as the newly
established Non-Partisan Solidarity Union. Another newly formed

KUWAITI OIL FIRM PLANS TO INVEST IN CHINA: HONG KONG STANDARD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC) , one of
the Middle East's top oil producers, has offered to invest as much as
US$3 billion in mainland China's oil refining and distribution
system, the English-language Hong Kong Standard reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the oil firm aims to secure a
significant presence in the world's fastest-growing energy market.
</P>
<P>
Quoting mainland Chinese and Kuwaiti oil industry sources, the
report said that the offer has met with a cool response from China's
oil giants, who are not keen to see a well-heeled competitor enter
their backyard.
</P>
<P>
KPC's offer, the report said, follows an official visit to
Beijing by Kuwait's prime minister during which the two governments
signed a framework agreement pledging closer co-operation in a
variety of areas including energy. That deal paved the way for talks
between government-owned KPC and several of China's partly-privatized
oil majors, including PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC as well as their
trading subsidiaries, including Chinaoil and Unipec.
</P>
<P>
However, KPC is not interested in investing in refining without
at the same time securing a foothold in China's oil retailing market,
which is currently controlled by Sinopec and PetroChina, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The sticking point is that the mainland Chinese oil firms are
reluctant to share their huge domestic market with foreign companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 6th Taiwan-Germany Economic Cooperation
Conference opened in Taipei Friday with more than 100 officials and
business leaders from the two countries taking part.
</P>
<P>
Rezzo Schlauch, a vice minister of economic affairs in Germany,
led the German delegation to the conference, signifying the
importance that Germany attaches to the annual gathering, said
officials from the Chinese International Economic Cooperation
Association (CIECA), sponsor of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The CIECA and the Taiwan Committee of the German Economy have
been largely instrumental in arranging the holding of the
Taiwan-Germany Economic Cooperation Conference, which is aimed at
building regular communication channels between business and trade
communities from Taiwan and Germany and in turn advancing bilateral
private sector cooperation, the CIECA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Fa-ta, a vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, delivered a keynote speech at the
conference on Taiwan's current economic situation and the development
of its service industry.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh briefed the participants on the Taiwan government's current
policies in helping accelerate industrial upgrading and restructuring
in the private sector aimed at sharpening Taiwan's international
competitiveness and enabling the island to carve a niche in the
world's economic and industrial chain.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers at the conference included officials from Taiwan's
Industrial Development and Investment Center, the Tourism Bureau, and
the Industrial and Technology Research Institute, as well as
Germany's National Tourism Bureau and Siemens AG.
</P>
<P>
Areas that the speakers dealt with included public
infrastructure, investment, energy, environmental protection, tourism
and information technology, the CIECA officials said.

BEIJING URGED TO PROTECT SAFETY OF `TAISHANG'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beijing authorities should strengthen
the protection of the safety of Taiwanese businessmen operating in
mainland China, commonly known as "taishang, " a senior Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san made the call after reports that a
taishang, identified as Hsu Shih-chieh, was murdered in Kunshan near
Shanghai late last month.
</P>
<P>
Quoting official tallies, Chiu said the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) had handled 1,202 cases involving
cross-Taiwan Strait disputes as of the end of August. Of these cases,
672 were related to the safety of taishang.
</P>
<P>
A spate of high-profile murders involving taishang between June
and July last year caused panic among taishang and their families,
Chiu said, adding that the latest murder has caused grave concern
again.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the mainland Chinese authorities will pay more heed to
protect the safety and interests of taishang," Chiu said, adding that
the mainland should substantiate its promise to protect taishang by
signing an investment guarantee agreement with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan businessmen have poured billions of dollars into the
mainland for various investment projects since the late 1980s. For
years, Taiwan has pushed Beijing to sign a bilateral investment
guarantee agreement to offer better protection for taishang's
interests and rights. However, Beijing has so far been reluctant to
start relevant negotiations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of mutual benefits, Chiu said, Beijing should not
continue to drag its feet on the issue. Even before such an accord is
signed, Chiu said the mainland authorities should take immediate
steps to protect the safety, rights and interests of taishang.
</P>
<P>
Chiu further said that the MAC, the SEF, major local trade
associations and Taiwanese chambers of commerce on the mainland will
also step up efforts to offer better services and assistance to
taishang.

CABINET TO COMMUNICATE WITH 'TRUTH' COMMISSION: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that the
government will communicate with a commission set up under a special
statute to investigate the March 19 election-eve shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks after five officials sent by the Cabinet to
call on the March 19 truth investigation commission ended in a row the
previous day in which both sides traded accusations, with one side
questioning the constitutionality of the body and the other side
asking the point of the visit if they regard it as "unlawful" as
President Chen has described it.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he felt sorry for the five officials, but
stressed that the Executive Yuan is sincere and that communication
must continue before a revision of the "truth" bill and a ruling on
the constitutionality of the bill by the Council of Grand Justices
has been issued.
</P>
<P>
"As long as there is consensus, the Executive Yuan will work with
the commission," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that Shih Chi-yang, convener of the 10-member
so-called "truth" commission, advocates an amendment of the
controversial bill, which the Executive Yuan considers a vindication
of its earlier request for a legislative reconsideration of the bill.
</P>
<P>
He called for continued communication so as to avoid damage to
society and a dilemma for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The premier's words came as the commission suffered another blow
Friday when a second official failed to respond to its request to
give a briefing to the commission.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ching-feng, spokeswoman of the commission and a former
member of the Control Yuan, said the failure of Hou You-yi,
commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) , to show up
was "regrettable, although expected."
</P>
<P>
Wang said that since the inauguration of the commission, it has
continued to request various personnel to present themselves for
interviews over the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The commission asked the Tainan Prosecutor's Office to send
officials Thursday, but waited in vain. Shih Chi-yang, convener of
the 10-member commission, went to Tainan, southern Taiwan, to call on
them Friday.
</P>
<P>
She claimed that the commission was set up under the law and must
work with the administrative and prosecutorial agencies to probe the
shooting in Tainan, southern Taiwan, which the defeated opposition
claims helped Chen edge out his rival in the election the following
day.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the commission has yet to receive funds from the
government and that an independent legislator had suggested that it
should solicit donations to facilitate its operation, Wang said that
as a government body established under the law the commission cannot
accept donations.
</P>
<P>
The commission estimates that it will need NT$10 million
(US$295,850) for basic expenses and is hopeful that the
comptroller-general will allocate an appropriate budget, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The commission has so far spent around NT$250,000, all provided
by the members themselves, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kao Cheng-sheng, deputy CIB commissioner, said that as
the Executive Yuan believes the legality of the commission is
"questionable" and as the implementation of the bill is difficult,
the CIB hopes that the legislature will revise the bill soon so that
it can work with the commission.
</P>
<P>
Kao also said that CIB, at the request of the Tainan Prosecutor's
Office, has turned over forensic and investigation reports to the
office and will await instructions from the Prosecutor's Office to
work with the commission.

<P>
Sweden welcomes Taiwan investors to make the
Scandinavian country their new investment hub, from where they can
make inroads into the global market, a Swedish official said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lotta Fogde, a vice minister from Sweden's Ministry of Industry,
Employment and Communication, said that Sweden, boasting advanced
research and development in telecom infrastructure, biotechnology and
other hi-tech industries, is worthy of Taiwan investment to help
sharpen the country's competitiveness in the global market.
</P>
<P>
Fogde made the remarks at the 20th Taiwan-Sweden Economic
Cooperation Conference which opened in Taipei Friday. She is the
highest-ranking Swedish official ever to have been invited to take
part in the Taiwan-Sweden Economic Cooperation Conference in the
recent decade.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 government officials and business leaders from
Taiwan and Sweden took part in the one-day conference sponsored by
the Taipei-based Chinese International Economic Cooperation
Association (CIECA).
</P>
<P>
Participants in the conference focused their discussions on
telecom and information technologies, biotechnology and environmental
protection, CIECA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the conference, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs
Yiin Chii-ming said that Taiwan and Sweden have maintained close
economic and trade relations over the years. Bilateral trade totaled
US$755 million in the first eight months of this year, up a whopping
16.6 percent over the corresponding period of the previous year, Yiin
said.
</P>
<P>
The holding of this meeting will give a big boost to both sides
and will enable bilateral business and trade ties to grow even faster
in the future, according to Yiin.
</P>
<P>
Yiin said that while Sweden is an important trade partner for
Taiwan in Scandinavia, Taiwan could serve as a gateway for Swedish
businesses eager to expand their investments and sales throughout
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Other prominent figures from Sweden that took part in the
conference included Kurt Hellstrom, former president of the Swedish
telecom giant Ericsson.

TAIWAN MULLING PIG EXPO IN 2007
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Friday that it is planning to sponsor a pig
exposition in 2007.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top economic policy planer said that the event could
be linked to a Taiwan expo scheduled for 2008 and it has initially
estimated that the pig expo will cost about NT$360 million (US$10.68
million) , which would be the largest-scale expo of this type in
years.
</P>
<P>
The Animal Technology Institute, which proposed the
idea to the CEPD, said that before the outbreak of foot and mouth
disease in Taiwan in 1997, Taiwan had 15 million pigs. Even after the
decimation of the hogs in the wake of the disease, the number remains
at around 8 million on average per year.
</P>

Institute officials said pork is the main source of animal
protein for local people, citing statistics to show that Taiwan
people consume 40 kg of pork -- about half a pig -- per person per
year, compared with only 3.5 kg of beef.
</P>
<P>
Because of the love of pork, the technology for raising pigs is
also world-class, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary plan, the 2007 pig expo will include
such activities as a photo exhibition of pigs of the world, as well
as delicious local and world pork dishes.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a pig Olympics, gathering different species of
pigs in an arena for competitions, as well as 10,000 people producing
sausages to gain a niche in the Guineas Book of World Records, the
officials said.

SEVEN NEW PARTY POLITICIANS JOIN KMT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of seven opposition New Party
politicians were Friday sworn in as members of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) in what was seen as the first step in the
integration of the "pan-blue alliance.".
</P>
<P>
The politicians will run under the KMT banner in the year-end
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Fei Hung-tai, Lai Shyh-bao, Lee Sheng-feng, Lei Chien, Chen
Li-ling, Chen Shu-wan and Lu Li-kang took the oath at the KMT
headquarters, in the company of New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming and
the party's only legislator, Wu Cheng-tien.
</P>
<P>
Presenting letters of recommendation to the candidates, KMT
Chairman Lien Chan said he was very happy to see the like-minded
friends from the New Party return to the KMT at this crucial moment.
</P>
<P>
Lien said the New Party, which split from the KMT 12 years ago,
is now responding to a call from "pan-blue" supporters who expect
solidarity in the camp.
</P>
<P>
He praised the New Party for its unselfishness and wished the
candidates great success in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Yok claimed that this is the first step in "pan-blue" solidarity
and promised to continue to push for the integration of the KMT, the
People First Party and the New Party for the ultimate goal of a
merger of the three.
</P>
<P>
Lee Sheng-feng, another founding member of the New Party, said
that only a merger of the three parties will be strong enough to
resist what he called the "pro-independence fascist dictatorship" of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and find out "the truth"
behind the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian.

MASTERS DEGREE HOLDERS EDGE OUT BACHELOR GRADUATES IN WORKPLACE: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Masters degree holders have markedly edged
out bachelor graduates in Taiwan's workplace, a recent survey has
found.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the poll carried out by the Career
employment Website, more than 45 percent of Taiwan companies prefer
hiring masters degree holders rather than university graduates, even
though the jobs require only bachelor degree holders.
</P>
<P>
Some 52 percent of the companies surveyed said that their hiring
of masters degree holders was not to meet actual work needs, but
rather a reflection of the situation of the current employment
market, in which the number of masters and doctoral degree holders is
growing fast.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the number of Taiwan students pursuing a
masters degree has jumped to more than 160,000 from 50,000 five years
ago. The number of graduate schools has also increased to top 2,000
from about 800 during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In terms of professions, jobs related to research, marketing,
overseas sales representatives, head hunting and legal consultation
have the highest ratios of personnel with a masters degree, the
survey discovered.
</P>
<P>
Around 88 percent of the hi-tech companies hope to recruit
researchers with a masters degree background, while 46 percent of
them harbor the same idea for overseas sales positions.
</P>
<P>
Some 84 percent of the financial services companies and about 47
percent of the law offices said that they will do the same while
advertising for new employees.
</P>
<P>
The employment information Website conducted the survey in
September and recovered 201 valid questionnaires from human resources
executives working for Taiwan's top 1,000 companies in the
manufacturing sectors and top 500 in the service sector.

New York Times: Death toll is uncertain
after three explosions strike resort towns.

Three explosions shook three Egyptian Sinai resorts popular with
vacationing Israelis on Thursday night. There were conflicting
reports on the number of casualties. Egypt said at least 30 people
were killed, including 12 Egyptians. But an Israeli official later
said he could confirm only 14 or 15 dead, including five or six
Israelis. Earlier, Israel Radio had reported that at least 35 people
were killed and more than 100 wounded.

Wall Street Journal: Blasts in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula kill at
least 21, injure scores.

Blasts from a car bomb and a suicide bomber tore through a resort
hotel in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula where Israelis were vacationing at
the end of a Jewish holiday Thursday night, officials said. There
were at least 19 dead and the toll was likely to rise.

LEGISLATIVE YUAN TO GO INTO ONE-MONTH RECESS NOV. 10
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan will go into recess
Nov. 10 for a month to prepare for the Dec. 11 elections for members
of the next legislature.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng made the announcement
Friday after a consultative meeting of representatives from the
legislative caucuses of the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the legislature is scheduled to resume work Dec. 13.
During the consultations, Wang said the legislative caucus of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) did not propose holding an
extra session before the recess to screen the NT$610.8 billion
special budget bill for the procurement of eight diesel-electric
submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six PAC
III Patriot anti-missile batteries from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus instead expressed hope that the draft package of
amendments to the statute governing the Financial Reconstruction Fund
can clear the legislative floor before the one-month recess, Wang
said, adding that the legislature may hold an extra session to screen
the package before Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided during the consultations that the legislative
caucuses of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , the People First Party
(PFP) and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) will jointly
designate from one to three of their legislators to defend the
controversial "319 truth commission" statute in two hearings to be
called by the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) later this month to
decide whether the statute violates the Constitution or not.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the three caucuses will unveil a short-list of their
debate representatives next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the caucuses of the DPP and its ally the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) -- both of which jointly applied for a CGJ
interpretation of the statute's constitutionality -- said they will
send three lawmakers to take part in the two debates.
</P>
<P>
The statute was authored and railroaded through the legislature
by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP to
create an all-powerful special commission to investigate an
assassination attempt against President Chen Shui-bian on the eve of
the bitterly contested March 20 Presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The statute was promulgated only after the "pan-blue
alliance"-dominated Legislative Yuan overrode the Cabinet's veto in a
narrow showdown vote last month.
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislative caucus has asked the CGJ to impose a
temporary injunction on the statute until the council decides whether
the statute is unconstitutional. The council will hold a hearing Oct.
14 to decide whether to impose a temporary injunction and will hold
two additional hearings Oct. 27 and Oct. 29 before issuing its
"constitutionality" interpretation.
</P>
<P>
Chen narrowly won re-election a day after the March 19 shooting
on the campaign trail. He was only lightly injured. His challenger,
KMT Chairman Lien Chan, has insinuated that Chen staged the shooting
to win sympathy votes. Although he has offered no evidence to support
his allegations, he has filed two lawsuits to challenge Chen's
re-election victory and even the validity of the entire election. The
Taiwan High Court has yet to hand down verdicts on the two lawsuits.

NO CHEAP OPTIONS FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday the
Executive Yuan hopes to purchase arms as cheaply as possible, but he
stressed that "there are no cheap options for national defense."
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks while fielding questions in the
Legislative Yuan one day after Lee Yuan-tseh, a Nobel laureate and
president of Academia Sindica, claimed that a Cabinet-proposed
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) special budget for arms
procurements from the United States is too expensive and that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should hold talks to avoid military
conflict and work toward cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's strategy focuses on war prevention and we will not take
the initiative to attack or provoke China," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will not launch an offensive strike, nor will it change
the status quo, Yu said, adding that "the preservation of the status
quo is in the best interests of the 23 million people of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
He said that arms procurement will depend on the country's needs
and on the threats from enemies. From the stance of the Executive
Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense, the cheaper the price tag
the better, although there are no cheap options for national defense.
</P>
<P>
Also, he went on, the budget for the major arms procurement
package will be cheaper if Taiwan does not insist on building some of
the eight submarines it wants. He was referring to the Cabinet's plan
for the purchase of six batteries of the anti-missile PAC-III system,
eight diesel-electric submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Legislators also asked if Taiwan will announce "no independence"
or if it will ask the respected Nobel laureate to send messages to
mainland China, to which the premier replied that although he admires
Lee for his concern about cross-strait peace and national security,
it is President Chen Shui-bian who is ultimately in charge of
cross-strait policy.

JUSTICE MINISTER URGES CALM AND RATIONALITY AMID CLASHES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan urged all
sides Friday to be rational and avoid confrontation after clashes
were reported between police and supporters of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) in Tainan, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen's call came as Shih Chi-yang, convener of a 10-member
investigation commission set up under a special statute to probe the
March 19 election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian, led a
four-member team that called at the Tainan Prosecutor's Office
earlier that day to try to learn more about the case after the office
refused to respond to the commission's request to send officials to
present a briefing to the commission a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and the TSU, led by
legislators Wang Sing-nan, Chien Lin Whei-jun and Tang Pi-a, tried
to force their way into the offices to protest against the
commission. They clashed with police who were called in to maintain
order. No-one was injured in the melee.
</P>
<P>
Apparently implying that the legislators were merely indulging in
a bit of self-publicity, Chen said that in the run-up to the Dec. 11
legislative elections, all legislative aspirants will want to use
every possible chance to stump for themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The Tainan Prosecutor's Office will investigate the incident
this afternoon to see if any laws have been violated," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He pleaded for calm and rationality to prevail and for further
confrontations to be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that all government agencies have received instructions
from the Executive Yuan that they are not to cooperate with the
commission until the Council of Grand Justices has ruled on the
constitutionality of the recently passed statute that provided legal
grounds for the formation of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Only when the commission is ruled to be working under the premise
of constitutionality and legality will the administrative agencies
cooperate with it, he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who was one of the five government officials that called on
the commission Thursday, also said Shih, a former Judicial Yuan
president, talked about an amendment to the controversial statute,
but when the officials questioned the commission on the issue, they
were "treated rudely" and the meeting ended in a row with one side
questioning the constitutionality of the body and the other side
asking the point of the visit if they regard it as "unlawful" as
President Chen has described it.

day to mark the festive occasion.
</P>

citizen will pay more heed to his or her own mental and physical
health.

<P>
In her view, Lu said, life is full of both joys and sorrows. "We
should face up to challenges and frustrations with a positive
attitude and turn negative feelings and stress into positive and

An alternate lifestyle parade will be held

government as was the case last year, an organizer of the event said
Friday.

The 2004 Taiwan Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Pride

Wu said the parade will feature colorful and dazzling costumes to
show the community's rich diversity, and will highlight the need for
society to respect all individuals, regardless of their sexual

Wu said in a statement that as citizens of Taipei, gays and
lesbians need to come out and be a part of the city. They also must
understand that they have the responsibility to teach the next
generation that there is no "wrong" identity and that differences
must be acknowledged and even respected.

The upcoming parade will set off from the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall and wind through the 228 Park to the Red Theater in

EX-PRESIDENT CALLS FOR NEW CONSTITUTION TO SAVE TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui said Friday
that drafting a new constitution for Taiwan is the only way to save
the country and that it is time for the people to make a concerted
effort to achieve that end.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Rotary International Taiwan's Taipei
Peimen district, Lee said the current Constitution must be redrafted
to leave mainland China no more excuses to invade Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who founded the Action for Constitution Taiwan in July, said
the Republic of China has long been replaced by the People's Republic
of China and thus is a non-existent country.
</P>
<P>
The ROC Constitution has been amended six times but is still "too
big to fit Taiwan," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
While there are more than 180 sovereign states around the world,
Taiwan is recognized by fewer than 30 of them and is excluded from
most international organizations including the United Nations, Lee
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Lee claimed that Taiwan is rejected by the international
community because major countries including the United States,
Britain and Japan believe the legal status of Taiwan is undetermined.
</P>
<P>
As shown in the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco, the document
officially renounces Japan's right to Taiwan and Penghu but does not
state which nation is sovereign over them, Lee noted.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, it is impossible for Taiwan to rejoin the United
Nations under the name of the Republic of China, so it needs to use
the name of a new country, according to Lee.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Friday
that the speech he will give on the Oct. 10 National Day will please
all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the assurance while speaking at the 13th National
Awards Ceremony for Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises and the sixth
National Awards of Overseas Taiwan Businesses at the Grand Hyatt
Hotel in Taipei. Representatives from 16 companies, 12 based at home
and four based abroad, received the honor from the president.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, his speech will focus on national unity, and
cross-Taiwan Strait stability and economic development. He expressed
his belief that the speech will help build confidence among the
people of Taiwan toward the country's future amid grave concerns from
other countries -- namely mainland China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chen has pronounced various times in recent days that he will
make major policy announcements in his national day speech, prompting
widespread speculation that his remarks may have something to do with
mainland China. The president also gave a pledge Wednesday that there
will be no war during his present tenure ending in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Current cross-strait ties are somewhat sensitive after Chen was
re-elected in March. Tension is increasing in the region recently
after Taiwan announced a plan to purchase NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion) in defensive weapons from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The high-profile military procurement plan has been the focal
point of a heated debate between the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and the opposition camp, with the two sides arguing over the
controversial package.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday the
completion of the Taipei 101 skyscraper, the tallest in the world,
proves that dreams do come true.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Ron Kelmencic, head of the Council on Tall
Buildings and Urban Habitat, Chen noted that some people thought it
was no more than wishful thinking and a "mission impossible" when the
idea was first floated in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Now the building has been certified as the tallest in the world,
which represents the highest recognition for Taiwan's architectural
designers and is the pride of the 23 million people on the island,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that he set up a panel to plan the construction
of Taipei 101 in January 1995 soon after he was elected mayor of
Taipei, and the construction project officially started in January
1998.
</P>
<P>
Witnessing every crucial stage of the project, the president said
he is proud to see that the building is now standing tall in the
capital city's Hsinyi district.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the significance of Taipei 101 is that it has helped
vitalize the commercial activities in the Hsinyi district, which has
been transformed from a place with very few buildings to become a
showcase of Taiwan today.

deter any possible mainland Chinese invasion, Minister of National
Defense Lee Jye said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Jye made the remarks during a meeting with members of the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) legislative caucus as part
of his efforts to lobby the party's support for the NT$610.8 billion
arms procurement budget bill.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, TSU lawmakers asked Lee about his views on
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh's remarks a day earlier that
the arms package is too expensive and that it's a pity that the
government has to spend such a large amount to purchase weapons from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
In response, Lee Jye said he above others does not want to see
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait go to war and earnestly looks
forward to maintaining permanent peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lee Jye, an admiral-turned-minister, said he is convinced that so
long as Taiwan can acquire the new arms, mainland China will refrain
from invading Taiwan because doing so would be very costly.
</P>
<P>
According to a computer war game simulation, Lee Jye said
mainland China would have to sacrifice two-thirds to four-fifths of
its troops if it were to attack Taiwan after the island obtains the
new arms.
</P>
<P>
The package includes eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six PAC III Patriot
anti-missile batteries.

CLA TO LOWER NUMBER OF FOREIGN LABOR FOR MAJOR PROJECTS AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang )
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) said Friday that it is considering lowering the number of
foreign labors allowed into the country to work on major private
sector construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The CLA is planning to cut the ratio from the current 30 percent
to 20 percent of the total number of workers on a project that is
worth more than NT$10 billion (about US$2.95 million) in the short
term in view of the warm response from local contractors to the
introduction of foreign laborers for their major construction
projects, a CLA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The CLA had expected that only two or three contractors would
apply for the foreign laborers since the council made public
regulations in late December, the spokesman said. But the response
from the private sector has been high, with eight applications being
approved, which are expected to bring in more than 6,900 foreign
workers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, around 3,400 of them have already entered Taiwan, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Although the government is encouraging the private sector to
launch large investment projects at home as a means of creating job
opportunities for local people, he pointed out, however, that the
larger-than-expected influx of foreign laborers will take away jobs
from local workers.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, the CLA is planning to cap the number
of foreign workers at 20 percent for major construction projects -- a
move based on its quota control mechanisms designed to protect local
workers, he explained.

MAINLAND CHINA TO HAVE MILITARY EDGE OVER TAIWAN IN 2006: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China will eventually gain a
military advantage over Taiwan in 2006 based on the current trend of
Beijing's military buildup, the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry made the announcement in a cross-strait
military analysis submitted to the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that mainland China is actively engaging in a
military buildup program that grows at a double-digit rate each year,
the defense ministry said that the mainland will have a military edge
in 2006.
</P>
<P>
By that time, Taiwan will be in a disadvantageous position in
terms of the number of its airplanes, missiles and submarines
compared with mainland China, the defense ministry said, stressing
that its plans to buy Patriot-III missiles, anti-submarine airplanes
and diesel-powered submarines are urgently needed and the decisions
to buy them must be made swiftly.
</P>
<P>
According to the defense ministry, mainland China has this year
allocated US$25.4 billion in its military buildup and modernization
program, with an additional hidden spending possibly amounting to
US$60 billion.
</P>
<P>
In view of the mainland's rapid military expansion, the defense
ministry pointed out that Taiwan's ground troops, air and naval
forces will confront a sharp deterioration in terms of new generation
weapons in two years.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, mainland China has about 200 cruise missiles
under development, which are capable of launching precision attacks
on Taiwan from some 1,800 nautical miles away, the defense ministry
said, adding that the mainland's navy will have as many as 50
advanced subs by 2006, capable of imposing an undersea blockade
against Taiwan over the long term.
</P>
<P>
During the same time, the number of its armored troops will
increase by 300,000, an exclusively designed move in case of an
attack on Taiwan, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although the mainland's military force is not expected to be able
to conduct a massive invasion of Taiwan by 2006, it warned, however,
that it will be strong enough to launch a blitz against the island
through airborne or seaborne strategies.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to effectively deter any mainland attacks, Taiwan
should build a strong defense capability through an adequate military
procurement, it concluded.

TAIWAN NEEDS A NEW CONSTITUTION: EX-PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan needs a new constitution for
facilitating its pursuit to join international organizations and to
avoid China's intimidation and threats, former President Lee Teng-hui
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking via teleconference with a group of American scholars
gathered at the U.S. Senate, Lee said that drafting a new
constitution for Taiwan is the only way to save the country and that
it is time for the people to make a concerted effort to achieve that
end.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the current Constitution implemented in Taiwan is quite
outdated and not suitable because it was established in 1946 by the
Republic of China which was founded in 1912 when Taiwan was not a
part of it.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Lee pointed out, the ROC Constitution violates
international laws because its stipulates the country's territories
cover the People's Republic of China and Mongolia, which are now
members of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A new constitution for Taiwan should be established by the 23
million people of Taiwan and should not infringe on the sovereignty
of other countries, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The ROC Constitution was amended six times during his term from
1988 to 2000 but is still "too big to fit Taiwan," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The conference on Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering and the
triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations was jointly organized
by the Taipei-based Action for Constitution Taiwan, led by Lee, and
the Washington-based Center for Taiwan International Relations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese delegates to the seminar included senior presidential
adviser Koo Kwang-ming, Evergreen University Professor Lee Hsien-jung
and Chen Lung-chu, chairman of the Taiwan New Century Cultural and
Educational Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The American participants included former American Institute in
Taiwan Chairman Nat Belocchi and several noted scholars, including
John Tkacik, Arthur Waldron, Larry Niksch and James E. Auer.

<TEXT>
<P>
The use of the "Republic of China (Taiwan)"
as the nation's title in official diplomatic documents will become
the norm in the future to avoid inconveniences and confusion,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after signing a joint statement with
visiting Chadian Foreign Affairs Minister Nagoum Yamassoum
reaffirming their commitment to further promoting bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"In the joint statement, our country is referred to as the
'Republic of China (Taiwan) ' for the first time in a diplomatic
document," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement has Chinese and French editions. The ROC is
referred to as the "Republique de Chine (Taiwan) " in the French
version of the document.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the administration has reached a consensus on the
issue. With a view to avoiding unnecessary troubles and confusion,
Chen said, referring to the country as the "Republic of China
(Taiwan)" will be the norm from now on.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, the foreign ministers of the two
countries expressed satisfaction with the current state of bilateral
relations. The two ministers pledged to further expand bilateral
cooperation in various fields, including joint exploration of oil
resources in the central African country.

<P>
Meanwhile, Yamassoum extended his gratitude for Taiwan's
long-term assistance in his country's agricultural and economic
development. He also reaffirmed Chad's firm support for Taiwan's bid
to join the United Nations, the World Health Organization and other
major international organizations.
</P>

For his part, Chen said Africa deserves more support and
assistance amid the trend of globalization. He said the international
community should assist all African countries in getting rid of
poverty and political instability so as to establish a more equitable
world economic system.

<P>
Outgoing ROC Representative to the U.K. Tien
Hung-mao on Friday expressed his appreciation for the friendship and
support offered to Taiwan by various sectors in Britain in bolstering
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Hosting a cocktail reception in celebration of the upcoming ROC
Double Ten National Day, Tien said relations between Taiwan and
Britain have become closer over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Most significantly, the number of Taiwanese students in Britain
has increased quickly over the last few years to more than 13,000
today, Tien pointed out.
</P>
<P>
This year alone, the British government has issued nearly 10,000
visas for Taiwanese students, Tien said.
</P>
<P>
Tien also noted that bilateral trade now stands at more than
US$4.3 billion, and that Britain-based mutual funds account for
one-third of all foreign mutual funds in Taiwan's stock market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he continued, Britain has now become the most
important base of Taiwanese corporations and banks operating in
European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been trying to show the world its concern for freedom,
democracy and human rights, Tien said, pointing out that the
presidential election in March of this year proved that Taiwan is
already a full-fledged democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan will share its resources with other countries and

as economic and technological cooperation and cultural exchanges,
adding that the island will be able to contribute more if it enjoys
more international recognition.

<P>
The event was participated in by over 300 British government
officials, members of Parliament, experts from a number of British
think tanks, academics, leaders of British financial circles, senior
executives of news media and leaders of Taiwanese expatriate groups.

CHINESE-LANGUAGE WEB SITE ON PHILIPPINE TOURISM DEBUTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Philippine representative office in
Taiwan announced Saturday the launching of a Chinese-language tourism
Web site to serve Chinese around the world wanting to get tourism
information on the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Economic and Cultural Office noted that the
Philippines has set the target of attracting 5 million tourists per
year by 2010. Currently, foreign tourists to the Philippines come
mostly from Taiwan, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong
and mainland China. Taiwan tourists account for the fastest growing
source of foreign tourists to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the office show that since February of
this year, the number of tourist arrivals from Taiwan has increased
by 58 percent. The office said it hopes the launch of the new
Chinese-language Web site will help maintain this growth.
</P>
<P>
The Web site address is www.wowphilippines.com.tw.

DEFENSE CAPABILITIES KEY TO PRESERVING NEW CONSTITUTION: U.S. EXPERT

<P>
Taiwan must acquire credible defense
capabilities before enacting a new constitution, otherwise it will be
vulnerable to being overturned, an American expert on China policy
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
John Tkacik, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, made
the remarks at a seminar on issues related to a new constitution for
Taiwan held at the U.S. Senate Hart Building.
</P>
<P>
Tkacik said constitutional reforms are necessary in Taiwan for
several reasons, including the fact that the existing ROC
Constitution in Taiwan was enacted by the Kuomintang in 1947 without
any input from the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tkacik said, before putting a new constitution in
place, the island must first acquire credible military capabilities
to defend itself against possible mainland Chinese military attack.
Otherwise, even if Taiwan succeeds in enacting a new constitution, it
will be difficult to preserve, he said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly organized by the Taipei-based Action for
Constitution Taiwan, headed by former President Lee Teng-hui, and the
Washington-based Center for Taiwan International Relations.

<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Saturday urged
the central government to work to normalize economic relations with
mainland China, claiming this will help deter Beijing from taking any
military actions against the island.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Ma proposed that the government lift its
restrictions on mainland tourists and on mainland capital in certain
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The mayor made the remarks while addressing the opening of
Kuomintang Legislator John Chang's campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Ma argued that cross-strait peace does not depend solely on arms
procurement but requires the support of a comprehensive cross-strait
policy.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is much smaller than mainland China, it must deal with
Beijing with wisdom, not force, he said.

Republic of China Representative to

saying that as a democratic and freedom-loving country, Taiwan
shouldn't have to face "political apartheid" in the international

He stressed that the 23 million people of Taiwan have become
international "nomads" who are discriminated against in the

organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health
Organization without any rights or dignity.
</P>
<P>
Wu also took the opportunity to review Taiwan-Singapore bilateral

TAIWAN REP OFFICE IN INDIA HOSTS ROC DOUBLE TEN NATIONAL DAY PARTY
</HEADLINE>

(By Lin Huei-chun &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China's representative
office in India hosted a major Double Ten National Day cocktail party
Friday in New Delhi, with over 200 representatives of the Indian
political, business and academic sectors, as well as foreign
diplomats to the South Asian country attending the event.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center
in New Delhi publicized its party to celebrate the ROC Double Ten
National Day since the center's founding in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Double Ten Day celebrations at the center were
always low-key events. The ROC does not maintain formal diplomatic
relations with India.
</P>
<P>
ROC Representative to India Kao Chen-chun told CNA reporters at
the evening party that there has been much close contact between
India and Taiwan over the last few years, with frequent exchanges in
the trade, economic and technology fields.
</P>
<P>
Given India's huge population and its growing middle-class and
consumer demand, Taiwan businesses should take the South Asian
country into consideration when planning to invest abroad.
</P>
<P>
Following the opening of the Taiwan representative office in New
Delhi in 1995, the two sides kicked off direct Taipei-New Delhi
flight services and signed an investment protection agreement in
2000. Meanwhile, bilateral trade and investment has also grown at a
steady pace, with two-way trade expected to hit US$2 billion this
year.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to expand Taiwan's relations with India, Kao said,
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming is planning a visit
to India in November.

<TEXT>
<P>
A domestic technology firm on Saturday
unveiled the world's smallest MP3 player at the 2004 Taipei
International Electronics Show.
</P>
<P>
The MP3 player, manufactured by the Hsuan Mao Enterprise Co., is
only four centimeters in diameter and 16 grams in weight. It has a
memory capacity of up to 256 megabytes and is powered by a
rechargeable battery that lasts four to six hours. It will be sold at
the competitive price of around NT$1,600 (US$47).
</P>
<P>
MP3 players are replacing CD walkmans as the mainstream product
in the portable stereo market thanks to their handy size, large
storage capacity, and excellent acoustic quality.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the International Data Corp. (IDC), some
25 million MP3 players are expected to be sold this year, up by over
10 million from the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts expect MP3 player sales to continue to increase
by 10 million units annually over the next several years.

U.S. SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN WEAKENING: SCHOLARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu, Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. support for Taiwan has shown signs
of weakening, several Taiwan and American scholars said at the
opening of a seminar on U.S.-Taiwan-China relations on Capitol Hill
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Symposium on Taiwan's Constitutional Reform and
U.S.-Taiwan-China Relations, Larry Niksch, a U.S. congressional Asian
affairs expert, said he has noticed that U.S. support for Taiwan is
gradually weakening.
</P>
<P>
If the United States wants to maintain the Taiwan Strait status
quo, Niksch said, it should prevent Beijing from continuously eroding
Taiwan's international presence or "space", including luring away
Taiwan's diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-yen, chief executive of the U.S.-based Formosan
Association for Public Affairs, echoed Niksch's views, saying he has
detected such a trend.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan should keep vigilant against this trend and make every
possible effort to keep the United States informed of Taiwan's latest
situation in order to win more U.S. support for its cause, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
As to what the Taiwan Strait status quo means, John Tkacik, a
Heritage Foundation research fellow, said he once asked the U.S.
State Department about this question, but none of the State
Department officials could give a clear definition.
</P>
<P>
To the best of his understanding, Tkacik said, the Taiwan Strait
status quo can be described as "no unification, no independence and
no war."
</P>
<P>
Chen Lung-chih, chairman of the New Century Culture and Education
Foundation, said the "status quo" is dynamic and cannot remain
unchanged forever.
</P>
<P>
James Kelly, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, said during a congressional hearing in April this
year that the United States is opposed to either side of the Taiwan
Strait unilaterally changing the status quo, adding that it's up to
the United States to define what the status quo means.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Nat Belocchi, a former chairman of
the American Institute in Taiwan, suggested that the U.S. government
set up a special cross-strait task force to review Taiwan-U.S.-China
relations regularly and to submit reports to the U.S. president
periodically. These reports should also be made available to Taiwan,
he suggested.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly organized by the Taipei-based Action for
Constitution Taiwan, headed by former President Lee Teng-hui, and the
Washington-based Center for Taiwan International Relations.
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee delivered a speech in English via video link
to the participants in the seminar held at the U.S. Senate Hart
Building. In the speech, Lee said he believes it is high time to
"save Taiwan" by writing a new constitution that fits the island's
present situation.

E.U. URGED TO MAINTAIN BAN ON ARMS SALES TO CHINA
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A campaign against considerations by
the European Union to lift its ban on arms sales to mainland China
dominated celebrations in Los Angeles Friday for the upcoming ROC
Double Ten National Day.
</P>
<P>
Many guests at a cocktail reception held to celebrate the Oct. 10
National Day signed a petition in support of the campaign by Taiwan's
government, with the statement and signatures to be sent to the L.A.
missions of all European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
Wei Wu-lien, director of the Tapei Economic and Cultural Office
in Los Angeles, said the peace-loving ROC has for years been actively
involved in international anti-terrorism and humanitarian efforts. He
said Taiwan looks forward to expanding its international
participation so as to contribute more to the global community.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Wei noted, Beijing has deployed more than 500
missiles targeting Taiwan, which he claimed demonstrates China's
strong military ambitions. He warned that proposals being discussed
in the European Union to lift its arms sales ban in disregard of this
fact are bound to lead to an escalation in cross-strait confrontation
and endanger security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
the world.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 guests, including a number of California politicians,
attended the reception held at the Bonaventure Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, a group of pro-Taiwan members of the U.S.
Congress sent their congratulations to the ROC government for the
nation's 93rd birthday. In their messages, the congressmen said
Taiwan is a great friend of the United States despite the absence of
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has become a model of democracy over the last 20 years,
with its people now enjoying a high standard of living and the right
to directly elect their president, they said.
</P>
<P>
The members of Congress also noted that Taiwan has fully
cooperated with the United States since the 911 terrorists attacks
and has supported the post-war reconstruction in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
They praised President Chen Shui-bian as a resolute national
leader for his commitment to maintaining peace and stability across

EXHIBITION OF MADAME CHIANG'S PERSONAL EFFECTS DRAWS HUGE CROWD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large crowd swarmed into the Sun Yat-sen
Memorial Hall in Taipei Saturday to view a collection of personal
effects that once belonged to the late Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the
most famous ROC first lady.
</P>
<P>
The rare show was organized by the ROC Women's League to mark the
anniversary of Madame Chiang's death. The exhibition, which will run
through Nov. 5, is believed to be the largest of its kind ever held
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Among the exhibits are 28 Chinese brush paintings by Madame
Chiang, who died at her New York home Oct. 24, 2003, at the age of
106. Many of the paintings carry the late President Chiang Kai-shek's
handwriting. Major painting utensils used by Madame Chiang are also
on display.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, many of the exhibits were loaned by
Madame Chiang's relatives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Also on display are a number of Madame Chiang's personal effects,
including costumes, handbags, shoes, hats, jewels and other
accessories. Photos featuring Madame Chiang wearing those fashionable
articles are also being shown to allow visitors to remember her grace
and fashion taste.
</P>
<P>
Other exhibits include Madame Chiang's manuscripts and personal
letters, as well as historical documents and photos featuring her and
her husband.
</P>
<P>
Madame Chiang, whose life traversed three centuries, helped the
late president rule mainland China and later Taiwan during years of
war, upheaval and Cold War tension.
</P>
<P>
The Chiangs were once one of the most famous couples in the world
-- a dashing general married to a beautiful, urbane woman. Time
magazine publisher Henry Luce named them "Man and Woman of the Year"
in 1938. Chiang Kai-shek headed the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Republic
of China for decades until he died April 5, 1975.
</P>
<P>
Madame Chiang led a reclusive life at her Manhattan home for much
of her later life after her husband's death. Born Soong Mei-ling, she
became widely known in the West as a spokeswoman for Chinese efforts
to resist the Japanese forces that began invading China in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
After the Chinese Communist Party took control of the mainland,
the Republic of China government, under her husband's leadership,
moved its seat to Taiwan in 1949. Chiang and his wife became Asia's
foremost anti-communist symbols.
</P>
<P>
Many KMT party elders, including former Premiers Sun Yun-hsuan
and Lee Huan as well as former Control Yuan President Wang Tso-jung,
attended the opening ceremony. KMT Vice Chairwoman Lin Cheng-chih
read a congratulatory message from KMT Chairman Lien Chan on the
occasion.

MAINLAND CHINA REFUSES TO ATTEND IEA GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN TAIPEI

<P>
Mainland China will be the only one of the
61 institutional members of the International Association for the
Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) to be absent from the
organization's general assembly set for Oct. 11-14 in Taipei, it was
learned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In line with past IEA practice, the host country must display the
national flags of all participating countries at the meeting, but
mainland China decided not to send delegates because it cannot accept
having the ROC national flag displayed.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the National Science Council (NSC), sponsor of this
year's 45th IEA General Assembly, said this has again shown mainland
China's relentless stifling of Taiwan, even on academic occasions.
</P>
<P>
They cited last year's meeting in Cyprus as an example, saying
that mainland Chinese delegates protested to the host country after
seeing the ROC national flag flying side by side with the flags of
other member states. The host country later decided to remove all the
flags to demonstrate its impartiality.
</P>
<P>
The move angered many other countries, according to Lin Fu-lai,
director of the NSC's Science Education Department who represented
Taiwan at the meeting. He was later elected as an IEA board member
IEA in Asia after obtaining the support from many countries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines would have hosted this year's meeting, but it
later gave up, and the IEA then inquired about the intention of
Taiwan hosting the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China, after learning that Taiwan was awarded the right
to host this year's general assembly, invited the IEA president and
other officials to visit the mainland, protesting to them in person
and asking that the site of the meeting be shifted to the mainland.
However, the IEA only agreed to let mainland China host the 2006
meeting and insisted that Taipei host this year's event.
</P>
<P>
The IEA, founded in 1958, is an independent, international
cooperative of national research institutions and governmental
research agencies.

KINMEN COUNTY OFFICIALS CAN'T CONFIRM HANDOVER DATE FOR ISLETS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kinmen County Government officials said
Saturday that they could not confirm reports that the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) will turn over six islets off Kinmen to the
county government next January, stating only that the "handover plan
is proceeding smoothly."
</P>
<P>
The officials made the remarks amid media reports that the MND
will withdraw stationed troops from the six islets -- namely Tatan,
Ertan, Tungting, Peiting, Shihyu and Menghuyu -- and hand the islets
over to the Kinmen County Government for opening to tourism in Jan.
1, 2005.
</P>
<P>
The officials would not confirm the "timing" for handover,
saying it is "top secret."
</P>
<P>
However, they did disclose that since Premier Yu Shyi-kun
inspected the outlying island of Kinmen in September 2002 and
announced the principle of having the Kinmen County government take
over the six islets, the plan has been moving forward smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the Executive Yuan replied in a letter in
late July that it agrees in principle to the Kinmen County
government's plan for the takeover, and that they would work out
related details.
</P>
<P>
In expectation of the handover, Kinmen County Government has
commissioned National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences to
conduct a tourism resource and development survey of Tatan and Ertan,
the two islets off Kinmen that are closest to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In September, the county government also worked with the Kinmen
Defense Command to survey the islets and recently convened a
closed-door meeting to discuss matters related to the hand over.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng has repeatedly said that
the county government will take over the six islets by the year's
end. On Oct. 7, when Lee led a delegation to visit Taiwan expatriates
in Southeast Asian nations, he mentioned the handover plan in
distributed pamphlets and welcomed the expatriates to return for
investment.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen is located off the southeastern coast of the mainland
Chinese province of Fujian. The shortest distance from the main
island of Kinmen to the mainland is only 2,310 meters.

<P>
Former Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Lin I-hsiung Saturday urged the people to cherish Taiwan's
hard-fought achievement in its democratic development.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on the role of the people in a democracy, Lin pointed
out that Taiwan is one of 86 countries where people enjoy full
freedom, citing a report by U.S.-based Freedom House.
</P>
<P>
Although the first power transition in the history of Taiwan's
democracy was completed in 2000, there are still a lot of "viruses"
impeding the progress of democracy which will require the united
effort of the people to get rid of, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin said many people are wondering what benefits Taiwan has
gained since the power transition besides now being able to curse the
president more freely than ever before.
</P>
<P>
The people have had enough of the disorderly Legislative Yuan and
think it is no better than in the past when it was controlled by the
"old guards," Lin noted.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the people are the masters of the country in a
democracy, and all the heads of governments and the people's
representatives are elected by the people.
</P>
<P>
The chaotic situation in Taiwan is the result of abuse of
freedom, the lack of democratic concepts, and the people's
disinterest in politics, according to Lin.
</P>
<P>
He called on the people to foster the concept of democracy in the
younger generations to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, parents should avoid treating their
children in an authoritative manner in order to develop a democratic
personality in their kids; schools should enhance education on
democracy and train students in democratic ways of thinking; and the
attitude of complying with the majority view and respecting the
minority view should be adopted in group activities.

DPP CALLS FOR INTER-PARTY COOPERATION IN AMENDING '319' STATUTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" Saturday to cooperate with it in resolving all the disputes
surrounding the "319 truth commission" statute.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative whip Tsai Huang-liang made the call after several
"truth commission" members encountered a violent protest in front of
the Tainan Prosecutor's Office in the southern city of Tainan the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the "truth commission" statute under which the
all-powerful commission was established is unconstitutional and
unlawful, Tsai said the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) should cooperate with the DPP in
amending the statute in compliance with constitutional provisions and
other existing laws.
</P>
<P>
"Only after the statute is properly revised can the 'truth
commission' operate smoothly. Otherwise, the commission will lead
nowhere," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Even though the "pan-blue alliance" has come up with a draft
revision package, Tsai said, it is not enough to ensure the smooth
operations of the commission.
</P>
<P>
"The 'pan-blue alliance' should take into account the DPP's
amendment proposals so that the statute can become practical and
feasible, " Tsai said, adding that the administration and judicial
authorities will cooperate with the "truth commission" only when the
statue no longer contains any unconstitutional or unlawful
provisions.
</P>
<P>
The statute was authored and railroaded through the legislature
by the "pan-blue alliance" to create an all-powerful special
commission to investigate an assassination attempt against President
Chen Shui-bian on the eve of the bitterly contested March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The statute was promulgated only after the "pan-blue
alliance"-dominated Legislative Yuan overrode the Cabinet's veto in a
narrow showdown vote last month.

The DPP legislative caucus has asked the Council of Grand
Justices to impose a temporary injunction on the statute until the
council decides whether the statute is unconstitutional. The council
will hold a hearing Oct. 14 to decide whether to impose a temporary
injunction and will hold two additional hearings Oct. 27 and Oct. 29
before issuing its "constitutionality" interpretation.

Chen narrowly won re-election a day after the March 19 shooting
on the campaign trail. He was only lightly injured. His challenger,
KMT Chairman Lien Chan, has insinuated that Chen staged the shooting
to win sympathy votes. Although Lien has offered no evidence to
support his allegations, he has filed two lawsuits to challenge
Chen's re-election victory and even the validity of the entire
election. The Taiwan High Court has yet to hand down verdicts on the
two lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Huang Chung-yuan of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union -- the DPP's ally -- said if the statute is finally revised,
KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong should make
a public apology to the public for their parties' insistence on
passing such an unconstitutional statute in the first place.

DATE FOR ISLETS TRANSFER STILL UNDER DISCUSSIONS: MILITARY

<TEXT>
<P>
The date for the military to hand over
control of six offshore islets to the Kinmen County Government is
still under discussions, the Kinmen Defense Command (KDC) said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The KDC was responding to media reports that the military will
withdraw troops from six small islets off Kinmen -- namely Tatan,
Ertan, Tungting, Peiting, Shihyu and Menghuyu -- and transfer control
of the islets to the civilian Kinmen County Government Jan. 1, 2005.
</P>
<P>
A KDC official said the proposed handover is being planned in
line with the principles of national defense, civilian livelihood and
tourism development in Kinmen, which lies closer to mainland China's
Fujian province than to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"While the transfer plan has been proceeding smoothly, the exact
date for the handover has yet to be decided. We are still discuss
relevant issues with the Kinmen County Government, " the official
added.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the takeover, the Kinmen County Government has
commissioned National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences to
conduct a tourism resources survey of Tatan and Ertan, which lies
very close to mainland China. The county government also would not
reveal when it will formally take over control of the six islets.

<P>
Substantive relations between Taiwan
and Malaysia have been growing ever closer, with commercial and
civilian exchanges increasing rapidly, the Republic of China's de
facto ambassador to Malaysia said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Wen-ya, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Malaysia, made the remarks at an evening party celebrating
the ROC's Oct. 10 National Day.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Malaysia has been one of the key destination for Taiwan's
"go south" investment policy which encourages Taiwan businesspeople
to invest in Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the "go south" policy, Wu said, Taiwan's investment and
trade with ASEAN countries have grown substantially since 1994.
Over the past decade, he went on, Taiwan has invested more than
US$43 billion in ASEAN nations, including Malaysia. In 2003, Taiwan's
trade with ASEAN reached US$34.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, Taiwan is now Malaysia's sixth largest trading
partner and Malaysia is Taiwan's eighth largest trading partner. In
the first eight months of this year, Taiwan-Malaysia trade amounted
to US$6.2 billion, up 26 percent from the year-earlier level, and
Malaysia enjoying a trade surplus of US$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is also third largest foreign investor in Malaysia, with
total investment reaching US$9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan people made 130,000 visits to Malaysia in the
first eight months of this year, up 73 percent from the same period
of last year, while Malaysian citizens made 54,000 visits to Taiwan
during the same period for a 72 percent year-on-year growth.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he will do his utmost to further boost Taiwan-Malaysian
ties during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Malaysian officials, parliamentarians, social
celebrities as well as Taiwanese expatriates and business executives
attended the celebration party.

Taiwanese trade associations in Malaysia also jointly donated
US$38,000 to help Taiwan people affected by typhoon-caused
flooding this summer.

New York Times: Bush
and Kerry trade attacks in their second
presidential debate

U.S. Senator John Kerry assailed President
Bush for a record of soaring deficits and
anemic job growth and a foreign policy that
stirred resentment around the globe in a tense
and testy second debate Friday night.
President Bush derided Kerry as a liberal who
would usher in higher taxes and bigger
government and would make the United States
less safe. For 90 heated minutes as they paced
across a platform in a "town hall" forum at
Washington University in St. Louis, Bush and
Kerry offered sharply different responses in
heated language to virtually every question
that came before them: from health care to
taxes, from Iran to Iraq, to who should be on
the Supreme Court and what kind of limits
should be placed on stem cell research.

Wall Street Journal: Bush and Kerry battle
in fierce second debate

In a crackling second debate, President Bush
and Sen. John Kerry battled over the war in Iraq,
jobs, education, health care, the environment, 
cheaper drugs and other issues at a town-hall 
session 25 days before the election. Bush
defended his invasion of Iraq. He insisted that
the Iraqi leader posed a unique threat and the
world was safer without him in power. But the
Massachusetts senator accused Bush of misplaced
priorities.

CREDIBLE DEFENSE CAPABILITY KEY TO TAIWAN STRAIT PEACE: CHEN

Investment in defense is tantamount to investment in permanent

national security should be put above any partisan interests.

Chen further said Taiwan's continued military reform and defense
capability upgrading are purely meant to defend its own security

TAIWAN'S DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS WILL CONTINUE: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's democratization process will
continue and will realize step-by-step the objective of popular
sovereignty and completely restore political power to the people,
President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In his national day message delivered at the Office of the
President, Chen said that the quality of Taiwan's democracy and the
essence of its civic society must be continuously enhanced and the
standard for the constitutional rule of law must be further examined
and realized.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that a series of political and constitutional
reforms initiated and made by his administration over the past years
are to enhance the management and efficiency of the government.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the national security, the president said that his
government will continue to enhance the country's defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the mounting threat of force and increasing military
preparedness from across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's defense
capability is paramount for maintaining the cross-strait peaceful
status quo, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our investment in national defense today is an investment in
permanent peace and an investment in security for the next
generation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The president also announced that a conference on ethnic and
cultural development will be held in mid-October to forge a new sense
of shared destiny and realize the goal of ethnic diversity and
national unity.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the president's message is as follows:
</P>
<P>
Distinguished Guests, My Dear Associates, Ladies and Gentlemen:
</P>
<P>
Congratulations and greetings to each and every one of you!
</P>
<P>
Today, on the 93rd National Day of the Republic of China, we
stand here in this solemn and momentous occasion to welcome this day
-- a glorious day that belongs to our 23 million fellow citizens. Let
us wish the nation a happy birthday!
</P>
<P>
In 2000, Taiwan accomplished its first-ever transfer of power
between political parties. The strengths of the people have set into
motion the gigantic wheel of national reform and progress. Their
determination released Taiwan from the burden and malaise -- remnants
of the protracted one-party rule from the past -- and enabled the
dynamic vitality of this young democracy to shine brightly again. The
historical significance of this change of administration is more than
just the relief of old maladies or burdens. This event lays the very
foundation upon which our nation's stability and future developments
can be ensured through persistent, comprehensive, and structural
reform. This year, the inaugural speech of my second-term, titled"
Paving the Way for a Sustainable Taiwan, "signifies our hope of
drawing on the support and strength of the people, so as to lay the
permanent cornerstone for sustainable democracy, reforms, humanities,
and peace.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's democratization process continues, we will
step-by-step realize the objective of popular sovereignty and
completely restore political power to the people. However, our
journey down the path of democracy will not end there. The quality of
Taiwan's democracy and the essence of our civic society must be
continuously enhanced, and the standard for the constitutional rule
of law must be further examined and realized.
</P>
<P>
During the first half-century of authoritarian rule in Taiwan,
freedom, democracy, and human rights were infringed upon. Moreover,
defective government policies exploited inequality among different
ethnic groups, suppressed certain languages and cultures, and caused
discrepancy in national identity. These inequities continue to eat at
the heart of Taiwan and can be traced to the political oppression by
our past dictatorial government. With our democratization, it follows
that Taiwan must face its history with utmost sincerity to bridge the
rifts and heal the wounds left behind by the past authoritarian
government -- through mutual understanding, tolerance, and respect. The
furtherance of democracy and creation of civic society will protect
the diversity of ethnic cultures and the right to pursue personal
development. Together, we will safeguard the fruits of Taiwan's
democracy, freedom, and prosperity; forge a new sense of shared
destiny; and vigorously realize the goal of"ethnic diversity and
national unity."
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Ethnic and Cultural Development slated to
convene in mid-October represents our will to candidly and sincerely
face the important issue of ethnic harmony. It is hoped that by
engaging in rational dialogue, learning from one another, and showing
mutual respect, we can enhance understanding among ethnic groups and
strengthen national identity and solidarity. The convening of this
conference is by no means the end of our work. Rather, it marks the
beginning of a new stage where Taiwan's society strives to reach
higher levels of harmony and solidarity. In the future, the
government will, in accordance with the consensus and recommendations
formed at the Conference on Ethnic and Cultural Development, review
current ethnic and cultural policies and implement measures to
safeguard the status of all ethnic groups and promote the development
of cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
In the face of increasingly rigorous global competition, only
continuous reform and innovation can ensure the sustainability of our
national competitiveness. For over four years, the government has
expedited the lifting of laws and regulations and actively upgraded
the efficiency of government administration in order to revitalize
the economy while launching comprehensive reforms. With these
efforts, we have kept local industries out the shadow of recession
and augmented national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, I proposed the"three-four-five"targets
for economic development that should be reached within three years.
Specifically, we will raise national spending on research and
development to 3 percent of the GDP in 2006, reduce unemployment to
less than 4 percent in 2005, and boost the economic growth rate to
over 5 percent by the end of 2004. As a result of all the hard work
of my fellow citizens, the economic growth rate for the first half of
this year reached 7.71 percent, with the annual growth rate expected
to exceed 6 percent overall. The average unemployment rate between
January and August was 4.52 percent, with the annual figure likely to
drop below 4.5 percent. We have achieved above and beyond the
original goals we set for ourselves. This makes us all the more
confident in what the future holds for our nation.
</P>
<P>
This year, Taiwan has also received high marks in several
important surveys on national competitiveness. Taiwan ranked fifth
among all nations and first among Asian countries in the World
Economic Forum's survey of global growth competitiveness. Over the
years, Taiwan's position in this survey has steadily risen, from
tenth in 2001, seventh in 2002, sixth in 2003, to fifth this year. In
the 2004 World Competitiveness Yearbook published by the Institute
for Management Development in Switzerland, Taiwan placed twelfth, the
highest-ranking Taiwan has earned from the same survey. Nevertheless,
we should and will not be complacent; instead, on the foundation laid
painstakingly over the previous four years, we must increase the
depth and breadth of reforms at every front and continue to elevate
our nation's overall competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Through the collective efforts of the governing and opposition
parties, as well as all sectors of society, the Legislative Yuan
approved in August constitutional revisions that include critical
issues with regards to legislative reforms. These amendments are to
halve the number of legislators; implement a single-district,
two-vote system in the legislative election; codify national
referendum in the Constitution; and abolish the National Assembly.
The Executive Yuan in September drafted a bill, the Organic Law of
the Executive Yuan, to modify its own structure, reducing the number
of its 36 subordinate ministries and commissions to thirteen
ministries, four commissions and five independent agencies. This
action symbolizes a major stride in the history of Taiwan's
governmental reengineering, an undertaking which has seen eight
premiers over seventeen years.
</P>
<P>
All of our endeavors, from parliamentary reforms and governmental
reengineering to possible future constitutional amendments, are
efforts to enhance the management and efficiency of the government.
These improvements will transform Taiwan into a normal, cohesive,
competitive, and modern democracy. It is my hope that, with the full
support of all the people and political parties of Taiwan, we will be
able to promote, one after another, major reforms concerning state
institutions and the quality of our democratic system. Such an
accomplishment would create conditions conducive to Taiwan's
sustainable prosperity, development, and progress.
</P>
<P>
The goal of economic development goes beyond the accumulation of
material wealth. Even more important is improving the quality and
appreciation of life, as well as establishing a more humane and
ecologically balanced living environment. The earthquake of September
21, 1999 was Taiwan's most devastating calamity in over a century.
That tragedy prompted us to think seriously about how to live at
peace with nature. The havoc wreaked by subsequent typhoons and
torrential rains remind us of the importance and urgency of land
conservation and environmental protection. In the future, we will
bring new life to the land by shifting the focus of national land-use
planning from utilitarian development to sustainable use and
conservation.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection and use of resources are two sides of
the same token. With the world economy experiencing a broad-based
recovery, global energy markets are bracing for an era of high oil
prices. In the face of the steadily rising oil price, we must reflect
on past policies that focused on the misguided pursuit of growth and
relentless energy consumption. It is time to promote comprehensive
energy conservation, as well as develop and adopt the use of
alternative or renewable energies. We must strive for an energy
policy more finely in tune with environmental protection and the
sustainable use of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Ensuring the security of people's lives and property is the
government's most imperative responsibility."National security"
should be the rhetoric commonly spoken by the whole citizenry. Faced
with the mounting threat of force and increasing military
preparedness from across the Taiwan Strait, every citizen should
develop the awareness that raising Taiwan's defense capabilities is
paramount for maintaining the peaceful status quo across the Taiwan
Strait. It is also the foundation that will enable the two sides to
pursue dialogue on an equal footing."Don't think that the enemy
will not come; instead, be ready and prepared."Everyone understands
the logic of this statement. If Taiwan lacks a strong national
defense, how can it deter military invasion or prevent the outbreak
of war?
</P>
<P>
We will continue to strengthen the military and enhance our
defense capabilities. Such efforts are not to enter an arms race with
Beijing, nor do they signal an attempt to provoke China; they are
founded entirely on the need for national security and self-defense,
as well as the responsibility and duty that we must shoulder to
safeguard cross-strait peace and regional stability.
</P>
<P>
National security should transcend party interests, and national
defense requires long-term and continued planning. The items and
contents of military procurement were initially proposed by the
previous administration and the proposal is now coming to fruition
after many years of endeavor, which should be a source of
satisfaction to both the governing and opposition parties. A decision
should not be considered correct one day but incorrect the next
merely for electoral or political considerations. Our investment in
national defense today is an investment in permanent peace and an
investment in security for the next generation. We should not allow
interim political strife to compromise our nation's long-term
security.
</P>
<P>
As head of state, I understand very well that national defense is
not the only factor in securing peace, but it is certainly an
indispensable prerequisite. My every waking moment is spent on
contemplating the grave responsibility of how to improve cross-strait
relations and secure Taiwan's status and diplomacy in the
international community. On this day of celebration for our Nation's
birthday, I would like to expound on my thoughts and ideas on the
directions and principles raised in my second-term inaugural speech
of May 20. We cannot rely on others to ensure peace in the Taiwan
Strait; and we must develop our own abilities to protect the current
status quo. I would like to urge all political parties -- the governing
party and the oppositions alike -- to relinquish their respective
prejudice, and put national security and the people's well-being
above their own self-interests. In order to make responsible
decisions for the nation's survival and development and to ensure
peace and security for our future generations, they should adopt
rational communication and debate to promptly review the legislation
and budget for national defense procurement.
</P>
<P>
My dear colleagues, we shall not forget the skies above Greece
this August, when our athletes captured the first gold medal for
Taiwan in the arena of the Athens Games -- a historic moment and an
answer to the prayer of our 23 million people. A great many of you
were deeply moved, as I was myself. Although Taiwan is a small
island, we must aspire to reach high goals. Despite meeting with
relentless and unjustifiable suppression in the international stage,
our efforts and strengths have finally enabled us to pass the test of
competition and capture these medals that belong to all of us. This
is Taiwan's story, a moving story of arduous sweat mixed with joyful
tears.
</P>
<P>
For the past half a century, the 23 million people of Taiwan have
dedicated themselves to the quest for democracy, to their passion for
peace, to their fight for survival, and to their pursuit of
advancement. This is the moving success story we have to share with
the international community. With such remarkable achievements, we
should be more confident of ourselves and of Taiwan. After four years
of trials and tribulations, after overcoming innumerable obstacles,
we should become more unified and dedicated in meeting the challenges
ahead. Looking into the future, we must, in a concerted effort,
shoulder the responsibility of creating our own destiny and be guided
by the vision of a progressive Taiwan - a land of sustainable growth
and development.
</P>
<P>
In closing, let us wish a happy birthday and prosperity to the
Republic of China, as well as good health and happiness to all our
distinguished guests and my dear colleagues. Thank you very much!

CHEN CALLS FOR REOPENING OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE BASED ON 92 TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian in his speech to
the National Day rally Sunday called for the reopening of
cross-strait dialogue based on the talks that officials from both
sides engaged in Hong Kong in 1992 to accelerate the long-stalled
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I would like to take the initiative to propose that both
sides use the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong to seek possible
schemes that are 'not necessarily perfect but acceptable, ' as
preparation of a step forward in the resumption of dialogue and
consultation," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the country that he has, on many occasions, proposed
that both sides promote the resumption of cross-strait dialogue and
communication based on the existing foundation to reduce the gap
between the two sides and to lay a foundation of mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
After the recent transfer of power and personnel reshuffle on the
Chinese mainland, Chen said, he hopes that, with greater wisdom, both
sides could create better opportunities for new development on
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Chen reaffirmed the promises and principles set forth in his
second-term inaugural speech, saying that these commitments will be
honored during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
Past experiences have shown that Beijing's military threats and
constricting Taiwan's international space will only further distance
people on either side of the Strait, Chen said, adding that
belligerent and hostile rhetoric simply cannot improve mutual trust
and understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said that cross-strait relations are not necessarily a
zero-sum game and there will never be a winner unless it's a win-win
situation for both sides. "I believe the fourth-generation leadership
on the other side of the Strait should be able to fully understand
this point," he continued to say.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president pledged that, he will invite, with
utmost sincerity, leaders from all political parties upon the
completion of the year-end legislative elections to collaborate in a
major undertaking of establishing a Committee for Cross-strait Peace
and Development.
</P>
<P>
Chen pledged to also collaborate with leaders from all political
parties after the elections to forge ahead with the constitutional
reform; to tackle national policy issues that are of vital importance
to the people; and to reach a majority consensus, based on which,
both the governing and opposition parties can make a critical
contribution to the enduring political stability and sustainable
development of the country.

PRESIDENT CHEN'S ADDRESS TO THE 2004 NATIONAL DAY RALLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that
Taiwan must stand tall on the international stage, with parity and
dignity.
</P>
<P>
This is a wish shared by the 23 million people of Taiwan, Chen
said in his address to the 2004 National Day rally held in front of
the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
"In the same spirit, it is the yearning of each of our fellow
citizens to see our national flag raised and our national anthem
played in the Olympic award ceremony," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is but a simple wish that should never be ignored by any
member of civilized societies nor met with flagrant attitude that
retorts: "Nobody cares about you!" Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the president's speech:
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chairman, Foreign Dignitaries, Distinguished Guests and
Fellow Citizens: Good morning!
</P>
<P>
Let me begin by expressing our sincere appreciation to our
distinguished guests, who have come from afar, and to our friends who
have extended their support to Taiwan over the years. Thank you all
for joining us here-- together with the 23 million people of
Taiwan--to celebrate the ninety-third birthday of the Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
To the people of Taiwan, 2004 is a year to be remembered:
Olympians representing Taiwan in Athens had, for the first time in
history, gallantly captured the first and second gold medals of this
nation--for themselves, for Taiwan, and as an answer to the yearning
of 23 million people of our country. Decades from now, the accounts
of Taiwan's triumphant moments in the Olympic Games will continue to
leave indelible imprints in the chronicle of Taiwan and in our
collective memory.
</P>
<P>
When Taiwan's first gold medal was conferred officially, waves of
emotions swept through the hearts of our athletes and millions of our
fellow citizens, who witnessed that glorious moment in history with
tears of joy streaming down their faces. Perhaps those not from
Taiwan find it difficult to comprehend the bittersweet sentiment so
deeply felt by all of us--one that stems from a profound regret that
our gold medallists are forbidden to sing our national anthem and
salute our national flag, and that our only recourse is to make a
loud appeal to the international media: "I am from Taiwan!"
</P>
<P>
This is the "Story of Taiwan"--an arduous journey that never
ceases to engender new chapters of glory and success. In the past
half a century, the 23 million of people of Taiwan toiled tirelessly
on this land to bring about economic developments and democratic
achievements--their indefatigable spirits and unfaltering strengths
fill the pages of the same moving story of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Today, we have invited our Olympic and Paralympic champions to
lead the chorus of our National Anthem. In a song that entwines our
people with the remembrance of our glorious past, we honor the
"Heroes of Taiwan"; and as sounds of our national Anthem reach far
beyond the horizon, we join here today with our Olympic heroes as a
symbolic gesture that each and every one of you, my fellow citizens,
is a hero of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is a small country. Facing a multitude of challenges and
vigorous competition, we must stand tall on the international stage,
relying only on our intrinsic capabilities. External difficulties
should make us more united internally. The transfer of governing
power between political parties and the actualization of democratic
ideas serve to strengthen our nation and improve our international
competitiveness. We cannot afford to dwell upon the victory or defeat
of each election, nor can we allow our nation to remain stagnant and
our society divided. The long-term authoritarian government of the
past has brought about inappropriate and defective policy regarding
ethnic groups and discrepancy in national identity. After the
alternation of political party in power, we must seize new
opportunities for rebuilding solidarity, instead of dwelling on
distractive confrontation.
</P>
<P>
In my inauguration speech of this year, I specifically called
attention to the issues of identity and ethnicity, which constitute
serious matters that cannot be denied or deliberately overlooked in
today's society. My colleagues and I, in the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) as the governing party, will lead the way in addressing
such issues. We will take the first step and begin with candid
self-reflection. Just this past September, the DPP passed a binding
resolution of supremacy--the Resolution on Ethnic Diversity and
National Unity. Soon after the National Day celebration, the
Executive Yuan will convene a "Conference on Ethnic and Cultural
Development, " for which much time and effort have been devoted
towards its fruition. These concrete actions signify the beginning of
mutual understanding, rather than an end to our own introspection.
</P>
<P>
The story of Taiwan is co-authored by every ethnic group of this
land. Where we stand is the motherland of the Indigenous, Hakka and
Hoklo. It is a new home for the "new settlers, " and a new world for
immigrants from other parts of the world. Taiwan's national identity
is established with all-inclusive participation from our ethnic
groups--each one being the master of this land, and their mother
tongues the languages of Taiwan. Whether an individual identifies
with Taiwan or the Republic of China, per se, any such professed
expression of national identity is a testament to one's loyalty
towards this country; and such an expression should not be distorted
or misused to divide the people. Rather, let mutual respect,
understanding and acceptance prevail despite our divergent views.
</P>
<P>
The sovereignty of the Republic of China is vested with the 23
million people of Taiwan. The Republic of China is Taiwan, and Taiwan
is the Republic of China. This is an indisputable fact.
</P>
<P>
Today, in many corners of the world, Taiwan's agricultural,
technical and medical missions are making remarkable contributions,
as Taiwan dedicates itself to active participation in the
international community, offering economic aid and humanitarian
assistance; for we believe that "one with moral integrity will never
be devoid of good neighbors," as Confucius says.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the United Nations (UN) will celebrate its 60th
anniversary. At a time when expectations for the reform and
consolidation of the UN system rise high in the international
community, and a sense of urgency felt for expanding international
participation, it is most misfortunate and unfair that the UN--an
international organization that vows to adhere to the values of "
peace, respect, equality and friendship," and claims to uphold the "
principle of universality of membership"--continues to exclude the 23
million people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Resolution 2758 of the 1971 UN General Assembly addresses the
issue of representation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in
the UN and relevant organizations. However, it never endows the PRC
any right to "represent the people of Taiwan." It is essential that
Resolution 2785 should not be wrongly used as an excuse to exclude
Taiwan from the UN system. Misusing this resolution to obstruct the
participation of Taiwan people not only violates the UN Charter, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and other international human
rights principles; it is also the greatest irony to the principle of
"universality of membership."
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan--a country of 36,000 square kilometers with effective
governance and a sound political system--sovereignty is vested with
the people, who enjoy full freedoms and human rights. With a foreign
reserve of over 230 billion USD and an average annual income per
capita of approximately 14,000 USD, Taiwan also ranks as the 15th
largest trading country in the world. A member of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and other international organizations, Taiwan has
endeavored to participate effectively in the international arena.
There is no reason that the 23 million people of Taiwan should
continue to be " politically isolated" and remain as international
nomads without due acknowledgement.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan must stand tall on the international stage, with parity
and dignity. This is a wish shared by the 23 million people of
Taiwan. In the same spirit, it is the yearning of each of our fellow
citizens to see our national flag raised and our national anthem
played in the Olympic award ceremony. It is but a simple wish that
should never be ignored by any member of civilized societies nor met
with flagrant attitude that retorts: "nobody cares about you!"
</P>
<P>
The people of Taiwan have together created a miraculous era of
economic growth and authored the glorious history of democratic
reforms. However, the greatest responsibility of our generation is to
provide for the coming generations a future of "peace and security"
and "sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
It is self-evident that our economic achievements and democratic
accomplishments can only prevail if our national security is well
ensured. As an old adage goes, "One shall be famished if one awaits
indolently for the merciful provision of nature; and one shall be
defeated if one relies on others to fight his battle." Only if we
remain resolute in our determination to defend ourselves and build up
sufficient defense capabilities can we ensure peace across the Taiwan
Strait and security for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The threat of military force poses the greatest "shadows of
terror" and " forces of darkness" across the Taiwan Strait. At
present, there are more than 600 ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan,
and the numbers grow by 50 to 75 missiles each year--a serious threat
that neither the Taiwan people nor the international society can
afford to look on idly. These "shadows of terror" and "forces of
darkness" not only directly threaten the peaceful status quo of the
Taiwan Strait, they also undermine regional stability and global
security.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is pleased to witness the steady progress, reforms and
peaceful emergence of China. We also extend our best wishes to the
other side of the Strait as it prepares for the 2008 Beijing
Olympics; and we hope that it will be a successful event conducted in
accordance with the Olympic spirits of peace and equality.
Nevertheless, the international community should be wary of and yet
hope for the emergence of China to be accompanied by a "peaceful
awakening", rather than a hegemony of belligerence and aggression.
</P>
<P>
In my inaugural address on May 20th of this year, I sincerely
called for leaders on both sides of the Strait, with the new century
upon us, to heed the new trend of regional integration and global
partnership, and to adopt a brand new frame of mind and together take
a fresh, unparalleled approach in addressing future cross-strait
issues. If both sides are willing, on the basis of goodwill, to
create an environment engendered upon "peaceful development and
freedom of choice," then in the future, the Republic of China and the
People's Republic of China--or Taiwan and China--can seek to
establish political relations in any form whatsoever. We would not
exclude any possibility, so long as there is the consent of the 23
million people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
I would like to reaffirm the promises and principles set forth in
my inaugural speech. Those commitments will be honored during my
presidency. We are aware of the recent transfer of power and
personnel reshuffling on the other side of the Strait. We hope that,
with greater wisdom, both sides could create better opportunities for
new development on cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Past experiences have shown that military threats and
constricting Taiwan's international space will only further distance
people on either side of the Strait. Belligerent and hostile rhetoric
simply cannot improve mutual trust and understanding. "Cross-strait
relations are not necessarily a zero-sum game, there will never be a
winner unless it's a win-win situation for both sides." I believe the
fourth-generation leadership on the other side of the Strait should
be able to fully understand this point.
</P>
<P>
On many issues, the governments and the peoples on both sides of
the Strait hold different views--some of which result from the
absence of communication. In light of this, I have, on many
occasions, proposed that, based on the existing foundation, both
sides should promote the resumption of cross-strait dialogue and
communication channel, so as to reduce the gap between the two sides
and to construct a foundation of mutual trust. Today, I would like to
take the initiative to propose that both sides use the basis of the
1992 meeting in Hong Kong, to seek possible schemes that are "not
necessarily perfect but acceptable", as preparation of a step forward
in the resumption of dialogue and consultation.
</P>
<P>
Any conflict in the Taiwan Strait could result in irreparable
damages to the peoples on both sides. Therefore, I propose that both
sides should seriously consider the issue of "arms control" and take
concrete actions to reduce tension and military threats across the
Taiwan Strait. Not too long ago, Taiwan's initiative to cancel the
Han-kuang military exercise originally scheduled for last September
was based on such deliberation. We believe only when both sides are
committed to exercising restraint and avoiding any action that might
further complicate the situation or induce conflicts, can we ensure
that cross-strait relations develop on a peaceful and stable path. In
the long term, both sides should formally end the state of hostility
across the Taiwan Strait and establish confidence-building measures
through consultations and dialogues. Furthermore, we should review
the armament policies of both sides and seek to establish the "Code
of Conduct across the Taiwan Strait" as the tangible guarantee of
permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
At present, both sides are dedicated to pursuing economic
development and social stability; both are facing a critical time and
opportune moment of transition. The strategy for cross-strait economy
and trade in this age of globalization is in accordance with our
mindset of peaceful development. If we can reduce the risk of
investment in the China market and clearly establish the division of
labor in the global supply chain, a new cross-strait economic and
trade relations--both competitive and collaborative--can be gradually
formed. Meanwhile, Taiwan must expedite its economic transformation,
promote development within Taiwan, reaching out to the world,
increase comprehensive strength, and disperse risks, so as to
effectively utilize the opportunities of cross-strait economic
development. The executive branch is currently formulating a plan
that provides convenient and efficient means to facilitate chartered
flights for passengers and cargo. It is our earnest hope that
cross-strait consultations can begin as soon as possible, so as to
seek further progress in the Three Link policy.
</P>
<P>
Distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, "Unite Taiwan,
stabilize cross- strait relations, seek social harmony, and
reinvigorate the economy"-these are not only my commitments to the
people of Taiwan; they are also responsibilities that all political
parties must shoulder together. The impending legislative election at
the end of this year presents us an opportunity, as well as a
challenge. Therefore, I hope that all political parties will hold a
sensible campaign based on goodwill and rational competition--so as
to open a new era for post-election politics and to give Taiwan a
chance to attain lasting unity, stability, peace, and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
I hereby offer my pledge that upon the completion of the year-end
legislative election, I will, with utmost sincerity, invite leaders
from all political parties to collaborate in the following
undertakings: establish a Committee for Cross-strait Peace and
Development; forge ahead with the constitutional reform project; and
tackle national policy issues that are of vital importance to the
people. We will seek to reach a majority consensus, based on which,
both the governing and opposition parties can make a critical
contribution to the enduring political stability and sustainable
development of our country.
</P>
<P>
Dear fellow citizens, let me now share with you about a new
documentary, based on real stories of post-921 earthquake
restorations; it is called Life. Like many people who have seen the
documentary, I was moved to tears by these amazing stories of
resiliency. Those tears were not a mere commiseration to lament the
tragic loss of so many people; instead, they were kindred emotions
shared by all who witnessed such display of strength and the power of
healing. What this documentary captures is not merely poignant
stories of 921, but also an evocative narrative commemorating Taiwan
and those who build their lives on this land, whose courage and
strength weave a remarkable story of triumph.
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, life may sometimes seem like passing through a dark
and windy tunnel, where we find ourselves confronted by numerous
setbacks and tribulations; at times, the future seems inexorably
bleak as if we have reached the end of the road. Yet, marching on, we
must and we will, with an unrelenting vitality that is our beacon of
hope until we emerge into the light at the end of the tunnel. On this
National Day, I encourage all of you to personally experience this
powerful film and to never relinquish opportunities to meet life's
challenges with fortitude. For the future of our country, we will
stride forward in unity to author a glorious new chapter for "The
Story of Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
In closing, let me wish the Republic of China a Happy Birthday.
May our great nation enjoy peace and everlasting prosperity.
Distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, I extend to you my
warmest wishes for good health and much success in all your
endeavors. Thank you!

PRESIDENT ADVOCATES CROSS-STRAIT 'CODE OF CONDUCT'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian proposed Sunday
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait seriously consider the issue of
"arms control, " and seek to establish a "code of conduct across the
Taiwan Strait" as a tangible guarantee of permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
In his 2004 National Day address at a rally in front of the
Presidential Office, President Chen stressed that any conflict in the
Taiwan Strait would result in irreparable damage to the people on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, both sides should seriously consider the
issue of "arms control" and take concrete steps to reduce tension and
military threats across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, he noted, both sides should formally end the
state of hostility across the Taiwan Strait and establish
confidence-building measures through consultations and dialogues.

"Furthermore, we should review the armament policies of both
sides and seek to establish a 'code of conduct across the Taiwan
Strait' as a tangible guarantee of permanent peace in the Taiwan
Strait," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said past experience has shown that Beijing's military
threats and schemes to constrict Taiwan's international profile will
only further distance people on either side of the Strait from each
other.
</P>
<P>
Belligerent and hostile rhetoric simply cannot improve mutual
trust and understanding, and cross-strait relations are not
necessarily a zero-sum game, he said, adding that there will never be
a winner unless it's a win-win situation for both sides.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the fourth-generation leadership on the other side of
the Strait should be able to fully understand this point," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's cancellation of the "Han Kuang" military exercise
originally scheduled for last September was based on setting a tone
for " arms control, " which will reduce tension and military threats
across the Strait, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that only when both sides are committed to exercising
restraint and avoiding any action that might further complicate the
situation or induce conflict, can we ensure that cross-strait
relations develop on a peaceful and stable path," Chen reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president stressed that it is self-evident that
Taiwan's economic achievements and democratic accomplishments can
only prevail if its national security is well ensured.
</P>
<P>
Using parables as examples, the president said that "a man will
starve if he stubbornly waits for a gift from nature, " and that "a
person will be defeated if he expects others to fight his battles for
him."
</P>
<P>
Chen told his fellow citizens that, "Only if we remain resolute
in our determination to defend ourselves and build up sufficient
defense capabilities can we ensure peace across the Taiwan Strait and
security for Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The threat of military force poses the greatest "shadow of
terror" and is a "force of darkness" across the Taiwan Strait, he
added.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, there are more than 600 ballistic missiles
on Chinese soil targeting Taiwan, and the number grows by 50 to 75
missiles each year -- a serious threat that neither Taiwan nor the
international community can overlook.
</P>
<P>
These "shadows of terror" and "forces of darkness" not only
directly threaten the peaceful status quo in the Taiwan Strait, they
also undermine regional stability and global security, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is pleased to see the steady progress, reforms and
peaceful emergence of China, he said, adding, "We also extend our
best wishes to the other side of the Strait as it prepares for the
2008 Beijing Olympics, and we hope that it will be a successful event
conducted in accordance in the Olympic spirits of peace and equality.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the international community should be wary of and
yet hopeful for the emergence of China to be accompanied by a
'peaceful awakening, ' rather than a hegemony of belligerence and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
"In my inaugural address on May 20th of this year, I sincerely
called for leaders on both sides of the Strait, with the new century
upon us, to heed the new trend of regional integration and global
partnership and to adopt a brand new frame of mind and together take
a fresh, unparalleled approach in addressing future cross-strait
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If both sides are willing, on the basis of goodwill, to create
an environment engendered upon 'peaceful development and freedom of
choice, ' then in the future, the Republic of China and the People's
Republic of China -- or Taiwan and China -- can seek to establish
political relations in any form whatsoever. We do not exclude any
possibility, so long as it comes with the consent of the 23 million
people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to reaffirm the promises and principles set forth
in my inaugural speech. Those commitments will be honored during my
presidency. We are aware of the recent transfer of power and
personnel reshuffling on the other side of the Strait. We hope that,
with greater wisdom, both sides can create better opportunities for
new developments in cross-strait relations," he said.

CHEN URGES END OF DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION, U.N. EXCLUSION OF TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian highlighted Sunday
Taiwan's unfair treatment in the international arena in his Oct. 10
National Day speech, saying that the U. N.'s misuse of Resolution
2758 in 1971 had led to Taiwan's exclusion from the world body.
</P>
<P>
Chen strongly lamented Taiwan's exclusion from the U. N.,
stressing that "it is essential that Resolution 2758 should not be
wrongly used as an excuse to exclude Taiwan from the U. N. system."
</P>
<P>
Resolution 2758 only addressed the issue of representation of the
People's Republic of China (PRC) at the U. N. and its affiliated
organizations, but that "it never endowed the PRC with any right to
represent the people of Taiwan," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 2758 should not be used wrongly to keep Taiwan out of
the U.N. system, a situation that the president said has violated the
U.N. Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The lack of representation of Taiwan's 23 million people at the
U. N. is an obvious and regrettable contradiction to the values of
peace, respect, equality and friendship that it promotes across the
globe, he pointed out, adding that obstructing the participation of
Taiwan's people also goes against other international human rights
principles and the principle of "universality of membership."
</P>
<P>
At a time when the international community has high expectations
for sweeping reforms and consolidation at the U. N., there is no
reason for Taiwan -- the world's 15th-largest economy and a sound
democracy commonly shared and vested by its people -- to be
continuously isolated in international society, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decades, Taiwan's contribution to the world has
never stopped, evidence in that its agricultural, medical, technical
and humanitarian groups scattered across the globe are working
relentlessly to assist their host countries, he said, because the
Taiwan people strongly believe in a Confucius saying: "One with moral
integrity will never be devoid of good neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan prides itself on standing tall on the world stage with
dignity and parity, and this is a common aspiration of all its 23
million people, he said.

DPP SEES PRESIDENT CHEN'S PEACE OVERTURE AS MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's proposal Sunday
to reopen cross-strait dialogue based on the "1992 talks in Hong
Kong" marked a major breakthrough in Taiwan's cross-strait policy, a
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) stalwart said.
</P>
<P>
In his National Day address, President Chen said that the
governments and the people on both sides of the Strait hold different
views -- some of which result from the absence of communications.
</P>
<P>
"In light of this, I have, on many occasions, proposed that,
based on the existing foundation, both sides should promote the
resumption of cross-strait dialogue and communications to narrow the
gap between the two sides and to lay a foundation for mutual trust, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I would like to take the initiative to propose that both
sides use the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong to seek possible
ways that are 'not necessarily perfect but acceptable, ' as
preparations for a step forward in the resumption of dialogue and
consultations," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Previously the ruling DPP attached little significance to the
"1992 talks in Hong Kong" that the former Kuomintang-ruled government
called "the 1992 consensus, " whose main concept was that both sides
agreed to the "one China" principle but with their own
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
This tacit understanding had enabled negotiators from both sides
to hold several rounds of talks on cross-strait exchanges until July
1995 when Beijing unilaterally suspended the talks after
then-President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark visit to the United
States in June the same year.
</P>
<P>
Relations became even icier after Lee proclaimed his "two states"
theory on July 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on President Chen's National Day proposal by referring
to the " 1992 talks in Hong Kong, " Tsai Huang-liang, a DPP party
whip at the Legislative Yuan, said that the president has once again
held out an olive branch to Beijing, and the move, he said, deserves
a reciprocal response of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
Tsai also called for the opposition parties to cooperate with the
governing DPP, of which President Chen is also chairman.
</P>
<P>
In the face of a multitude of challenges in cross-strait
relations, Tsai said the governing and the opposition parties cannot
afford any partisanship.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Tsai said that the opposition should stand with the
DPP to establish a "committee for cross-strait peace and development"
after the Dec. 11 legislative elections as President Chen advocated
in his National Day address.
</P>
<P>
"Only by joining hands and demonstrating esprit de corps can the
country be strong," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a party luminary of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU),
an ally of the DPP, commented Sunday that President Chen's peace
overture "did not break new ground since the president, and Taiwan
for that matter, has limited maneuvering room."
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now in Beijing's court, " said Huang Tsung-yuan, a
TSU party whip at the Legislative Yuan. "It all hinges on the Chinese
leadership as to whether and how cross-strait dialogue will be
reopened," he said.

PRESIDENT PLEDGES TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian pledged Sunday to
promote the sustainable use of natural resources and to conserve
energy.
</P>
<P>
In his National Day message delivered at the Presidential Office,
the president said that economic development is more than the
accumulation of material wealth and has much to do with improving the
quality of life, as well as establishing a more humane and
ecologically balanced environment.
</P>
<P>
The destructive earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999 prompted everyone to
think seriously about how to live at peace with nature and the havoc
wreaked by subsequent typhoons and torrential rains reminded us of
the importance and urgency of land conservation and environmental
protection, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection and the use of resources are two sides
of the same coin, he stressed, saying that, "In the future, we will
bring new life to the land by shifting the focus of national land-use
planning from utilitarian development to sustainable use and
conservation."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the country's energy policy, Chen said that in the
face of steadily rising oil prices, it is time to promote
comprehensive energy conservation, as well as to develop and adopt
the use of alternative or renewable energies.
</P>
<P>
"We must strive for an energy policy more finely in tune with
environmental protection and the sustainable use of natural
resources," he said.

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT TALKS ON "THREE-LINKS"
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called for talks
on direct "three-links" between Taiwan and mainland China as soon as
possible on the Republic of China's National Day on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In his address delivered at the 2004 National Day rally held in
front of the Presidential Office, Chen noted that the executive
branch is currently formulating a plan to provide convenient and
efficient ways to facilitate charter flights for passengers and
cargo.
</P>
<P>
"It is our earnest hope that cross-strait consultations can begin
as soon as possible to seek further progress in the 'three-link'
policy," Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said the
president's address extended considerable goodwill to mainland China,
and if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can therefore begin talks
and realize the "three-links," economic and trade development on both
sides can prosper.
</P>
<P>
Given the frequent cross-strait economic and trade interactions,
the Chinese market will continue to have a high degree of political
risk if talks cannot begin, MOEA officials warned.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the civil aviation industry echoed the
president's words by expressing the hope that direct air
transportation can be established as soon as possible between Taiwan
and China, which they said could save a great deal in transportation
costs between the two sides and thus accelerate cross-strait
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Currently, carriers operating flights between Taiwan and mainland
China are required to stop at a third place -- Hong Kong or Macau --
since direct cross-strait air links are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
Officials of China Airlines and EVA Airways Corp. said they will
do whatever the government stipulates, and said that they hope that
detailed regulations can be drawn up soon.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed the hope that the Chinese government can
respond positively to President Chen's appeals.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwanese businessmen make a total of four million
visits between Taiwan and China via Hong Kong a year, the officials
said the additional cost spent by passengers for interruption in
travel is about NT$30 billion (US$884 million).
</P>
<P>
Figure in the additional costs for the aviation industry, and
indirect cross-strait air transport increases the total transport
cost by NT$100 billion, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
They called for an early implementation of convenient transport
between the two sides to reduce the costs in time and money.

PRESIDENT PLEDGES POST-ELECTION MEETING WITH POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang )
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aiming to forge a national consensus on
political stability, constitutional reform and cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that he will invite
political leaders to discuss these major issues of national concern
after the December legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the pledge in an address he delivered at Oct. 10
National Day rally held in the square in front of the Presidential
Office.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a new political atmosphere and sustainable security
and prosperity, Chen said that he will do his utmost to invite
leaders of various political parties for discussions on the issues of
vital significance to the country's long-term development, including
setting up a committee for cross-strait peace and development,
building social harmony and launching a constitutional re-engineering
task force.
</P>
<P>
The president said the proposed meeting will be held in a
non-partisan effort to create cooperation for the country's long-term
progress. This is a goal to be jointly shared by all political
parties, he added.
</P>
<P>
In terms of cross-strait ties in particular, he said, "If both
sides are willing, on the basis of goodwill, to create an environment
engendered upon peaceful development and freedom of choice, then in
the future, the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China
-- or Taiwan and China -- can seek to establish political relations
in any form whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
"We would not exclude any possibility, so long as there is the
consent of the 23 million people of Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to Chen's initiative, Tsai Cheng-yuan, spokesman for
the prime opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , said that the party will
decide whether to take part in a cross-strait peace committee after
concrete measures are put forward.
</P>
<P>
To create a favorable climate for negotiations on matters of
major national concern, Tsai urged Chen to stop balking at the
operations of a truth investigation commission, which was created and
passed by the opposition-controlled legislature to look into the
March 19 shooting of the president.
</P>
<P>
Tsai also attacked a government plan to purchase NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) in defensive weapons from the United States under
the pretext of national security, calling it a result of the pork
barrel policies adopted by the administration led by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.

NOTHING NEW IN PRESIDENT'S DOUBLE TEN ADDRESS: LIEN CHAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Sunday that President Chen Shui-bian's proposal for the
reopening of cross-strait dialogue based on the "1992 talks in Hong
Kong" was nothing new.
</P>
<P>
What President Chen referred to as the "1992 talks in Hong Kong"
is what the former ruling party and now opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
called the "1992 consensus."
</P>
<P>
The main concept of the "1992 consensus" was that under the
principle of "one China, " both sides could have their own rhetorical
interpretations of the word "China," Lien added.
</P>
<P>
Lien stressed that what is important is that leaders from both
sides sincerely seek peace and stability across the Strait to allow
the people to lead peaceful and stable lives.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait peace and stability can never be achieved simply by
seeking to re-name the country, talking about writing a new
constitution or by provoking mainland China, Lien asserted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the KMT legislative caucus praised President Chen's
proposal for the resumption of cross-strait dialogue as well as the
establishment of a "committee for cross-strait peace and
development."
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said
that President Chen's peace overture spelled out on National Day was
positive and useful in efforts to alleviate cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
Tseng, nevertheless, did not hide his doubts about Chen's
sincerity and about the feasibility of his plans.
</P>
<P>
It is patently contradictory that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party ( DPP) has schemed to seek Taiwan independence over
the past four years on the one hand while vowing to improve
cross-strait relations on the other, Tseng said.
</P>
<P>
The president's statements have always been a mix of comforting
promises and provocative rhetoric, which indicate the government's
wavering stance, Tseng added.
</P>
<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP) also welcomed President
Chen's proposal Sunday on the establishment of a "committee for
cross-strait peace and development."
</P>
<P>
PFP spokesman Huang Yi-chiao said that although the proposal is
constructive, it may end up as just empty rhetoric, given that there
are no laws governing its establishment or operations.
</P>
<P>
Huang suggested that the legislature follow the suggestion made
by PFP Chairman James Soong several days ago that a cross-strait
peace bill be passed into law.
</P>
<P>
The tiny opposition New Party confirmed that President Chen's
National Day proposal is a positive approach in efforts to redress
the cross-strait political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, President Chen will be firm and clear in his proposal
and will substantiate it with concrete actions soon, New Party
Legislator Wu Cheng-dian said.
</P>
<P>
The last thing the people want to see is that the proposal is
just another smokescreen like those President Chen has often used
before, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I would like to take the initiative to propose that both
sides use the basis of the '1992 meeting in Hong Kong' to seek
possible ways that are 'not necessarily perfect but acceptable, ' as
preparations for a step forward in the resumption of dialogue and
consultations," President Chen said in his National Day address.
</P>
<P>
The president also pledged that he will invite, with utmost
sincerity, leaders from all political parties upon the completion of
the December legislative elections to the "committee for cross-strait
peace and development."

ROC NATIONAL DAY OBSERVED IN HONG KONG

Some 1,200 guests from Hong Kong's
political, cultural and media sectors, as well as Taiwanese
expatriates living, participated in a rally Sunday to celebrate the
Republic of China's Oct. 10 National Day.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the new ROC Representative in Hong Kong Bao
Cheng-kang, who has not arrived in Hong Kong to assume his post,
Chang Chih-yu, an official of the Chung Hwa Travel Service, the de
facto ROC representative office in Hong Kong, noted at the occasion
that the close Taiwan-Hong Kong relations were being reflected not
only in the annual bilateral trade worth US$30 billion, but also in
the mutual investment and personnel exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Taiwanese businessmen made investments worth more than
US$600 million in Hong Kong, with the number of Taiwan companies
listed in the former British colony exceeding 3,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of visits made by Taiwan people to Hong
Kong reached 1.7 million, Chang added.
</P>
<P>
However, Chang noted that Taiwan-Hong Kong relations are not
balanced, with too few Hong Kong investments and travelers to Taiwan,
which indicates that there is still a lot of room for development in
this regard for both sides.
</P>
<P>
Chang expressed the hope that Taiwan and Hong Kong can establish
solid partnerships in the future to contribute more to the people of
both sides.

PRIVATE SECTOR MIXED ON PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's Oct. 10 National
Day speech on cross-Taiwan Strait ties drew mixed reactions Sunday
from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tiao-chun, secretary-general of the Council for Industrial
and Commercial Development (CICD) , said that the local business
community thinks positively of Chen's remarks in terms of Taiwan's
relations with mainland China and believes that the president's
address will be helpful in improving bilateral ties by mentioning the
"basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Chen proposed in the speech that Taiwan and mainland China use
the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong to seek possible ways that
are "not necessarily perfect but acceptable" as preparations for
steps forward in the resumption of dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that the executive branch is currently crafting a
plan that provides convenient and swift means to facilitate charter
flights for passengers and cargo.
</P>
<P>
Wang hailed the president's address as taking the initiative to
display goodwill to the mainland and said that this should help build
a positive course in the development of cross-strait ties and break
the current impasse between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Shu Sheng-hsiung, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers Association, echoed Wang's views and praised
Chen's statement as a "good beginning."
</P>
<P>
Shu said that opening direct transport links is urgent and vital
to maintaining Taiwan's competitiveness and a failure to set up the
links will seriously hurt economic development on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Chao Chun-shan, a veteran mainland affairs hand and a professor
at Tamkang University, claimed that the president's statement will do
nothing to help bring about a breakthrough in Taiwan-mainland
interaction because it has shunted the "one China" core principle
that Beijing has insisted upon.
</P>
<P>
The president's speech may temporarily reduce tensions between
the two sides, but bilateral ties are difficult to improve, as
Beijing is highly skeptical of Chen's words and deeds, Chao pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Liao Ta-chi, a professor at National Sun Yat-sen University, said
that she doubts very much that Chen's rhetoric will soften the stance
of the hardline Beijing regime.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shien-chi, a keen activist of the Alliance to Campaign for
Rectifying the Name of Taiwan, urged the president to stop extending
an olive branch to Beijing without reciprocity and parity. The "one
China" precondition will paint Taiwan into a corner, he argued.

against terrorism and has taken steps to prevent terrorists from
laundering money in Taiwan.

evaluation examination for people with a junior high school education

Confucius' lesson of the day: "It is only he in this world who is
possessed of absolute truth that can order and adjust the great
relations of human society, fix the fundamental principles of
morality, and understand the laws of creation of the Universe."

U.S. WELCOMES CHEN'S PEACE OVERTURE TO BEIJING IN NATIONAL DAY SPEECH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department expressed
welcome Sunday to President Chen Shui-bian's peace overture to
Beijing spelled out in his Oct. 10 National Day speech calling for a
reopening of cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman said Chen's message was constructive
and creative in terms of reducing tensions and increasing prospects
for resuming dialogue across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The United States urges Taiwan and the People's Republic of China
to grasp opportunities to restart cross-strait dialogue, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The State Department official said that the U.S. policies have
remained unchanged -- namely firmly supporting the "one China"
policy, not supporting Taiwan independence and opposing any moves by
either side that would change the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States has been consistent in its stance
that the cross-strait differences should be solved in a peaceful way
that is acceptable to the people of both sides.
</P>
<P>
President Chen took the initiative to display goodwill toward
Beijing by proposing in his speech Sunday that Taiwan and mainland
China use the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong to seek possible
schemes that are "not necessarily perfect but acceptable" as steps
toward a resumption of dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Chen also called for the two sides to seriously consider the
issue of "arms control" and seek to establish a "code of conduct
across the Taiwan Strait" as a tangible guarantee of permanent peace
since "any conflict in the Taiwan Strait would result in irreparable
damage to the people on both sides."

BANGLADESH PREPARING TO SEND LABORERS TO TAIWAN: CLA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The South Asian country of Bangladesh is
preparing to export laborers to Taiwan to work, sources from the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health has given its consent to a list of
hospitals recommended by Bangladesh's public health and labor affairs
agencies to allow potential Bangladeshi workers to have health
check-ups prior to their journey to Taiwan, CLA officials said.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Bangladesh opens its liaison office in Taiwan, the CLA
will give the green-light to open Taiwan's doors to Bangladeshi
laborers, the CLA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan maintains a representative office in Bangladesh, while the
Bangladeshi government is planning to open one in Taiwan, although no
definite timetable has been set.
</P>
<P>
CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu paid a five-day visit to Bangladesh in
August this year. During her stay, Chen and her entourage met with
senior Bangladeshi officials to discuss the procedures for importing
Bangladeshi workers and feasible labor cooperation formula,
particularly in designing of vocational training programs and
cultivation of labor training instructors.
</P>
<P>
With a population of more than 131 million, Bangladesh has rich
manpower resources.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh will become the newest source of foreign laborers in
Taiwan. At present, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and
Mongolia export laborers to Taiwan. Mongolia sent its first batch of
workers to the island in May of this year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, because it failed to work in tune with the CLA's
request to cut the exorbitant brokerage fees charged by employment
agencies in the Southeast Asian country, has not been allowed to
export laborers to Taiwan since Aug. 1, 2002.

Swazi Prime Minister Absalom Dlamini said
Monday his country will do whatever it can to help Taiwan join the
United Nations and other major international organizations.
</P>
<P>
In terms of its population, democratic development and economic
prosperity, Dlamini said, Taiwan deserves a U.N. seat.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini, who arrived in Taipei Friday to attend the Republic of
China's Oct. 10 National Day celebrations, made the remarks after
President Chen Shui-bian decorated him with the Order of Brilliant
Star with Special Grand Cordon in recognition of his contributions to
the promotion of Taiwan-Swaziland ties.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan and Swaziland have shared values, Dlamini said
the two countries have for long cooperated closely in various fields,
including public health, education, handicrafts, tourism,
agriculture, investment promotion, information sharing and
technological development. Dlamini expressed gratitude for Taiwan's
long-term assistance in Swaziland's national development.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini further said his country is now undergoing social and
political transformation. As a developing country, the southern
African kingdom is facing many challenges. Dlamini said he hopes
Taiwan can continue to be Swaziland's working partner in addressing
all these challenges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Dlamini, the work to write a new Swazi
constitution is entering the final stage.
</P>
<P>
"I hope our new constitution can be put into force next year. To
the best of my understanding, the ROC is also reviewing its existing
constitution. We can learn from each other in this regard, " Dlamini
said.

TAIWAN MUST CONTINUE TO BEEF UP DEFENSES UNTIL TRUST IS BUILT: WANG

<P>
Taiwan must continue to beef up its
defensive capabilities through the purchase of arms until
cross-strait mutual trust on arms control efforts is established,
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Before the two sides engage in talks on arms control and reach an
understanding in this matter, it is imperative for Taiwan to continue
to strengthen its military defenses, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks in response to President Chen Shui-bian's

<P>
However, he stressed that Chen must demonstrate his sincerity in
pushing for the implementation of these proposals so as to help build
trust across the strait.

Only when mutual trust is built can Taiwan expect to see a
resumption in cross-strait dialogue, Wang added.

TAIWAN, VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS LABOR EXPORT POLICIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Labor affairs officials from Vietnam are
scheduled to meet with their Taiwan counterparts in Taipei Wednesday
to discuss labor export issues, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The main topic of the meeting is expected to be the issue of
Vietnamese laborers absconding while in Taiwan. Although Vietnam is
not the largest source of foreign laborers in Taiwan, Vietnamese
workers top the list in terms of number of absconders who had not yet
been found as of the end of September, the CLA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said a possible freeze on the import of Vietnamese
laborers might be adopted, probably in mid-October, if a report on
this group of people for the July-September period shows that the
situation has not improved.
</P>
<P>
According to CLA talles, 7,900 out of the some 72,000 Vietnamese
workers currently in Taiwan have absconded, for a rate of 9.39
percent. The rate for Vietnamese workers was also the highest among
all foreign laborers as of the end of August in terms of nationality,
followed by that for Philippine workers at 2.5 percent and Thai
laborers at 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CLA in May of this year suspended the introduction of
Vietnamese fishermen and fishing boat crew members into Taiwan, also
in response to the group's high absconding rate.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan had about 302,000 legal foreign laborers at the end of
June, with 102,000 from Thailand, 86,000 from the Philippines, 72,000
from Vietnam, 40,000 from Indonesia, 36 from Mongolia and 22 from
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, because it failed to work in tune with the CLA's
request to cut the exorbitant brokerage fees charged by employment
agencies in its country, has not been allowed to export any laborers
to Taiwan since Aug. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector has absorbed the largest number of
foreign laborers, followed by the caregiving sector and the
construction industry. A few thousands of these foreign laborers
serve as maids.

UNI AIRWAYS INAUGURATES MATSU-TAICHUNG, MATSU-KAOHSIUNG FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Matsu,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Air traffic between Taiwan proper and the
frontline island of Matsu has become more convenient with UNI Airways
inaugurating flight services between Matsu and two major Taiwan
cities -- Taichung and Kaohsiung, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
UNI Airways, an affiliate of Evergreen Group, made its maiden
flight from Taichung in central Taiwan to Matsu's Nankan Airport
Monday and will inaugurate its flight between Kaohsiung in southern
Taiwan and Nankan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The carrier held a ceremony celebrating the inauguration of the
two new air routes Monday at Nankan Airport in Matsu, with the
participation of Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng, Lienchiang County Magistrate Chen
Hsueh-sheng and other local government officials and elected
representatives.
</P>
<P>
UNI is the only carrier that operates regular flight services to
the island group of Matsu, which lies closer to the southeastern
mainland Chinese province of Fujian than to Taiwan. As it originally
only plied the Taipei-Nankan and Taipei-Peikan routes, residents in
the central and southern parts of the island had to travel to Taipei
to take flights to Matsu.
</P>
<P>
From now on, UNI will operate one round-trip Taichung-Nankan
flight on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday as well as one
round-trip Kaohsiung-Nankan flight on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Legislator Tsao Yuan-chang,
who represents the Matsu constituency, said he hopes direct flight
services between the two Taiwan-held offshore defense outposts of
Kinmen and Matsu can be opened in the future.
</P>
<P>
Tsao further said he will also push for the opening of direct
flights between Matsu and Fujian Province's Mawei port. Tsao said
that although direct Matsu-Mawei shipping services have opened as
part of the "mini three links" across the Taiwan Strait, a voyage
between the two places takes one hour and 45 minutes. It will take
less than 20 minutes if flight services are permitted, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In response, CAA Director Chang said direct Kinmen-Matsu flights
are not likely to be opened for now because both islands are located
within mainland China's 15-mile territorial airspace.
</P>
<P>
As to Matsu-Mawei direct flights, Chang said cross-strait
negotiations are required.

DISFIGURED CHINESE-MALAYSIAN WOMAN RECEIVING TREATMENT IN TAIWAN

<P>
Chinese-Malaysian citizen Chang Si-mei, who
suffers from congenital lamellar ichthyosis, an autosomal recessive
disorder which can cause severe disfigurement, has come to Taiwan for
treatment of skin cancer, medical sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 47, has checked into Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in
Linko, Taipei County, where doctors are treating the cancer in her
left foot, Chang Gung officials said.
</P>
<P>
Chang has planned to stay for two months on her third trip to
Taiwan since 1992 when she first came to receive treatment and
plastic surgery for the disfigurement caused by lamellar ichthyosis.
Her second visit Taiwan came in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chang had confined herself to her tiny cottage room in Malaysia
before the age of 35. She was discovered unexpectedly by Taiwan
writer Po Yang in 1992 during a journey to Malaysia. After extensive
media coverage, Chang was invited to Taiwan the same year to receive
medical treatment at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital which enabled her
to return to society.
</P>
<P>
During her current stay in Taiwan, Chang said she plans to meet
several "old friends, " including Master Cheng Yen, founder of the
Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, Taiwan's largest
charity organization. She also plans to visit the Taipei 101, the
world's tallest building.

TAIWAN HOPES TO DEVELOP CAPACITY TO LAUNCH SATELLITES

<TEXT>
<P>
The government is currently assessing
whether Taiwan will be able to launch satellites itself, Wu Mao-kun,
chairman of the National Science Council (NSC), said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks when he was fielding questions at the
Science-Technology and Information Committee in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Legislators asked if the development of vehicles to launch
satellites such as ROCSAT-II, which was developed by the National
Space Program Office and launched in California in April this year,
have other than scientific purposes.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the development of a launch vehicle for satellites aims
to develop the country's aeronautics program. The NSC has in the
past cooperated with the military-run Chungshan Institute of Science
and Technology (CIST) for spacecraft research.
</P>
<P>
This time, it has asked the CIST and other specialists to assess
the feasibility of sending satellites to an orbit of 700 kilometers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that ROCSAT-II is mainly for scientific research. Whether
it can be used for national security or information gathering is up
to other government agencies, he said. However, if the NSC were to be
tasked with such missions, the council would work to that end, he
added.

EX-PRESIDENT PLANS TO DRAFT NEW CONSTITUTION FOR TAIWAN BY 2007
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui Monday
unveiled his plan to draft a "new Taiwan constitution" by 2007,
saying the Republic of China Constitution now used by the country is
trapping Taiwan in a "one China" pitfall.
</P>
<P>
Lee was delivering a speech entitled "Only if Taiwan enacts a new
constitution will Asia-Pacific stability be ensured" during a Taipei
seminar jointly organized by the Taiwan Advocates, a think tank
chaired by Lee, and two Japanese civic groups.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that Taiwan does not have a constitution
belonging to itself and is still using the "Constitution of the
Republic of China" which exhibits a wide gap with the political
realities of today.
</P>
<P>
At the time of its enactment, the Constitution covered a
territory that is now the People's Republic of China and Outer
Mongolia but not Taiwan, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Besides its incongruity with the status quo of Taiwan, the
Constitution is ensnaring Taiwan into a "one China" pitfall and
offering Beijing an excuse to declare to the international community
that the Taiwan question is one of its "internal affairs, " Lee
argued.
</P>
<P>
Lee said having been president for 12 years, he has a deep
feeling that the so-called "Republic of China" is nothing
internationally and is simply a non-existent entity like the
"emperor's new clothes" which Taiwan uses to fool itself.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he does not approve of President Chen Shui-bian's
remarks that "the Republic of China is Taiwan" and "Taiwan is the
Republic of China, " because Taiwan is deceiving itself and others by
using this description.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwanese people continue to be governed under the
"Republic of China" system, they will never be able to participate in
the international community and the instability across the Taiwan
Strait will carry on, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the Taiwanese people will be irresponsible to themselves
and their offspring as well as to peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region if they do not adopt a new constitution to
terminate this abnormal situation.
</P>
<P>
Accusing mainland China of being the origin of the crisis in
Asia, Lee said Beijing is threatening other countries against
supporting Taiwan and recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state, while
it is upgrading its coercive language toward the island from
"independence means war" to "refusing unification means war, " Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
Unless the Taiwanese people free themselves from the "one China"
framework formed by the Republic of China system, it will be
tantamount to the Taiwanese people acquiescing to Beijing's
territorial claim over Taiwan, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee emphasized that the "one China" framework maintained by the
Republic of China system is encouraging the mainland to invade
Taiwan, which he said would be the severest crisis across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the five-branch government under the ROC
Constitution does not fit a presidential or parliamentary system and
is hampering Taiwan's politics from operating normally.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Ching-hsiung, a professor of Japanese studies at Tamkang
University, said a new country needs to be built on Taiwan because
the Republic of China is not recognized by the world.
</P>
<P>
Enacting a new constitution and adopting a new name for the
country are the two essential parts of building a new country, Hsu
added.
</P>
<P>
Hsu criticized President Chen as being self-contradictory for
calling Taiwan and the mainland "one country on each side" but not
trying to join the United Nations in the name of a "new country."

Some 200 Israeli friends of the Republic
of China from the political, commercial, academic and media sectors
attended a cocktail party Sunday evening hosted by the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Tel Aviv to celebrate the Republic of
China's 93th National Day.
</P>
<P>
The dignitaries included Israel Knesset member Shaul Yahalom,
four parliamentarians, and a media advisor to Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, contact between Taiwan and Israel has gradually
increased, with official statistics showing a growing trend in terms
of trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
ROC Representative to Israel Teng Shen-shen cited statistics
released by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics and said that
during the period from January to July this year, two-way trade
between Taiwan and the Middle East country grew 62.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Israel's exports to Taiwan expanded 180 percent to US$294 million
during the period, while Taiwan's export to Israel increasing 31
percent to US$270 million, according to the statistics.
</P>

Teng also noted that his office issued a total of 1,786 visas to
Israelis last year, and from the beginning of this year to September
they have granted 2,467 Israelis permission to visit Taiwan.

NO IMMEDIATE PRICE HIKES FOR WATER, ELECTRICITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Water and electricity prices will not go up
in the short term to help stabilize domestic commodity prices, Vice
Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while fielding questions at a committee in
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that domestic water and electricity prices have been
low for a long time, and there is room for reasonable adjustments,
but in the future. Electricity prices are also affected by rising
coal prices and the cost of generating electricity is rising.
</P>
<P>
If there is no adjustment, Taiwan Power Company could be in the
red to the tune of NT$9 billion (US$267.06 million) for the first
time next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said the recent surge in crude oil prices, as high as
US$52.68 a barrel, is a concern, but he said that after short-term
factors for the price spike recede, prices should better reflect
supply and demand, although the possibility of a dramatic decrease in
price is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the ministry will keep a close eye on the international
situation and oil price fluctuations to mitigate any adverse impacts
on the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that considering the fact that price hikes for water and
electricity will trigger price hikes in other industries and stoke
public worries about inflation, any price hikes will not be done
right away.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will consider the impact on the industry, the
tolerance level of the public as well as the sustainable development
of the water and electricity industries in its assessment of the
timing and level of price hikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the consumer price index in the first nine
months rose 1.54 percent, modest compared with other countries, and
attributed the hike to the surge in international crude oil prices,
as well as the short term factor of a series of typhoons that hit
Taiwan in the summer, causing prices hikes for fruits and vegetables.

PROSPECT OF CROSS-STRAIT TALKS RESUMING UNCERTAIN: U.S. EXPERT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-chi and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prospect for the resumption of
cross-strait dialogue remains uncertain despite President Chen
Shui-bian's latest offer since it failed to address the "one China"
precondition set by mainland China, an American expert on East Asian
affairs said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Alan Romberg, a senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center,
said it would be "wishful thinking" to believe that this precondition
will vanish, no matter how unreasonable it is.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen's proposal, however, does not address the
mainland's sole criterion for getting back to the table, and that is
acceptance of the current existence of 'one China,' even if each side
has a different way of defining that 'one China,'" Romberg said.
</P>
<P>
In his National Day address on Sunday, Chen proposed that Taipei
and Beijing resume their long-stalled dialogue based on the talks
that officials from both sides held in Hong Kong in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Romberg said some people may hope that Beijing, especially after
Taiwan's year-end legislative elections, will rethink its position at
least to the extent of engaging in an authoritative dialogue with
Taipei at some level, but that is "far from a certainty."
</P>
<P>
Beijing will be paying close attention to developments in Taiwan,
especially to the handling of sensitive issues, including the
possible change of the national title and the proposals to amend the
Constitution, he added.

TAIWAN AIR CARRIERS POISED FOR CROSS-STRAIT DIRECT LINKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan-based air carriers are keenly hoping
for direct transport links across the Taiwan Strait after President
Chen Shui-bian called for an early resumption of negotiations on the
issue in his Oct. 10 National Day address.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the government's executive branch is currently
devising a plan to provide a convenient and swift way to facilitate
charter flights for passengers and cargo, and he voiced his hope that
cross-strait consultations can begin as soon as possible to seek
further progress in the "three-links" policy.
</P>
<P>
China Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways Corporation -- Taiwan's two
largest aviation companies -- said that they Beijing should respond
quickly to Chen's call considering that the move would benefit both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Taking factors such as travel time, fuel costs and market share
into consideration, they contended that technical issues centering on
cargo travel are easier to handle and urged the Taiwan authorities to
put forward concrete measures, such as allowing mainland China's
carriers to offer the same services.
</P>
<P>
According to the civil aviation sector, Taiwan people make about
four million trips every year to mainland China via a third country
or area, incurring an extra cost of about NT$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
If extra flying time and fuel costs are added, they pointed out
that the total cost through a third area -- usually Hong Kong or
Macau -- is about NT$100 billion (US$2.94 billion) per year.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , the volume of present indirect cargo travel between
Taiwan and mainland China amounts to around 73,000 tons each year.
MAC officials said that the level will further increase after travel
links are set up.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to tap the cross-strait market, CAL has signed an
accord for joint operations with the mainland's Air China, China
Southern Airlines Co., Ltd. and China Eastern Air, Ltd. It also inked
cooperative ventures with shipping and bus companies based in Hong
Kong to provide better land and sea travel.
</P>
<P>
CAL, Taiwan's No. 1 carrier, opened an office in Guangzhou
earlier this year and has increased flights between Taiwan and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
A CAL executive said that there will be no technical problems for
cross-strait air travel and that they welcome other aviation
companies to join the service. He said that CAL will do its best to
cooperate with the government when concrete measures are worked out
and put in place.
</P>
<P>
The MAC has announced that future cross-strait routes will be
open to six carriers based in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
An assessment by the Taipei Aviation Industry Association shows
that direct cross-strait air links will help passengers flying
between the two sides save some 50 percent in travel time on single
trips and that carriers can save from US$50,000 to US$80,000 in
operating costs on a round trip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stock market watchers predicted that President Chen's
proposal on this front will inject momentum to shipping and aviation
company shares in the coming days.

BEIJING URGED TO SEND NEGOTIATORS TO TAIWAN TO DISCUSS AIR LINK ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China is welcome to send
negotiators to Taiwan to discuss issues regarding opening direct
charter flight services across the Taiwan Strait, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Taiwan is not opposed to the Beijing-proposed three
principles for forging direct cross-strait air links, namely two-way,
participation of carriers from both sides on a reciprocal basis and
non-stop.
</P>
<P>
"As these kinds of air links involve the exercise of public
authority, the two sides must negotiate viable and mutually
acceptable terms to begin with, " Wu said. "We hope Beijing can send
negotiators to Taipei for face-to-face consultations."
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks at a news conference held after a meeting
chaired by Premier Yu Shyi-kun of senior government officials,
scholars and executives of major industry associations.
</P>
<P>
Yu called the meeting a day after President Chen Shui-bian said
in his National Day address a day earlier that cross-strait charter
flights should be opened to facilitate passenger and cargo transport.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Joseph Wu, several other senior officials,
including Minister of National Defense Lee Jye, Minister of Finance
Lin Chuan, Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san
and Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Other participants included Wu Rong-I, president of the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research, Huang Mao-hsiung, president of the
Chinese National Association of Commerce and Industry, and Hsu
Sheng-hsiung, president of the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
With a view to accelerating the start of cross-strait
negotiations, Joseph Wu said the government will invite senior
executives of the nation's six largest trade associations and
representatives of air carriers to discuss how to kick-start
cross-strait talks on direct air links issues.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the newly revised statute governing cross-strait
relations has authorized the government to commission private groups
to negotiate with parallel mainland organizations, Wu said the
government will exercise flexibility in handling cross-strait talks.
Before the statute was revised, only the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation could handle cross-strait talks in the absence of
official ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai
said the government will uphold the principles of pragmatism,
flexibility and respect in handling cross-strait negotiations,
including the status of negotiators, timing, venue and the meeting
format.
</P>
<P>
If mainland authorities prefer to hold charter flight
negotiations in any mainland city or at a third place, Chen said,
Taiwan will not oppose this. "Anyway, we hope Beijing can make a
goodwill response to our offer," he said.

SHIPPING AND AVIATION LEADERS KEY IN CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT TALKS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan's decision to consider
the possibility of direct cross-strait charter flights for passengers
and cargo is a breakthrough, but shipping and aviation figures should
take part in the ensuing talks, an entrepreneur suggested Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Sheng-hsiung, president of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers' Association, made the remarks after a
Cabinet decision Monday that confirmed President Chen Shui-bian's
proposal announced in his Double Ten National Day address to
formulate a plan that provides convenient and efficient means to
facilitate such charter flights.
</P>
<P>
After the Executive Yuan's decision, the next step will be the
selection of representatives for talks.
</P>
<P>
Hsu suggested that during such technical consultations,
individuals from the aviation and shipping sectors should take part
while government officials can serve as advisers to the negotiation
team.
</P>
<P>
Charter flight services across the Taiwan Strait were operated on
a trial basis two years ago for Taiwan businessmen based in mainland
China to return to Taiwan for the Chinese New Year holiday, but they
were only one-way and had to make stops in Hong Kong or Macau.
</P>
<P>
There were no cross-strait charter flights this year because
Beijing did not wish to engage in bilateral consultations.

BEIJING FRIENDLINESS NEEDED TO START DIRECT LINKS: MOTC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid a government drive to promote direct
charter flights for both passengers and cargo between Taiwan and
mainland China, an official said Monday that Beijing's friendliness
is needed to start such services.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) Tsai
Tui made the remarks after Premier Yu Shyi-kun convened a meeting
earlier the same day with key trade and economics officials.
</P>
<P>
It was decided in the meeting that cross-strait direct air links
will be offered based on the principle of "allowing aviation
companies from both sides to offer round trips without a technical
stop in a third country or area."
</P>
<P>
Claiming that there will be no technical problems for
cross-strait air travel, Tsai, however, pointed out that Beijing
still needs to display goodwill of its own, since Taiwan has again
offered to talk on the issue.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said a day earlier in his Oct. 10
National Day address that Taiwan is eagerly hoping to begin
consultations with the mainland to facilitate charter flights for
passengers and cargo between the two sides to pave the way for
further progress in the "three-links" policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local business and industrial communities gave a
thumbs-up to the government's newest stance regarding direct air
links between Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
It is an irreversible path for the two sides given the present
prevailing trends of division of labor and such a move will help
Taiwan companies more effectively keep their talent, capital and core
operations at home, they said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that both sides should do their best to remove

Taiwan and mainland China have been at odds since the end of a

so-called "three links" -- remain absent despite frequent and close

Singapore's foreign ministry said Monday
that it welcomed President Chen Shui-bian's address a day earlier,
calling it a development that would reduce tensions between Taiwan
and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry made the remarks in a statement, which said

The president said in the address that "based on the existing
foundation, both sides should promote the resumption of cross-strait
dialogue and communication to reduce the gap between the two sides
and to construct a foundation of mutual trust.

The Taichung City Government will
sign an initial agreement with the New York-based Solomon R.
Guggenheim Foundation Tuesday on cooperation in building a Guggenheim
branch museum in the central Taiwan city.
</P>
<P>
Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu said the city government will sign
the preliminary cooperation accord with the Guggenheim foundation by
fax.
</P>
<P>
According to a consensus reached during Hu's visit to the
Guggenheim foundation Sept. 21, the two parties should sign an
initial agreement before Oct. 12 and the Taichung City Government
must pay a total of US$8 million in initial royalties, project
management and architectural design fees before Oct. 29 as a
guarantee that it will indeed carry out the cooperative project;
otherwise, the foundation will forfeit its cooperative plan with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In response to a request by the Taichung City Council, Hu said,
the Guggenheim foundation has agreed to cut its royalty fee by US$3
million and extend the contract period to 25 years to meet the
council's demand of a 20 percent discount in royalty payments.
</P>
<P>
As the city council will begin a session Oct. 18, Hu said he

CHEN LOOKS FORWARD TO NEW ROUND OF KOO-WANG MEETINGS: LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian looks forward to a
new round of Koo-Wang meetings to kick-start the long-stalled
dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hung Chi-chang, an influential member of the DPP's New
Tide faction, made the remarks a day after Chen suggested in his
National Day address that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait use the
basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong to seek possible ways that are
"not necessarily perfect but acceptable" as preparations for a step
forward in the resumption of dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Hung said the 1992 conference between Taiwan and mainland
officials in Hong Kong paved the way for a high-level meeting between
Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
and Wang Daohan, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) in Singapore in April
1993.
</P>
<P>
The historic Koo-Wang meeting laid the foundation for
cross-strait dialogue and exchanges. However, Beijing has
unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS dialogue since mid-1999
after then-President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait ties as
special state-to-state in nature, a statement which Beijing viewed as
a veiled move to promote Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Hung said he believes that President Chen, by proposing using the
1992 Hong Kong meeting as a basis, hopes to break the lingering
cross-strait political stalemate and jump-start a new round of
Koo-Wang meetings to discuss the much-anticipated opening of direct
cross-strait air and shipping links and jointly work for permanent
peace in the Taiwan Strait.

TAIWANESE REPS ABROAD CALL FOR NEW CONSTITUTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and P. C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 60 Taiwanese representatives
in Europe, America and Asia who attended a two-day World Taiwanese
Leaders Conference in Washington, D.C., Oct. 9-10 urged Taiwan to
accelerate its steps to write a new constitution and to rectify the
nation's official designation.
</P>
<P>
The representatives made the appeal in a declaration adopted at
the conference, the first of its kind ever held abroad by Taiwanese
representatives residing in locations around the world.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that Taiwan's fundamental goals are to gain
recognition from the international community and to write a new
constitution
</P>
<P>
Noting that the use of an inappropriate national designation,
impractical government organization operations, and uncertain
territorial claims are all causes behind Taiwan's encountering a lot
of difficulties, the representatives said that all of these urgently
require reform and that all Taiwanese around the world should do
their utmost to help achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that Taiwan can only make a breakthrough by writing a
new constitution and clearly identifying its national status, they
also said in the declaration that only by doing this can the island's
security and position be ensured.
</P>
<P>
The representatives also decided during the meeting to urge
Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties to accelerate their steps to
launch a campaign for the writing of a new constitution and the
rectification of the nation's official designation.
</P>
<P>
Calling for Beijing to give up the option of force against Taiwan
and to stop its efforts to obstruct Taiwan in the international
arena, they also expressed the hope that leaders of other nations
will pay more attention to the global development of human rights,
economy and trade as well as Taiwan's contributions to the world.
</P>
<P>
They also requested that the leaders of the world accept the
willingness and capacity of Taiwan to become a member of the global
village and recognize Taiwan as a nation as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The representatives also adopted several action plans at the
meeting, including asking members of the U.S. Congress to write a
letter to President Chen Shui-bian to request that the island's
Representative Office to the United States rectify its designation;
lobbying the European Union to maintain its ban on arms sales to
mainland China; continuing to push Taiwan's bid to join international
organizations; promoting Taiwan's image abroad; and holding various
seminars to discuss the writing of a new constitution.

COURSES ON SOUTHEAST ASIAN CULTURE TO BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Courses on Southeast Asia culture will be
taught in elementary and junior high schools starting next year, an
education official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Education Minister Fan Sun-lu said this will be part of a
project under the name of a new immigration culture to create a
pluralistic and new Taiwan which was worked out by National Chi Nan
University at the commission of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Fan noted that the number of foreign spouses of Taiwan citizens
is growing every year. The latest statistics show that the number of
foreign spouses has passed the mark of 310,000, with their children,
numbering more than 30,000 in Taiwan's elementary and junior high
schools, having become a new immigration group.
</P>
<P>
This is the reason the government wants to promote a pluralistic
and equal ethnic society and the learning of the culture of new
immigrants, Fan added.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the ministry will work along the lines of
teaching about Southeast Asian culture, mobilizing students from
Southeast Asia who are currently studying in Taiwan, and increasing
international cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Courses to enhance understanding of Southeast Asian culture will
start to be taught in elementary and junior high schools in February
when the new semester begins.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a two-part "Understanding Southeast Asia"
documentary featuring the region from the angle of Taiwan will also
be aired by the Public Television Service.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also ask the education departments in
universities to devise comprehensive teaching materials for the
teachers in the immigration learning centers in Taoyuan, Nantou and
Tainan.
</P>
<P>
The overseas Chinese and foreign students who are currently
studying in more than 60 colleges and universities in Taiwan will be
mobilized so that they will become the bridge between new immigrants
and Taiwan society.
</P>
<P>
The team comprised of these overseas students will work in Nantou
County, where there is a large number of new immigrants, in the first
year on a trial basis, and then the service will be expanded to the
whole island.
</P>
<P>
Fan noted that Taiwan people used to travel to Southeast Asian
nations for work or marriage in earlier years, and that now many
Taiwan people travel to the region for investment. She added that it
is hoped the "Understand Southeast Asia" project will help the people
of Taiwan see the new immigrants as their equals through more
understanding.

MOFA CALLS FOR WORLD ATTENTION TO CHINA'S GROWING MILITARY STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
urged the international community Tuesday to pay more attention to
mainland China's ever-growing military strength which the ministry
said poses a serious threat to Taiwan Strait and Asia-Pacific
security.
</P>
<P>
The ministry made the appeal amid reports that European Union
foreign ministers had failed to agree Monday on lifting the bloc's
15-year-old arms embargo against mainland China despite strong French
lobbying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news conference, MOFA deputy spokeswoman
Anna Kao said the proposal to lift the arms sales ban against
mainland China was not put on the agenda of the current E.U. foreign
ministers meeting in Luxembourg because a majority of member nations
oppose lifting the ban. The E.U. foreign ministers only held informal
discussions during a lunch meeting Monday, Kao said.
</P>
<P>
Yang-Huang Mei-hsing, director of the MOFA's Research and
Planning Board, said that thanks to prominent media coverage in
recent months, the world community has taken greater notice of
Taiwan's concern about the proposed lifting of the E.U. arms embargo
against mainland China.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Yang-Huang said, foreign wire services had reported
a series of demonstrations staged by local activists outside major
E.U. countries' representative offices in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she added, Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen's
letter to the editor published in the London-based Financial Times
urging the European Union not to view a lifting of its ban on arms
sales to mainland China lightly had been widely quoted by major
international news media.
</P>
<P>
Yang-Huang said she hopes local news media can continue to report
on Taiwan's concerns about the issue so that the world can understand
that Taiwan has been the guardian of peace in the Taiwan Strait and
that keeping the arms embargo against China is very important to
preserving regional stability, security and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The European Union imposed the arms sales ban against mainland
China after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in which Beijing mobilized
troops to crush a pro-democracy demonstration. Some E.U. member
states oppose lifting the ban on the grounds that Beijing has not
imporved its human rights records.

LABOR RIGHTS ACTIVISTS PUSH FOR HOUSEMAID SERVICE LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of labor rights activists
demonstrated in front of the Legislative Yuan Tuesday advocating
passage of a housemaid service law to protect basic human rights and
the interests of local and foreign family helpers.
</P>
<P>
The activists displayed a barrel bearing signatures of more than
10,000 foreign housemaids working in Taiwan to show support they have
received for the legislation. Also on display was a collection of
photos of foreign housemaids who had been allegedly abused or
maltreated by their local employers.
</P>
<P>
Chen Su-hsiang, president of the Taiwan International Workers
Association, said Taiwan has not enacted a special law to protect
foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the absence of such a law has violated the
international norm for human rights protection, Chen said the nation
should enact a housemaid service law as soon as possible to protect
both local and foreign family helpers from being abused by their
employers.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed housemaid service law can clearly prescribe work
terms to offer better protection for some 300,000 local and foreign
housemaids in Taiwan," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Shyu Jong-shyong has joined some
of his colleagues in drafting a housemaid service bill, which is
pending legislative screening.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill contains 51 articles in eight chapters. Highlights
of the bill include protection of housemaids' privacy, regulations on
employers' family members in dealing with housemaids, the code of
conduct of housemaids, housemaid's rights to leaves and holidays,
minimum wages, direct payment of wages and the rights of housemaids
and employers to terminate working contracts.
</P>
<P>
Chen said she hopes this draft bill can clear the legislative
floor during the current session.

MILITARY CLARIFIES REPORTS ABOUT PULLOUT FROM SIX ISLETS OFF KINMEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The military will turn over six islets it
administers to the Kinmen County Government to help the outlying
county's tourism efforts, but the Ministry of National Defense said
Tuesday the move is an "adjustment of military personnel, " not a
troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng, spokesman for the defense ministry,
made the remarks amid media reports that the six islets -- namely
Tatan, Ertan, Tungting, Peiting, Shihyu and Menghuyi -- would be
turned over to the Kinmen County Government and be opened to tourism
on Jan. 1, 2005.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng proposed
the takeover of the six islets, which lie closer to mainland China
than to Taiwan, for tourism in 2000, and Premier Yu Shyi-kun, while
inspecting the area in 2002, agreed to release the six islets in line
with the plans of the Kinmen County Government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kinmen Defense Command is currently working with
the Kinmen County Government on the details of the handover, but the
date will be decided by the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Huang stressed that after the adjustment of military personnel,
land and sea security will be turned over to police, but the six
islets will still be within the effective range of the military's
sphere of influence.

TAIWAN TO CLAIM RIGHTS OVER CONTINENTAL SHELF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will submit information to the
United Nations on the outer limits of its continental shelf if they
extend beyond 200 nautical miles to protect its sovereign rights over
the shelf, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, the government
is planning to have the submission made through its diplomatic
allies, according to Maysing Yang, head of MOFA's Research and
Planning Board.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (CLCS) has requested its member nations to file the
information by May 2009 in accordance with the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
As stated in the convention, the continental shelf of a coastal
state comprises the sea-bed and subsoil of the submerged areas that
extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation
of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or
to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the
breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of
the continental margin does not extend up to that distance.
</P>
<P>
The coastal state should establish the outer edge of the
continental margin wherever the margin extends beyond 200 nautical
miles and register the information with the U.N. commission, the
convention stipulates.
</P>
<P>
It says the coastal state exercises over the continental shelf
sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting its
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the Ministry of the Interior is currently surveying the
outer limits of Taiwan's continental shelf and that it is still
unsure if they extend beyond 200 nautical miles.
</P>
<P>
However, Yang said Taiwan's continental shelf could extend
northward to the East China Sea and Yellow Sea and overlap partially
with that of mainland China's, Japan's and South Korea's; eastward to
overlap partially with that of Japan's and the Philippines'; and
westward to overlap almost completely with that of the mainland's.
</P>
<P>
Yang said MOFA believes that the government should lodge a
serious protest over any foreign invasion of its continental shelf to
safeguard its rights and to prevent Taiwan from being demarcated to
become part of the mainland's territory.
</P>
<P>
MOFA will also inform neighboring countries of its claim over the
continental shelf limits and seek bilateral negotiations for a
settlement, she added.

be built at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in northern
Taiwan to help meet the growing demand for water there, a government
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official with the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), the proposal was adopted at
a CEPD meeting held a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will offer a
parcel of land for the build-transfer-operate (BTO) project in
cooperation with the private sector, which will be in charge of
operations of the facility upon completion of its construction, the
CEPD official said.
</P>
<P>
The planned desalination plant will be Taiwan's largest, with a
projected capacity of more than 30,000 tons of fresh water per day
for the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, which relies heavily
on a sufficient water supply to sustain normal operations.
</P>
<P>
CEPD Vice Chairman Chang Ching-sun said at the meeting that a 20
percent water shortage could halt at least 50 percent of the park's
operations.
</P>
<P>
Chang pointed out that it is increasingly difficult to maintain
stable water supplies for the hi-tech park -- Taiwan's most
representative and oldest facilities of its kind -- in the face of a
growing threat of dry spells due to the worsening disparity in
rainfall across Taiwan in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Citing an initial assessment by the CEPD, he said that each water
meter unit of the desalination plant will cost an additional NT$1.5
and that many companies based in the park have shown a keen interest
in its construction.
</P>
<P>
Estimates by water resource authorities show that it is necessary
to explore alternative sources to satisfy the long-term need for
fresh water in the Hsinchu area. Underground water, which has in the
past been the major source for emergency use, is gradually running
out, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Government authorities will open bidding to the public by Nov. 15
to invite a qualified private investor to participate in the
construction project and an investment accord will be signed between
the two sides by June 2005. Overall completion of the project and
trial operations are scheduled for Dec. 2006.
</P>
<P>
Ownership of the plant will be returned to the government 20
years later after it has paid the private investor the total
construction spending in installments.
</P>
<P>
The construction plan will carry a price tag of NT$1.788 billion
(US$52.5 million) and the government will, starting from 2007, return
NT$176 million per year to the investor through to the end of the
20-year installment plan.

NO BOTTOM LINE FOR CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: PREMIER YU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that both
sides of the Taiwan Strait can talk about any issues in consultations
and dialogue, even the "one China" rhetoric cherished by mainland
China, and there will be no bottom line.
</P>
<P>
The premier was responding to questions by Legislator Cheng
Kuo-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the
Legislative Yuan who asked how the Executive Yuan is going to follow
through on President Chen Shui-bian's call for the resumption of
cross-strait dialogues in his Double Ten National Day message.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said he would propose that both sides use the
basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong to seek possible ways that are
"not necessarily perfect, but acceptable" in preparation for a step
forward in the resumption of dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that there was a meeting in Hong Kong in 1992
which paved the way for the first high-ranking negotiations between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait the following year, but there is
no such thing as the "1992 consensus."
</P>
<P>
The president's words that the Hong Kong meeting could be used as
a basis aims to put aside cross-strait disputes on sovereignty and
engage in pragmatic exchanges, and his words should not be twisted as
if there were a consensus reached in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The premier reaffirmed that those who took part in the Hong Kong
meeting in 1992 know that there was no consensus reached between the
two sides -- a tacit understanding that there is only one China, but
mainland China and Taiwan have different interpretations on what this
constitutes.
</P>
<P>
On cross-strait issues that the president touched on in his
address, including arms control to avoid conflicts,
confidence-building measures through consultations and dialogues, and
the establishment of a "code of conduct across the Taiwan Strait, "
the premier said that the government has "made preparations for
cross-strait matters."
</P>
<P>
"There will be no bottom line for cross-strait consultations, "
the premier added, saying that anything can be discussed, including
venues and timing.
</P>
<P>
"The government is extending an olive branch in sincerity, and is
hoping to have a positive response from mainland China," he said.

PREMIER SAYS NO PLAN TO RAISE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS BEFORE FEB. 1

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday the
government has no plan to raise the premiums of the National Health
Insurance within his term, which expires Feb. 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan in response to reports that the government will
raise the premiums next year.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he is only responsible for the policy as long as he is in
office.
</P>
<P>
Yu's Cabinet is set to resign en masse before the new Legislative
Yuan is sworn in on Feb. 1, and it is uncertain if Yu will be
reappointed premier by President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Chen Chien-jen, meanwhile,
said it is necessary for the government to comprehensively plan the
future financial program to ensure that the health insurance system
remains viable.
</P>
<P>
However, any plans for adjustments will be raised for discussions
at a civic meeting before they are finalized, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yi-jen, deputy chief of the National Health Insurance panel
under the DOH, said in a news conference that raising the premiums is
not the only option for improving the program's financial condition.
</P>
<P>
There are other options such as increasing tobacco and alcohol
taxes to finance the program, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, staff members of nearly 500 regional hospitals
around the island took to the streets demanding that the DOH raise
the quota on National Health Insurance coverage for the medical
services provided by regional hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The protesters claimed the current quota is driving them into
bankruptcy.

TAIWAN NOT DEVELOPING MISSILES THAT CAN REACH SHANGHAI: PREMIER

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun denied Tuesday that the
nation is developing cruise missiles that can reach Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"We have no such capability, nor are we developing such weapons,"
the premier said as he was fielding questions in the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Ku Chung-lien of the opposition People First Party
asked if Taiwan was developing such offensive missiles. He also asked
if the nation will develop them in the future after the premier's
denial.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he could only give his word that there will
be no such development during his term. The premier will step down in
February according to practice after the new legislature is
established.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said that his recent mention about missiles to
be used against the mainland was only a "presumption."
</P>
<P>
In a call for Taiwan to purchase arms to maintain a sufficient
military deterrent, the premier said late last month that if mainland
China fired 100 missiles at Taiwan, the island should be able to fire
at least 10 back at the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Ku, a former ROC Navy commander-in-chief, also asked if the
nation's "nuclear free" policy will be confined to opposition to the
construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, and not opposition to
nuclear weapons, and whether there is a "five-man team" in the
government to plan for the development of cruise missiles and nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"There are no such things," the premier said categorically.

TAIWANESE RANK NEARLY LAST IN LOVE-MAKING FREQUENCY: DUREX POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan may be gaining strength in the
global electronics industry, but in one area Taiwanese are definitely
sagging -- sex.
</P>
<P>
The latest annual survey on sex by condom-maker Durex found that
Taiwanese had sex only 80 times per year, ranking them fourth from
the bottom of a list of 41 countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the 2004 Durex Global Sex Survey, released Tuesday,
French top the global list with an average 137 times per year.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan had close company, as the three countries below them were
Asian neighbors Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kongers and Singaporeans had sex 79 times on average a year
with Japanese bringing up the rear at 46.
</P>
<P>
As if that weren't bad enough, Taiwanese also cut to the chase
faster than many other nationalities. Taiwan people spent an average
of 16.3 minutes on foreplay, 3.4 minutes less than the global average
from a sample size of 350,000 people worldwide, ranking them fifth
from the bottom.
</P>
<P>
Topping the list of foreplay were those from Great Britain at an
average of 22.5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Coming to the final question, the survey found that 35 percent of
all people responding said that they always achieve orgasm; however,
only 17 percent of women said this compared to the 45 percent of men
who did.
</P>
<P>
Among Chinese, 11 percent say they have never had an orgasm.

New York Times: Group of Bishops using
influence to oppose Kerry.

For Archbishop Charles J. Chaput, the highest-ranking Roman
Catholic, abortion is a foundational iuuse. Archbishop Chaput, who
has never ex plicitly endorsed a candidate, is part of a group of
bishops intent on throwing the weight of the church into the
elections and they consider that there is only one way for a faithful
Catholic to vote in this presidential election, for President Bush
and against Senator John Kerry.

Wall Street Journal: Corporate tax bill passes Senate, goes to
President.

After four years of fits and starts, the Senate approved and sent
to President Bush a huge tax bill that repeals a controversial export
subsidy and replaces it with an even bigger break for U.S.
manufacturers. The bill, dubbed the "American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, " is a treasure trove of tax breaks for scores of industries,
multinationals with profts parked overseas, tabacco farmers subject
to Depression-era quotas and residents of states that rely heavily on
sales taxes. The billl was approved by a Senate vote of 69-17 after
passing the House last week by 280-141. Though the Bush
administration has reservations about some provisions of the bill,
Mr. Bush is expected to sign it -- and will likely herald it as part
of his plan to boost the U.S. economy.

Members of the "truth investigation

examine details of President Chen Shui-bian's campaign tour on March
19 right before he was shot.

The members were received by NSB Director-General Hsueh Shih-min

<P>
The NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion)
arms procurement from the United States is not bound by the results
of the March 20 national referendum because it had been decided upon
before the vote was held, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during an interpellation session at the Legislative
Yuan, Yu said the referendum is only binding to policies that came
after it.
</P>
<P>
Yu pointed out that Taiwan asked the U.S. repeatedly to sell the
weapons to Taiwan between 1995 and 1999, and Washington finally
agreed to the sale in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan held its first referendum along with the presidential
election on March 20; whether the country should upgrade its
anti-missile defense capability was one of two questions posed to
voters.
</P>
<P>
However, although the question was approved by over 90 percent of
those who participated, the referendum was declared invalid as a

YOUNG ILLITERATE FOREIGN BRIDES TO BE REQUIRED TO RECEIVE EDUCATION

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Illiterate foreign and mainland Chinese
brides under the age of 34 will be required to receive supplementary
education, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new requirement is aimed at lowering the illiteracy rate
among foreign and mainland brides younger than 34 years old to 1.8
percent by 2007 from 2.26 percent in 2003, MOE officials said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the officials said, the ministry will revise current
supplementary education laws to have certain foreign and mainland
brides receive compulsory elementary education.
</P>
<P>
According to official tallies, the illiteracy rate among foreign
and mainland brides reached 2.6 percent in 2003, with the rate among
those younger than 34 standing at 2.26 percent.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that one-quarter to one-third of local
newborns were born to mothers of mainland Chinese and Southeast Asian
origins in recent years, the officials said the MOE has to take
effective measures to lower the illiteracy rate among young mainland
and foreign brides to maintain good manpower quality.
</P>
<P>
The number of Taiwan citizens marrying foreign and mainland
Chinese citizens has been growing steadily, with the number of
foreign and mainland brides exceeding 310,000.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 children born to foreign and mainland mothers
are now studying at local elementary and junior high schools. Those
new "sons of Taiwan" spread in all cities and counties around Taiwan,
with Taipei and Taoyuan counties boasting the largest numbers.
One-third of their mothers come from mainland China; 7,853 come from
Indonesia and 3,578 come from Vietnam.

The signing of an initial
agreement between the Taichung City Government and the New York-based
Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation on cooperation in building a
Guggenheim branch museum in the central Taiwan city will be postponed
to late October, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The postponement was mainly meant to express our respect for the
city council, " Hu said, adding that the postponement received the
consent of the Guggenheim foundation.
</P>
<P>
According to a consensus reached during Hu's visit to the
Guggenheim foundation Sept. 21, the two parties should sign an
initial agreement before Oct. 12 and the Taichung City Government
must pay a total of US$8 million in initial royalties, project
management and architectural design fees before Oct. 29 as a
guarantee that it will indeed carry out the cooperative project;
otherwise, the foundation will forfeit its cooperative plan with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The city government was originally scheduled to sign the initial
cooperation pact with the Guggenheim foundation Tuesday by fax.
</P>
<P>
"As the Taichung City Council is now in recess and will not open
its new session until Oct. 18, we decided to postpone the signing to
late this month so that the city council can screen and approve the
project before the agreement is sealed," Hu explained.
</P>
<P>
The city council has been scheduled to screen the project Oct.
25-26. Once the city council formally approves the project, Hu said,
the city govenrment will sign the initial cooperation accord with the
Guggenheim foundation and pay UN$8 million in initial royalties,
management and design fees immediately afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Hu further said preparations for the ambitious project will get
underway after the initial cooperation pact is signed.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the new museum will be able to open to the
public in 2008 as originally scheduled," Hu added.

PREMIER, MOFA DENY REPORT LINKING MONEY TO CHAD FOR TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to a media report that the
government has paid NT$350 million (US$10.3 million) to Chad in
exchange for its continued diplomatic recognition, Premier Yu
Shyi-kun said Tuesday that he has no knowledge of the matter and that
he doubted the accuracy of the report.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that he does not have the slightest idea about any
money for recognition, Yu said that media reports are not always
accurate.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks while answering questions from Legislator Li
Yung-pin of the opposition People First Party, who cited a story in
the China Times Express evening newspaper that Chad obtained NT$350
million (US$10.3 million) from the Republic of China government in
exchange for its continued diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
Chad is one of the 26 nations, predominantly in Africa and Latin
America, that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the African nation threatened to cut
diplomatic ties with Taiwan in the middle of this year should it
refuse to give the money to help it renew a set of power generating
facilities. The report said that Taiwan eventually granted the money
to Chad in the form of a "cooperation project."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs
Kau Ying-mao categorically denied the report and gave his assurance
that relations between the two countries remain very good on the
grounds that Chad Foreign Affairs Minister Nagoum Yamassourm led a
delegation to Taiwan to take part in the Oct. 10 National Day
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Kau blasted the report's details, although he admitted that it is
true that Taiwan has to extend economic aid to Chad quite often.
</P>
<P>
"If what the report said were true, I would step down from my
post to assume political responsibility, " he said, and harshly
criticized the newspaper of running the false report without first
verifying the facts.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Michel C. L. Lu told a news conference
later the same day that renewing power generating facilities is
surely one of the issues contained in bilateral joint cooperative
ventures. But he called the report saying that Chad threatened to
suspend diplomatic links with Taiwan to trade for the money is a far
cry from the truth.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, Taiwan-Chad ties are sound and stable and all
sorts of cooperative plans are faring well, ranging from medical and
agricultural to technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
An oil exploration project between the Chad government and the
state-run Chinese Petroleum Corporation, under negotiation since last
year, has reaped initial progress after Minister of Foreign Affairs
Tan San Chen and his Chad counterpart reached agreement days ago in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
As to a reporter's question that Beijing would meddle in the
project, Lu said that the ROC Embassy in Chad is keeping a close
watch on developments and he described the current situation as "so
far, so good."

CREATION AND INVENTION KEY TO TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Creation and invention are keys to the
success of Taiwan's economic transformation, Minister of Economic
Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 2004 National Creation and Invention Awards
ceremony, Ho said that the government has been actively promoting the
country's economic transformation, from a manufacturing-based economy
to a knowledge-based one.
</P>
<P>
The success of the transformation relies on whether the country
has sufficient acumen for the job, the minister said, adding that the
government has announced an increase in the country's expenditures in
research and development to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
by 2006 and has adopted incentives to encourage domestic and foreign
enterprises to set up their R&amp;D centers in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she went on, the government has also enhanced
intellectual property protection by amending relevant laws and
regulations and improving law enforcement techniques.
</P>
<P>
The government has pledged to reduce the ratio of commercial
software piracy to less than 40 percent in the next year from this
year's 43 percent, she noted.
</P>
<P>
What the government is doing is to create an environment friendly
to creation and invention, which will lead the country to a new era
amid the knowledge-based economy, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's ability for creation and invention is one of the world's
best, Ho said, explaining that the number of patents obtained by its
nationals in the United States during the period between 2000 and
2003 was forth-highest in the world, only behind the U.S., Japan and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
A total of 61 companies and individuals were awarded by the
government with a combined prize money of NT$13.75 million
(US$405,000) at the ceremony for their excellent creative works and
inventions, according to the Intellectual Property Office under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.

<P>
A total of 387 candidates officially
registered to run in the Dec. 11 legislative elections, a spokesman
for the Central Election Commission (CEC) reported Tuesday after the
five-day legal requirement process ended earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
The candidates will vie for 168 regional and eight aboriginal
seats. The registered candidates will be screened by the CEC to be
qualified to run and will then draw designation numbers Nov. 17 at
local CEC committees across the country.
</P>
<P>
According to CEC statistics, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) has recommended 92 candidates, followed by the prime
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) with 74, and the People First Party (PFP)
with 41. The tiny pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) and
the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) fielded 30 and 26 hopefuls,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Citing survey results carried out by the DPP, a key party
official forecast that the "pan-green camp" -- formed by the DPP and
its political ally the TSU -- will be able to grab from 110 to 115
seats -- a turnaround from the last legislative elections in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Chung Jia-ping, DPP deputy secretary general, expressed his
belief that the "pan-green camp" will beat the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" and hold more than half of the seats in the 225-member
Legislative Yuan as a majority.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP
also claimed that they will keep their majority in the legislature,
as the two parties have agreed to cooperate based on a conservative
quota system to ensure their maximum seats.
</P>
<P>
The NPSU is also very optimistic about its performance,
predicting that the party will be able to pass the 5 percent
threshold to win as many as 17 regional seats and up to three
at-large seats.
</P>
<P>
The 225 seats will include 168 regional seats and eight
aboriginal seats, as well as eight overseas Chinese seats and 41
at-large seats.
</P>
<P>
The overseas Chinese and at-large legislators will be produced
based on a proportional representation of the ballots that each party
grabs in the election.

The Hong Kong government welcomes Pao
Cheng-kang, new Taiwan representative to Hong Kong, to assume his
post, a spokesman for the Constitutional Affairs Bureau (CAB) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Hong Kong government has consistently
adopted a positive attitude toward Pao's application for a working
visa.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Pao to assume his post as managing director of the
Chung Hwa Travel Service in Hong Kong," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's representative office in Hong Kong is designated as
Chung Hwa Travel Service because Hong Kong doesn't have official ties
with Taiwan due to Beijing's "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether CAB Director Stephen Lam would meet Pao after Pao
took office, the spokesman said the CAB has traditionally maintained
effective communication channels with the Chung Hwa Travel Service.
</P>
<P>
"Lam will meet with Pao so long as it is necessary in handling
bilateral affairs," the spokesman said, adding that in the past, Lam
had met with Pao's predecessor, Chang Liang-jen, from time to time to
exchange views on matters of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities confirmed Tuesday that Pao has received a
working visa from Hong Kong and will soon travel to Hong Kong to
assume the post left vacant by Chang.

EX-GERMAN PRESIDENT CALLS FOR PEACE ACROSS TAIWAN STRAIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Berlin,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-li and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walter Scheel, who served as president of
the former West Germany, called Tuesday for both sides of the Taiwan
Strait not to resort to force under any circumstances in dealing with
cross-strait differences.
</P>
<P>
Scheel, in a speech at the Republic of China National Day
cocktail party held in Berlin, quoted ROC President Chen Shui-bian as
saying in his National Day speech that cross-strait differences can
only be solved through peace.
</P>
<P>
The 85-year-old Scheel was the highest-ranking former or
incumbent German official to attend the ROC National Day celebrations
in Berlin. He was the president of West Germany between 1974-1979. A
Free Democratic Party stalwart, Scheel served as West German foreign
minister prior to becoming president.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Scheel said that Taiwan's democratization and the
freedom that its people enjoy are facts that deserve the respect of
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Annual two-way trade between Taiwan and Germany has reached some
1 billion euros, making Taiwan one of Germany's major trade partners
in Asia, Scheel noted.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation to Taiwan's National Palace
Museum for having arranged for its flagship collections, known as
"the treasures of the Chinese emperors, " to be exhibited in Germany,
allowing the German people to savor the magnificent Chinese culture
without having to travel to China.
</P>
<P>
Scheel said he hopes that Taiwan and Germany will enhance their
bilateral cultural exchanges in the future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wolfgang Lueder, chairman of the German China
Association, praised Taiwan and its people in his speech to the
cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
Citing the story of a Taiwanese farmer who planted Chinese
mushrooms in a Berlin suburb and went on to market his produce
throughout Europe, Lueder said that Taiwan's people have been
important investors in Germany beyond the high-tech field.
</P>
<P>
Lueder said that Taiwan -- with its economic strength and high
level of human rights -- would be worthy of being invited by German
politicians to join the European Union if the island were located in
the Mediterranean Sea. His remarks received loud applause from those
attending the cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
The German China Association, established in Germany 47 years
ago, has been an influential private organization devoted to
relations between the German and Chinese people. It has maintained
very close interactions with Taiwan since its inception.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the association has about 200 members, most of whom
are influential people from Germany's political, economic and
cultural circles.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 German government officials, Bundestag members and
scholars, as well as some 600 Taiwanese and Chinese people attended
the cocktail party, which was sponsored by the Taipei Representative
Office in Berlin.

TAIWAN WILL PATIENTLY WAIT FOR GOODWILL RESPONSE FROM BEIJING: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China government will
patiently wait for a goodwill response from mainland China to its
peace overture, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu
Tai-san said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu made the remarks after Beijing sternly responded to
President Chen Shui-bian's latest olive branch extended in his ROC
Double Ten National Day speech.
</P>
<P>
"Our goodwill and stance toward Beijing will not change. We are
willing to wait patiently for Beijing to weigh and understand our
appeals," Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen proposed in his Oct. 10 address that the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait use the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong
to seek possible ways that are "not necessarily perfect, but
acceptable" in preparation for a step forward in the resumption of
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to himself by his nickname 'A-bian, ' Chen further said
that as any conflict could cause irreparable damage to both sides,
Taiwan and mainland China should seriously consider practical steps
toward "arms control."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore A-bian proposes that both sides should seriously
consider the issue of arms control and take concrete actions to
reduce tension and military threats across the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
For the sake of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait, Chiu said, Beijing should resume talks with Taiwan on issues
that conform with the common desires and interests of the people on
both sides in order to jointly create win-win prospects.
</P>
<P>
In mainland China's first official response to President Chen's
olive branch, Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for mainland China's Taiwan
Affairs Office, told a news conference in Beijing Wednesday that
Beijing's stance remains unchanged and warned that Chen risked "great
catastrophe" by pushing for independence.
</P>
<P>
"Chen Shui-bian claimed that he intends to ease tensions and
confrontation across the Taiwan Strait, but he has obstinately stuck
to his separatist stance of 'one country on each side' of the
strait," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"If Chen Shui-bian remains bent on sticking to his splittist and
Taiwan independence activities, he will never bring peace and
prosperity to the Taiwan compatriots, but will only bring great
catastrophe," he said.

BEIJING'S 'BACKPEDALING' ON CROSS-STRAIT LINKS REGRETTABLE: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) caucus in the Legislative Yuan said Wednesday it regrets that
mainland China has linked direct cross-strait transportation links to
the "one China" issue, calling it "backpedaling" on Beijing's part.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus was responding to a rejection by Zhang Mingqing,
spokesman for the mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office, of President Chen
Shui-bian's call in his Double Ten National Day speech for early
peace talks so as to seek progress in direct cross-strait links.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said earlier in the day that cross-strait transportation
links must be conducted based on the premise of "internal affairs"
and the principles of mutual benefits and reciprocity, adding that
the opening of cross-strait links will not depend on proposing
"two-way chartered flight service."
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Chang Hsueh-shun said Zhang's remarks represented
a backpedaling on mainland China's part, noting that Beijing had
earlier defined cross-strait transportation links as a "special
route" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which Chang noted
is similar to President Chen's proposal in his National Day speech.
</P>
<P>
Chang expressed the hope that cross-strait economic and political
issues could be separated and that the two sides could begin direct
cross-strait transportation links consultations by focusing on the
economic aspect of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chun-yi, DPP whip in the Legislative Yuan, said Zhang was
harping the same old tune by linking cross-strait links to the "one
China" issue, which Lee called "inappropriate" and a hampering of the
common wish of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait for the
opening of such transportation links.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that President Chen hopes to establish direct
cross-strait links through the implementation of direct charter
flights and through shelving disputes on sovereignty, adding that it
is regrettable that Beijing has defined the links as an "internal
affair."

NHRI FORMS ALLIANCE WITH U.S. PHARMACEUTICALS TO DEVELOP CANCER DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Health Research Institutes
(NHRI) Wednesday established a strategic alliance with U.S.-based
Bridge Pharmaceuticals on the research and development of cancer
medicines.
</P>
<P>
The first cooperation project between the two sides will be the
clinical development in Taiwan of two new cancer medicines, SR-13668
and SR-16158, NHRI officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two medicines have been tested on animals in the United
States and have been shown to be effective in inhibiting the growth
of cancer cells, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of clinical trials on humans is expected to start
next year in Taiwan, they said.
</P>
<P>
The SR-13668 is for oral consumption and can curb the AKT
retroviral oncogene protein, which is extremely active in patients
with malignant tumors, including breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate
cancer, liver cancer, ovary cancer and colon cancer, according to the
NHRI.
</P>
<P>
The SR-16158, meanwhile, is intended for the treatment of breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Whang-Peng, director of the NHRI's Division of Cancer
Research, said that compared with existing cancer medicines, the two
drugs have produced better therapeutic results and less side effects.
</P>
<P>
Compared with hormonal drugs, SR-16158 is less likely to trigger
cardiovascular disease in patients, Whang-Peng said.
</P>
<P>
She said the two new medicines will be available on the market
three years from now at the earliest if the clinical trials proceed
smoothly.

LOCAL TV STAR DECIDES AGAINST BEING LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local TV variety show host Jacky Wu (Wu
Tsung-hsien) announced Tuesday that he has decided against being a
legislator-at-large candidate in the upcoming legislative elections,
citing "personal reasons" for his decision.
</P>
<P>
Wu -- whom the newly-formed Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU)
announced last Friday would run under the NPSU banner -- declared in
Beijing that he will not get involved in politics.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that due to his mother's strong opposition, he has
decided against being a candidate. He denied that he is an
opportunist who has eaten his own words as some in the media have
said, claiming that they had interpreted his words out of context.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Wu's change of heart, NPSU Secretary-General Chen
Jung-chieh said Wednesday that his party fully understands the
awkward position Wu has been placed in following the earlier
disclosure of his intentions to be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he regrets the fact that Wu, who enjoys a high
level of popularity in Taiwan, cannot join the NPSU as a legislative
candidate, but added that his party respects Wu's decision.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the NPSU decided Tuesday to have Wu listed as
an NPSU candidate for a legislator-at-large seat after Wu and the
NPSU leadership reached a certain understanding last week that Wu
would represent the NPSU in the legislative elections slated for Dec.
11.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Hao, who is the vice chairman of the NPSU, also
said last Friday that Wu would formally announce his election bid at
a press conference in Taipei Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
Wu changed his mind due to considerations of his entertainment
career, Chen said, adding that Wu turned his back to the NPSU after
some "upstairs" individuals at a television station warned that Wu's
"stage would be dismantled" if he decided to take part in politics.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who has been one of the hottest targets of local paparazzi
because of his colorful private life, has reportedly amassed a
fortune over the years in his career as an entertainer and a
businessman.
</P>
<P>
Wu had said that if he were a lawmaker, one of the areas he would
like to straighten up is the local media.
</P>
<P>
In the legislative elections, all 225 seats will be up for grabs,
including 168 regional legislative seats, eight Aboriginal seats,
eight overseas Chinese seats and 41 at-large seats.
</P>
<P>
The parties fielding candidates are the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, its ally the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union,
the Kuomintang, and the People First Party, as well as the newly
established Non-Partisan Solidarity Union. Another newly formed
group, the Taiwan Democracy School, is also poised to recommend a
number of candidates.

<P>
A Suao-based fishing boat which was hijacked
and taken to mainland China Oct. 9 has managed to escape and will
return to Taiwan Thursday, the Suao Fishermen's Radio reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Skipper Hung Chi-chen and an engineer -- the only two Taiwanese
crew members of the 42.38-ton "Chin Lung Yu" -- are scheduled to
arrive in Suao, eastern Taiwan, around 3 a.m. Thursday, from Shacheng
port, Fujian Province, after a four-day ordeal on the seas.
</P>
<P>
The "Chin Lung Yu" was hijacked by six mainland Chinese deckhands
working aboard the vessel on the night of Oct. 9 after it sought
temporary shelter on the coast of Yaeyama Island of Japan's Okinawa
Prefecture due to Typhoon Ma-on.
</P>

The six mainlanders subdued Hung and the engineer before robbing
them of NT$3,000 in cash and making away with more than 7,000
kilograms of shark catch and 12,000 liters of gasoline, according to
the fishermen's radio.
</P>
<P>
Neither Hung nor the engineer were hurt by the mainland crew
members, the radio broadcasters said.

TAIWAN'S CPI GREW MILDLY BY 1.1 PERCENT OVER PAST DECADE: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI)
increased by 1.1 percent per year on average during the 1994-2003
period, lower than the 2.4 percent seen in the United States and the
3.8 percent in South Korea, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
The newest tallies released Tuesday by the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show
that Taiwan's CPI increased by between 3 percent and 4 percent each
year in the first half of the 1990s. A DGBAS official said this was
the result of a severe labor shortage and increases in workers'
wages.
</P>
<P>
The rate of increase in Taiwan's CPI began to slow in the second
half of the 1990s due to economic globalization, output expansion and
the influx of cheap products made in mainland China into the world
market, the official pointed out. He added that CPI increases fell
further starting in 2001 because of drops in product prices in the
home market amid fierce competition.

TAIWAN ACCESS TO VENTURE CAPITAL 4TH EASIEST IN THE WORLD: IMD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan ranked fourth in the world in terms
of availability of venture capital for business development, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) quoted the
International Institute of Management Development (IMD) Wednesday as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
With a score of 6.76 in terms of venture capital easily available
for business development in a criterion of the Swiss IMD for its
World Competitiveness Yearbook 2004, Taiwan was behind the United
States (7.95) , Hong Kong (7.06) and Finland (6.8), CEPD officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was the second-best in this ranking in all Asian countries
behind only Hong Kong, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
According to CEPD tallies, there were a total of 241 venture
capital companies in Taiwan as of 2003, operating 8,719 venture
capital service projects which involved some NT$161.9 billion
(US$4.77 billion).
</P>
<P>
Newly contracted venture capital in 2003 alone totaled NT$16.54
billion, constituting 0.17 percent of the island's gross domestic
product (GDP) that year, marking a record high in the most recent
three years, CEPD officials said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the venture capital was channeled into high technology
industries, with semiconductor manufacturing taking the lion's share,
followed by optoelectronics, electronics, information technology and
telecommunications industries, in that order, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, biotechnology and software development industry
took only an alarming low percentage of 7.3 percent and 1.9 percent,
respectively, of the total venture capital granted in 2003, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
They added that biotechnology and software development industry
are currently two up-and-coming star industries in
industrially-advanced countries and may serve as leading indices for
countries' competitiveness in the world in the near future.

LOW POSSIBILITY FOR CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: LEGISLATURE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Wednesday that the possibility of resuming cross-Taiwan Strait
talks has been reduced considerably given China's reaction toward
President Chen Shui-bian's National Day address.
</P>
<P>
In his Oct. 10 speech, President Chen Shui-bian proposed that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait use the basis of the 1992 meeting in
Hong Kong to seek possible ways in preparation for a step forward for
the resumption of long-stalled cross-strait dialogues, and called for
talks on direct "three-links" between Taiwan and mainland China as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government made its official and harsh response to
Chen's Oct. 10 speech Wednesday, with Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for
mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office, saying that "Chen Shui-bian
claimed that he intends to ease tension and confrontation across the
Taiwan Strait, but he has obstinately stuck to his separatist stance
of 'one country on each side' of the Strait."
</P>
<P>
Chen's words completely promote Taiwan independence, and they are
again a challenge to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,
Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Wang opined that Beijing's reaction reflected its dissatisfaction
with Chen's address, which means that the possibility of resuming
cross-strait talks is slim.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Min-tong, a former vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, noted that Chen's proposal on
convenient and efficient ways to facilitate cross-strait charter
flights for passengers and cargo has gained approval from the
international community, including the United States, Japan and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
However, in Beijing's reaction, it only reaffirmed the "one
China" policy, but avoided the substantial issue of the charter
flights proposal.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Chen has presented many creative proposals on
cross-strait exchanges, expressing hope that the Chinese government
consider the international situation and the welfare of the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait so that cross-strait ties can be
developed benignly.

MOEA WELCOMES U.S. GROUP'S RECOGNITION OF TAIWAN'S IPR EFFORTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said Wednesday it welcomes the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council's public
suggestion that Taiwan be removed from the U.S. government's Special
301 "priority watch" list for intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, a Washington-based private
organization that groups American companies with interests in Taiwan,
publicly urged the U.S. government to take Taiwan off its Special 301
"priority watch" list in recognition of Taiwan's progress in IPR
protection and crackdowns on commercial piracy.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the U.S. organization's recognition of our
achievements in IPR protection," an official with the MOEA's
Intellectual Property Office said, adding that the organization's
suggestion will definitely have a positive effect on having Taiwan
removed from the U.S. "priority watch" list or downgraded to the less
serious "watch" list.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that Taiwan's strenuous efforts to improve
IPR protection is primarily aimed at enhancing its international
competitiveness, not at having its name taken off the U.S. IPR watch
list.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to concerted efforts of ruling and opposition parties, the
official said, Taiwan has completed IPR-related legal reforms,
including the institutionalization of a police agency responsible for
IPR protection and commercial piracy crackdown, as well as
amendments to the Copyrights Law to better protect copyrights.
</P>
<P>
Since the revised Copyright Law was implemented in 2003, the
official said, Taiwan has scored remarkable achievements in IPR
protection.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has twice been left off the top-10 list of
sources of pirated products seized by U.S. customs authorities, the
official said the absence indicates that Taiwan's IPR enforcement has
improved in the past two years and its crackdown on commercial piracy
has paid off.
</P>
<P>
Quoting tallies compiled by the National Police Administration,
the official said the IPR police uncovered 2,017 commercial
piracy cases in 2003, in which NT$6.6 billion worth of counterfeit
goods were seized. In the first nine months of this year, 953 cases
involving IPR infringements and trademark law violations were
uncovered, with NT$7.73 billion worth of goods seized. The official
attributed the rise in the amount mainly to increased inflow of
counterfeit goods.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the police conducted 1,088 spot checks on the island's
84 optical disc manufacturing firms in 2003 and 544 inspections in
the first half of this year, with 200 inspections made at night. The
frequent spot checks have deterred optical disc firms from producing
pirated products, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a recent survey released by the
Business Software Association, Taiwan's software piracy rate was 43
percent, far lower than the average rate of 53 percent in
Asia-Pacific countries. Taiwan's piracy rate was only higher than
Japan's, the official said, adding that the government has set the
goal of lowering the software piracy rate to 40 percent in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that strengthening IPR protection is the government's
policy goal, the official said, the concerted efforts of the public
and private sectors in the past two years have paid off and this
achievement will contribute to the upgrading of Taiwan's
international competitiveness and image.

CHINA'S REACTION TO CHEN SPEECH PREDICTABLE BUT OF NO HELP: CABINET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China's negative response to
President Chen Shui-bian's Double Ten National Day address was
expected, but Beijing's stern words won't help cross-strait
differences, a Cabinet spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai was responding to remarks by Zhang Mingqing, a
spokesman of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, earlier in the day in
which he again reiterated the "one China" principle for cross-strait
talks, and warned of "great catastrophe" if President Chen continues
to push for Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Beijing has consistently adopted a negative attitude
toward Taiwan's overtures, Chen Chi-mai said Beijing's response was
expected, although "a hard mind can't see things in the right
perspective, and stern faces and harsh words also won't help
overcome differences."
</P>
<P>
He urged Beijing to respond to the olive branch extended by
President Chen, saying that there is goodwill as well as positive
policies in his National Day speech, such as the promises in his 2004
inaugural speech will remain unchanged, the establishment of "code of
conduct" between the two sides of the Strait, as well as cross-strait
charter flights for passengers and cargo.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's proposal of cross-strait charter
flight services for passengers and cargo as a way to establish
direct links, Zhang said the three principles governing such links
are that they are internal affairs, utilize direct
two-way charter flights, and create mutual benefits and reciprocity.
Zhang emphasized the "internal affairs" part the most.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also said that charter flight services for Taiwan
businessmen operating on the mainland during the 2003 Chinese New Year
holidays were not covered by these principles and were a "special
case."
</P>
<P>
On this, Chen Chi-mai said these charter flight services, though
only one-way and rerouted via third places such as Hong Kong and
Macau when it was inaugurated on a trial basis in 2003 was a
"valuable experience."
</P>
<P>
Zhang's premise for direct cross-strait links shouldn't become a
hindrance to cross-strait charter flight services between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait during Chinese New Year in the future,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Beijing has long promoted its three principles
before 2003, but it and Taiwan managed to put aside their
differences, and addressed pragmatically the needs of Taiwan
businessmen in the mainland at that time.
</P>
<P>
China knew clearly the procedure of charter flights during
Chinese New Year, and as long as Taiwan carriers make related
applications, the flights should be feasible, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the president urged in his address that both
sides should come back to the long-stalled negotiation table based on
the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The significance of the 1992 meeting is to shelve disputes on
sovereignty and engage in pragmatic exchanges, Chen Chi-mai said,
expressing the hope that both sides can resume talks as early as
possible on issues that have been discussed or have yet to be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged Beijing to see the goodwill in President Chen's
speech and seize the opportunity so that both sides can conduct
talks on matters such as two-way charter flights for passengers and
cargo early.

MAC URGES CHINA TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO PRESIDENT'S REMARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Chinese authorities should
properly interpret President Chen Shui-bian's constructive remarks on
cross-strait relations and respond to them positively, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu was reacting to criticism made earlier in the day by
Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Zhang Mingqing, who said it
was pointless for President Chen to make the remarks when "they are
based on the premise of separatism."
</P>
<P>
In his National Day address on Sunday, Chen called for the
resumption of cross-strait dialogue based on the 1992 talks held by
representatives of both sides in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chen also proposed that both sides establish a "code of conduct"
to maintain peace and start negotiating on the launch of direct
passenger and cargo charter flight services to pave the way for
direct cross-strait air and shipping links.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang accused Chen of "faking temperance but actually
meaning independence for Taiwan, " saying Chen is responsible for
cross-strait tensions for insisting there is "one country on each
side of the Taiwan Strait" and making vicious attack at the mainland
constantly.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the MAC said President Chen's proposals have
fully exhibited Taiwan's proaction, goodwill and integrity.
</P>
<P>
Taipei and Beijing share a responsibility to seek a peaceful
resolution to cross-strait disputes and should look for consensus
through dialogue on ways to maintain long-lasting peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The MAC hopes that Beijing authorities will see the olive branch
extended by Taiwan from an innovative perspective and work together
with Taiwan for cross-strait peace, the statement said.

"Beijing's tirade was expected, but we should not be daunted by
the arduousness of the task of forging cross-strait rapprochement. We
should be patient toward the development of cross-strait relations, "
Chen said after undergoing an annual routine physical at National
Taiwan University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
As the nation's leader, Chen told the media that he is obligated
to defend national sovereignty, dignity and security as well as seek
the greatest possible benefits for the people.
</P>
<P>
"While working to boost popular wellbeing, I must also endeavor
to ease cross-strait tension and avert unnecessary confrontation.
It's an onerous mission. I must have wisdom and good health to
accomplish this duty, " Chen said, adding that the just-concluded
physical showed him to be in good health.
</P>
<P>
Chen also revealed that U.S. authorities have expressed warm
welcome and fervent support in private for his National Day speech
regarding cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. authorities had also told me that Beijing would definitely
issue a sternly worded statement against my peace appeals. They
advised me to remain patient in handling cross-strait affairs. They
also urged our government and people to be patient toward the
development of cross-strait ties, " Chen said. "You can take it easy.
Nothing will happen. Cross-strait ties will remain peaceful."
</P>
<P>
President Chen proposed in his National Day address that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait use the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong
Kong to seek possible ways that are "not necessarily perfect, but
acceptable" in preparation for a step forward in the resumption of
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to himself by his nickname 'A-bian, ' Chen further said
that as any conflict would cause irreparable damage to both sides,
Taiwan and mainland China should seriously consider practical steps
toward "arms control."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore A-bian proposes that both sides should seriously
consider the issue of arms control and take concrete actions to
reduce tension and military threats across the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
For the sake of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait, Chiu said, Beijing should resume talks with Taiwan on issues
that conform with the common desires and interests of the people on
both sides in order to jointly create win-win prospects.
</P>
<P>
In mainland China's first official response to President Chen's
Oct. 19 address, Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for mainland China's
Taiwan Affairs Office, told a news conference in Beijing Wednesday
that Beijing's stance remains unchanged and warned that Chen risked
"great catastrophe" by pushing for independence.
</P>
<P>
"Chen Shui-bian claimed that he intends to ease tensions and
confrontation across the Taiwan Strait, but he has obstinately stuck
to his separatist stance of 'one country on each side' of the
Strait," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"If Chen Shui-bian remains bent on sticking to his splittist and
Taiwan independence activities, he will never bring peace and
prosperity to the Taiwan compatriots, but will only bring great
catastrophe," he said.

New York Times: Tightening race increases
stakes of final debate.

U.S. President Bush and Senator John Kerry meet in their final
presidential debate on Wednesday night after two encounters that
polls suggest weakened Bush and fortified Kerry, leaving some
Republicans concerned that 20 days of the contest would be more
competitive than they had expected. Republicans who had been
confident of victory before the debates said they were uneasy as Bush
returns to a format - 90 minutes of questions from one moderator -
that has seemed to play to the strength of Kerry, a 20-year senator
and former prosecutor.

Wall Street Journal: Tax windfall may not boost hiring despite
claims.

Big companies in the U.S. long lobbied for a tax cut on their
overseas profit as a way to spur job growth. But now that it has been
granted, much of the windfall won't go toward hiring but for such
uses as strengthening balance sheets, buying back shares and making
acquisitions. The one-year break, included in a sweepin g tax bill
that cleared the Senate and went to the president this week, will
allow hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas profit to be
brought home by dozens of U.S. companies at a steeply reduced tax
rate. By some estimates, U.S. companies have parked as much as US$500
billion in profit abroad to avoid taxes back home.

BEIJING URGED TO PUT ASIDE CROSS-STRAIT DIFFERENCES FOR EXCHANGES

Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged mainland Chinese
leaders Wednesday to put aside cross-strait difference for pragmatic
consultations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The premier was responding to the negative response of Beijing
toward President Chen Shui-bian's Double Ten National Day address in
which Chen called for cross-strait negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The premier said President Chen has extended an olive branch
in the utmost sincerity in his speech, but it is a misfortune that
Beijing has stuck to its "one China" ideology, and couldn't see the
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
Yu expressed the hope that the fourth generation of Beijing
leaders can have sufficient wisdom to shake off its iron-clad
"one China "ideology.
</P>
<P>
He urged Beijing to seize the opportunity and base engagement on
the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong to put aside differences and
begin pragmatic consultations.

Zhang Mingqing, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office,

ROUTINE PHYSICAL SHOWS PRESIDENT CHEN IN GOOD HEALTH

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that he is in good health and will be able to safeguard Taiwan over
the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after a routine physical at National Taiwan
University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his regular exercise, Chen said his fatty "toro-shape"
belly already disappeared and that he has recovered from the gunshot
wound he sustained in the March 19 election-eve shooting on the
campaign trail in the southern city of Tainan. A bullet grazed his
abdomen in the incident. A videotape taken by the Presidential Office
on the whole process of Chen's health examination showed a scar on
Chen's abdomen.
</P>
<P>
Chen won re-election by a slim margin a day after the shooting.
His challenger, opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, insinuated
that the shooting might have been staged to help Chen win sympathy
votes. Without offering any evidence to back his allegations, Lien
has filed two lawsuits to challenge Chen's re-election victory. The
Taiwan High Court has yet to mete out its judgments on the two
lawsuits aimed at invalidating Chen's re-election victory and even
the entire presidential election so that a new one can be held.

TSU SUGGESTS PUTTING ALL ILLEGAL MAINLAND IMMIGRANTS ON ONE ISLET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ally of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party suggested Wednesday that the government choose one
islet off the outlying island of Kinmen to set up a detention center
for illegal mainland Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The caucus of the Taiwan Solitary Union (TSU) made the suggestion
amid reports that the military will soon turn over the administration
of six islets -- namely Tatan, Ertan, Tungting, Peiting, Shihyu and
Menghuyu -- to the Kinmen County Government to be opened for tourism.
</P>
<P>
The TSU, in a press conference to highlight the situation that
Taiwan has become a haven for illegal mainland immigrants, said
that one of the six islets, which lies very close to mainland China,
should be chosen to set up the detention center.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming, TSU convener, said that illegal mainland
Chinese immigrants get easy money working in Taiwan, and even if they
are arrested, the period for repatriation could be six months during
which they get treatment for venereal disease and cancer, and have
babies delivered, all without paying medical insurance fees.
</P>
<P>
Their treatment is better than those behind bars in
prison, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Chen suggested that all the illegal Chinese immigrants could be
put in the detention center on the islet off Kinmen, and they could
return to the mainland based on the "mini three-links" model by
paying themselves, or mainland Chinese fishing boats could be allowed
to come to the islet to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
Direct postal, trade and transportation links, or commonly known
as "mini three-links," were established between Kinmen and Matsu and
Fujian province in coastal mainland in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
Chen also suggested that the government confiscate all the money
the illegal mainlanders earned in Taiwan, impose steep fines for the
smuggling rings, and raise the cash award for police nabbing the
illegal Chinese immigrants so as to stem the flow of the immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The TSU also unveiled statistics compiled by the National Police
Administration to show that between 1987 and 2003, they had nabbed
more than 43,600 illegal Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 3,400 illegal Chinese immigrants in a
detention center in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan last year, and the
government has to appropriate NT$4.02 million (US$118,500),
averaging NT$21,000 per illegal mainlander, which the TSU said is a
"serious drain on Taiwan taxpayers."

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE URGED TO CURB RECORD ENERGY PRICES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government officials are worried about
soaring oil and fuel coal prices and economists urged the government
to swiftly tackle the issue to minimize the impact on the country's
economic activities and the people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Although the impact is expected to be less significant than the
one in the 1970s, experts said that high energy prices will
unavoidably add production costs to manufacturers and drag down the
country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the government work out countermeasures as
soon as possible and give the public and industries an orientation to
deal with the situation in the face of a looming wave of hikes in
water rates, electricity fees, ticket fares, construction materials
and petrochemical products.
</P>
<P>
The price of oil pierced through the US$54 per barrel level a day
earlier in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a
21-year high, boosted by strikes in Nigeria and Norway and the
approach of the northern hemisphere winter.
</P>
<P>
The price later fell below US$53 per barrel, but market watchers
called it a natural retreat on profit taking and not a change in the
trend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international fuel coal price also surged to a
historical high of around US$62 per metric ton in the first half of
this year, an astounding jump over the US$26 level registered in the
second half of last year. The price increase has levied a heavy
operating burden on the state-run Taiwan Power Company.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said early this month at the Legislative Yuan
that the government has no plan for the time being to raise its water
and power rates, while an executive at the state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corporation also ruled out the possibility as part of the
government's efforts to help stabilize product prices.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released recently by the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) ,
Taiwan's wholesale price index (WPI) for September rose by 11.43
percent on an annual basis -- the largest rise in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
The September consumer price index (CPI) increased by 2.78
percent compared to the previous year's level, the second-largest
growth in nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
The same tallies show that Taiwan's CPI grew mildly by 1.1
percent per year on average during the 1994-2004 period, lower
than 2.4 percent in the United States and 3.8 percent in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials attributed the WPI and CPI growth mainly to
implications arising from high oil prices that show no signs of
cooling.

TAIWAN IS WORLD'S FOURTH MOST COMPETITIVE ECONOMY: WEF REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,   Oct.  13  (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is the world's fourth most
competitive economy, ranking behind Finland, the United States and
Sweden, according to the Global Competitiveness Report 2004-2005
published Wednesday by the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
Taiwan moves up a notch this year in terms of the WEF's Growth
Competitiveness Index -- the highest ranking of the Asian countries
-- and is followed by Singapore at seventh spot, according to the
report. The leading three economies maintain their same ranking as
last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the Asian economies surveyed, Japan advances to ninth spot
this year in terms of the Growth Competitiveness Index, a jump from
11th place a year ago. Hong Kong ranks at 21st this year, followed by
South Korea at 29th and mainland China at 46th.
</P>
<P>
The report hails Taiwan and Singapore as Asia's best performing
economies and attributes the two countries' top-10 rankings to their
"excellent performance in technology" and "sound macro-economic
environment."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan scores second in technology competitiveness this year, an
advance of a notch from last year, and it grabs ninth spot in terms
of macro-economic situations, an improvement from 18th place last
year.
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan losses ground in terms of the quality of public
institutions, falling to 27th from 21st, and it ranks only at 16th in
terms of the Business Competitiveness Index, a drop of one place from
last year.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is relatively weak in terms of Business Competitiveness
Index, lagging behind Japan at eighth spot, Singapore at 10th and
Hong Kong at 11th.
</P>
<P>
The WEF surveyed 104 economies for its Global Competitiveness
Report 2004-2005, with more than 8,700 responses from business
leaders across the world.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with 109 prominent academics worldwide, it issues
the annual study to serve as a valuable tool for shaping economic
policy and guiding investment decisions.

<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday he will
call a meeting in the next few days to discuss feasible measures for
National Health Insurance-related financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he plans to invite former Department of Health (DOH)
Minister Lee Ming-liang, government officials and legislators versed
in health insurance affairs to contribute their views on the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Yu disclosed his plan a day after about 1,000 healthcare

demonstrated in Taipei to protest what they called an unfair payment
fixed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).
</P>
<P>
Yu said he will solicit opinions of conference-goers about the
appeals made by the demonstrators as well as feasible complementary
measures for the current "Hospital Excellence Plan" and other reform
projects aimed at improving the financial status of the nation's
universal health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
According to DOH officials, the universal health insurance
program faces serious financial difficulties and the program could
collapse if no effective measures are taken to improve its finances.

BEIJING'S REACTION NOT BEYOND EXPECTATION: EXPERT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Vice Minister of National Defense
Lin Chong-pin said Wednesday that Beijing's reaction toward President
Chen Shui-bian's Oct. 10 National Day speech was expected.
</P>
<P>
On Chen's proposal that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait use
the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong to seek possible ways in
preparation for a step forward for the resumption of long-stalled
cross-strait dialogues, the Chinese government said that Chen's words
completely promote Taiwan independence, and they are again a
challenge to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin noted that in his judgment and according to the
information he received in the United States, Beijing has reoriented
its strategies on Taiwan by adopting a more flexible attitude toward
the people of Taiwan, but still has not changed its harsh attitude
with respect to the Taiwan government's position and the island's
space to development in the international community.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lin, who is CEO of the Foundation on International
and Cross-Strait Studies, revealed that Beijing is now drawing a
strategic bead on Taiwan "by causing the fewest human casualties and
the minimum economic losses" and to control the whole of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Lin told the participants at a seminar on national defense that
the Chinese government knows well that there is no need to cause a
large and bloody conflict or to ruin Taiwan and reconstruct it later
with tremendous sums of money.
</P>
<P>
He went on that the military power of mainland China will surpass
that of Taiwan in 2005, and the U.S. Pentagon believes that the time
between 2006 and 2008 will be the most dangerous period for a crisis
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
However, he opined that Beijing will not make a large-scale
invasion, but will launch an "acupuncture war" to paralyze Taiwan's
political and military nerve centers.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the number of China's military satellites will
rise to 30 in 2010 from the current three, which means its military
attack will be of high precision.
</P>
<P>
With apparently superior numbers of fighters, submarines and
cruise missiles, China's military forces can attack Taiwan's Chiasan
Air Base and blockade the east coast, and edge out "third country's"
aircraft carriers from reaching the island's coastal areas.

The World Medical Association (WMA)
recently approved the name change of Taiwan's membership from the
"Chinese Medical Association Taipei" to "Taiwan Medical Association,
"Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that a Taiwan delegation, composed of
Veterans General Hospital President Lee Liang-hsiung, Taiwan Medical
Association's former chairman Wu Yun-tung and medical professors,
successfully persuaded the association to make the change in
discussions at the WMA's general assembly in Tokyo from Oct. 5-9.
</P>

MOFA officials said the successful name change will allow Taiwan
to begin medical diplomacy in the future and end the use of the
confusing name of Chinese Medical Association Taipei, which is often
mistaken as a local organization of China.

<P>
Wu indicated that the WMA has been very supportive of Taiwan's
bid to participate in the World Health Organization, and many of its
chairmen have visited Taiwan, where they were profoundly impressed by
the island's progress in many aspects.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the WMA supported Taiwan's bid to enter the WHO
as an observer in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should work hard to gain the continued support from the
WMA and participate more in its activities, which will help the

TAIWAN GIRDING FOR SOUND INVESTMENT CLIMATE AT HOME: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will continue building an
unfettered investment climate in Taiwan, despite the fact that the
country performs brilliantly in ratings by the world's major research
institutions in recent years, a spokesman for the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the comments after the World Economic Forum
ranked Taiwan as the fourth most competitive economy in the world,
after Finland, the United States and Sweden in its Global
Competitiveness Report 2004-2005 issued earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is the best performing Asian economy in the survey, ahead
of Singapore at seventh and Japan at ninth.
</P>
<P>
The WEF's newest ranking of Taiwan is an indication that the
government has done the right thing in improving the investment
climate at home, and it will keep on doing so to maintain the
country's competitive edge globally, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent proposal by the American Chamber of
Commerce in Taiwan suggesting the U. S. government resume its Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks with Taiwan, he said
that the ministry welcomes such a development but added that it has
not yet received any information from the U.S. side in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral TIFA talks have been suspended for more than one year
due to Taiwan's lackluster performance in resolving key matters
related to foreign rice and telecommunications services, as well as
pharmaceutical pricing and intellectual property rights protection.

ECONOMIC CONVERGENCE WILL LEAD TO POLITICAL CONVERGENCE: DIPLOMAT

<TEXT>
<P>
The economic convergence of Taiwan and
mainland China will eventually result in political convergence of the
two sides, the French ambassador to the United States said in a
speech Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Jean-David Levitte said that France considers Taiwan
and mainland China as one country and hopes that the two sides will
address their differences in a peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
Levitte delivered a speech entitled "Changes in Europe and
America: A French View, " at the School of Advanced International
Studies (SAIS) of Johns Hopkins University, giving his audience a
French perspective of the major blocs around the world today and in
the future.
</P>
<P>
In a question and answer session after the speech, Levitte was
asked whether the French government supports the need to promote
democracy in mainland China by supporting democracy in Taiwan or
believes that commercial interests are paramount and that arms sales
to mainland China should be permitted.
</P>
<P>
Levitte ducked the part about arms sales to China, but gave a
response on the prospects of China's democratization and on the
development of cross-strait relations. "We are in favor of democracy
in China, as we are in favor of democracy all over the world, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
"My personal conviction is that you cannot have a strong market
economy competing so well in this globalized world without democracy
developing at the same time, even without knowing democratic values,
because a market economy brings democracy," he added.
</P>
<P>
"With Taiwan investing so heavily in mainland China, I believe
that this convergence of the two economies will gradually result in
the convergence of the two different regimes," Levitte said.
</P>
<P>
On the changes taking place in mainland China, Levitte said China
today is "a very different China" from 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he lived in China 30 years ago for several years
during the Cultural Revolution, Levitte said that "if you compare the
level of freedom, liberties and market economy in China in the days
of the Cultural Revolution with that of today's China, you'll see
it's a totally different world."

TAIWAN DOCTORS TO JOIN ORBIS 'FLYING EYE HOSPITAL' MISSION IN MYANMAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two senior Taiwan ophthalmologists are
scheduled to visit Myanmar in December, in a trip organized by ORBIS
Taiwan, to join an Orbis Flying Eye Hospital program aimed at helping
treat some 250,000 Burmese suffering from blindness or other vision
problems.
</P>
<P>
The two Taiwan eye doctors -- Dr. Liu Jung-hung, president of the
Cheng Hsin Rehabilitation Medical Center, and Lu Ta-wen, chief of the
Ophthalmology Department of Tri-Service General Hospital -- will join
other counterparts from around the world to take part in World Sight
Day activities in Myanmar to be sponsored by ORBIS International,
according to Cliff Chien, executive director of ORBIS Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
World Sight Day, which falls on the second Thursday of October,
is an annual activity regularly sponsored by ORBIS International, the
World Health Organization (WHO) , the International Cooperation and
Development Fund (ICDF), the International Agency for the Prevention
of Blindness, the Lion's Club International, and 10 other public
interest organizations from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Liu and Lu will be in Myanmar between Dec. 6-10, during ICDF
Taiwan Week, mainly to train Myanmar healthcare workers in the
treatment and prevention of blindness to enable them to better care
for their compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Of the 42 million people of Myanmar, about 252,000 suffer from
blindness or severe vision problems. Nationwide, there are only 183
eye doctors, 32 optometrists and 150 ophthalmology nurses, Chien
said.
</P>
<P>
ORBIS Taiwan, established in 2001, is an affiliate of ORBIS
International, a non-profit organization dedicated to the prevention
of blindness and saving the sight of the visually impaired.
</P>
<P>
According to Chien, there are 45 million blind people around the
world and 135 million others with severe visual problems, 90 precent
of whom live in countries with inferior medical resources.
</P>
<P>
In light of the quality medical services and the existence of a
large number of professionally trained ophthalmologists in Taiwan,
ORBIS International invited in August a number of eye doctors from
the island to join its "flying eye hospital" on a mission to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Mohan Jacob Thazhathu, chief operating officer of ORBIS
International, who came to Taiwan in August for a promotional event,
cited an estimate by the World Health Organization that blindness
costs society some US$25 billion every year, with Southeast Asian
countries bearing approximately US$5.6 billion of that burden.
</P>
<P>
The number of people suffering from blindness in the world can be
stopped from increasing further by merely investing US$200 million
per year in blindness prevention and treatment programs, he said.

CPC, FPCC EACH FINED NT$6.5 MILLION FOR COLLUSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fair Trade Commission meted out a
NT$6.5 million fine to each of Taiwan's two oil suppliers, Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) and Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPCC) ,
Thursday for their tacit business collusion.
</P>
<P>
After long investigations into the marketing practices of the CPC
and FPCC, the commission determined that the two companies have
adjusted oil prices in collusion in recent years, violating fair
trade laws and consumers' rights, Fair Trade Commission Vice Chairman
Chen Chi-yuan said.
</P>
<P>
The Fair Trade Commission had received numerous complaints from
ordinary gas station customers about possible collusion between the
two companies, prompting the commission to begin probing the matter
early this year, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
It was found that the CPC and FPCC had raised or lowered prices
in sync 20 times since 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that although the two companies had not held meetings
or signed any agreements regarding the collusion practices, solid
evidence was found that the two have worked in concert to manipulate
domestic oil prices under a tacit understanding.
</P>
<P>
The commission said earlier this month that if it were confirmed
that the two companies were guilty of collusion, they could each be
fined between NT$50,000 and NT$25 million.
</P>
<P>
The state-run CPC currently controls about 75 percent of the
island's entire oil market. The FPCC has a 25-percent market share,
with 525 gas stations islandwide.

New York Times:
Sharp contrasts for candidates on domestic issues

In a fiercely competitive conclusion to the presidential debates,
President Bush and Senator John Kerry battled Wednesday night over
the state of American health care, the strength of the economy and
whether they would appoint Supreme Court justices who would uphold
the right to abortion for 90 minutes in Tempe, Ariz. The two
candidates displayed a stark contrast in their views of virtually
every major domestic issue - and particularly Bush's economic
stewardship - as they offered a blizzard of figures and statistics to
try to make their cases.

Wall Street Journal: Bush, Kerry in caustic final debate

President Bush, looking for one conclusive debate victory to
regain his campaign's momentum, tore into Sen. John Kerry throughout
last night's event, accusing his opponent of "exaggerations" and "a
litany of misstatements" as well as empty promises and a dangerous
outlook on terrorism. Bush repeatedly described Kerry's record in the
Senate as a string of votes for tax increases and budget-busting
spending.

TRIAL VOLUNTARY MILITARY SERVICE PROGRAM NOT AS POPULAR AS EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial voluntary military service
program which began to be implemented in 2003 on a trial basis has
not been as popular as was expected, sources from the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The MND began implementing the program last year with the goal of
recruiting 647 non-commissioned officers and enlisted soldiers in the
first three stages to be assigned to three military units.
</P>
<P>
However, the three military units -- a missile battalion, a
marine battalion and an air force maintenance and supply group --
have only recruited 328 volunteers as of this week, marking a
recruitment rate of a barely passable 51 percent, said Wu Ta-peng,
director of the MND's Department of Manpower.
</P>
<P>
Of the 328 new recruits, 81 percent have come from within the
military, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the revelation at a Legislative Yuan National Defense
Committee meeting, where he reported on the progress of the voluntary
military service program and other conscription programs.
</P>
<P>
Wu analyzed the reasons behind the lukewarm reception by society
to the voluntary program -- namely that the salary is not high enough
to attract recruits; that the publicity campaign has been not
powerful enough; and that the average physical agility of the
potential volunteer recruits is low.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NT$27,000 monthly salary is about the same as
that for someone beginning their first job, and therefore offers no
incentive to young men to join the military; that nearly 80 percent
of young male civilians were not made aware of the program; and that
only 68.12 percent of the applicants passed the physical agility
tests.
</P>
<P>
Under a "lean and mean" strategy, the MND has envisaged focusing
on voluntary military service starting next year, with the goal of
recruiting 45,000 enlisted soldiers and non-commissioned officers
over a period of four years.
</P>
<P>
In the MND's five-year national defense buildup report which was
sent to the Legislative Yuan last month, the ministry said that
according to the voluntary military service plan, it will increase
recruitment of non-commissioned officers by 4,000 and enlisted
soldiers by 2,000 in 2005, with an additional 21,000 non-commissioned
officers and 18,000 enlisted soldiers over the next three years, to
reach its target of 45,000 non-commissioned officers and enlisted
soldiers by 2009.
</P>
<P>
In line with the nation's military streamlining policy, the
number of military personnel will be cut to under 300,000 by 2009
from the present figure of 360,500, Chen added.

<P>
The fact that Taiwan has been listed as the
world's fourth most competitive economy indicates that the
government's efforts in boosting the economy have gained
international recognition, Executive Yuan officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The officials were referring to the Global Competitiveness Report
2004-2005 released Wednesday by the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
Taiwan moves up a notch this year in terms of the WEF's Growth
Competitiveness Index because of its "excellent performance in
technology" and "sound macro-economic environment, " according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that this is the fifth consecutive year
Taiwan has advanced, while the country's showing has topped other
Asian countries for the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
The results show that the government's measures on upgrading
industrial technology, improving domestic investment environment, and
strengthening the country's economic growth potential have won
worldwide recognition, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said the government will not be complacent about this
achievement but will continue to work harder to maintain Taiwan's

TAIWAN READY TO TALK WITH CHINA ON SENSIBLE ISSUES AT ANY TIME: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is willing to open negotiations with
mainland China on pragmatic issues of mutual concern at any time,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks while giving a speech at the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the MAC has started training negotiation personnel
to serve that purpose, Wu said that the government is poised to hold
negotiations with the mainland at any time on a wide range of
practical matters that are not politically charged, but are mutually
beneficial, such as fishing and trade disputes, illegal immigrants,
crime prevention and tourism exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Resolving these issues through two-way talks will help both sides
boost mutual understanding and build trust to create greater
cooperation and progress in cross-Taiwan Strait dealings, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The MAC chief proposed doing this by beginning with talks on
Chinese New Year charter flight services for mainland-based Taiwan
businessmen wishing to return home for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the proposal has gained full support from Premier Yu
Shyi-kun and that Taiwan is waiting patiently for a positive response
from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He urged both Taiwan and mainland China to take the first step
boldly to forge a favorable atmosphere for a second meeting between
the top negotiators from the two sides, reiterating that it will be a
win-win situation for the two sides.
</P>
<P>
SEF Chairman C. F. Koo and his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) , met for the first time in 1993 in Singapore, based on a
framework reached by Taiwan and mainland officials in a meeting held
a year earlier in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It was decided in the meeting that the two sides would put aside
their political differences to discuss practical matters of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian again extended an olive branch to
Beijing in his Oct. 10 National Day address, calling for joint
efforts to reduce the risk of military conflict, and clear the way
for direct links based on the existing framework.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take the initiative to propose that both sides
use the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong to seek possible ways
that are "not necessarily perfect, but acceptable" as preparation of
a step forward in the resumption of dialogue and consultation, " Chen
said.

MND HOPES DEFENSE BUDGET CAN INCREASE BY 1 PERCENT NEXT FISCAL YEAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of National Defense (MND)
Tsai Ming-shian on Thursday expressed hope that Taiwan's defense
budget will account for 3.5 percent of gross domestic product in
future over the current 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's National Defense
Committee, Tsai said the proposed defense budget increase is to
support arms purchase plans and the implementation of a voluntary
military service program in the future.
</P>
<P>
Tsai noted that the defense budget for fiscal 2005 will total
US$260 billion, accounting for only 2.5 percent of the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
According to opposition People First Party Legislator Lin
Yu-fang, a defense expert, the MND will need an additional NT$380
billion (US$11.2 billion) from 2005 to 2009 to support the
implementation of the voluntary military program in conformity with a
five-year military structural readjustment plan.
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, Lin argued, additional money used for the
plan will mean that NT$76 billion will be unavailable for general
annual defense spending, making it difficult to support the voluntary
military service program.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lee Wen-chong
suggested that the MND increase salaries for enlisted soldiers and
non-commissioned officers who are under a trial voluntary military
service program as an incentive to lure more young people to join the
military forces, while accelerating the reduction in the number of
current military personnel.
</P>
<P>
Tsai stressed that the implementation of the voluntary military
service program is a redistribution of the country's resources, and
the MND believes that without the obligatory military service
program, young people can add more production to the nation by one or
two years.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the cost for the obligatory military service program
is three times that of a voluntary military service plan, Tsai
expressed the hope that the defense budget for fiscal 2006 can be
increased by 1 percent, which would result in an additional NT$100
billion, to account for 3.5 percent of the country's GDP.

MAC INVITES MAINLAND'S TOP NEGOTIATOR TO VISIT TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Thursday again invited a top mainland Chinese negotiator to
visit Taiwan, saying this is the common wish of the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
MAC Chairman Joseph Wu extended the invitation to Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) when he delivered a speech on seizing the opportunity to
restart sensible cross-strait dialogues at the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), a semi-official body set up to handle cross-strait
matters in civilian exchanges and the Taiwan counterpart of ARATS.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that both sides of the Taiwan Strait met in Hong Kong in
1992, during which time both sides displayed the attitude of "shelving
disputes on sovereignty and pragmatically engaging in consultations."
</P>
<P>
Though no substantial agreement was reached in 1992, it paved the
way for historic talks between Wang and his Taiwan counterpart, Koo
Chen-fu, SEF chairman the following year. It was the first
high-ranking contacts between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
after a hiatus of nearly five decades.
</P>
<P>
A flurry of cross-strait contacts afterward also made
possible another Koo-Wang meeting in Shanghai in 1998, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that history will continue to move forward and that
people on both sides of the Strait are hoping for a third meeting
between the two octogenarians to complete the unfinished
consultations in 1998, he openly extended the invitation, saying a
third Koo-Wang meeting is the aspiration of people on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He also took the opportunities to elaborate on the establishment
of a "code of conduct" across the Taiwan Strait, which President
Chen Shui-bian espoused in his National Day address, saying its
purpose is to avoid accidental conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that mainland Chinese leaders in a recent conference
stressed the theme of strengthening the ability to govern,
and the documents approved during the conference showed that mainland
China has encountered problems within itself which will require
a peaceful and stabile environment to settle.
</P>
<P>
But he said that with military confrontation between the two
sides, many people are worrying that accidental conflict could
worsen and become uncontrollable. This is why Taiwan is
willing to face the situation and formulate a "code of
conduct across the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
He said that the content of such a code could include
exchanges of military personnel and information, the
establishment of an emergency hotline and notification mechanism,
joint presence in international security seminars, cooperation to
combat crime, no use or threats of the use of force, not taking the
initiative to attack, mutual notification of military exercises,
military aircraft not flying over the "midpoint" of the Taiwan Strait,
and no use of radar to lock onto aircraft or ships.
</P>
<P>
Among these, not taking the initiative to launch an attack,
mutual notification of military drills, as well as military aircraft
not flying over the "midpoint" of the Strait can be a "tacit
understanding and agreement" between the two sides, while
cross-strait consultations are required for other issues, he added.

GRAND JUSTICES OPEN HEARING ON PETITION TO FREEZE 'TRUTH COMMISSION'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Grand Justices opened a
hearing Thursday on a petition for the issuance of a temporary
injunction to freeze a special statute governing the formation of the
controversial "truth investigation commission."
</P>
<P>
The petition has been jointly filed by the "pan-green alliance"
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, which has also requested a constitutional
interpretation on the opposition-backed statute, which they consider
to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Building a case for the DPP, lawyer Wellington Koo asked the
council to suspend the statute immediately and not to wait until an
interpretation is released.
</P>
<P>
Koo argued that the statute has done irreparable damage to the
Constitution, seriously violating human rights and the constitutional
principle of the division of powers.
</P>
<P>
The mistake will be beyond remedy even if the Council of Grand
Justices declare the statute unconstitutional in the future, Koo
said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the commission, however, argued that a
constitutional interpretation will become superfluous if the Grand
Justices have the power to order a temporary injunction.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ching-feng, spokeswoman for the commission, said the Grand
Justices can interpret the Constitution but are not allowed to create
a new measure that does not exist in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan law, any attempt to abolish a law must be
made in the Legislative Yuan by a majority vote, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
As the hearing was being held, different groups representing both
sides of the issue demonstrated outside the Judicial Yuan offices.
</P>
<P>
The commission is aimed at probing the election-eve shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, which the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party claims was set up by the DPP to give Chen an advantage in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance, " which enjoys a marginal majority in the
legislature, pushed through the statute on Aug. 24. The legislature
upheld the statute in a second vote held on Sept. 14, following the
Executive Yuan's request that the bill be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
The commission was officially formed and started operations on
Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green camp" has refused to join the commission and
sought legal means to try to end its operations.

MOFA CHECKING ALLEGATION THAT FORMER COSTA RICAN HEAD POCKETED MONEY

<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
investigating reports that former Costa Rican President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez pocketing money from Taiwan that was given as donations, a
MOFA spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu made the remarks as reports said that Costa Rican
prosecutors had confirmed that they are investigating alleged
payments by the government of Taiwan to accounts controlled by
Rodriguez, who resigned Oct. 8 as head of the Organization of
American States.
</P>
<P>
The reports also cited Costa Rican media as saying that Rodriguez
received the money of about US$400,000 from Taiwan in 2000 and 2002.
Rodriguez served as president from 1998 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the ROC maintains diplomatic relations with allies
based on long-term mutual trust and sincerity.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's assistance to its allies takes into consideration its
own capacity to provide foreign aid, adding that both sides work on
projects that will benefit the national development of these allies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
All projects are carried out according to established schedules,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that in view of the fact that Costa Rica is currently
investigating Rodriguez for alleged acceptance of commissions from
French company Alcatel during his term, the ministry will refrain
from making comments so as not to obstruct judicial procedures of the
Central American nation.

CHINESE DEMOCRATIC ACTIVIST PREDICTS DRASTIC CHANGES ON MAINLAND

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese democratic activist Wang Dan
predicted Thursday that a tremendous change will take place in
mainland China in 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged Taiwan to promote its experience in democratic
development to the mainland to lower the possible impact of the
change on the island.
</P>
<P>
Wang was delivering a speech at the Mainland Affairs Council to
share his views on the future development of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China is now open to the outside world but that does
not mean reform is on the way.
</P>
<P>
A great deal of crises underlie the fast economic development of
China, which include an unhealthy financial system and the widening
gap of rural-urban development, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
This will lead to drastic changes -- which could be for the
better or the worse -- on the mainland in 10 to 15 years, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In order to lessen the possible repercussions on the island, the
authorities in Taiwan should continue to maintain the status quo with
China and strengthen cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges,
Wang proposed.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan should also promote its democratic experience to
China to let the Chinese people better understand the true meaning of
its Taiwanization movement and bring on a transformation of Chinese
society.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the values of democracy and human rights will be
the only ones common to both sides of the Strait in the future.

<P>
There will be no tax hike this year, but
the feasibility of such a move is yet to be assessed, Vice Minister
of Finance Lin Tseng-chi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks while fielding questions at the Legislative
Yuan at a time when tax reform has again become a focal point in the
face of a wave of domestic product price hikes that seem imminent.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that tax increases are out of the question this year and
he fell short of confirming such a possibility for 2005, saying only
that "the issue has yet to be further evaluated."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to an economic upturn this year, national coffers took in
NT$769 billion (US$22.6 billion) in net tax revenues during the first
nine months of this year, accounting for 85.2 percent of the
full-year target, he reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Economic Affairs Vice Minister
Yiin Chii-ming said that the ministry will consider water and
electricity rate hikes no earlier than before late February next year,
depending on the overall business climate at home by that time. "It

Taiwan is opposed to the European Union
lifting its arms ban against mainland China and will closely monitor
the EU-China summit on Dec. 8 in The Hague, an official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Chun-teh, deputy director-general of the ministry's
European Affairs Department, said the foreign ministry feels the
situation is serious and has been watching developments since late
last year when the EU was reported to be reconsidering the ban that
has been in place against Beijing since 1989 following the Tiananmen
Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the EU must take into account the impact on regional
security and stability in the Pacific Rim should it lift the arms
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China's recent military buildup and modernization poses
a great threat to the Asia-Pacific region's security and stability as
well as to the strategic interests of the United States and Japan,
Hsieh noted, adding that both Washington and Tokyo have clearly
expressed their opposition to the lifting of the arms ban against
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry will continue to actively seek every
possible way to make known internationally its stance, including by
speaking via established channels to the administrative and

ECONOMIC ADVISORY PANEL WORRIED ABOUT HIGH-TECH TALENT SHORTFALL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Economic Advisory Panel to the
President will report to President Chen Shui-bian on Oct. 20 on the
shortage of individuals skilled in the high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
Panel member Wu Rong-i, who is president of the Taiwan Institute
of Economic Research, noted Thursday that there is a large shortfall
in Taiwan in terms of the supply of high-tech experts, which will
seriously affect the island's development in the semiconductor and
TFT-LCD panel industries, in which Taiwan now leads in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, Taiwan needs 1,585 experts with
doctorate degrees and 23,193 with masters degrees in the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
However, it is estimated that schools can only supply 1,140 with
doctorate degree and 18,579 with masters degree in this period,
falling short by 5,000 high-level experts in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged the government to pay high heed to the problem and find
ways to resolve it, suggesting that it seek people from abroad in
addition to strengthening the training of experts at home.
</P>
<P>
The panel members also suggested that the government review its
alternative military service program, in which conscripts can serve
in selected fields such as scientific, as the handsome benefits the
conscripts gain in these corporations will reduce their ambition to
pursue advanced studies abroad, which will affect the cultivation of
highly talented people for the country in the long-run.

U.S. AGAIN CALLS FOR RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington has once again expressed
welcome to President Chen Shui-bian's peace overture to Beijing
spelled out in his Oct. 10 National Day speech calling for a
resumption of cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Responding to reporters' questions at a regular press conference
Thursday, U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that
the department views Chen's speech as "a welcome and constructive
message that offered some creative ideas to reduce tension and resume
cross-state dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Boucher said that "we have urged both sides -- we will continue
to urge both sides -- to take the opportunity to engage in dialogue
in order to resolve the differences peacefully."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not comment when asked by a reporter about the
notion that mainland China sees President Chen's speech quite
differently from the United States and regards it as a provocation
rather than an opportunity for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
A deputy spokesman of the State Department expressed a similar
welcome Oct. 10 immediately after learning about President Chen's
message to China.
</P>
<P>
The State Department official said that the U.S. policies have
remained unchanged -- namely firmly supporting the "one China"
policy, not supporting Taiwan independence, and opposing any moves by
either side that would change the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States has been consistent in its stance
that the cross-strait differences should be solved in a peaceful way
that is acceptable to the people of both sides.
</P>
<P>
President Chen took the initiative to display goodwill toward
Beijing by proposing in his National Day speech that Taiwan and
mainland China use the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong to seek
possible schemes that are "not necessarily perfect but acceptable" as
steps toward a resumption of dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Chen also called for the two sides to seriously consider the
issue of "arms control" and seek to establish a "code of conduct
across the Taiwan Strait" as a tangible guarantee of permanent peace
since "any conflict in the Taiwan Strait would result in irreparable
damage to the people on both sides."

CWB CLOSELY MONITORING TYPHOON TOKAGE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) is closely
monitoring Typhoon Tokage, a "large" typhoon with a radius of 400
kilometers, which has been looming in the Pacific Ocean since Monday.
</P>
<P>
The weather bureau is not expected to issue any warnings for
Tokage on Friday unless the typhoon hastens its pace and continues
moving in a northwestward direction directly toward Taiwan, CWB
meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Tokage, packing maximum sustained winds of up to 136
kilometers per hour, was centered about 1,900 kilometers southeast of
Taiwan at 8 a.m. Friday, moving northwesterly toward Taiwan at a
speed of 12 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The forecasters said they'll be monitoring how the northeastern
trade winds coming from the north influence the typhoon's course over
the following day, adding that Saturday and Sunday will be the
crucial period in terms of determining whether the typhoon will hit
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon is expected to bring tremendous amounts of rainfall
to Taiwan regardless of whether or not it hits the island directly,
they added.

OFFSHORE QUAKE ROCKS ENTIRE ISLAND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 7 on the open-ended Richter scale rattled eastern Taiwan at 12: 08
p.m. Friday, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake was located about 110 kilometers from
the northeastern city of Ilan at a depth of 59 kilometers beneath the
surface of the sea, CWB seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
The temblor shook the entire island of Taiwan, with Ilan and the
neighboring county of Hualien registering the greatest intensity, at
5.
</P>
<P>
The quake had an intensity of 4 in Taipei and Taoyuan in the
north, Taichung and Yunlin in central Taiwan, and Taitung in eastern
Taiwan. It had an intensity of 3 in Hsinchu, Miaoli, Changhua,
Nantou, Chiayi and Tainan, and an intensity of 2 on Penghu Island in
the Taiwan Strait and in Taiwan proper's southernmost city of
Pingtung.
</P>
<P>
CWB seismologists called for the public to be on alert against
possible aftershocks, adding that aftershocks of a major earthquake
may occur one hour, one day, one week, or even one month afterward.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Ilan's Fire Department said that as of 12:45 p.m.,
no damage or casualties had been reported in the city.
</P>
<P>
The National Fire Administration, which has begun checking into
the situation around Taiwan, also said no damage or casualties had
been reported anywhere on the island as of 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan experienced its deadliest earthquake in five decades on
Sept. 21, 1999, when a magnitude 7.6 temblor struck central Taiwan,
killing 2,415 people and injuring more than 10,000 others. Some
100,000 residents were displaced in the quake, and damage to property
was immeasurable.

BEIJING DOESN'T WANT HEIGHTENED CROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS: U.S. SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American China hand said Thursday
that Beijing's response to President Chen Shui-bian's peace overture
was not too harsh, and that the mainland Chinese leadership continues
to want to avoid a heightening of cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Glaser, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), said that Beijing has long demanded
that Taiwan accept the "one China" principle, which she said
President Chen has not done so.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's negative response to President Chen's Double Ten
National Day message was predictable, with mainland China's Taiwan
Affairs Office spokesman reiterating Beijing's distrust of Chen and
its demand that he accept its "one China" principle, Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
She said that Beijing's response was not "excessively harsh, "
and that it is trying to moderate its rhetoric toward Taiwan and
lower the temperature between the two sides, adding that the new
leadership in Beijing does not want heightened tensions with
Taiwan and "hopes for greater stability."
</P>
<P>
Glaser pointed out that Beijing is especially displeased with the
fact that Chen has successfully kicked the ball into China's court,
and that the United States has termed some of the content of Chen's
speech as "constructive " and expressed the hope that China will
respond with its own positive gestures.
</P>
<P>
She said that the United States is willing to "cherry pick" the
positive points from the speech -- namely his suggestions that the
1992 meeting in Hong Kong be used as a basis for moving toward a
resumption of cross-strait dialogue, and that a "code of conduct
across the Taiwan Strait, a confidence-building mechanism and direct
cross-strait air links be established.
</P>
<P>
But China "is analyzing the speech in its entirety and finds the
overall tone and many specific elements provocative, " she said,
adding that Beijing "is strongly opposed to Chen's statement that the
Republic of China is equal to Taiwan, and his emphasis on Taiwan
national identity."

ARTIFICIAL REEFS CONSTRUCTED OFF TAIWAN TO ENHANCE FISHERY RESOURCES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hsinchu,  Taiwan,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Discarded utility poles were
submerged in waters off Nanliao Port in the northern Taiwan county of
Hsinchu Friday to create artificial reefs as part of the government's
fishery resources conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The reefs were constructed under a long-term cooperative program
between the Council of Agriculture's (COA's) Fishery Administration
and state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower).
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, Taiwan has created a large number of
artificial reefs made from discarded utility poles, decommissioned
naval vessels and discarded tires at 100-plus designated areas along
the coastline to enhance fishery resources.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said the artificial reefs not only function to
prevent the deterioration of fishing grounds but also help increase
fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
"The structures provide a foundation that is colonized by coral
polyps and in time becomes thickly encrusted with living coral,
providing an ecosystem in which marine life can thrive, " a COA
official said.
</P>
<P>
With underground electrical wiring becoming a general trend in
recent years, Taipower has donated many waste cement utility poles
for the creation of more than 10,000 artificial reefs in 79 coastal
regions, including Taoyuan County's Yungan, Hsinchun County's
Nanliao, Taichung County's Wuchi, Changhua County's Wangkung and
Hualien County's Yenliao, for conservation of fishery resources and
other marine life.
</P>
<P>
In addition to enhancing fishery resources, the artificial reef
areas have also become points of interest and create new businesses
in such areas as deep-sea diving, leisure fishing and recreational
scuba diving.

FORMER DPP CHAIR PUSHES FOR 'PAN-BLUE' INTEGRATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Democratic Progressive Party (DDP)
Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said Friday that he will call on the
leadership of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP)
shortly to push for the signing of a pact to merge the two main
opposition "pan-blue alliance" parties once and for all.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who served as DPP chairman before the party came to power
more than four years ago, said that all the "pan-blue alliance"
groups, including the New Party, should merge to enable the
opposition forces to secure a majority in the Legislative Yuan after
the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
A co-founder of the new political group -- the Taiwan Democratic
School -- Hsu noted that only by calling all the "pan-blue"
supporters back to vote in the Dec. 11 legislative elections can the
opposition camp win a majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan to
"rebuild a new center of power" for the country.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who had a falling out with the DPP after the party failed to
nominate him to run in the 2000 presidential election, claimed in
July of this year at the inaugural ceremony of the Taiwan Democratic
School that the new group is aimed at "promoting a new democratic
movement to sustain Taiwan's young democracy."
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan has been divided into "two countries and two
peoples" since the bitterly fought March 20 presidential election,
Hsu said the island now needs a new and powerful popular movement to
address this crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hsu and three other Taiwan Democratic School members have
registered to run in the Dec. 11 legislative elections as
independents.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that he will probably call on KMT Chairman Lien Chan and
PFP Chairman James Soong prior to the elections to push for a "big
consolidation" of the opposition forces and to make known the Taiwan
Democratic School's determination to throw its support behind the
"pan-blue alliance" as well.
</P>
<P>
Hsu and Taiwan Democratic School President Hou Hsiao-hsien as
well as Vice President Cheng Li-wen held a press conference Friday to
call for the Taiwan public, particularly TV talk show hosts, to
refrain from using inflammatory rhetoric and abusing the term "love
Taiwan" during the campagin season.

COUNTY CHIEF WANTS TROOPS TO REMAIN ON ISLETS OFF MATSU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid reports that the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) will withdraw troops from six Kinmen islets, the head
of another outlying island has said he opposes the pullout of
troops.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hsueh-sheng, magistrate of Lienchiang County, said Friday
that he is strongly against a similar withdrawal of troops from the
islets off Matsu.
</P>
<P>
The MND has confirmed that it will adjust its deployment on the
six islets -- Tatan, Ertan, Tungting, Peitung, Shihyu and Menghuyu --
and turn over administration of the islets to the Kinmen county
government, with the police to maintain order on the islets.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Matsu have speculated that the MND will also
withdraw its small number of troops currently stationed on the islets
off Matsu, which are located only 11 nautical miles from the mainland
Chinese port of Mawei, Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Kinmen and Matsu will be unable to take over the
islets after the military pullout, and that even the National Park
Administration will be unable to handle them. Even if Matsu wants to
adopt the BOT (build-operate-transfer) model, it won't be able to
attract private sector interest because of a lack of incentives.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he believes that at the present stage, the troops
should remain on the islets, and that the government should make good
use of the unique landscape of the islets by opening them to tourism.
</P>
<P>
The MND's plan to turn over the six islets off Kinmen is at the
request of Kinmen County, but the people of Matsu have expressed
concerns that if the MND withdraws troops from the islets near Kinmen
and Matsu, this will trigger a complete troop withdrawal from Matsu,
which he said would be a major blow to the Matsu economy as spending
by the soldiers stationed there is a major source of income for the
residents.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Kinmen's economic development and that of Matsu
have diverged, with the two relying on the military to different
degrees, which may be the reason why the two counties have different
views on the troop withdrawal issue.

NO MAJOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY FRIDAY'S QUAKE: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No major damage was caused in Taiwan by
Friday's magnitude 7.0 earthquake because the quake's epicenter was
well below sea level and far out to sea, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Yu said that only one man in
Ilan City, eastern Taiwan, and another man in Taoyuan County,
northern Taiwan, were reported injured after the temblor struck at
12:08 p.m. Both men suffered only minor injuries, according to local
government reports.
</P>
<P>
The man in Ilan City was hurt when he was hit by falling ceiling
debris. He received four stitches on his forehead at a nearby
hospital and then returned home.
</P>
<P>
The Taoyuan County man was injured when his left leg was hit by
an iron bar falling from the ceiling which was smashed when a
roof-top water tank overturned at the road-side restaurant where he
was eating. He returned home after receiving treatment at a nearby
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Also in Toayuan County, a fire broke out at a TECO Electric and
Machinery Co. plant only five minutes after the earthquake struck. It
remains to be determined whether the fire was caused by the temblor,
police said.
</P>
<P>
The quake's epicenter was located about 110 kilometers off the
coast from Ilan City, at a depth of 59 kilometers beneath the surface
of the sea, according to the Central Weather Bureau's Seismology
Center.
</P>
<P>
The quake was the strongest to shake Taiwan since the deadly
magnitude 7.6 earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999, the CWB seismologists
said. The 921 earthquake, the deadliest in five decades in Taiwan,
killed 2,415 people and injured more than 10,000 others. Some 100,000
residents were displaced in the quake, and damage to property was
immeasurable.
</P>
<P>
Friday's earthquake was also the third strongest "undersea"
earthquake since Taiwan began to keeping firefighting records in the
early 20th century. A magnitude 8.3 temblor occurred off Keelung,
northern Taiwan, on April 12, 1910, and another magnitude 8.3 quake
occurred on June 5, 1920, off Hualien, eastern Taiwan, the National
Fire Administration reported.
</P>
<P>
Friday's temblor was felt throughout Taiwan, with Ilan and the
neighboring county of Hualien registering the greatest intensity, at
5.
</P>
<P>
The quake had an intensity of 4 in Taipei and Taoyuan in the
north, Taichung and Yunlin in central Taiwan, and Taitung in eastern
Taiwan. It had an intensity of 3 in Hsinchu, Miaoli, Changhua,
Nantou, Chiayi and Tainan, and an intensity of 2 on Penghu Island in
the Taiwan Strait and in Taiwan proper's southernmost city of
Pingtung.
</P>
<P>
CWB seismologists called for the public to be on alert against
possible aftershocks, adding that aftershocks of a major earthquake
may occur one hour, one day, one week, or even one month afterward.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei City, the MRT system was shut down immediately after
the earthquake struck in accordance with standard operating
procedures. Service was resumed about one hour later after the
operators made sure that the system had not been affected by the
quake.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chairwoman of the Taipei 101 Tower, recently
certified as the world's tallest building, expressed satisfaction
with the sturdy construction of the skyscraper.
</P>
<P>
Diane Chen said that Friday's earthquake, which had an intensity
of 4 in Taipei, has helped prove that the Taipei 101 is safe and
strong -- not only in terms of structure, but also the software it is
equipped with and the management's emergency response mechanism.

President Chen Shui-bian decorated five
noted veteran writers with the Order of Propitious Clouds with Grand
Cordon Friday in recognition of their literary achievements.
</P>
<P>
The honored writers were Bo Yang, Chung Chao-cheng, Yeh Shih-tao,
Chi Chun and Chi Pang-yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the decoration symbolizes recognition of the five
veteran writers' career achievements and remarkable contributions to
the promotion of Taiwan's cultural and literary development.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of all honored recipients, Bo Yang, who was imprisoned
for some 10 years during Taiwan's martial law era due to his
criticism of then-top government leaders, said the decoration
signifies Taiwan's evolution to a liberal democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Now is a brand new era in Taiwan. The government recognizes our
literary creations. The decoration ensures that we will never suffer
literary persecution again, " said Bo Yang whose real name is Kuo
Yi-tung.
</P>
<P>
In addition to creative writing, Bo Yang is also a noted columnist
specializing in analyzing major social and political events.
</P>
<P>
Chung Chao-cheng has dedicated himself to Taiwan-centered
literary writing and the promotion of Hakka culture. Yeh Shi-tao has
also contributed much to the development of Taiwanese literature. Chi
Chun is known for her novels and prose rooted in traditional Chinese
culture and Chi Pang-yuan has been a respected literary commentator

DIGITIZATION IS TRANSFORMING LIFE IN 21ST CENTURY: HP CHAIRWOMAN
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 21st century is a totally different era
from the past, with digitization being one of the transformational
trends that is changing people's lifestyle, according to visiting
Hewlett-Packard Company Chairwoman Carly Fiorina Friday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech in Taipei, Fiorina said a massive
transformation is taking place, in which every process and all
content is being transformed from physical, static and analog, to
digital, mobile, virtual and personal.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Fiorina said, while only 20 percent of cameras were
digital five years ago, they are the mainstream product in the camera
market today.
</P>
<P>
Individuals will enjoy easier access to knowledge and services in
the future, and all technological, recreational and government
services will have to be redesigned to meet individual needs, Fiorina
said.
</P>
<P>
She said technology firms and technology-oriented countries like
Taiwan must realize the importance of safety, reliability and
adaptability of technology.
</P>
<P>
For society, corporations and individuals alike, those having a
higher degree of pliability will enjoy the more advantages, she said.
</P>
<P>
Another trend is that value is delivered horizontally, not
vertically, according to Fiorina.
</P>
<P>
Taking Taiwan as an example, she said both corporations and the
government adopted a vertical organization in the past and created
value by setting up different divisions.
</P>
<P>
However, value is now derived from the connection between
different divisions and different products, she added.

TAIWAN DONATES US$1 MILLION TO GRENADA TO HELP WITH HURRICANE RELIEF

<TEXT>
<P>
Following dispatching relief goods and
foodstuffs to Grenada since early September, the Republic of China
donated US$1 million in cash Friday to Grenada to help with
post-disaster rehabilitation in the Caribbean island country that was
ravaged by Hurricane Ivan Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
Grenada Premier Keith Mitchell received a check for the money on
behalf of the Grenada people presented by Jiang Lii-shang, ROC
ambassador to the Caribbean country, at a ceremony held at Mitchell's
office Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the presentation ceremony, Mitchell offered his
sincerest appreciation to Taiwan for its magnanimity and compassion.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell assured Jiang that his administration will use the money
efficiently to help the people get back on their feet again and
expressed his hopes that Taiwan will continue to help to his country.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also stressed the importance of the realization of a
promise that Taiwan has made to Grenada on helping build a sports
stadium in his country.
</P>
<P>
Once the stadium is built, he said, it would be the largest and
best-equipped sports stadium throughout the entire Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
He added that the stadium will also showcase Taiwan's strength
and magnanimity if it were used as the venue of the 2007 World
Cricket Games, which will be held in Grenada that year.
</P>
<P>
After learning that Hurricane Ivan had struck Grenada on Sept. 7,
President Chen Shui-bian and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
telephoned the Grenada government to express their concern about the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Minister Chen also instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
staff to dispatch US$200,000 in relief materials bought in Venezuela
to Grenada in the following days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ROC embassy in Grenada's capital of St. George's
saved the US$5,000 that was originally allocated for the Oct. 10 ROC
National Day celebrations and donated the sum to the Grenada
government for relief.
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 18, Minister Chen traveled to Grenada to express concern
over the natural disaster and facilitating the donations.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after that, the Taiwan agro-tech mission gave more
than 10,000 seedlings of vegetables and crops to the people of
Grenada, followed by the arrival of a full container of foods and
clothes donated by ROC citizens residing in the greater New York
area.
</P>
<P>
Grenada has maintained a close and friendly relationship with
Taiwan since both sides established official diplomatic relations 15
years ago. The Caribbean country also spoke up for Taiwan's bid to
join the United Nations at this year's U.N. Steering Committee
meeting held Sept. 16 in New York.

<P>
Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI)
President Liu Chien-hsiang Friday pledged to continue to consult with
the medical sector for measures to improve the quota system on
medical expenditure coverage.
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing on the issue at the Legislative Yuan, Liu
said the purpose of the quota system is to control unnecessary
increases in medical spending and to let the medical sector share the
responsibility in managing medical resources.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will negotiate with representatives of the medical
sector to set proper quotas while protecting people's right to
quality medical services, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the waste of medical resources and to save the
cash-strapped insurance program from going bankrupt, the government
has set quotas on health insurance coverage of medical spending
depending on the level of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The hearing was held after a group of medical staff from nearly
500 regional hospitals islandwide staged a demonstration earlier this
week to demand the quota for regional hospitals be raised.
</P>
<P>
The protesters claimed the low quota was insufficient to cover
their costs and was forcing them to go out of business.

SMALL BUSINESSES IT BUDGETS TO FOCUS ON SOFTWARE IN 2005: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Flor  Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's small businesses will maintain a
similar spending in the field of information technology (IT) for 2005
as this year, focusing on the improvement of their software, a recent
survey has found.
</P>
<P>
According to poll results released Thursday by IBM (Taiwan) ,
about 70 percent of Taiwan's small- and medium-sized businesses will
match their 2004 budget next year for their IT facilities, mainly to
upgrade their software to improve their knowledge management system,
set up company portal Web sites, improve their electronic working
processes and step up security.
</P>
<P>
The trends mark a departure from last year's mainstream on
building e-mail or Web systems, an indication which an IBM executive
said shows that e-solutions are in greater demand in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 percent of the companies polled said that they will
increase their IT expenditures to modernize their e-solution
equipment. Professional technology, service efficiency and
flexibility are their top considerations while selecting a service
provider, according to the survey. Price factors came after these
elements -- contrary to a popular assumption, it discovered.
</P>
<P>
According to the IBM executive, a lack of correct information and
backward corporate cultures are the leading barriers for domestic
small businesses to launch their e-solution programs.
</P>
<P>
To sharpen small businesses' willingness and capabilities for
advanced knowledge, business owners must have a clear concept and
create an adequate business environment to collaborate, he said.

Recent reports that Taiwan conducted
plutonium separation experiments refer to events 20 or 30 years ago,
a spokesman for the U.S. State Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Boucher made the remarks in response to reports that
preliminary samples taken in Taiwan by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that plutonium separation experiments
probably continued until the 1980s. Plutonium is the raw material to
produce nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the reports referred to what happened in Taiwan in
the 1970s and 1980s, and that the IAEA is studying the history of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
It was common knowledge that Taiwan worked with the IAEA on
monitoring measures on the security of plutonium in the 1970s, he
said.

</P>
<P>
The president will elaborate on the meaning and significance of

PREMIER WELCOMES TOP MAINLAND NEGOTIATOR TO VISIT TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday he
supported the Mainland Affairs Council's (MAC's) invitation to the
top mainland Chinese negotiator to visit Taiwan, saying Wang Daohan,
president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) is welcome to visit the island.
</P>
<P>
Yu echoed the MAC's invitation to Wang during a Legislative Yuan
interpellation session.
</P>
<P>
During the session, opposition People First Party Legislator
Huang Yi-chiao asked Yu about his attitude toward MAC Chairman Joseph
Wu's open invitation to Wang a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
"I definitely support Wu's move. The government's stance is
consistent," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu extended his invitation to Wang while addressing a seminar
Thursday, saying Wang is welcome to visit Taipei to meet with his
Taiwan counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo
Chen-fu.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's legislative session, the Cabinet's top mainland
policy planner was asked about the possibility of Wang traveling to
Taipei for a new round of Koo-Wang meetings.
</P>
<P>
In response, Wu said the MAC is sincere in inviting Wang to
Taipei. Nevertheless, he would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san told a news
conference that Wang agreed to visit Taiwan during his meeting with
Koo in Shanghai in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely invite Wang to visit Taipei at an appropriate time
for a third Koo-Wang meeting, " Chiu said, adding that the MAC hopes
the two elder statesmen can jointly turn a new page in the
development of cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said negotiators from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait met
in Hong Kong in 1992 where both sides displayed the attitude of
"shelving disputes on sovereignty and pragmatically engaging in
consultations."
</P>
<P>
Although no substantial agreement was reached at the 1992 Hong
Kong meeting, Chiu said it paved the way for the historic Koo-Wang
meeting in Singapore the following year. It was the first-ever
high-level meeting between the two sides after a hiatus of nearly
five decades.
</P>
<P>
The ice-breaking meeting laid the foundation for regular
SEF-ARATS dialogues. A flurry of cross-strait contacts afterward also
made possible a second Koo-Wang meeting in Shanghai in 1998. However,
Beijing unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS dialogues in
mid-1999 to vent its anger at then-President Lee Teng-hui's defining
cross-strait relations as "state-to-state" in nature.
</P>
<P>
Noting that people on both sides of the Strait look forward to a
third Koo-Wang meeting to complete the unfinished consultations in
1998, Chiu said the MAC welcomes Wang to visit Taipei to realize this
common wish.
</P>
<P>
"Earlier this week, Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for mainland
China's Taiwan Affairs Office, also expressed the hope in a news
conference in Beijing that the two sides can enhance mutual
understanding through increased civilian exchanges and cooperation, "
Chiu said, adding that since Beijing desires enhanced mutual
understanding, it should jointly work with Taiwan to pave the way for
a third Koo-Wang meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have extended our invitation. We'll show maximum goodwill and
flexibility in making concerted efforts with Beijing to craft a
setting for a third Koo-Wang meeting," Chiu added.
</P>
<P>
The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by their respective governments to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian heaped praise on
Taiwan's oldest motorcycle manufacturer Friday at the company's
50-year anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The president hailed Sanyang Industrial Co. for setting five
"Taiwan first" records: the producer of the first motorcycle on the
island; the first Taiwanese motorcycle company with its own trade
mark promoted worldwide; the first motorcycle enterprise with
whole-plant export experience to other countries; the largest R&amp;D
facilities in Taiwan for motorcycles; and the first company able to
produce cars and motorcycles at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The five "Taiwan first" records have contributed significantly to
Taiwan's economy, and reflect the process of Taiwan's economic
development during the last half century, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that according to a report released by the World
Economic Forum Wednesday, Taiwan was ranked fourth in the world in
terms of the Growth Competitiveness Index, and holds the top spot in
Asia for a third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Although Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said modestly that Taiwan must
work harder to vie for third place in the world in terms of growth
competitiveness, Chen encouraged everyone to strive to be number one.

LINGERING US$60/BARREL OIL COULD TRIGGER 'STAGGERING INFLATION': CEPD
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should oil prices rise above US$60 per
barrel and stay there for over a year, Taiwan would be hit with
"staggering inflation," a key government official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Ming-feng, vice chairman of the Cabinet's Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said that such a situation
would push up product prices and drag down the country's economic
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD vice chairman made the remarks after the international
price of oil skyrocketed to a 21-year high of US$54 per barrel
Tuesday in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Although the price retreated below US$53 per barrel, market
analysts pointed out that there was no change in the trend.
</P>
<P>
As world oil prices have been maintained at a level of over US$50
for more than two weeks, Yeh said that the CEPD may call an
inter-ministerial meeting next week to gauge the situation to
minimize its impact.
</P>
<P>
He forecast that the price of oil will not drop below US$50 by
the end of this year with the approach of winter in the northern
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials tried to calm inflation fears by saying that
inflationary pressures are under the control of the government,
despite the fact that a wave of product price hikes is just around
the corner.
</P>
<P>
Experts have called on the government to work out countermeasures
soon to help lead the public and industries through the foreseeable
difficulties arising from higher spending and costs.

The Council for Economic Planning and

</P>
<P>
CEPD Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng will personally head the office
while CEPD Vice Chairman Hsieh Fa-ta will serve as chief executive to
handle day-to-day affairs, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The special office is scheduled to open at the end of this month,
the official said, adding that the office will hire researchers to
help draw up comprehensive service industry promotion plans.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, the official said, the government will
invest NT$100 million for various service industry promotion
programs.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEPD's plan, the service sector will account for
more than 70 percent of Taiwan's annual gross domestic product (GDP)

</P>
<P>
In addition to thanking Fiorina for HP's large purchases every

charter flight services for passengers and cargo.
</P>
<P>
The HP chairwoman publicly called for cargo charter flights
between Taiwan and mainland China last year.

Chen said that Taiwan is keenly hoping for normal trade and
economic relations with mainland China and reiterated his call for
early two-way negotiations on cross-strait charter services he
advocated in his Oct. 10 National Day address.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the issue is mutually beneficial for both Taiwan

<P>
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Chen
Chien-jen pledged Saturday to hold a civic meeting before the end of
this year to discuss measures to reform the National Health Insurance
program.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is a professor at National Taiwan University's College

31 to join government service.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he hopes that holding the civic meeting will help to

</P>
<P>
He said the DOH is currently planning to hold the civic meeting
in December, after representatives to the meeting are selected in
November.

Meanwhile, on DOH Deputy Minister Chang Hung-jen's offer to
resign, Chen said he hopes Chang will change his mind and stay.

TAIWAN WANTS TO PLAY MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL AID: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
urged the international community Saturday to give Taiwan fair
opportunities to take part in international aid projects with
dignity.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal while delivering a keynote speech at the
opening of a seminar on the general world trends in foreign aid,
co-sponsored by the International Cooperation and Development Fund
under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Taiwan Thinktank, a
private group.
</P>
<P>
Because of Beijing's ubiquitous diplomatic embargo, Chen said,
Taiwan faces serious difficulties joining international cooperative
programs.
</P>
<P>
"International isolation has denied us fair opportunities to
participate in international aid projects with dignity, " Chen said,
adding that unreasonable restrictions have hindered enforcement of
Taiwan's international aid work.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Chen said, Taiwan has donated funds to help finance
post-war reconstruction projects in Afghanistan and Iraq. Much to its
regret, Chen added, Taiwan was barred from sending representatives to
attend international donors meetings held in Japan simply because of
Beijing's opposition. "This was extremely unfair to us," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of Taiwan's economic development, Chen said,
Taiwan received aid from other countries. Through such assistance and
the concerted efforts of the Taiwan people, Taiwan has now emerged as
the world's 15th largest trading nation.
</P>
<P>
"We are now able and willing to share our knowledge and
experience with other developing countries through international
cooperative programs, " Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as Taiwan is granted fair opportunities and dignified
treatment, it will definitely be able to play an active and
constructive role in the world arena," he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite facing "political apartheid" in the world community, Chen
said the Republic of China government will continue to join
international humanitarian aid projects and assist needy countries in
economic development in order to fulfill its duty as a member of the
Global Village.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen said, the ROC government will help Taiwan's
non-government organizations and private groups to take part in more
international humanitarian aid projects in the future.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Japan International Cooperation Agency have been
invited to attend the seminar to offer counseling on the promotion of
international aid work. Other conference goers include local
scholars, social workers and business executives.

Importing less expensive drugs not seen as cure
for U.S. woes.

U.S. Senator John Kerry, the Democratic
presidential candidate, has made a campaign 
pledge to help cut Americans' prescription drug 
costs by allowing them to import drugs from 
Canada. President Bush has conceded that the 
idea is worth a try "if there's a safe way to do
it. "Bipartisan legislation in Congress would
allow the reimportation of prescription drugs
from Canada and other industrialized countries.
It may make political sense to point to Canadaas
a solution to high prescription drug prices
in the United States. But many economists and
health care experts say that importing drugs
from countries that control their prices would
do little to solve the problem of expensive
drugs in the United States, where companies are
free to set their own prices. Even the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
estimated that allowing Canadian drug imports
would have a " negligible" impact on drug
spending.

Wall Street Journal: Greenspan warns further

three-quarters of a percentage point off
economic growth this year, Greenspan said in
a speech to the National Italian American
Foundation in Washington. That is a far smaller
effect than when oil shot up in the 1970s, he
said. But the "risk of more serious negative
consequences would intensify if oil prices were

35% OF WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS REGULARLY STAY LATE AT OFFICE: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 35 percent of white-collar workers in
Taiwan regularly remain at the office after their normal work hours
are up, according to the results of a survey released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Topping the list of reasons for staying late was unfinished work,
mentioned by 61.47 percent of the respondents, followed by a desire
to work harder in the hopes of earlier career advancement, mentioned
by 26.61 percent. The No. 3 reason was wanting to use the office
facilities for things not related to work, mentioned by 24.77 percent
of the respondents.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the 1111 Job Bank between Oct. 7-15
on 2,172 white-collar workers. The poll is said by its authors to
have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The results seem to correspond with the 2003 Year Competitiveness
Yearbook released by the International Institute for Management
Development, which showed that the Taiwan people top the global list
in terms of average number of work hours per person in a year at
2,282.
</P>
<P>
According to human resources statistics compiled by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics in September
of this year, Taiwan workers in the 20-29 age group work an average
of 2,159 hours per year; while those in the 30-39 age group work
2,166 hours per year; and those in the 40-49 age group work 2,170
hours.
</P>
<P>
The 111 Job Bank survey found that 52 percent of the respondents
feel lonely and empty after work, while 60 percent said they could
not identify their goals in life. These two problems were found by
the survey to be most common among workers in the 20-29 age group.
</P>
<P>
1111 Job Bank spokesman Wu Rui-ying attributed this to the fact
that most people under 30 years old are single and therefore tend to
feel lonely if they have no one to talk to after work. He also said
that most workers in this age group are not married and don't have a
family, adding that after they get married, their "family" will
automatically give their life a a purpose.

ALL FOREIGN AID OFFERED IN LINE WITH LEGAL PROCEDURES: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's aid to its diplomatic allies has
consistently followed stringent legal procedures, Minister of Foreign
Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen was responding to reports that Nicaraguan President Enrique
Bolanos may be impeached due to his alleged acceptance of huge
foreign political contributions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government has long formulated comprehensive
regulations governing the offering of aid to other countries, Chen
said, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is unlikely to
distribute foreign aid in violation of those rules.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Chen explained, the government usually signs a
five-year cooperative agreement with the aid recipient country in the
first phase, with the agreement outlining concrete cooperative items,
such as the building of bridges or hospitals, followed by the MOFA
providing funds in accordance with progress in each specific
construction project.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan follows its legal procedures to the letter in
offering aid to foreign countries, Chen said that the manner in which
the recipient countries handle the cooperation projects is a
different matter.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the reported possible impeachment of Bolanos is a
Nicaraguan internal affair, Chen said the MOFA is not in a position
to comment on or get involved in the issue. He added that the MOFA
will ask the nation's embassy in Nicaragua to look into what has
happened for its reference.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Taiwan has ever offered political contributions to
any individual foreign political figures, Chen categorically ruled
out the possibility, stressing that foreign aid is primarily aimed at
assisting in diplomatic allies' national development and the
improvement of their people's livelihood and well-being.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on media reports that former Costa Rican President
Miguel Angel Rodriguez has been detained for allegedly accepting
bribes, including illegal political donations from Taiwan, Chen said
the reports were not correct.
</P>
<P>
"All the allegations about Taiwan offering political
contributions to individual foreign political figures were unfounded,
" Chen said, adding that Taiwan has consistently followed proper
legal procedures in offering aid to its diplomatic allies.

ARSENIC IN GROUNDWATER INCREASES CANCER RISKS: DOH HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's top health official said
Saturday that regular users of groundwater that contains high
levels of arsenic are at greater risk of developing cancer.
</P>
<P>
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Chen Chien-jen made the
remarks while giving a report on the health hazards of
arsenic-containing groundwater in a seminar sponsored by the National
Health Research Institutes (NHRI).
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed to a study of residents in southwestern Taiwan and
in Ilan, northeastern Taiwan, who regularly use groundwater. The
study found a direct relation between arsenic levels in the
groundwater and the risk of developing cancer.
</P>
<P>
In the study, a group of people who regularly drink groundwater
with an arsenic level of 300 ppb (parts per billion) was
compared with a group who regularly use groundwater with an arsenic
level of 0.1 ppb. The results showed that those in the first group
were four times more likely to develop lung cancer, eight times more
likely to develop bladder cancer, and 20 times more likely to develop
skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is an epidemiologist, said that a person who regularly
uses groundwater and who also smokes is 15 times more likely to
develop lung cancer than someone who does not. He therefore urged
those who drink groundwater to check the arsenic level and filter out
the heavy metal, and advised smokers to quit.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that drinking groundwater that contains arsenic can
also lead to pancreatic problems, dementia, diabetes, and
cardiovascular problems.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the
World Health Organization have revised the safety standard for
arsenic levels in water to 10 ppb from the original 50 ppb, and that
Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration followed suit last
year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shu-li, an NHRI associate researcher, speaking on the same
occasion, said that many residents in Peimeng, Hsuehchia in Tainan
County used to suffer from an endemic disease called "black foot
disease" in the 1950s because of long-term use of artesian well water
that contained high levels of arsenic.
</P>
<P>
Now, the ratio of Peimeng and Hsuehchia residents who suffer from
pancreatic problems, diabetes, retinal problems, or cardiovascular
problems is much higher than for residents in the rest of Taiwan.

<P>
Taiwan's de facto consulate in Los
Angeles sent a petition Friday to the L.A. missions of 23 E.U. member
nations urging that the European Union's ban on arms sales to
mainland China not be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The petition was written under the name of Wei Wu-lien, director
of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Los Angeles,
with the signatures of hundreds of Taiwanese and foreign supporters.
</P>
<P>
The petition urges the European Union not to lift its arms
embargo against mainland China for the sake of global security and
peace, and calls the European Union's attention to Beijing's
continuous military buildup.
</P>
<P>
It also warns that a lifting of the ban would sharpen the crisis
across the Taiwan Strait, spur an arms race, and give rise to
regional conflict.

In early October, the TECO in L.A. also launched a "Global

PREMIER PLEDGES TO HELP DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONICS SECTOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday that the
government will continue to provide an investment environment that is
conducive to the stable growth of the electronics industry and to
work to build Taiwan into a "technology island."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the 2004 Taipei International
Electronics Show on finished products, Yu said the electronics sector
can claim much credit for Taiwan's excellent competitiveness showing
-- which ranks fourth in the world according to the 2004-2005 Global
Competitiveness Report released by the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
In the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2004 published by the
International Institute for Management Development, Taiwan's
competitiveness ranked 12th in the world, up from 17th place for the
previous year, Yu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
With Taiwan's economy recovering since the second half of last
year, export orders and the volume of outbound shipments are hitting
new highs, and investment by the private sector has increased by 20
percent in the first half of this year, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said major economic research institutions in Taiwan
have revised their economic growth forecasts for Taiwan for 2004
upward to 5.5 percent -- which, if achieved, would be the highest in
four years.
</P>
<P>
While the semiconductor sector's overall production is expected
to top NT$1 trillion (US$29.53 billion) for this year, that of the
optoelectronics sector is likely to reach the same level next year,
Yu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the high-tech industries have unlimited
development potential, they also face the challenges of a high
technology replacement rate and short product lifespan. Therefore,
they need to carry on with their research and development efforts to
meet these challenges, he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the government will continue to guide the
development of the high-tech industries and provide them with a
stable and desirable environment in which to operate in order to
attract more enterprises to firmly establish their roots in Taiwan.

GOV'T TO STEP UP MONITORING OF EELS AFTER ANTIBIOTIC RESIDUES FOUND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will step up monitoring of
eels for export following reports that some eels exported to Japan
had been found to contain bactericidal residue, the Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the COA's Fisheries Administration said that they
will issue directives next week calling for antibiotic enrofroxacin
tests to be conducted and for the requirement that antibiotic-free
certificates be issued before any eels are allowed to be exported.
</P>
<P>
The officials also asked eel growers to exercise self-discipline,
to observe norms in using antibiotics for the eels, and to not use
unauthorized bactericide.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that some Taiwan-originating live eels and
processed eel were found last October to contain sulfamethazine (SMZ)
, and that Japan kicked off testing of eel imports from Taiwan the
following month. SMZ is a drug used to treat a variety of infections.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the government and the eel growers have taken several
steps to strengthen safety controls on eel exports, including
implementing the requirement that eels for export be tested for the
presence of residue of five types of antibiotics, including SMZ and
oxolinic acid.
</P>
<P>
Every batch of eels exported also has to pass tests to ascertain
that they contain no pesticide residues, and must receive export
approval from the Fisheries Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Fisheries Administration also provides aquaculture and
management classes to the eel growers.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that as of the end of this September, no eels
exported had been found to contain SMZ residue. Japan lifted its
inspection order for Taiwan eels Aug. 9, but recent individual cases
have led to a reimposition of the order.
</P>
<P>
Fishery officials said that they have confidence in upgrading the
hygiene quality of Taiwan's eel ponds, adding that they will
consistently promote a good aquaculture environment for the eel
ponds, establish a good monitoring system, step up the campaign
against illegal bactericide, and increase testing for the presence of
illegal bactericidal drugs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by the Fisheries Administration showed that Taiwan
produces about 22,000 tons of eels a year, with 90 percent of that
total being exported to Japan.

ETHNIC, CULTURAL DIVERSITY AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL ASSET FOR TAIWAN: CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
ethnic and cultural diversity has not only been an important social
asset for Taiwan but also a driving force behind the island's social
progress.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of an ethnic and cultural development
conference held at the National Central Library, Chen said Taiwan has
experienced successive waves of immigration over the past four
centuries.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the aboriginal citizens, native Taiwanese, Hakka
and mainlanders that now populate Taiwan, many new immigrants have
also come to Taiwan through marriage or naturalization in recent
years amid globalization and liberalization, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"Against this backdrop, our population has become ever more
diverse, " Chen said, adding that this ethnic diversity has injected
new blood and vitality into local society.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said the various ethnic groups should respect and
recognize one another's differences and unique features in order to
create a harmonious living environment and forge a common national
identity.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has come a long way in its national
development, the president said some historical ethnic rifts might
have left wounds and scars. Chen said that he hopes that from now on,
all the people of Taiwan can forget and forgive past "mistakes" and
treat each other with understanding, respect and goodwill.
</P>
<P>
"Let's forget any bitter memories. Let's see no more ethnic
disharmony, and let's work hand-in-hand for national progress and
prosperity from now on," he urged.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lyric voice of Tu Ying-hui from Taiwan
floated through the air of the East Railway Station in Paris Saturday
as she read a poem in Chinese in front of a crowd of book-lovers
sitting on a corner at the station, one of 18 major railway stations
in cities around France that have joined in the annual Reading
Festival.
</P>
<P>
Tu works for Taiwan's Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs,
and her job is to encourage residents nationwide to read. In order to
study France's efforts in promoting reading, Tu came to Paris to
participate in the 16th Reading Festival that kicked off Friday
around the country and will last for three days.
</P>
<P>
She read a poem by Taiwanese poet Chen Yi-chi to the onlookers,
while Tang Shu-chuan, a staff member of Taitung City Government's
Department of Cultural Affairs, read a verse of Tang poetry.
</P>
<P>
Tu told the Central News Agency that various activities related
to the reading festival have not only been held at schools, libraries
and bookstores around France, but also in public spaces, such as
railway stations and street corners, and even at some hospitals and
prisons.
</P>
<P>
She said that it is difficult for efforts at promoting reading to
bear fruit in a short period of time, but added that through the
organizing of colorful and interesting activities, like the annual
Reading Festival in France, people can be drawn to experience the joy
of reading.
</P>
<P>
France has held the annual Reading Festival for the past 16
years, while the festival activity at the railway stations has been
held for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 festival has a "bookstore" theme, with organizers
arranging an activity called "sleepless in bookstores, " inviting the
public to remain late in bookstores that stay open until midnight or
around the clock during the festival.
</P>
<P>
According to the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs, the reading
festival has so far been introduced into 91 countries around the
world.

<P>
The recent report of avian flu transmission
in a Thai family does not mean there will be an outbreak, an
epidemiologist said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Michael M. C. Lai, vice president of the Academia Sinica, made
the remarks when he delivered a speech on the mystery of the virus
and its impact on human beings. The speech was one of the activities
to mark the 50th anniversary of the top research institute in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said the accidental transmission of bird flu to humans
should be considered as accidental cases as it is not a human flu
after all. The health of each individual varies and so there is this
isolated case.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that if a person contracts the bird flu and the
human flu simultaneously, then the genes of the two viruses could
interact and mutate into a new virus, which would then be a source of
serious concern.

The 2004 Hsinchu rice noodle and pork
meatball festival kicked off in the northern Taiwan city Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rice noodles and pork meatballs are Hsinchu's most famous
delicacies, and the city wants to use the festival to promote them
and the city.
</P>
<P>
Hsinchu Mayor Lin Cheng-tze invited the mayors of Hsinchu's
sister cities in the United States and Japan -- namely Mayor Pat
Evans from the city of Plano in Texas and Mayor Seiji Hagiwara from
Okayama City -- to join him and Hsinchu residents in making the
longest rice noodle in the world.
</P>
<P>
Together, they were able to make a rice noodle 12,000 centimeters
in length, shattering the old world record of 10,000 centimeters and
bringing the day's activities to a climax.
</P>
<P>
The three mayors then displayed their culinary skills by frying
the rice noodles. Their "rice noodle dishes" were then put up for
charity auction, fetching a total of NT$16,000 (US$473).
</P>
<P>
Evans and Hagiwara also brought with them several members of
council of their respective cities, and they all enjoyed rice noodles
and pork meatballs cooked in various styles.
</P>
<P>
Lin Kuang-hua, governor of the Taiwan provincial government,
welcomed the foreign guests to the festival and invited them to
Hsinpu Township in Hsinchu County later to savor another local
delicacy -- preserved persimmon -- and to experience the Hakka
culture there.

<P>
Asia-Pacific countries should work
together to develop a joint missile defense system in the face of
mainland China's fast growing military strength, Vice Defense
Minister Tsai Ming-hsien said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on the present state and prospects for Asian
security, Tsai said mainland China's continued military buildup has
become the biggest "variable" to Asia-Pacific regional stability and
peace.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said mainland China has deployed 610 ballistic missiles
along its southeastern coastline and that the number of its
missiles deployed in the region is growing by 50 to 70 annually.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Tsai said the Taiwan-U.S.-Japan security
dialogue mechanism should be upgraded to an official- or
quasi-official level and Asia-Pacific countries should cooperate in
developing a joint missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsai, Taiwan has expressed its willingness to
the United States through various channels to join the U.S.-proposed
theater missile defense (TMD), but U.S. authorities have not yet
given a clear response.

President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday
Taiwan is unlikely to offer political contributions to any individual
foreign political figure.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while attending an evening party
co-sponsored by the International Cooperation and Development Fund
under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Taiwan Thinktank, a
private group.
</P>
<P>
Chen's statements came amid reports that Nicaragua President Enrique
Bolanos may be impeached due to his alleged acceptance of political
contributions from Taiwan and that former Costa Rican President
Miguel Angel Rodriguez has been detained for allegedly accepting
bribes, including political donations from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's aid to foreign countries has not been done out
of charity nor is it an act of 'dollar diplomacy.' We have offered
aid primarily for helping resolving issues of human survival,"
Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
Based on this idea, Chen said, Taiwan is absolutely not
likely to offer political donations to any individual
foreign politician.
</P>
<P>
The evening party was organized to entertain foreign
and local participants to a seminar on the general new world trends
in international aid projects. Twenty-six young Taiwan volunteers who
will soon head for 12 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies for volunteer
services also attended the party.

</P>
<P>
"We'll never launch the first strike. But in line with our
'effective deterrent and firm defense' strategy, we need
counterattack arms so that Beijing would have to pay 'big price' in
case it attacks Taiwan, " Tsai said. However, he didn't elaborate on

<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
reiterated Sunday that all foreign aid that Taiwan offers is
implemented in accordance with plans and there never have been any
aids given out as political contributions.
</P>
<P>
Chen was referring to allegations that Taiwan had conducted
dollar diplomacy under the guise of foreign aid to Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
formally give an explanation to the Costa Rican government shortly,
as it has required, on Taiwan's aid plans to Costa Rica, including
those conducted during the stint of former President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
"There were absolutely no political contributions to Costa Rica,"
Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks when he was at a stump for Democratic
Progressive Party legislative elections candidate Lin Chung-mo.
</P>
<P>
Former Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez has been
detained for allegedly taking huge sums of kickbacks from Alcatel, a
French telecom company. The Costa Rican government is also reportedly
investigating into allegations that Rodriguez received political
donations from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice Foreign Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau said Sunday
that the MOFA-initiated foreign aid has been conducted in accordance
with a set standard operating procedure (SOP) under the supervision
of the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the exact amounts of cash aid to countries
varied and have been kept secret to avoid diplomatic faux pas, as
well as jealousy by other countries.
</P>
<P>
Kau said that the MOFA will present explanations on Taiwan's cash
aid to Costa Rica after further understanding.

TYPHOON TOKAGE MAY MISS TAIWAN, BUT RAIN EXPECTED: WEATHER BUREAU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Weather Bureau is closely
monitoring Typhoon Tokage and tropical storm Nock-Ten, although
Tokage has decreasing chances of directly hitting Taiwan and Nock-Ten
is still very far away.
</P>
<P>
According to bureau forecasters, Typhoon Tokage, which has been
looming in the Pacific Ocean since Oct. 12, was centered about 880
kilometers south-southeast of Okinawa at 10: 30 a.m. Sunday, moving
northwesterly toward Taiwan at a speed of 18 kilometers per hour. It
was packing maximum sustained winds of up to 154 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The weather bureau is not expected to issue any warnings for
Tokage on Sunday or Monday unless the typhoon hastens its pace and
moves more westerly toward Taiwan, bureau meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
The forecasters said they'll be monitoring how the northeastern
trade winds coming from the north influence the typhoon's course over
the following days, adding that the typhoon is expected to bring
tremendous amounts of rainfall to Taiwan in the following couple of
days regardless of whether or not it hits the island directly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tropical storm Nock-Ten was centered some 4,000
kilometers away from Taiwan as of 10:30 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is still too early to determine whether Nock-Ten -- moving in
a west-southwesterly direction at a speed of seven kilometers per
hour -- will directly affect Taiwan or not, the forecasters said.

MOST TAIWAN RESIDENTS DON'T THINK CHARTER FLIGHTS 'INTERNAL AFFAIR'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A majority of Taiwan residents do not think
opening direct charter flight services across the Taiwan Strait is an
"internal affair" as mainland Chinese officials put it, according to
results of a government-conducted public opinion poll released
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 67.2 percent of Taiwan adults said that it is
unacceptable to them that officials from mainland China's State
Council's Office of Taiwan Affairs set a premise for the start of
cross-strait talks over charter flight services that such talks would
be China's "internal affair, " according to the poll sponsored by the
Government Information Office.
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll, conducted Oct. 13-14, found that 63 percent
of the respondents think the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
resume official dialogue, while 19 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
Just over 71 percent think that Taiwan and mainland China should
build a military mutual trust mechanism to help reduce cross-strait
tensions. Only 17 percent said nay to the notion, according to the
poll.
</P>
<P>
On who is to blame for the cross-strait political deadlock, 42.7
percent said that China should bear the responsibility, compared with
20 percent who said President Chen Shui-bian is to blame.
</P>
<P>
A total of 44.8 percent of the respondents said that President
Chen demonstrated true sincerity in the remarks he made in his Oct.
10 National Day speech about efforts to improve cross-strait
relations. Some 30 percent said Chen did not.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that respondents aged between 20-29 are most
supportive among all age groups for President Chen in this regard,
followed by those in the 40-59 age group.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53.2 percent approved of the idea expressed by Chen in
his National Day speech that "the Republic of China is Taiwan and
Taiwan is the ROC, " also with the greatest support by those from the
youngest age group.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the poll also found that 41 percent of the
supporters of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" approved of
President Chen's advocacy, while another 41 percent of this group
thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
On the future of Taiwan, 30 percent of the respondents support
Taiwan independence or the notion of "one side, one country, "
compared with 54.9 percent who said they support the status quo for
Taiwan and mainland China, and only seven precent supported
reunification or the "one country, two systems" formula, the poll
found.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,115 valid responses were collected in the poll of
randomly selected Taiwan adults islandwide. The survey had a margin
of error of plus or minus 2.99 percentage points.

PREMIER STUMPS FOR RULING PARTY'S LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun called on the public
Sunday to support the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
candidates in the year-end legislative elections to allow the DPP to
control the legislature and thus help improve the government's
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of the campaign office of Wang
Shih-shung, a DPP legislative candidate for Taichung City, central
Taiwan, Yu said that many draft bills initiated by the administrative
branch for carrying out the nation's development programs and public
construction projects are being stockpiled in the Legislative Yuan
due to the boycott by the opposition camp which, enjoys a slim
majority in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The government has always performed with a high degree of
efficiency when dealing with matters that are not involved with the
legislature and the government's efficiency is reduced with the
engagement of the opposition-controlled legislature, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 draft bills initiated by his Cabinet are pending be
screening by the Legislative Yuan, Yu noted, adding that the
inefficiency has affected the government's administration.
</P>
<P>
The legislative elections will be held Dec. 11 with 225
legislators to be elected.
</P>
<P>
A total of 387 candidates have registered to vie for 168 regional
and eight aboriginal seats, of which 92 have been recommended by the
DPP.
</P>
<P>
The prime opposition Kuomintang (KMT) nominated 74 candidates,
followed by the People First Party (PFP) with 41, the
pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) with 30 and the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) with 26.
</P>
<P>
The parties will add additional seats for 41 legislators-at-large
and eight overseas Chinese legislators based on a proportional
representation of the ballots that each party secures in the
election.
</P>
<P>
Citing survey results carried out by the DPP, Chung Jia-ping, the
party's deputy secretary-general, forecast that the "pan-green camp"
-- formed by the DPP and its political ally, the TSU -- will be able
to win from 110 to 115 seats -- a turnaround from the last
legislative elections in 2001.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP
also claimed that they will keep their majority in the legislature,
as the two parties have agreed to cooperate based on a conservative
quota system to maximize their seats.
</P>
<P>
The NPSU, a new party created by 10 incumbent independent
legislators, is also very optimistic about its performance,
predicting that the party will be able to pass the 5 percent
threshold to win as many as 17 regional seats and up to three
at-large seats.

SUFFICIENT SUBMARINES CAN ASSURE ECONOMIC LIFELINE IN EAST ASIA: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sufficient number of submarines in
Taiwan's military could reduce the mainland Chinese threat along the
Western Pacific and maintain an economic lifeline for Asian and
Pacific countries, Vice Minister of National Defense Tsai Ming-shian
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the remarks at a seminar organized by the Institute for
Taiwan Defense and Strategic Studies in Taipei on Taiwan's national
defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's northern and southern waters control the
route where Chinese submarines enter and leave the Pacific, Tsai said
that if China's submarines can go through these areas freely, the
security of all marine transport in the Western Pacific will be
threatened.
</P>
<P>
In his judgment, a strong Taiwan submarine fleet would not only
help stabilize the Taiwan Strait, but would also contribute to
the regional security.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the remarks against the backdrop of the defense
ministry's efforts to gain support from the legislature for its
special arms purchase budget plan worth NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion).
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the defense ministry hopes to buy six advanced
Patriot anti-missile defense batteries, 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft and eight conventional submarines from the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, Tsai stressed that good hardware should be accompanied
by good strategies and tactics.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said China is depending more and more on its navy, and if
Taiwan can boast of a strong submarine fleet, it can become a
powerful counterforce and make China's blockade of Taiwan
unprofitable, said.
</P>
<P>
No other weapons can have such a strong effect like submarines,
Tsai stressed, quoting Hyman Rickover, father of the world's first
nuclear-powered submarine, as saying that all the weapons used in
wars are expensive, and cheap weapons seldom win wars.
</P>
<P>
If weapons cannot win wars, there is no need to buy them, and
this is why Taiwan should buy submarines, which are of great
significance to Taiwan's national defense, Tsai concluded.

KINMEN READY FOR ISLET TRANSFER: DEPUTY MAGISTRATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By K.Y. Ni and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kinmen County Government is ready to
take control of six small islets near Kinmen after the military
transfer the administration of these areas, Deputy Magistrate Yang
Chung-chuan said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The civilian Kinmen County Government will make the most of this
chance to develop tourism and trade in the areas to turn Kinmen,
formerly an anti-communism stronghold, into a "bridge of peace"
across the Taiwan Strait, Yang claimed. Kinmen lies closer to
mainland China's Fujian province than to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Basically, Yang asserted, the Kinmen County Government will only
take over the jurisdiction of the six islets -- namely Tatan, Ertan,
Tungting, Peiting, Shihyu and Menghuyu -- but will not be responsible
for defending them.
</P>
<P>
After the transfer of the six islets, probably on Jan. 1, 2005,
the Coast Guard Administration will be responsible for their defense
and the National Police Administration will help keep social order,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no interruption in social order before, during or
after the transfer period," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the six islets have been purely military for
more than five decades. "These islets were completely off-limits to
civilians, even to Kinmen residents," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Many people, including multinational companies, have been keen to
learn of the demilitarization -- some suggesting that the islets be
developed into eco-sanctuaries, and some are looking into the
feasibility of developing them into resorts with casinos, while
others say the islets should be kept as museums of military history,
according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the takeover, the Kinmen County Government has
commissioned National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences to
conduct a tourism resources survey of Tatan and Ertan -- known as
"the islets of heroes" -- which lie closest to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Tungting and Peiting are known as "the islets of lights," because
they are the only two islets to have lighthouses. The Tungting
lighthouse was built in 1871 during the Tongchih Period of the Ching
dynasty and the Peiting lighthouse was built in 1882 during the
Kuanghsu Period.

MAC HEAD OFFERS FOUR WAYS TO DEFUSE CROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(by Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top mainland China policy planner
has been seeking a meaningful dialogue across the Taiwan Strait and
has offered four ways to defuse cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, in his article contributed to the Sept.-Oct. issue of the
magazine New Zealand International Review discussed many dimensions
of current Taiwan-mainland China relations.
</P>
<P>
He called for a new approach by China's leaders to help break the
political impasse across the Strait, while offering four methods to
be taken in four stages to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, both sides should work to strengthen exchanges,
including those of culture, business and trade, which have already
been established.
</P>
<P>
Second, the two sides should begin constructive dialogue to build
mutual trust. The dialogue can begin with talks on business issues
and efforts to jointly crack down on crime, followed by talks on the
direct "three-links," Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
In the third stage, the two sides should seek to enter into a
certain kind of political engagement and build a military mutual
trust mechanism, promising that neither side will take unilateral,
radical means to change the status quo.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth stage, he said, Taiwan and mainland China are
expected to smooth out their political differences. As long as the
people of Taiwan agree, all means will be considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu called for the international community to help push
China to pay more heed to Taiwan's peace overture. He once again
urged Beijing officials to return to the negotiating table.

ENGLISH KEY TO SPREADING TAIWAN CULTURE ABROAD: EDUCATION MINISTER

<P>
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said
Sunday that Taiwan's development in diverse aspects will be limited
if people in the country do not strengthen their English ability.
</P>
<P>
Tu made the remarks at a seminar held in Taipei on ethnic groups
and cultural development.
</P>
<P>
As the "new Taiwan citizen movement" is one of the issues being
discussed at the seminar, some participants maintained that mother
languages of each ethnic group should be given priority over English.
They suggested that the government should not promote English
education too early for kids.
</P>
<P>
Concerning such suggestions, Tu stressed that English is the
channel to the world community, and the essence of Taiwan culture
cannot be accepted and understood by the world without it.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Shu-cheng, an associate professor at National Chiao Tung
University, echoed Tu's opinion by saying that for comparison, Taiwan
people have less intention of pursuing advanced studies abroad, which
poses a problem for the island's scientific development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some participants hailed the island's efforts in
"Taiwanization, " pointing as an example to some domestic orchestras
that have shifted their focus on Taiwanese music and musicians.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan can be easily connected with the world community through
its own music," they added.

Elsewhere, according to national security agencies, more than

Lu called on the public to stay alert for any possible trouble in
Taiwan by mysterious visitors from China.

Moreover, she urged the public to support the ruling party in the
year-end legislative elections to allow it to hold a majority in the
legislature and thus increase the government's efficiency.

tactics is described at Cuba base.

Many detainees at Guantanamo Bay were regularly subjected to
harsh and coercive treatment, several people who worked in the prison
said in recent interviews, despite longstanding assertions by
military officials that such treatment had not occurred except in
some isolated cases. The people, military guards, intelligence agents
and others, described in interviews with The New York Times a range
of procedures that included treatment they said was highly abusive
occurring over a long period of time, as well as rewards for
prisoners who cooperated with interrogators.

<TEXT>
<P>
Experts attending a confab on ethnic and
cultural development suggested Monday that the Executive Yuan
accelerate steps toward the establishment of a Ministry of Culture
and Tourism to facilitate the materialization of various policies on
cultural and tourism development in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Upon the conclusion of the three-day Conference on Ethnic and
Cultural Development, experts from the academic, political and social
circles agreed that the Executive Yuan should hasten its pace in
establishing the much-talked-about Culture and Tourism Ministry as
many important relevant policies have lagged far behind in terms of
meeting the needs of Taiwan's current situation.
</P>
<P>
The experts called for relevant Cabinet-level agencies to
collaborate in working to promote four major "cultural
transformations" in Taiwan -- namely transforming the "culture of
colonialism" to a "culture of autonomy, " the "culture of Taiwan as a
base of operations" to a "culture of Taiwan as the homeland, " the
"culture of imitation" to a "culture of creativity," and the "culture
of elitism" to a "national culture."
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that a new constitution for Taiwan be
written, with a new section devoted exclusively to aboriginal affairs
to show the government's determination in carrying out the policy of
"partnership between Taiwan's indigenous people and the central
government."
</P>
<P>
They added that the Executive Yuan should also work to facilitate
policies on autonomy for the aboriginal people.
</P>
<P>
On the well-being of the increasing number of foreign spouses
married to Taiwan citizens, the experts suggested that an
anti-discrimination law be enacted and an immigration administration
be established under the Ministry of the Interior.

TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH COULD HIT 6% FOR THE YEAR: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
Taiwan's economic growth rate is expected to reach 6 percent for this
year, the highest level since 1998.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with leading members of the
Global Federation of Chinese Business Women and winners of the 2004
Excellent Chinese Business Women Awards.
</P>
<P>
Under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration's
strenuous efforts to revitalize the economy and accelerate sweeping
reform, Chen said Taiwan's global competitiveness and economic
vitality have greatly improved in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest forecast by the Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, Chen said Taiwan's 2004 economic growth
rate could reach 5.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Barring any unexpected developments, the annual growth rate may
even hit a seven-year high of 6 percent," Chen told his guests.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said that Taiwan ranks 29th among major countries
around the world in terms of women's political participation based on
the results of a recent survey of 129 countries released by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In the U.N. survey, Chen said, Taiwan outpaced other Asian
countries in terms of women's political participation.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that although Taiwan didn't experience a
transition of power between different political parties until 2000,
it outran the United States in spawning a female vice president.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that Taiwan women will have even greater room in
the political arena in the years to come," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on his administration's work agenda, Chen said the
government will continue to carry out various political and economic
reforms as well as promote the constitutional re-engineering plan.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Chen said, his administration will actively work
for the establishment of a viable mechanism for peaceful interaction
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait for the sake of
maintaining regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"We'll push for resumption of cross-strait dialogue on the
existing foundation and craft an environment favorable for
sustainable peaceful development and for the pursuit of maximum
well-being for the people," Chen added.

TOP PRESIDENTIAL AIDE DEFENDS DISCLOSURE OF NUMBER OF PRC MISSILES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president's chief of staff on Monday
defended the appropriateness of disclosures by Taiwan's president or
vice president on public occasions of the number of mainland Chinese
ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Su Tzeng-chang,
secretary-general of the Presidential Office, said that the
"belligerent" People's Republic of China has never relented in
intimidating Taiwan with the threat of missiles and has continued to
increase the deployment of such weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Su said, it is only appropriate for the
president or vice president to talk to the nation about the number of
the missiles -- which he said is as normal as a guard at a sentry
post signalling a warning.
</P>
<P>
Su said that the president or vice president's disclosures of the
facts about the mainland Chinese missiles is not a "disclosure of
military intelligence," as some have criticized.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks in response to a question raised by
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chiu Chuei-chen, who asked
about the possible implications of Vice President Annette Lu's recent
mention of the PRC's missile deployment.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Beijing has so far deployed 610 short-range and
medium-range missiles targeting Taiwan and that the number could
increase to 800 by next year.

'SOFTWARE' ASPECT OF FOREIGN AID PROGRAMS HARD TO CONTROL: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen said
Monday that all of Taiwan's foreign aid projects are carried out in
accordance with the law and established procedures and under
legislative supervision, although he admitted that "the software"
aspect of the aid projects is hard to control.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the "hardware" part of the cash aid is relatively
easy to monitor, such as through written reports from the government
of a recipient country on the progress in an infrastructure
development project.
</P>
<P>
However, the "software" aspect of the foreign aid, such as how
and where the aid has been used in the training of personnel or the
sponsoring of activities, is more difficult to trace, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Michel Lu
reiterated that all of Taiwan's foreign aid projects are carried out
in accordance with the law under legislative supervision and standard
operating procedures.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that no aid has been given in the form of political
contributions, and he denied the involvement of any "personal bank
accounts" in the recipient countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister and the spokesman made the remarks in the aftermath
of allegations out of Latin America that Taiwan had conducted "dollar
diplomacy" under the guise of foreign aid to Costa Rica and
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the Costa Rican government issued a note to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) last week requesting that Taiwan
provide a written statement about all cash aid offered to Costa Rica
during former Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez's time in
office.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that the MOFA will formally give an explanation, also in
the form of a "note, " to the Costa Rican government Tuesday, as
requested.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez has been detained for allegedly accepting huge
kickbacks from Alcatel, a French telecom company. The Costa Rican
government is also reportedly investigating allegations that
Rodriguez received political donations from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As to foreign wire reports saying that Nicaraguan President
Enrique Bolanos faces possible removal from office on corruption
charges, including allegations of his receiving US$4.9 million from
Taiwan for his 2001 election campaign, Lu stressed that the reports
are not related to Taiwan's aid to Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Taiwan had indeed channeled over US$4 million to
Nicaragua, under the request of President Bolanos, to establish a
"Taiwan aid fund" to help carry out a series of cooperative programs,
including financial aid for human rights efforts, public health and

<TEXT>
<P>
Three Taiwan fishing vessels were
detained last Friday by the Malaysian navy for illegally fishing in
waters off Labuan in Sabah State in northern Borneo.
</P>
<P>
According to a Malaysian navy news release, all three Taiwan
vessels -- the "Hsinhaifa, " the "Lienyuchun, " and the "Lienyuchun
No. 18" -- are equipped with sophisticated fishing equipment.
</P>
<P>
During the chase by the navy, one Taiwan fishing ship was damaged
when it collided with a navy vessel. The "Lienyuchun No. 18" sank
after catching fire when it was being escorted back to harbor.
</P>
<P>
The three vessels have a total of 20 crew members. The captains
are Tsai Fa-tsai (the "Hsinhaifa") , Cheng Chung-he (the
"Lienyuchun"), and Cheng Jen-hung (the "Lienyuchun No. 18").
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian navy said that the three ships were fishing
illegally in the waters off Labuan on Oct. 15, and that they were
detained because they didn't have legal operating licenses, adding
that the vessels have been turned over to the Labuan fishing
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The navy also said that Labuan is a famous fishing ground in
Malaysia, and that all fishing ships must follow legal procedures and
obtain permits to enter the waters for fishing operations.

HONG KONG ONE OF MOST MATURE TELECOM MARKETS IN ASIA: S&amp;P
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong  Kong,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Increased competition induced by
regulatory change has made Hong Kong one of the most sophisticated
and mature telecommunications markets in Asia, Standard &amp; Poor's
Ratings Services said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The international rating agent said in a report that the
territory's mobile phone market is saturated, and churn rates are
among the highest in Asia, while regulatory changes have made the
fixed-line business increasingly competitive.
</P>
<P>
John Bailey, director at Standard &amp; Poor's, said: "The
penetration rate of mobile phones in Hong Kong is more than 105
percent, and fixed-line subscriber growth is flat."
</P>
<P>
He also said that although market conditions have improved over
the past year, with mobile operators returning a profit, the
environment remains difficult.
</P>
<P>
"Operators need to continue to modify their business models in
response to new technologies and changing regulations, " he added.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed to several main issues that could shape Hong
Kong's telecom industry, including whether the government remains
committed to further deregulation in the sector.

MORE BLACK-FACED SPOONBILLS ARRIVE IN TAIWAN TO OVERWINTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tainan,  Taiwan, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the weather getting colder, a
large number of black-faced spoonbills have arrived at the Chiku
Wetlands Sanctuary in southern Taiwan to overwinter, a local
association dedicated to protecting rare birds said Monday.
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, 223 black-faced spoonbills had arrived at the Chiku
sanctuary near the estuary of the Tsengwen River in Tainan County,
marking a roughly three-fold increase from the 78 arrivals recorded
at the same time last year, a spokesman for the association said.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase might be related to the formation of typhoons
in the East Pacific in recent weeks, prompting black-faced spoonbills
on the Korean Peninsula to fly southward to Taiwan, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The black-faced spoonbills are expected to stay at the Chiku
Wetlands until early next year. The rare birds will then move to the
Suchao Sanctuary in Tainan City before migrating north between March
and April for mating.
</P>
<P>
Between December 2002 and January 2003, black-faced spoonbills
infected with botulism were reported in the Chiku Sanctuary and 73
died, the first time the endangered species had died en masse in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tainan County Government officials in charge of animal disease
control said they have completed a series of tests at 18 sites in the
Chiku habitat and have found no evidence of botulism contamination.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue monitoring the habitat closely to ensure all the
birds stay healthy while they overwinter here," the official said.

III INTRODUCES 10 MORE INDIAN SOFTWARE R&amp;D ENGINEERS TO TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten engineers from India versed in software
research and development arrived in Taipei Monday at the invitation
of the Institute for Information Industry (III) to help Taiwan's
software R&amp;D.
</P>
<P>
They will be working in Taiwan mainly in the areas of IC design
and embedded software, III CEO Ke Chih-sheng said.
</P>
<P>
With the addition of these 10 engineers, there are now about 40
Indian software R&amp;D personnel in Taiwan, an unprecedented Indian
presence in Taiwan's technology sector.
</P>
<P>
The Indians will try to help Taiwan's software development, which
has been lagging its hardware development, Ke noted.
</P>
<P>
Ke recommended the Indian software R&amp;D engineers highly, saying
that not only is their English native, they are disciplined and have
a good work ethic.
</P>
<P>
Ke quoted estimates by India's National Association of Software
and Service Companies (NASSCOM) as reporting recently that the Indian
information technology (IT) industry is now a US$15.5 billion market
with some 800,000 workers. It is estimated that the market will
balloon to US$80 billion with an army of workers of two million by
2008, Ke added.
</P>
<P>
According to NASSCOM President Kiran Karnik, the huge number of
highly skilled persons and the low costs for their employment will
give India's high-technology industrial development a competitive
edge the future.
</P>
<P>
India is now already the leader of the world's software industry.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by 2020, the United States will be in need
of 1.7 million workers in its industrial sector, Japan will be short
nine million while mainland China will need 19 million. By that time,
Karnik said, India will be able to export some 47 million people to
meet these countries' needs.
</P>
<P>
Ke said that the III will also introduce high-technology
technicians and engineers from Russia, Ireland and Vietnam in the
years to come to help with Taiwan's IT and telecom industrial
development.
</P>
<P>
The III signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with NASSCOM
in February this year to bolster two-way industrial and economic
exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the MOU, the two sides will set up a group to handle and
promote bilateral cooperative issues such as forging joint ventures
to pave the way for technology and manpower transfers.
</P>
<P>
The 2003 Taiwan-India IT Technology Cooperation Seminar was held
in Taipei in September last year with the participation of leading IT
companies from India, including internationally renowned TCS (TATA
Consultancy Services) , Sasken Communication Technologies and Satyam
Computer, as well as well-established companies that are members of
NASSCOM, India's top software industry organization.

LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES BEGIN REVIEWING OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENT BUDGETS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative committees began reviewing the
central government's 2005 budgets Monday.
</P>
<P>
The review is expected to be completed Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan will recess for one month from Nov. 10 to
Dec. 10 prior to the legislative elections on Dec. 11. The
legislature will then reconvene on Dec. 21 and will hold a
floor meeting to discuss the review reports of the committees until
Dec. 23. Legislators will begin the second and third readings of the
budgets that passed starting Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan set the central government's revenue at
NT$1.4027 trillion (US$41.623 billion) for 2005, up 3.9 percent from
the previous year, while expenditures for next year will be NT$1.6356
trillion, up 2.4 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the shortfall will come to NT$232.9 billion -- NT$292.
9 billion if debt repayments of NT$60 billion are included. The
Cabinet plans to finance this by issuing NT$255 billion in bonds and
the use of the leftover surplus of NT$37.9 billion from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
With the current standoff between the ruling and opposition
parties, the budgets for such key government agencies as the
Presidential Office, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice are expected to be
bitterly contested.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party feels that altering the
budget figures would be better addressed after the legislative
elections so that they can be discussed without the shadow of
campaigning obscuring the issues.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung, party whip of the opposition People
First Party, suggested that discussions take place first and a full
review be held after the elections to avoid making decisions in
limited time.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Chien-ming, party whip of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union, said that the party will not overlook the review procedure
regardless of the ferocity of the campaigning.

NEW DISEASE CONTROL CHIEF VOWS TO BOOST INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under
the Department of Health (DOH) will step up international cooperation
to avert outbreaks of any contagious diseases, the center's new chief
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
New CDC Director Kuo Hsu-sung made the remarks after taking over
the center's official seal from DOH Minister Chen Chien-jen at a
changeover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said the CDC will greatly increase international exchanges,
particularly with the United States and Japan in the prevention of
communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kuo said the CDC plans to transform one of its
divisions into a special task force responsible for promoting
cooperation with other countries in blocking the import of exotic
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has long faced a severe shortage of
professional disease control personnel, Kuo said the CDC will give
priority to recruiting and cultivating competent infectious disease
experts.
</P>
<P>
Chang recalled that when severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
hit Taiwan between March and June of last year, the saying that
"battling outbreaks of an infectious disease is like waging a war"
was often mentioned.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that a disease control system requires strategic
thinking, teamwork, discipline, mobility, obedience and a spirit of
self-sacrifice, " Kuo said, adding that the CDC will reinforce
training of its staff in line with these principles in the future.
</P>
<P>
Kuo graduated from National Yangming University's medical
department and has a doctorate in public health policy from Yale
University. He once served as director of the DOH's planning
department and played an important role in the SARS-fighting campaign
last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's top health official said
Monday that he has accepted his deputy's resignation with
"reluctance," but has yet to think about his replacement.
</P>
<P>
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Chen Chien-jen, in a hastily
convened news conference, said that Chang Hung-jen, DOH deputy
minister and a former president of the Bureau of National Health
Insurance, has made a final decision and will leave his post.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Chang has been his "right-hand man" and that he
has made great contributions to the public, but because of family
reasons and different career plans, he decided to resign.
</P>
<P>
As for Chang's replacement, Chen said that he "has yet to think
about the matter."
</P>
<P>
Chang tendered his resignation last week in the wake of protests
by the staff of some 500 regional hospitals around Taiwan who took to
the streets in Taipei to call attention to what they said was an
unfair allocation of medical resources under the current National
Health Insurance (NHI) program, which results in a big gap of medical
resources between national medical centers and regional hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The protesters said that regional hospitals are not financially
viable under such unfair allocations and that many regional hospitals
have been forced to shut down. They asked Chang to step down to take
responsibility because he designed the current NHI program.
</P>
<P>
Chang said last Thursday that he was willing to step down if his
departure meant that an obstacle would be removed.
</P>
<P>
However, Premier Yu Shyi-kun and Minister Chen strongly urged him
to stay on and not to quit under pressure. Chang was moved and
promised that he would take some time to deliberate on his decision.

Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
stressed Monday that the country has a stringent screening mechanism

Chen made the remarks amid reports that ROC's aid to its

prevent this in the future, the foreign ministry will reduce the
ratio of its confidential budget to under 15 percent in the future to
increase the transparency of its foreign aid.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Taipei City Government held the
nation's first-ever burial at sea Monday, scattering the cremated
ashes of six people into waters more than six kilometers off the
northern Taiwan coast amid drizzle and wind.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh Cheng-tai, director of the Municipal Bureau of Social
Affairs (BSA), presided over a joint funeral for the six deceased at
the Kuantu Wharf in Taipei County before their family members carried
their ashes aboard two boats.
</P>
<P>
During the voyage, Hsiao Hsien-ming, a division chief at the city
government's funeral management department, played lyric songs and
saxophone music.
</P>
<P>
Family members first threw rose petals and bouquets into the sea
and then spread the ashes of the deceased, four Taipei City and two
Taipei County residents. The oldest was a 96-year-old retiree from
the ROC Air Force and the youngest was a baby boy.
</P>
<P>
The first-ever burial at sea in Taiwan took about two hours.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yi-wei, a Central News Agency reporter whose father was
among the six deceased remembered in the sea burial, said all family
members were grateful for the city government's assistance in
handling the unprecedented burial for their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
"Sea burial was my father's preferred choice. Open sea is the
source of life. My father wanted to take his final rest in the depths
of the sea," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei City Government paid the bill, including cremation,
reprocessing of the ashes, the eco-friendly urns and the
transportation charges.
</P>
<P>
BSA Director Hsueh said the city government will hold a
burial-at-sea for deceased people once a year from now on as part of
its efforts to encourage sea burials as alternatives to being buried
on land. Besides Taipei City dwellers, residents in other parts of
the island are also welcome to apply for sea burial, he added.

The Republic of China's representative
office in Malaysia will offer all necessary assistance to crew
members of three detained Taiwan fishing vessels, a Council of
Agriculture (COA) official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the three Taiwan fishing vessels have
been detained in Malaysia since last Friday on charges of illegal
fishing in waters off Labuan in Sabah State in northern Borneo.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian naval authorities claimed that the three Taiwan fishing
boats -- the "Hsinhaifa, " the "Lienyuchun, " and the "Lienyuchun No.
18" -- were caught fishing in waters off Labuan Oct. 15 without legal
operating licenses. One Taiwan ship was reportedly damaged in the
chase by Malaysian naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
The official with the COA's Fishery Administration said the
council has asked the ROC representative office in Malaysia through
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assist crew members of the
detained ships in resolving the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We'll also closely watch the developments in the case, " the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local fishermen to refrain from traversing into the
exclusive economic zones of other countries to avoid trouble. The
Fishery Administration will step up a publicity campaign to remind
local fishermen to abide by international rules when deep-sea
fishing.

plans to fund a large-scale clinical trial of Celebrex's ability to
prevent heart attacks and strokes in patients with serious
cardiovascular disease. The study, expected to enroll its first
patients in the next few months, will test Celebrex against a sugar
pill in thousands of people with osteoarthritis and a history of
serious heart disease, such as a previous heart attack or severe
angina.

TAIWAN NEEDS NEW CONSTITUTION: SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of President Chen Shui-bian's mentors
Monday advocated the creation of a new constitution for the nation,
saying the current one is out of date.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hung-hsi, president of the Ketagalan Institute, a school
founded by President Chen that aims to nurture the nation's future
leaders, made the remarks when he was invited to deliver a speech on
constitutional reform in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that a constitution exists for the country, if it can
not keep up with the progress of the times, it should be revised,
adding that the current Republic of China Constitution has been
revised 11 times, but the holes are getting bigger despite the
repeated efforts.
</P>
<P>
The current Constitution should be abrogated and a new one should
be formulated, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ROC Constitution was formulated in Nanjing in
the mainland in 1946 when Taiwan delegates didn't participate. The
Kuomintang regime imposed it on Taiwan, so why should Taiwan
people enshrine the Constitution? he asked, claiming that over half
of local people do not recognize the ROC, and that the ROC
Constitution has nothing to do with Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ROC Constitution was formulated for 450 million
Chinese people back in 1946, but Taiwan had only six million people
then. The "big" Constitution simply does not fit Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the French Fifth Republic imposed a
dual-leadership system, but the president and the premier are often
at loggerheads. The ROC Constitution sets out a five-branch
government, which is neither a presidential nor a Cabinet system, a
practice that has baffled many foreign scholars, who ask how the
system can operate, Lee said. It works because it has never been put
into practice, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that only 28 or 29 out of the more than 190 countries in
the world have a presidential system, but he said that election
quality in Taiwan is one of the poorest in the world with gangsters
being able to be elected as legislators, which he said wouldn't be
possible in Japan or Italy, for instance.
</P>
<P>
If a Cabinet system were practiced in Taiwan, then gangster
legislators could unite to control or manipulate the government, he
said, adding that it is better to institute a presidential system
during the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that mainland China has announced that it would not
turn a blind eye if Taiwan creates a new constitution, believing it
would be the last step toward Taiwan's independence, but he added
that Taiwan is already an independent country with its own peoples,
land and government, but China does not recognize this fact and
instead pressures Taiwan through the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who had taught many years at National Taiwan University,
said that many of his students have graduated from prestigious
schools from around the world. The students have thoroughly
researched the Constitution, and will formulate a new one and put it
on a referendum in Taiwan in due time, he said.

NEW TAIWAN REPRESENTATIVE TO HONG KONG ARRIVES TO ASSUME POST

Hong Kong,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's new representative to Hong
Kong, Pao Cheng-kang, arrived to assume his new post Monday, pledging
to do his utmost to promote ties between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Pao, whose official title is managing director of the Chung Hwa
Travel Service in Hong Kong because of the lack of diplomatic ties
between Hong Kong and Taiwan, was mobbed at the airport by
journalists who showered him with questions about how he would try to
improve the strained bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Pao said the mutual trust and genuine desire for better ties
fostered by Hong Kong and Taiwan would lay the groundwork for closer
exchanges between the two.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Pao said, Hong Kong and Taiwan benefited through
medical exchanges during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory
syndrome in early 2003, and the fact that he took a shorter time to
get a working visa from the Hong Kong authorities than his
predecessor is an indication that bilateral ties are improving.

TAIWANESE STUDYING OVERSEAS FELL BY 22.1 PERCENT IN 2003

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of Taiwanese studying overseas
dropped by 22.1 percent in 2003 compared with the previous year, the
Directorate Generate of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The DGBAS made the calculation based on the 26,318 visas issued
by foreign missions in Taiwan for students wishing to study abroad in
2003. The United States was the most popular destination with 10,324
visa, followed by 6,662 to Great Britain and 2,823 to Australia. The
three countries attracted about 75 percent of Taiwanese students in
2003.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also showed that Taiwan students going to France and
Germany rose by 18.5 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively, in 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to the tallies of foreign students unveiled by the
Institute of International Education of the United States, U.S.
colleges and universities registered 586,323 foreign students between
Sept. 2002 and June 2003. Among them, Taiwan students numbered
28,017, ranking them fifth in terms of foreign students behind India,
China, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS statistics also showed that there were 7,844 foreign
students in Taiwan in 2003, among them 1,568 were studying for
degrees and 6,276 were studying Mandarin, up 22.2 percent and 3.8
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign students, the humanities was the most popular
discipline, followed by business, management, economics and
psychology, but more and more
students are coming to Taiwan to study engineering. Eighty-seven such
students were recorded in 2003, an annual increase of 107 percent.

PREMIER VOWS TO ESTABLISH 'CULTURALLY CIVIL SOCIETY'

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Monday the Cabinet
will come up with concrete measures based on the action guidelines
and policy initiatives proposed by scholars attending a national
conference on ethnic and cultural development to establish a
"culturally civil society."
</P>
<P>
Yu made the pledge at the closing ceremony of the two-and-half
day ethnic and cultural development conference.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan is an immigrant society, Yu said the majority
of Taiwan people have traditionally possessed an "immigrant spirit" of
mutual learning, mutual assistance and mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has experienced successive waves of immigration over the
past four centuries. In addition to the aboriginal citizens, native
Taiwanese, hakka and mainlanders that now populate Taiwan, many new
immigrants have also come to Taiwan through marriage or
naturalization in recent years amid globalization and
liberalization, " the premier said, adding that with Taiwan's
population becoming ever more ethnically diverse, the various ethnic
groups should respect and recognize one another's differences and
unique features to create a harmonious living environment and forge a
common national identity.
</P>
<P>
Yu further said patience, consideration and sensibility are
required elements to realize the goal of "ethnic diversity and
national unity" outlined in President Chen Shui-bian's May 20
inaugural address.
</P>
<P>
With a view to realizing this ultimate goal, Yu said the Cabinet
will work out concrete measures in line with the action guidelines
proposed by at the conference, including establishing a viable
mechanism for multicultural exchanges, offering better care for
minority ethnic groups, and formulating new language and education
policies to boost Taiwan's cultural diversity and transform Taiwan
into a "culturally civil society."

<P>
Regardless of the difficulties, Taiwan will
never cease trying to create strategic international alliances, Hu
Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Hu said the Executive
Yuan has approached Paraguay, Nicaragua and Japan for possible
conclusion in a free trade agreement, and is negotiating with the
United States on a trade and investment framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Hu said, a panel under the Executive Yuan
overseeing the free trade agreement negotiations gathered for the
first time Monday to review progress in talks with Japan, Paraguay
and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Consensus has emerged in talks with Japan that a free trade
agreement is one of the possible ways of bilateral cooperation, Hu
went on.
</P>
<P>
Talks with the United States on the trade and investment
framework agreement have focused on telecommunications, medicine,
rice and intellectual property rights, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the comments in response to a question from opposition
Legislator Thomas Tung-hao Lee regarding how Hu's council will
cushion the impact prompted by the closer economic partnership
arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong which, Lee said,
could boost the economies of Hong Kong and the mainland to the
detriment of Taiwan.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Monday promised to do all it can to help the survivors of a
tragic bus accident in Taipei County that killed five women tourists
from Hong Kong and injured 32 others.
</P>
<P>
The MAC has informed the Hong Kong government and the families of
those involved in the accident and sent representatives to visit them
to express sympathy through the Chung Hwa Travel Services, its Hong
Kong office.
</P>
<P>
There were 38 people on the tour bus when the accident took place
in the afternoon, including 35 Hong Kong tourists, a Hong Kong tour
guide, and Taiwan tour guide Ou Kuo-ming, who was not injured, and
bus driver Hsu Chung-hsin. Police are still investigating why the bus
overturned on a mountain road.
</P>
<P>
Chang Yung-shan, director of the MAC's Department of Hong Kong &amp;
Macau Affairs, as well as his deputy, Huang Chien-liang, visited the
injured tourists, who were in Chang Kung Memorial Hospital and Patu
Hospital in Keelung City as well as Rueifang Hospital in Taipei
County.
</P>
<P>
Chung Hwa Travel Services in Hong Kong has taken the initiative
to help the family members of the Hong Kong tourists to come to
Taiwan. Twelve of them arrived in Taipei Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Chung Hwa Travel Services also set up hotlines - 9314-0130 and
8200-2665 in Hong Kong as well as 8862-0939-082-274 and 0920-538-577
in Taipei to help the families.
</P>
<P>
Shantou Company, the owner of the tour bus, said that every
deceased passenger will receive an insurance payment of NT$1.4
million (US$41,660) , while all injured tourists will have their
medical bills paid for by the insurance company.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Kao-ching, secretary-general of the Travel Agent Association
of the ROC, said that the China Spring (chung-chun) Travel Agency
that hosted the two Hong Kong tour groups Monday mainly caters to
tourists from Southeast Asian countries, Hong Kong, Macau and
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that Chioufen in Rueifeng township is one of the
favorite tourist destinations for Japanese and Hong Kong tourists.
The roads in Chioufen have continued to expand to accommodate the
rising number of tourists. Bad weather may have caused the bus
accident in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It is known that the China Spring Travel Agency didn't insure the
Hong Kong tourists, and their operations to cater to Hong Kong
tourists could be suspended because of it.

The Development Fund under the Executive
Yuan entered into a strategic alliance with the Giza Fund owned by
the GE Capital Group in Tel Aviv, Israel Monday by investing NT$450
million (US$13.32 million).
</P>
<P>
Lin Yi-fu, chairman of the Development Fund said the alliance
will enhance Taiwan's presence in the international venture capital
market and set the stage for industrial cooperation between Taiwan
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Citing as proof of this, Lin said several Israeli integrated
circuit design companies are exploring the possibility of having the
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in Hsinchu help them
produce their products.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 20 percent of the Development Fund's investments in
Giza will be used for Taiwan's start-ups, especially undertakings in
the fields of telecommunications, information software and life
sciences, Lin said he hopes the alliance will encourage other
government-controlled funds to follow suit by investing in Giza.

The Development Fund under the Executive Yuan was founded in 1973
with the purpose of helping upgrade local industries.

The proposed arms purchase from the United
States is meant to show Taiwan's determination to defend itself

to buy arms from the United States, Tsai said the purchase is not

ensure that Taiwan has the capability to survive a first strike and
launch a counter-strike, which would deter the mainland from even
beginning hostilities.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell
will during his forthcoming visit to Beijing encourage mainland China
to engage in dialogue with Taiwan and will respond to Beijing's
concerns over U.S. arms sales to the island, a State Department
senior press officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Richard Boucher said at a daily press briefing that the
secretary will also discuss with mainland Chinese leaders the speech
recently made by President Chen Shui-bian about the prospects of
dialogue with Beijing, and tell them that the United States does see
that as an opportunity for cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Powell will visit three Asian countries, namely Japan, mainland
China and South Korea, between Oct. 23-26. He is scheduled to arrive
in Beijing Oct. 25 for a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Powell will want to take up some of the Taiwan
issues again during his visit in Beijing, the spokesman said that the
secretary also looks forward to having a chance to respond on a lot
of talk about arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Chen's Oct. 10 National Day speech, Boucher said that
Washington knows Beijing didn't take the speech the same way as the
United States did, "but it's a chance to look at what we can all do
to promote the idea of dialogue across the strait."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States is "entirely happy" with
President Chen's speech, the spokesman said that obviously, the
United States "is not endorsing anybody's speech completely."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "we think there were elements in it that
were creative, we think there were elements in it that were
constructive, and we felt that there's an opportunity here to get
back to a cross-strait dialogue that should be looked at by all the
parties."

SAINT VINCENT CALLS FOR TAIWAN HELP IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING

Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said Tuesday that he hopes Taiwan can
assist his country in drawing up economic development and financial
reform plans.
</P>
<P>
Gonsalves made the remarks while meeting with Hu Sheng-cheng,
chairman of Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD).
</P>
<P>
Gonsalves told Hu that his country intends to launch national
development and financial reform projects. Due to a lack of
experience, Gonsalves said, his country needs Taiwan's assistance in
outlining the work plans.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Taiwan can send economic and financial reform planning
experts or strategists to our country for a two or three month stay
to help with drafting detailed measures and work schedules. If
necessary, we would also send personnel to Taiwan to learn from your
experiences in relevant fields," Gonsalves said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Hu said the CEPD -- the Cabinet's top economic
planning agency -- is more than willing to offer counseling services
for the East Caribbean ally's financial reform and economic
development projects.
</P>
<P>
As a mater of fact, Hu said, the two sides already reached a
consensus on boosting information and personnel exchanges when Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines' vice finance minister paid a visit to the
CEPD about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Gonsalves, accompanied by his wife and several senior officials,

New York Times: Poll
shows tie; concerns cited on both rivals

Two weeks before Election Day, voters hold a
sharply critical view of President Bush's 
record in office, but they have strong 
reservations about Senator John Kerry, leaving 
the race in a tie, according to the latest New 
York Times/CBS News polls. Bush's job
approval rating is at 44 perrcent, a dangerously
low n umber for an incumbent president, and one
of the lowest of his tenure. A majority of
voters said that they disapproved of the way
Bush had managed the economy and the war in
Iraq. But a majority of Americans continue to
see Kerry as an untrustworthy politician who
will say what he thinks people want to hear.
The poll found the two candidates each drawing
46 percent of all registered voters in a
head-to-head race. Among likely voters in a
two-way race, Bush has 47 percent, with 46
percent for Kerry.

JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, SINGAPORE RESPOND POSITIVELY TO CHEN SPEECH: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan, Australia and Singapore have all
responded positively to President Chen Shui-bian's Oct. 10 National
Day address, saying Chen's peace overtures are conducive to easing
tension in the Taiwan Strait, a diplomatic official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shan-lin, deputy director of the Asia-Pacific Affairs
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , made the
remarks at a regular news conference.
</P>
<P>
"The three Asian-Pacific countries have given a thumbs-up to
President Chen's peace appeals to mainland China, saying that the
initiatives could help ease cross-strait tension and facilitate
resumption of bilateral dialogue," Chen Shan-lin said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement
immediately after President Chen delivered his National Day speech,
reaffirming Japan's commitment to maintaining friendly
non-governmental substantive relations with Taiwan and urging the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait to resolve their disputes through peaceful
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a public
statement recognizing President Chen's peace overtures. The statement
also said that Singapore was pleased to see President Chen deliver an
address that would contribute to the easing of cross-strait tension.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, major Australian newspapers ran editorials recognizing
President Chen's call for the establishment of a cross-strait
military trust mechanism as helpful toward the lowering of
cross-strait tensions. The Australian news media also pushed the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait to end their hostility as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
President Chen proposed in his National Day address that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait use the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong
Kong to seek possible ways that are "not necessarily perfect, but
acceptable" in preparation for a step forward in the resumption of
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to himself by his nickname 'A-bian, ' Chen further said
that as any conflict would cause irreparable damage to both sides,
Taiwan and mainland China should seriously consider practical steps
toward "arms control."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore A-bian proposes that both sides should seriously
consider the issue of arms control and take concrete actions to
reduce tension and military threats across the Taiwan Strait."

HONG KONG TOURISTS CUT TRIP SHORT AFTER TOUR BUS ACCIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several Hong Kong tourists who suffered
light injuries in a tour bus accident in Taipei Monday decided on
Tuesday to cut their trip short and return home a day early.
</P>
<P>
The tour bus carrying 36 Hong Kong tourists overturned in scenic
Chioufen, Ruifang, killing five female tourists and injuring 32 other
passengers. It is suspected that faulty brakes combined with the
driver's fast speed in the rain caused the accident, but police are
still investigating. As of Tuesday, more than 10 of the tourists
remained in hospital for further observation.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Tai-san, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), said that some of the tourists will head back to Hong Kong a
day earlier than the scheduled departure Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Travel Agent Association of the Republic of China and the
China Spring Travel Agency in Taipei, which arranged the tour, are
making preparations for the tourists' early return home.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the MAC will respect the wishes of the family members
in handling the bodies of those killed in the accident. The bodies
are currently being held at a Keelung City morgue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two Hong Kong immigration officials and two medical
staff, who arrived in Taiwan in the early morning hours of Tuesday,
headed to Rueifang Hospital in Taipei County and Chang Kung Memorial
Hospital in Keelung County to visit the injured and their family
members to learn how the accident happened and to help with matters
in the aftermath of the accident. The Hong kong team was accompanied
by MAC officials.
</P>
<P>
MAC Chairman Joseph Wu also visited the two hospitals in the
afternoon to express his sympathy to the family members of the
deceased and to wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Bureau also sent officials to the hotels where the family
members of the tourists were staying to offer them any assistance
they might require.
</P>
<P>
The MAC informed the Hong Kong government and the family members
of the tourists right after the accident through its representative
office in Hong Kong Monday, setting up hot lines for any family
members of the victims to check the latest developments regarding the
accident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsu Chung-hsin, the driver of the tour bus, faces up
to seven and a half years in prison, stiff fines and the loss of his
driver's license for life if he is found guilty of driving under the
influence of alcohol or of using a hand-held mobile phone while
operating the bus.

FLAP OVER TAIWAN'S FOREIGN AID COULD BE CHINA'S MANIPULATION: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that the
recent allegations of improper use of ROC aid to two diplomatic
allies has all the trappings of backdoor maneuvering by mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks while fielding questions in the
Legislative Yuan amid media reports that China may be behind
allegations out of Latin America that Taiwan had conducted "dollar
diplomacy" under the guise of foreign aid to Costa Rica and
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chou Hsi-wei of the opposition People First Party
asked why Taiwan's foreign aid to diplomatic allies for national
construction had allegedly been turned into a campaign fund and why
the former head of Costa Rica has stepped down from an important post
over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Chou was referring to the Costa Rica government's request to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week that Taiwan provide a written
statement about all cash aid offered to Costa Rica during former
Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez's time in office.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who stepped down as the secretary general of the
Organization of American States early this month, has been detained
for allegedly accepting huge kickbacks from Alcatel, a French telcom
company. The Costa Rica government is also reportedly investigating
allegations that Rodriguez received political donations from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign wire reports also said Nicaraguan President Enrique
Bolanos faces possible removal from office on corruption charges,
including allegations that he pocketed US$4.9 million from Taiwan for
his 2001 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that no one has stepped down from their post
over the allegations of illegal foreign aid from Taiwan and a person
is presumed innocent before a ruling and outsiders should not
interfere with the internal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are obliged to provide assistance to the international
community, " he said, adding that Taiwan provides assistance in a
"cautious" manner.
</P>
<P>
Since the reports involving the two countries surfaced at about
the same time and both countries are major allies of Taiwan, the
premier said the situation looks suspiciously like the "invisible
hand" of China at work.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen also said that "it is a
reasonable supposition" that China was behind the scenes pulling the
strings.
</P>
<P>
Chen again said that foreign aid, given in accordance with the
law and established procedures and under legislative supervision to
ROC allies is used at the discretion of the ally governments, and
shouldn't be interfered with.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that mainland Chinese leaders and officials have
always done everything possible to lure away allies from Taiwan, and
judging by the current situation, they are up to their old tricks
again.

TWO ADVANCED E2T AIRCRAFT TO JOIN AIR FORCE FLEET NEXT SPRING

<TEXT>
<P>
Two advanced E2T Hawkeye early warning
aircraft will join the ROC Air Force fleet next March to further beef
up Taiwan's defense capabilities, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang
Suey-sheng said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news conference at the Ministry of National
Defense (MND), Huang said the ROC Air Force placed the order for the
two E2T early warning aircraft with the United States back in 1999
after it purchased four of this type of aircraft in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The two E2Ts to be delivered next spring belong to an upgraded
version, Huang said, adding that the commissioning of the two
additional early warning aircraft will effectively help the air force
maintain its air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the upgraded E2Ts can stay airborne longer
and fly farther.
</P>
<P>
With the delivery of the two new warplanes, Huang said, the air
force will have six E2Ts to assist with Taiwan's defense needs.
</P>
<P>
At present, Huang said each of Taiwan's E2Ts can stay in the air
for four hours for surveillance missions. In the future, the E2T
fleet will be able to conduct round-the-clock reconnaissance
missions.
</P>
<P>
The E2T fleet will also support disaster rescue and relief work
as well as combat strategy testing and training missions, Huang added.

Officials from trade unions of state-run or

after failing to get a response from the ruling party for their call

</P>
<P>
The officials of the trade unions threatened to continue the
hunger strike until Friday when the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to
have a floor meeting unless the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), respond.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU) mobilized more
than 2,000 workers from state-run and public-controlled enterprises
to a rally in front of the Legislative Yuan Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Rally participants asked the government to consult with the TCTU
when formulating its privatization policy, and that before a
consensus is reached in the consultations, the government should
suspend the release of shares of the enterprises involved.
</P>
<P>
Also, before the privatization of state-owned enterprises, the
enterprises should sign contacts with the trade unions, and that the
government should also respect the business operations of the
enterprises and cut administrative interference.

PREMIER REAFFIRMS NO HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM HIKE DURING HIS TENURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 19 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun reiterated Tuesday that
there will be no hike in national health insurance premiums during
his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the reaffirmation during a Legislative Yuan
interpellation session where opposition People First Party Legislator
Shen Chih-hui asked the premier whether the health insurance premiums
would be raised to "salvage" the financially troubled national health
insurance program.
</P>
<P>
In response, Yu said the Cabinet has no plan to raise health
insurance premiums before his term in office expires Feb. 1, 2005
when the new legislature to be elected Dec. 11 is inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Department of Health (DOH)
Minister Chen Chien-jen said health insurance is a kind of social
insurance and requires the support of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the DOH will hold a public meeting to help forge a
national consensus on reforming the existing health insurance
program, " Chen said, adding that the civic meeting is scheduled to
take place in December.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the health insurance program has been operating at a
loss, Chen said Taiwan needs to design a second-generation insurance
program for local people's common well-being.
</P>
<P>
Chen also defended the "Excellent Hospital Program, " saying that
since the program was put into practice, patients of acute and
serious diseases have received better care at national medical
centers.
</P>
<P>
The epidemiologist-turned-official further said if each local
citizen can cut one outpatient visit to a medical facility per year,
the national health insurance program will be more viable. According
to Chen, each local citizen makes an average of 14 outpatient visits
annually.
</P>
<P>
"The number is too high. We should save our medical resources. If
we can cut the per capita outpatient visits by one, our health
insurance program will be more sustainable," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the same legislative session, Premier Yu also said that
the implementation of an all-volunteer military service system is
still in the planning stage.
</P>
<P>
"The time is not yet been ripe for implementing an all-volunteer
military service system. The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
still working on the plan and has not yet reached the policy
formulation stage. It will take a long time to transform the current
conscription-dominated service system into an all-volunteer one, " Yu
said.
</P>
<P>
Yu was responding to PFP Legislator Lin Yu-fang's question about
the feasibility of the MND's five-year troop restructuring plan under
which the MND will need an additional budget of NT$380.9 billion to
finance its volunteer soldiers recruitment plan.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the MND estimate was just a preliminary calculation. "The
estimate may not be accurate because the volunteer recruitment plan
has not yet fully matured," he added.

TAIWAN TO ASSESS STANCE BEFORE NEW ROUND OF WTO TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting ROC Vice Minister of Economic
Affairs Chen Ruey-long said Tuesday that Taiwan will make an overall
assessment of its negotiation stance before the Doha round of talks
under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) , which is
expected to begin next February.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the ministry will make use of the time before the
opening of the talks to coordinate with government agencies and make
an overall assessment to establish the government's stance for the
talks to obtain the best outcome for the nation.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will still focus on four issues that are most closely
related to Taiwan -- agriculture, non-agricultural market access
(NAMA), the service industry, and trade facilitation, according to
Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen is currently visiting Geneva after attending an annual
meeting in Zurich of the EVIAN Group -- an association of elite
members in political and business communities in major countries
around the world.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Geneva, he exchanged views with Taiwan's
mission to the WTO on the July package, called on WTO General Council
Chairperson Shotaro Oshima as well as permanent representatives from
Australia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the passage of the July package by the WTO is a
major breakthrough, but the next stage of substantial talks will come
early next year at the soonest. During the interval, the ministry and
Taiwan's mission to the WTO will work closely to establish their
stance for future talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Of the four issues that Taiwan is most concerned about, Chen
wouldn't deny that agriculture will be impacted, and that the nation
will have to make adjustments to brace for future developments. As
for the other three issues, they will help Taiwan's trade
development.
</P>
<P>
NAMA is of course beneficial to Taiwan, Chen said, noting that
export-oriented Taiwan hopes that the trade in industrial products
will be further liberalized and that more markets will open to create
more trade opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the service sector presently accounts for 67
percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product. But as the service sector
is currently confined to the island, he is hoping that in the future
it will make inroads into international markets.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that Taiwan has great potential for development in
the areas of transportation, telecommunications, finance, information
and technology, as well as tourism.
</P>
<P>
Chen is scheduled to leave Geneva for home Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
If Taiwan doesn't insist on taking part in
the building of the eight submarines it plans to purchase from the
United States, the price for them could be reduced by NT$71.9 billion
(US$2.12 billion), Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to seek lawmakers' support for his ministry's
request for a special budget of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion)
to buy the submarines and other arms from the United States, Lee told
the Legislative Yuan that the price for the purchase may be further
reduced by some NT$30 billion (US$886.13 million) if part of the
price is financed through the ministry's regular budget.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee said there is no point in haggling with the United
States over the price before Taiwan has chosen what subs are up
for offer.

which has long been noted for its beautiful scenery and tourist
resources.

<P>
"We hope the visit can not only help us realize the goal of

opening the Hualien-Macau charter flight services. The carrier will
operate three round-trip charter flights. The other two round-trip
charter flights will take off Oct. 23 and Oct. 27 from Hualien
Airport. An airline spokesman said the Hualien-Macau flight time is
shorter than that needed for the Taipei-Macau flight. The

TAIWAN HAS SPENT NT$1.8 BILLION AIDING ANTI-TERRORISM DRIVE: LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has spent NT$1.8 billion assisting
in the U.S.-led anti-terrorist campaign over the past three years, an
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Sun Guo-hua claimed at a news conference held at the
KMT legislative caucus office that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) appropriated a total of NT$1.8 billion in secret budgets
between 2003 and 2005 to help finance U.S.-led anti-terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
Sun said he believes that Taiwan is the third-largest supporter
of the global anti-terrorist campaign after the United States and
Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Wu-chiao, director of the North American Affairs Department
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), would not respond to Sun's
remarks at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hsieh said the fight against terrorism is a universal
value. As a member of the international community, he went on, Taiwan
should support the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh stressed that Taiwan's aid for reconstruction projects in
Afghanistan and other anti-terrorist activities has not been related
to any military actions.
</P>
<P>
"We only offer humanitarian aid and medical resources, " Hsieh
said, adding that he couldn't reveal any details because of a tacit
understanding with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh further said U.S. officials and congressmen have on several
occasions recognizing Taiwan's contributions to the global
anti-terrorist campaign.

U.S. ACCUSES TAIWAN OF NOT TREATING THERMISTOR AS IT PRODUCT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C.tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States on Tuesday accused Taiwan
of not treating thermistors, or thermally sensitive resistors, as an
information technology (IT) product and of therefore imposing import
duties on them, a source in Geneva said the same day.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. delegate made the accusation at a meeting held by the
World Trade Organization's Information Technology Product Committee,
noting that the World Customs Organization (WCO) has decided that the
thermistor is an IT product that is not subject to import duties,
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's customs authorities have been imposing a 7.5-percent
import duty on thermistor products imported from the United States by
U.S. Tyco Co.'s Taiwan branch since they consider that the thermistor
is a resettable fuse product rather than an IT product as Tyco's
Taiwan branch claims.
</P>
<P>
Thermistors are solid state, electronic devices which detect
thermal environmental changes for use in temperature measurement,
control and compensation of circuitry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegate expressed the hope that Taiwan would respect
the WCO's decision and not continue to impose import duties on
thermistor products from the United States.
</P>
<P>
In response to the accusation, Taiwan representatives attending
the meeting said that Taiwan is reviewing the issue and promised that
the island will not only deal with the issue with the United States
on the basis of mutual interests, but will also give the United
States an explanation regarding the matter at an appropriate time,
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the United States has made the
accusation, showing the country's serious concern about the issue.
However, the U.S. side did not mention during the meeting whether it
will take further action, the source added.

PRESIDENT CHEN MEETS WITH SAINT VINCENT PRIME MINISTER

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian met with visiting
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves
Wednesday to discuss how to further strengthen cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has been one of
Taiwan's staunchest diplomatic allies in the East Caribbean, Chen
said relations between the two countries have been cordial since they
forged formal ties in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Chen said, he hopes the two countries can
cooperate even closer in trade, investment, cultural development and
civilian exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chen also expressed his gratitude for Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines' firm support for Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations
and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Gonsalves said his country is grateful for Taiwan's
long-term assistance in its agricultural development and
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Gonsalves said one of the main purposes of his current visit is
to push for the establishment of a Taiwan-Saint Vincent trade and
economic cooperation promotion association with a view to attracting
more Taiwan business groups to invest in his country.
</P>
<P>
This is Gonsalves' third visit to Taiwan since he assumed his
current post. Gonsalves said he looks forward to seeing commercial
exchanges and investment from Taiwan increase significantly in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
During a Tuesday meeting with Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, Gonsalves said he
hopes Taiwan can assist his country in drawing up economic
development and financial reform plans.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Taiwan can send economic and financial reform planning
experts or strategists to our country for a two or three month stay
to help with drafting detailed measures and work schedules. If
necessary, we would also send personnel to Taiwan to learn from your
experiences in relevant fields," Gonsalves said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Hu said the CEPD -- the Cabinet's top economic
planning agency -- is more than willing to offer counseling services
for the East Caribbean ally's financial reform and economic
development projects.

ROC AMBASSADOR TO COSTA RICA RESPONDS OVER DONATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China Ambassador to Costa Rica
Wu Tzu-dan has issued a note to Costa Rica explaining the situation
surrounding the donation of US$400,000 to a foundation in the Central
American country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks amid Costa Rican media
reports that former Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez
received US$200,000 from the MOFA in 2001 and another US$200,000 from
the ROC embassy in Costa Rica in 2002. The reports also said that a
Panamanian company controlled by Rodriguez allegedly accepted two
separate donations amounting to US$500,000 each and that Taiwan had
provided a total of US$1.4 million in political donations to
Rodriguez over three years.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government last week made a request to the MOFA
that Taiwan provide a written statement about all cash aid offered to
Costa Rica during the former president's time in office.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Wu presented a note to the Costa Rican vice foreign
minister Tuesday asking him to turn the note over to the foreign
minister. The note explained that Taiwan provided money to a
foundation in Costa Rica under a cooperation project, according to
Costa Rica's request, for a talent training program and the convening
of an international conference.
</P>
<P>
The note also said that Taiwan had not sent two separate
donations of US$500,000 each to the Panamanian firm as news reports
had said, and that the MOFA has no idea why there were such reports,
according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government is expected to respond by issuing a
statement later after receiving the note from the ROC embassy in
Costa Rica, Lu said.

JAPANESE GANGSTER NABBED FOR CROSS-BORDER PORNO BROADCASTS
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Japanese yakuza gangster was arrested
Tuesday in Taipei on charges of beaming pirated pornographic movies
around Asia, using Taiwan as his operating base, according to the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB).
</P>
<P>
Shuichi Mogi, a member of the Japanese yakuza gang
Yamaguchi-Gumi, who is the president of two Taiwan companies, has
been operating pornographic movie broadcasts by first transporting
porno DVDs from Japan to Taiwan and then beaming them from Taiwan via
the satellite channel Jwave to places around Asia, CIB officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mogi's Jwave porno broadcasts -- operated through his Taiwan
companies Yixinhui and Oriental Digital -- have reached "clients" in
Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Guam and many Southeast Asian countries,
CIB investigators said.
</P>
<P>
In raids on Yixinhui and Oriental Digital Tuesday, the police
busted Mogi and his Taiwanese vice president, Huang Wei-chin, and
confiscated a large number of porno DVDs, as well as a satellite
antennae, receivers, IC cards, account books, and website materials.
</P>
<P>
The investigators are also trying to track down Mogi's Taiwanese
partner, surnamed Yen, and other accomplices who remain at large.
</P>
<P>
The police have learned that the Yamaguchi-Gumi gang has been
broadcasting porno via satellite for quite a long time. In Taiwan,
"clients" spend NT$20,000 for equipment, including an antenna, a
receiver and cable, to get access to the 24-hour porno broadcasts,
with extra fees for a decoding IC card and monthly payments of
NT$2,000.
</P>
<P>
The Yamaguchi-Gumi beam the porno movies to clients throughout
Asia by up-linking to the Palapa C2 channel in Indonesia and another
channel in the Philippines, the police said.
</P>
<P>
This new kind of cross-border pornography operation has become a
"grey area" for law enforcement authorities to deal with, CIB
investigators said.

Interest groups mounting costly push to get out
vote

As the outcome of the U.S. presidential race
is expected to hang on turnout at the polls, an
army of interest groups is pumping at least $350
million into gett-out-the-vote campaigns. The
efforts are part of the most expensive
voter-drive ground war in history. It includes
the major parties and their allies, the
independent but partisan groups known as 527's,
whose attack advertisements have played a big
role in both President Bush's and Senator John
Kerry's campaigns. For the first time in a
national campaign, it includes hundreds of
civic organizations and deep-pocketed business
interests.

Wall Street Journal: Bush and Kerry deadlock
among likely voters

Both John Kerry and George W. Bush have
taken important steps toward winning the U.S.
presidency during the past month, but neither
has broken ahead in a race that remains
deadlocked with two weeks to go. A new Wall
Street Journal/NBC News poll, which
has the two men tied at 48% apiece among likely
voters, indicates Mr. Kerry's solid debate 
performances have helped him inch toward key 
objectives: building voter confidence in his 
ability to be commander in chief; narrowing the 
gap with President Bush on handling terrorism; 
and riding a powerful edge on the twin domestic 
concerns of jobs and health care. In the 12 swing
states where electoral votes will likely prove 
decisive, he leads Mr. Bush by six percentage 
points.

The ten most outstanding young persons in
Taiwan for 2004 have been selected, and their names were announced
Wednesday by Junior Chamber International, Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The 10 outstanding young men and women are scheduled to be
honored with Taiwan Outstanding Young Person (TOYP) awards at a
presentation ceremony in Hsinchu on Nov. 9, the JCI Taiwan reported.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, President Chen Shui-bian will meet with them some
time in October.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Junior Chamber has also decided that it will recommend
that Chen Shi-hsin, taekwando gold medalist at the Athens Olympics
and the recipient of a TOYP award in 2001, be nominated for the JCI
Outstanding Young Person of the World award for 2005, said Francis
Lee, Taiwan Junior Chamber national president of 2004.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 TOYP award winners are scheduled to travel to mainland
China in December to meet with their mainland counterparts for a
series of exchange activities, Lee added.
</P>
<P>
The 10 Taiwan outstanding young persons for 2004 are: professors
Chou Hsi-tseng and Kuo Ta-wei in the science-and-technology category;
Fang Chi-tai, a physician at National Taiwan University Hospital, in
the social services category; Liao Yan-hsian, a high school teacher
from Yuanlin, in the labor category; Pan Sheng-tsai, for outstanding
diplomatic performance; Chan Ming-tsai, for outstanding contributions
to agriculture; Chen Rui-ping, for commendable performances in art
and culture; Drs. Wang Peng-hui and Kuo Po-chao, for outstanding

the public administration category.
</P>
<P>
Offering his congratulations to the 10 winners, Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng, who was one of the panel judges in the
selection of this year's outstanding young persons, said all the
recipients were selected after strict screening and careful
examination to make sure that they are appropriate role models for
Taiwan society.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that all the TOYP award winners, aged between 18 and
40, are individuals who exemplify the best attributes of the
country's young people, the panel of judges decided to heighten their
selection standards this year, resulting in an absence of winners in
two categories -- namely the education and athletics category and the

<P>
Former South Korean President Kim Young Sam
has decidedly refused to take mainland China's advice of not making a
trip to Taiwan, saying that he would do anything that would benefit
South Korea and its people.
</P>
<P>
A secretary of the former president announced Tuesday that at the
invitation of President Chen Shui-bian, Kim and his wife will visit
Taiwan Oct. 25-Nov.1.
</P>
<P>
A daily newspaper in Seoul reported the same day that the
mainland Chinese embassy in the South Korean capital had strongly
suggested that Kim cancel his planned visit to the island, noting
that it is not the right time for the former president to visit
Taiwan and the visit might harm the spirit of the 1.3 billion people
of mainland China and pass on a wrong message to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Beijing's suggestion, Kim said that he would do
anything that would benefit South Korea and its people and that he is
ready to go anywhere at any time.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released to the local media, Kim said that he had
promised President Chen during his visit to Taipei in 2001 that he
would visit the island again when the two countries resumed their
two-way aviation links. Taipei and Seoul recently re-established
direct air links after a twelve-year suspension of the links.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that during Kim's forthcoming visit to Taiwan, he
will hold talks with President Chen and exchange views on issues of
mutual concern with other political figures, including Premier Yu
Shyi-kun, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou, and representatives from the ruling Democratic Progressive

Kim is also expected to meet with Taiwan business and industrial

TAIWAN CAN STILL ACHIEVE 6% ECONOMIC GROWTH THIS YEAR: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chan Shui-bian said Wednesday
that Taiwan can still achieve a 6 percent economic growth for this
year despite soaring crude oil prices and global terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when he presided over a meeting of
his economic advisory group, during which the economic experts
discussed issues related to oil prices, national health insurance,
financial reforms and the land value increment tax.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that according to the International Monetary Fund's
latest forecast, global economic growth could reach 5 percent for
this year, or the highest figure in more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the world economic recovery and the efforts of the
Taiwan people, Taiwan's economy has performed well this year, the
president said, adding that Taiwan's imports and exports have
maintained a growth at over 20 percent and that private investment
and consumption have also steadily increased.
</P>
<P>
He noted that surging oil prices and terrorist activities in the
world will affect the continued growth of the world economy, but "as
long as we put in more effort, it is still possible for us to achieve
growth of 6 percent for this year."
</P>
<P>
The economic advisory group to the president also endorsed the
goals of the nation's second-stage financial reforms proposed by the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
According to CEPD proposed goals, by the end of 2005, there
should be at least one "representative" company in each financial
field, such as asset management, banking, insurance and securities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the number of financial institutions in which the
government have stakes will be cut by half to six institutions. By
the end of 2006, financial holding companies will be cut by half from
the present 14 companies, and at least one financial institution will
be run by foreign-owned companies or be listed in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The president instructed related government agencies to implement
the conclusions so as to upgrade the efficiency and liberalization of
Taiwan's financial market.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that the measure of halving of the land value
increment tax, which was put into effect in February 2002, has had
good results as seen by brisk real estate transactions.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Executive Yuan will actively
promote the revised land tax law proposed by the Ministry of Finance
so as to further cut the land value increment tax. He added that if
the revised law can't clear the legislature by the end of this year,
the Executive Yuan should still extend the measure of halving the
land value increment tax for another year.

<P>
The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) Central
Standing Committee approved Wednesday the appointment of Chang
Jung-kung as chairman of the party's Culture and Communications
Committee, a position which includes the role of KMT spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Chang had headed the Mainland Affairs Division under the party's
Policy Committee before he was named to the new position, replacing
Alex Tsai.
</P>
<P>
Tsai will be transferred to the post of deputy executive director
of the Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
It was reported by local media that Tsai's replacement was
related to his recent argument with Chiang Fang Chih-yi, a
daughter-in-law of late President Chiang Ching-kuo and member of the
KMT's Central Standing Committee. Reportedly unsatisfied with Tsai's
performance in campaigning for the party's candidates in the year-end
legislative elections, Chiang Fang openly criticized him at last
week's Central Standing Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the media reports, Chiang Fang said Wednesday that her
remarks last week were meant to improve the party's campaigning
efforts and were "nothing personal."
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the Central Standing Committee confirmed the
expulsion of four politicians from the party who had campaigned for
ruling Democratic Progressive Party candidates Chen Shui-bian and
Annette Lu during run-up to the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The KMT members expelled were Huang Chao-cheng, chief of
Kaohsiung County's Linyuan township; Pan Chien-fang, chief of the
county's Yenchao township; Chen Sheng, an official at the KMT's
branch office in Kaohsiung County's Maolin township; and Hung

Taiwan's second north-south expressway will

spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The second north-south expressway was originally designated as
"National Highway No.3." As many drivers had complained that the
designation was confusing, the Cabinet decided to find a new name for
the expressway.
</P>
<P>
Chen said three final entries selected through a public contest

</P>
<P>
"The Cabinet members unanimously selected 'Formosa' as the
expressway's new name," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Formosa is Taiwan's original name known to the whole world. It
is easy to remember and symbolizes beauty, good fortune and safety.
Therefore, it has won the support of all the Cabinet members, " he
explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
The top presidential aide refuted an
allegation made by opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Liu
Wen-hsiung against President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday and said that
the Presidential Office will sue Liu.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
said that President Chen was "furious" when heard about the
allegation made by Liu at a press conference earlier the same day
that Chen had given former Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso US$1
million as a "birthday gift."
</P>
<P>
Su categorically denied Liu's allegation, saying that the "red
envelop" claim was totally fabricated and that the allegation has
undermined the president's standing and damaged the friendship
between Taiwan and Panama.
</P>
<P>
The president's chief of staff urged the few "unworthy
politicians" not to sling mud at President Chen simply for political
gain for their own parties or for personal pleasure.
</P>
<P>
Liu, at the press conference, quoted recent reports from Costa
Rica that President Chen had given Moscoso US$1 million and that the
latter had shown the check she received from Chen at many
international occasions.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that President Chen's true aim in visiting Central and
South America recently was to visit the United States, providing
"others" in the world the opportunity to "blackmail" Taiwan after
discerning Chen's true ambitions.

CIVIC GROUPS CALL FOR RETURN OF TAIWAN FROM HANDS OF ARMS DEALERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Civic groups against the government's
proposed special budget of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) for an
arms procurement package from the United States issued a proclamation
prior to the Taiwan's Retrocession Day, urging a "recovery of Taiwan
from the hands of arms dealers."
</P>
<P>
The two civic groups -- the Alliance Against the NT$610.8 billion
Arms Procurement and the Democracy Action Alliance -- issued its "New
Retrocession Day Proclamation" in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
They urged the public to strongly express their views to the
legislators of their constituencies and vote against candidates that
advocate the arms procurement in the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The groups noted that a referendum held earlier rejected a
proposal for arms procurement. Increased arms procurement was one of
the two questions on the referendum. Although more than 90 percent
voted positively in the referendum, the proposal failed because those
who participated did not surpass 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the alliances noted that the arms procurement is
like a "drug addiction, " which could ruin the nation, and the
aspirations for peace and independence of the Taiwan people shouldn't
be trampled on.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said that they plan to hold a large
Retrocession Day rally in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, this Sunday.
Retrocession Day, which falls on Oct. 25, marks the return of Taiwan
from the hands of Japanese colonial rule to the fold of the Republic
of China.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the public allows the arms deal to go through,
it will be tantamount to paying protection money to the United States
to maintain Taiwan's security, and would be a form of capitulation.
Moreover, the arms procurements in the future will get bigger and
bigger, resulting in the collapse of Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<P>
They strongly urged the public to adamantly "say no to the arms
procurement package, " and that they bring their concerns to the
attention of the media and their friends in the United States, as
well as legislators in their constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Independent Legislator Su Yin-kuei also said that the national
defense budget for next year passed without any cut in the
legislative committee. If NT$610.8 billion is reasonable, the budget
should be put to the annual review.
</P>
<P>
Su also said that the nation's debt will hit NT$12 trillion and
questioning how the government is going to finance the arms purchase.

TAIPEI CITY OPENS 'SINGLE DESK' TO SERVICE FOREIGN, M'LAND SPOUSES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei City Government has opened "single
desk" services exclusively for foreign and mainland Chinese spouses
wishing to find jobs in Taiwan's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Based on the employment service law, the city government began to
implement the "single desk" services last year to help foreign and
mainland Chinese nationals who are married to Taipei citizens and
wish to find employment.
</P>
<P>
According to the employment service law, foreign nationals who
are married to ROC citizens and have obtained permanent residence can
work in Taiwan without filing for permission in advance.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Taipei City Employment Service Center said
that a total of 519 foreign and mainland Chinese spouses have applied
with the center for job opportunities since the office became
operational in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 246 people have successfully landed jobs under the
"matchmaking" efforts of the center, marking a 47 percent success
rate.
</P>
<P>
This figure was relatively higher than the matching rate of 33
percent in terms of matching job opportunities between local people
and job providing organizations, center officials said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the officials said, the center has sponsored 15
career or vocational workshops for foreign and mainland Chinese
spouses over the past 20 months, allowing 485 people to attend
classes that are helpful to facilitating their joining in Taiwan's
job market.
</P>
<P>
Interested parties can call the center at (02) 2594-2277 ext. 122
or ext. 712, the officials said.

PREMIER WILLING TO WORK WITH ELECTION-EVE SHOOTING INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday that the
Executive Yuan is willing to work with the Control Yuan's
investigation on the presidential election-eve shooting of President
Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu on March 19.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks on the sideline of a ceremony to bestow
medals on the winning athletes at the Athens Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the Executive Yuan is unreservedly willing
to work with the investigation, but the Control Yuan, the nation's
highest watchdog, has not found any violations of law or dereliction
of duty on the part of anyone at the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that he is only a "witness" and that he accepts being
"visited" by Control Yuan representatives over the matter, but not
being "interviewed" by them.
</P>
<P>
If it is a "visit," then the venue could be at the Executive Yuan
or at his residence, although the Control Yuan has not agreed to
this.
</P>
<P>
The opposition believes that the March 19 shooting, which injured
the president and the vice president slightly, swayed the bitterly
contested election to the president's favor.
</P>
<P>
A March 19 shooting "truth investigation commission, " which was
established under a special statute passed by the Legislative Yuan in
August, formally began operations early this month, and has started
to look into the shooting, but the Cabinet, believing that the
special statute is unconstitutional, has refused to cooperate with
the commission prior to a ruling on its constitutionality by the
Council of Grand Justices. The request for an interpretation was made
by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally Taiwan
Solitary Union (TSU).
</P>
<P>
The "truth commission" originally was to have had 17 members, but
because the commission is being boycotted by the DPP and the TSU,
there are only nine members from the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang and the People First Party, and one from the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
President Chen, contesting the validity of the "truth
commission, " refused to confirm the commission members, but the
commission began operations automatically because it had the required
50 percent of its seats filled.

TAIWAN FOURTH LEAST-CORRUPT COUNTRY IN ASIA: TI REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(BY sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is the fourth least-corrupt country
in Asia, after Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong, according to an annual
global corruption report released by Transparency International (TI)
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan ranks 35th in the TI's 2004 Global Corruption Report on
the transparency of political finances in 146 countries and areas
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan received a score of 5.6 points on the TI-designed
zero-to-10 transparency index, down 0.1 points from its year-earlier
level.
</P>
<P>
Yu Chih-li, director of Shih Hsin University's administrative
management department, who concurrently serves as chief executive of
the TI's Taiwan branch, said Taiwan dropped five notches in the
global ranking as compared with the 2003 rating.
</P>
<P>
Only two of the 13 countries or areas that were gauged this year
for the first time outpace Taiwan. "Theoretically, Taiwan should have
only dropped two slots. But it dropped five notches. This trend is
worthy of the government's attention," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Chai Sung-lin, a national policy adviser to the president, said
political democratization and economic liberalization may not
necessarily reduce corruption. For instance, mainland China received
only 3.4 points in the TI transparency index, ranking 71st in the
global rating.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Li-kung, a Central Police University professor, said the
government has cracked down on corruption for many years. "But our
score and ranking have remained almost the same over the past few
years, indicating that there is still ample room for improvement," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Su You-chen, a lawyer, cautioned the government that the recent
reports of alleged political contributions controversies in several
Central American countries with diplomatic ties with Taiwan might
affect Taiwan's transparency rating in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
All of the least-corrupt countries that received a score of more
than 9 points in the TI's 2004 Global Corruption Report are advanced
countries. They are Finland (9.7) , New Zealand (9.6) , Denmark and
Iceland (9.5), Singapore (9.3), Sweden (9.2) and Switzerland (9.1).
</P>
<P>
Singapore is the only Asian country that received a score of more
than 9 points. Japan ranks 21st, with a score of 6.9 points. South
Korea ranks 47th, with a score of 4.5 points. The United States ranks
17th, with a score of 7.5 points.
</P>
<P>
The most corrupt countries include Azerbaijan, Paraguay, Chad,
Myanmar, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The TI is a non-governmental international coalition created to
fight corruption. Founded in 1993, the TI has set up branches in 120
countries or areas around the world. The Taiwan branch was founded in
2002.
</P>
<P>
The TI's Corruption Perceptions Index is based on the results of
surveys of multinational business group managers and national affairs
analysts on 18 indicators provided by 12 independent research
institutes, including the World Economic Forum.

A 15-year-old girl from the Philippines
suffering from congenital heart disease has fully recovered and was
discharged from the hospital Wednesday after successfully undergoing
open heart surgery in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ann Margaret Derder was sent to the National Taiwan University
Hospital for the surgery earlier this month under the "Gift of Life"
program sponsored by Rotary International. The surgery was performed
on Oct. 6.

At a news conference held by the hospital on her recovery, the
girl expressed her gratitude for the help offered to her by the "Gift
of Life" program and medical staff at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Yi-hsiang, a cardiovascular surgeon at the
hospital, the girl was suspected of having congenital heart disease
since she was little after a murmur was discovered in her heart, but
her family could not afford medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
She was diagnosed with tetralogy of fallot (TOF) -- a kind of
heart problem -- when she was three years old, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan has mature technology for the treatment of TOF
and the success rate of heart surgery is very high.

ALLEGATION THAT PRESIDENT GAVE PANAMANIAN LEADER CASH ABSURD: MOFA

<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) on Wednesday refuted as ludicrous an opposition People
First Party legislator's allegation that President Chen Shui-bian
gave former Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso a US$1 million gift.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu made the remarks in response to the claim made by PFP
Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung earlier the day that Chen gave the outgoing
Mireya Moscoso a check worth US$1 million as a "birthday gift" when
he visited Panama in early September for the inauguration of the new
Panamanian President Martin Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held on Wednesday afternoon, Lu stressed
that the gifts that the government presents to the leaders of other
countries are generally symbolic articles, such as traditional
artifacts or high-tech products produced domestically, and it is
absolutely impossible that money was given.
</P>
<P>
Noting that although Taiwan and Panama have maintained cordial
ties and the leaders of the two have made frequent visits, Lu said
that Chen does his job of maintaining international courtesy.
</P>

TAIWAN EXPECTS CONSISTENCY IN U.S. ARMS DEALINGS: VICE DEFENSE MINISTER

<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan hopes the United States can maintain
"consistency and continuity" in its arms sales policy toward Taiwan,
Vice Minister of National Defense Tsai Ming-hsien said Wednesday..
</P>
<P>
Tsai was commenting on U.S. State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher's statement that U.S. Secretary of State Powell desires to
have a chance to speak on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan during his
one-day visit to Beijing on Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the U.S. stance on arms sales to Taiwan is crystal
clear, namely to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons in line with
the Taiwan Relations Act to safeguard peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the U.S. government to maintain consistency and
continuity in its policy on arms sales to Taiwan," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Ministry of National Defense hopes the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan can approve the NT$610.8
billion arms procurement budget as early as possible so that the
United States can begin selecting contractors and deciding on the
type of diesel-powered submarines to be sold to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The NT$610.8 billion arms package includes eight diesel-powered
submarines, six PAC III Patriot anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice President Annette Lu said she is not opposed to a
third party correctly conveying information or messages between the
two sides of the Taiwan strait.
</P>
<P>
Lu was responding to Boucher's remarks that Powell will take
advantage of his Beijing visit to encourage mainland China to resume
dialogue with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants war. We welcome respectable foreign friends,
such as Powell, to serve as cross-strait mediators," Lu said, adding
that she looks forward to seeing people on both sides and
foreign friends work together to kick-start the long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Lu further said Taiwan needs to cultivate a new generation of
competent negotiators in preparation for future cros-strait talks.

<P>
A batch of 18 tons of rice produced in
Hualien County, eastern Taiwan will be exported through Kaohsiung
Harbor in southern Taiwan to Japan after a hiatus of 33 years, an
agriculture official said in Taipei Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous official from the Council of Agriculture said it
took his council and other related agencies much effort to put Taiwan
rice through Japan's testing and get permission to export.
</P>
<P>
If the Japanese market responds well to Taiwan rice, two more
batches of rice will be sold in Japan before the end of this year,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
As a rice producer, Japan keeps its domestic market under close
control and does not import foreign rice unless it is that of the
highest quality, the official went on.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan used to be a rice supplier to Japan, but the rice trade
stopped since 1971.

HONG KONG URGED TO SET UP REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)

<TEXT>
<P>
The Hong Kong government should set up a
representative office in Taiwan to boost bilateral relations and
offer better services to its expatriates on the island, a senior
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san made
the call after a recent tourist bus accident in the Chiufen
mountainous resort in northern Taiwan that killed five Hong Kong
citizens.
</P>
<P>
"When the accident occurred Monday, we need the assistance of
Hong Kong authorities in contacting the victims' families," Chiu
said, adding that the accident highlights the necessity for the
Hong Kong government to open a liaison or representative office
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In view of ever-growing tourist exchanges between the two sides,
Chiu said, the Hong Kong government should seriously consider the
proposal of setting up a representative office in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
According to MAC tallies, Hong Kong citizens made about 240,000
visits to Taiwan in 2003 and the number of of Hong Kong visitors to
Taiwan in the first nine months of this year already exceeded
230,000.
</P>
<P>
"The figure indicates the upward swing in civilian exchanges
between Taiwan and Hong Kong," Chiu said. "For the sake of boosting
bilateral contacts and exchanges and offering timely and better
services for Hong Kong expatriates and tourists, we look forward
to the opening of a Hong Kong representative office in
Taipei."

Taiwan and Belgium signed an agreement Oct.
13 to avoid double taxation in a move to further promote bilateral
trade and investment, Bureau of Foreign Trade officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the agreement will encourage Belgian
enterprises to invest more in Taiwan, introduce high technology and
administration techniques to the island, as well as help Taiwan
upgrade its industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan and Belgian enterprises are generally small-
and medium-sized, and that the bilateral investments have focused on
the establishment of branches and operations points in each others'
country, the officials stressed that there is still much space for
the development of bilateral investments between the two.
</P>
<P>
The officials suggested that domestic entrepreneurs consider
establishing their European distribution centers in Belgium,
considering its geographical advantage of being located in the center
of Western Europe.

Production of Taiwan's semiconductor
industry is expected to top NT$1 trillion (US$29.58 billion) this
year, an analyst with the Industrial Technology Intelligence Services
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on Taiwan's scientific standing and the challenges
of the market, Chien Chih-sheng noted that the island's semiconductor
industry looks promising considering that there are many trade
opportunities hidden in 3C products -- computer, communications and
consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
As the semiconductor's sub-industries, such as IC design and
original equipment manufacturing for wafers, have also performed
excellently, Chien estimated that the island's semiconductor industry
is full of potential.

<P>
A hunger strike by about a dozen leaders of
the Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU) went into its second
day after lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) refused to endorse their requests Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Ker Chien-ming, the whip of DPP caucus at the
Legislative Yuan said that his party would like to discuss the issues
concerning workers with union leaders in a sensible way, but the
party will not bow to pressure.
</P>
<P>
The three other major political parties have already pledged to
support the trade union leaders' requests. TCTU Vice President Chung
Kung-chao said his confederation might stage another protest if the
DPP still refuses their demands before the hunger strike ends Friday.
</P>
<P>
The TCTU, which called in more than 2,000 members to stage a
demonstration in front of the Legislative Yuan Tuesday, appealed to
lawmakers from different political parties to stop the government
from selling state enterprises before consulting the confederation
and getting its approval.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the lawmakers to support their request that the
government sign group contracts with workers of state-owned
enterprises before selling these companies.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government to refrain from meddling in the

WITHOUT ARMS PURCHASE, DEFENSE MINISTRY PREDICTS WAR ACROSS STRAIT
</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense warned
Wednesday that a war across the Taiwan Strait is likely to happen
between 2010 and 2020 if Taiwan misses the chance to accept the offer
from the United States of US$18.23 billion in arms.
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort to win the legislature's support for its
request for a special budget to finance the purchase, the defense
ministry said in a position paper that the acquisition of the arms,
including submarines, anti-submarine aircraft and missiles, will
ensure at least 30 years of peace across the Strait.
</P>
<P>
The paper also listed the destroyer equipped with the Aegis
system as being what the ministry would seek in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The budget has been bogged down in the opposition-controlled
legislature, not only because of its huge price tag but also because
the special budget will worsen the already strained government's
finance, according to opponents of the purchase.

In a briefing on the government's financial reform plan to
President Chen Shui-bian, a written copy of which was released to the

government's stocks in formerly state-owned banks that have already
been privatized.

<P>
The second part, Hu said, is to merge these state-controlled
banks to halve the number of state-controlled banks by the end of

The current 14 financial holding companies will also be merged
into seven by the end of 2005.

</P>
<P>
Chen said in the speech that South Korea has greatly impressed
the people of Taiwan with its success in economic and high-technology
development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Korean pop culture, particularly Korean soap operas, have become
extremely popular in Taiwan over the last two years, allowing the
Taiwan public to learn about Korea's history, culture, customs, and
even its art and foods, Chen was quoted by Yonhap News as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that South Korea is one of the closest countries to
Taiwan geographically, and that the two countries have maintained
close economic and trade ties, with two-way trade reaching US$13
billion last year. South Korea enjoyed a trade surplus of US$4
billion for the year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is Taiwan's fifth largest trade partner, Chen said,
adding that such close and cordial bilateral ties should also be
reflected in political exchanges between the two countries, according
to the Yonhap report.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Taiwan and South Korea have both persevered in the
pursuit of democratization despite external and internal pressures.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and South Korea are both role model nations among
Asia-Pacific countries, and their respective development experiences
are a common asset on which the two countries should continue to
build their friendship, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, Chen continued, interactions between
Taiwan and Korea have been restricted due to the lack of formal
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he hopes that the academic conference -- with so many
influential politicians and academics from South Korea participating
-- as well as the resumption of direct air links between Taiwan and
South Korea will lead to the opening of a new page in bilateral
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 scholars and politicians from more than 10 countries,
including the United States, Canada, mainland China, Japan and India,
took part in the two-day Korean studies. Former South Korean prime
minister Hyun Seung Zong was one of the participants in the
conference, the Yonhap report said.
</P>
<P>
In related news, former South Korean President Kim Young Sam has
decided to visit Taiwan Oct. 25-Nov. 1 at the invitation of President
Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Defying Beijing's advice not to make a trip to Taiwan, Kim said
recently that he would do anything that would benefit South Korea and
its people.

PRESIDENT FILES CIVIL SUIT TO RESTORE REPUTATION

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian filed a civil suit
against a political talk show host and two opposition lawmakers
Thursday over "improper dealing" allegations.
</P>
<P>
Chen's lawyer Ku Li-hsiung filed the lawsuit against People First
Party Legislators Liu Wen-hsiung and Tsai Chung-han as well as
television and radio talk show host Jaw Shau-kong, a former lawmaker,
with the Taipei District Court on behalf of President Chen.
</P>
<P>
The three have in recent days made allegations, based on
unverified reports, that President Chen had presented a US$1 million
check to former Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso as a birthday
gift and as a"compensation for Chen's improper dealings."
</P>
<P>
Ku said Chen is seeking to "restore his reputation" through a
civil suit instead of a criminal suit mainly because he does not want
to give the impression of intimidating a media personalty.
</P>
<P>
According to Ku, Chen filed the lawsuit in line with Article 18
and Article 195 of the Civil Code as well as the Council of Grand
Justices' Constitutional Interpretation No. 453.
</P>
<P>
Ku said Chen is not seeking any financial compensation because
the "president's reputation is priceless." Instead, Ku said, Chen has
demanded that the three defendants publish the court verdict and an
apology to him on the front pages of five local newspapers -- the
China Times, the United Daily News, the Liberty Times, the Taiwan
Daily and the Apple Daily -- for three days.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, Chen's chief of staff, said the president filed
the lawsuit mainly to protect Taiwan's diplomatic ties with Panama.

LIVE-FIRE DRILL CONDUCTED ON PENGHU ISLAND

(By Deborah Kuo)

<TEXT>
<P>
The Penghu Defense Command conducted a
live-fire drill involving artillery Thursday on the island group
located in the Taiwan Strait to test and hone the military's defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Penghu Defense Commander Wang Han-chi presided over the drill,
which kicked off on a highland on the islet of Hsiyu at 5: 50 a.m.
The Penghu island group is located about 40 kilometers off the
southwest coast of Taiwan proper.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 officers and soldiers took part in the drill,
firing hundreds of rounds with 105-millimeter and 155-millimeter
self-propelled howitzers, 20-millimeter canons, and other artillery
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The drill, dubbed "Lianhsin No. 247, " was staged to practice
countering a simultaneous landing invasion, air attack and naval
blockade by the enemy, according to officials from the Penghu Defense
Command.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the drill, one of the two annual operations to
test artillery pieces and coordination among the armed forces in a
combat zone, has nothing to do with the current state of cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the drill was a success, and he expressed his
appreciation to the military for their efforts. He also expressed his
appreciation to the local residents, whom, he said, have been
understanding and cooperative.
</P>
<P>
"Only by constantly honing its combat skills can the military be
capable of protecting the security of the Penghu island group and its
residents and ensuring stability in the Taiwan Strait, " Wang added.

PRESIDENT'S LAWSUIT AIMED AT PROTECTING DIPLOMATIC TIES: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By  Y.F.  Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's lawsuit against
a radio host and two opposition lawmakers is aimed at protecting his
reputation and the country's relations with its diplomatic allies,
Presidential Office Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Su said the president will cooperate with the court in handling
the case.
</P>
<P>
Chen had his lawyer file a civil suit calling for the restoration
of his reputation against UFO Radio Chairman Jaw Shau-kong and People
First Party Legislators Liu Wen-hsiung and Tsai Chung-han Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While Jaw, citing mainland Chinese news reports, claimed in his
radio show that Chen had offered US$1 million to former Panamanian
President Mireya Moscoso as a birthday present, Liu and Tsai later
used the reports to back up their accusations that the government was
wasting the taxpayers' money. The two lawmakers also speculated that
the "gift" could be some kind of "hush money, " implying an affair
between Chen and Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
Su told a news conference that he felt angry and "chilled to the
heart" that a few "unscrupulous politicians" had sided with Beijing
in defaming the president at a time when the country is already
facing a very difficult diplomatic situation.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that mainland China, which has always been hostile to
Taiwan, has used various means to isolate Taiwan and has used vicious
language to try to humiliate and smear the island in international
arenas.
</P>
<P>
As the head of state, the president deserves the highest level of
respect from the people, Su said.
</P>
<P>
He said the unfounded accusations have hurt the feelings of the
people of Taiwan and Panama and could undermine relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Also, Su said, the indecent insinuation made by the two
legislators on the friendship between Chen and Moscoso is the
"greatest humiliation to women."
</P>
<P>
By taking legal action, President Chen is not only trying to
protect his own reputation but also the country's relations with
Panama, Su said, urging all 23 million people on the island to unite
to condemn what he called the "corrupt people."

EPA HEAD INSPECTS DENGUE FEVER COMBAT EFFORTS IN PINGTUNG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Pingtung,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmental Protection Administrator
Chang Juu-en traveled to Taiwan's southernmost city of Pingtung
Thursday to inspect efforts in combating dengue fever.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting areas that have been hit the hardest by dengue
fever, Chang suggested that Pingtung residents, with the assistance
of city and county officials, battle dengue fever by first cleaning
up their environments.
</P>
<P>
"I suggested that Pingtung City and Pingtung County accelerate
community development programs, starting with each borough in the
region cleaning up and beautifying their living environments, " Chang
said. In the process, the mosquito-infested areas will be cleared and
the scourge of dengue fever will be staved off, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Pingtung has been the hardest hit among all the regions around
Taiwan this year by dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA), a total of 132 cases of indigenous dengue fever
were reported islandwide as of Oct. 20 this year, with 123 cases
reported in Pingtung County alone. Of the 123 cases, 116 cases were
reported in Pingtung City, with new cases being reported almost every
day, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Chang stressed the importance of residents voluntarily cleaning
up their own environments to combat dengue fever, saying that efforts
to eradicate mosquitoes will be doomed to failure if the residents
rely simply on the government.
</P>
<P>
"Fines will have to be issued in the event that the residents do
not take the initiative to clean up the areas," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the EPA has allocated NT$4 million this year
exclusively for clean-up efforts nationwide. As of last week, he
said, 97.8 percent of 1,085 unattended open tracts in Pingtung City
had been cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
Under a carrot-and-stick scheme, the Pingtung County Government
will begin a clean-up competition in 79 boroughs in Pingtung City
Oct. 23 for 20 days to select winners who perform the best in
clearing up mosquito-infested environments.
</P>
<P>
The competition will feature cleaning up of stagnant water in
ponds and sewers, as well as standing water that does not contain
pesticides, all of which are believed to have allowed mosquitos to
multiply.
</P>
<P>
The winners will be awarded with cash prizes ranging from
NT$40,000 to NT$100,000, county government officials said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 300 soldiers were sent to Pingtung County Oct. 4 to
help combat the spread of dengue fever in Pingtung.
</P>
<P>
Small-scale dengue fever outbreaks occur about every three years
in Taiwan, with a major outbreak happening about every decade, dating
back to the early 1930s when nearly 80 percent of the population
contracted the disease in a major outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Four types of the virus that causes dengue fever have been found,
and patients with more than one type of virus can develop symptoms
that include bleeding of the gums, the skin and the intestinal tract,
in addition to the classic symptoms of sudden high fever, severe
headaches, nausea and vomiting, and muscle and joint pain.

sensationalism over their allegations that President Chen Shui-bian
had given US$1 million to former Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso
as a birthday present.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and Overseas Chinese

President Chen on Thursday filed a civil suit against UFO Radio

Minister Chen said the foreign aid offered by the Ministry of

designated for specific purposes and appropriated over a five-year

</P>
<P>
He said there is a standard legal procedure for the Taiwan

<TEXT>
<P>
A hunger strike by leaders of the Taiwan
Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU) against the government's
privatization policy went into its third day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
TCTU Vice President Chung Kung-chao said the group might begin
more protests before the year-end legislative elections unless the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) agrees to their requests
before the hunger strike ends Friday.
</P>
<P>
The TCTU called in more than 2,000 members to demonstrate in
front of the Legislative Yuan earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that lawmakers across party lines help stop the
government from selling state-run enterprises before consulting the
confederation and getting its approval.
</P>
<P>
They urged the lawmakers to support their request that the
government sign group contracts with workers of state-owned
enterprises before privatizing these companies.
</P>
<P>
They also wanted the government to refrain from meddling in the
operation of the state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the DPP, the three other major political
parties including the opposition Kuomintang, People First Party and
Taiwan Solidarity Union have signed to endorse the group's petitions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun reaffirmed the
government's determination Thursday to crack down on vote-buying in
the upcoming legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the reaffirmation while addressing a meeting of chief
prosecutors and investigators chaired by State Public
Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao to discuss measures to increase
effectiveness and efficiency in vote-buying investigations.
</P>
<P>
As 387 hopefuls have registered to vie for 176 regional seats to
be up for grabs in the Dec. 11 legislative elections, Yu said the
competition will definitely be very fierce.
</P>
<P>
"I hope all law enforcement officers, including prosecutors,
investigators and police officers can maintain administrative
neutrality and adopt effective steps to wipe out vote-buying, " Yu
said.
</P>
<P>
To signify its determination to eliminate vote-buying and
establish clean politics, Yu said the Cabinet has approved a proposal
to set up vote-buying investigations that can be conducted
immediately upon notification of irregularities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cabinet's program, prosecutors' offices in
various counties and cities should form a special vote-buying task
force to handle vote-buying charges swiftly and effectively. The
special task force will be comprised of investigators, police
officers and prosecutors to enhance operational efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the Cabinet will earmark NT$48 million from its second
reserve fund to finance operations of the rapid investigative task
forces.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yu said the government will offer additional cash
rewards to encourage ordinary citizens to provide leads for law
enforcement officers to investigate vote-buying charges. In addition
to general commendations, those who have contribute to the conviction
of a single vote-buying case will be offered additional pecuniary
rewards ranging between NT$150,000 and NT$5 million, Yu added.

New York Times: Red Sox's anguish and
Yankee's mystique dissolve in game 7.

With a barrage of four home runs, the Boston baseball team Red
Sox eliminated the New York Yankees with a 10-3 victory in Game 7 of
the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium. The Red
Sox became the first team in baseball story to win a best-of-seven
series after losing the first three games, and they will play host to
the Houston Astros or the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 1 of the World
Series at Fenway Park on Saturday. The National League Championship
Series is tied, three games apiece, with Game 7 tonight.

Wall Street Journal: As shrimp industry thrives in Vietnam, trade
fight looms.

American shrimp fishermen are struggling, as millions of shrimp
farmers in Asia and Latin America are exploiting their natural
advantages in climate, cheap labor and large coastal tracts. They
farm their catch in ponds -- a process virtually off-limits to
Americans due to environmental concerns and the high cost of coastal
property. Their methods have led to a surge in world shrimp supply,
and they now account for nearly 90 percent of the U.S. market. The
growing supply has led to a dramatic decline in shrimp prices -- in
the U.S., for instance, wholesale prices fell roughly 40 percent
between between 1997 and 2002.

GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGES PRIVATE PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government has provided significant
business opportunities to encourage private participation in public
construction projects, the chief of the Public Construction
Commission under the Executive Yuan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to start individual meetings on private
participation in building harbor facilities organized by her
commission, Kuo Yao-chi said that the government enacted the Law for
Promotion of Private Participation in Infrastructure in 2000 to
encourage the private sector to participate in public projects.
</P>
<P>
However, she pointed out, many private enterprises are still
neither aware of related regulations nor the business opportunities
that have been offered by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government has set a target of attracting investment of
NT$100 billion (US$2.95 billion) a year from the private sector to
participate in public constructions, Kuo said, adding that the figure
is at NT$41.7 billion so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Kuo expressed the hope that the private sector will have a better
understanding of the government's efforts in this regard after
attending the meetings.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulated by the law are very pragmatic and
flexible and allow the parties interested to present their own
development projects in public construction, Kuo noted.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transportation and Communications has released
nearly 600 hectares of lots in the ports of Kaohsiung, Keelung,
Taipei and Taichung for private participation in the construction of
harbor facilities, she said.

SEPTEMBER EXPORT ORDER VALUE HITS SINGLE-MONTH HIGH: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Export orders received by Taiwan companies
in September amounted to US$19.5 billion in value, marking a 26.61
percent annual growth and posting the highest single-month level on
record, according to statistics released Thursday by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA).
</P>
<P>
The amount brings the combined value of export orders on Taiwan
manufacturers for the January-September period to US$155.29 billion,
up 26.26 percent over the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that the September value registered a surge
of US$1.09 billion in comparison with the same month last year. The
figures also indicate most orders have been in the electronics
sector.
</P>
<P>
MOEA officials attributed the growth to a globally rebounding
semiconductor industry that has pushed top multinationals to place a
bigger number of orders from Taiwan-based contractors, and to a
booming demand for consuming electronic products.
</P>
<P>
In September, orders from the United States reached US$5.64
billion in value, a new single-month high. The amount grew by US$1.26
billion from a year ago, or 28.78 percent, according to the MOEA
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figures also pointed out that orders from Hong Kong during
the one-month period hit US$4.32 billion, up by US$840 million, or
24.24 percent from a year ago; Japanese orders reached US$1.99
billion, up by US$300 million, or 17.5 percent; and European orders
amounted to US$3.1 billion, up by US$710 million, or 28.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In terms of product items, September orders for information
technology and communication goods generated US$3.82 billion, up by
15.05 percent from the same month of a year ago, while orders for
electronic products were valued at US$4.42 billion, posting an
increase of 32.73 percent compared to the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
Orders for textile products hit US$1.09 billion in value,
slightly decreasing 1.72 percent from a year ago.

<P>
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
Chairwoman Chen Chu said Thursday the Cabinet-level council will make
every possible effort to help disabled people find jobs.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the pledge at the opening of a job fair for mentally
and physically challenged people in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the unemployment rate among people with disabilities
is 14.6 percent, Chen said the CLA has consistently
worked hard to help the mentally or physically challenged find jobs.
</P>
<P>
"The current job fair is part of these efforts and the CLA will
organize similar activities in other parts of the island to mediate
job opportunities for the disabled," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Chen said, the CLA has asked other
government agencies to hire more disabled staff members. For
instance, the Labor Insurance Bureau has recruited a batch of blind
people to join its work force responsible for handling a backlog of
insurance premiums collections. Since then, Chen said, the bureau's
premium revenues have increased by NT$1 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
"The achievement proves the devotion and capability of disabled
workers, " Chen said, adding that she hopes more disabled people can
bravely stand out to seek jobs.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Chen said, the CLA will continue working to improve
job opportunities and working conditions for the mentally and
physically challenged.
</P>
<P>
The job fair, held at the plaza in front of the Chung Cheng
Cultural Center in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, attracted a
large number of disabled job seekers and prospective employers. Vice
Premier Yeh Chu-lan also attended the opening ceremony.

NEW YEAR HOLIDAY CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS MAY BE POSSIBLE: MAC

<TEXT>
<P>
Direct charter flights across the Taiwan
Strait during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday may still be
possible, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said even though Beijing may be unwilling to discuss with
Taiwan the opening of regular direct cross-strait charter passenger
and cargo flights before the island's Dec. 11 legislative elections,
it may still be willing to consider special cross-strait charter
flights during the lunar new year holiday to facilitate the return
of Taiwan business people operating in mainland China, commonly known
as "taishang," for family reunions.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China allowed major Taiwan carriers to operate special
charter flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong
Kong/Macau during the 2003 Chinese New Year holiday for the
convenience of home-bound "taishang." Such services were not offered
during the 2004 Chinese New Year season because Beijing declined to
negotiate technical details for mainland Chinese carriers to operate
similar charter flights.
</P>
<P>
If the two sides can reach an agreement allowing Taiwan and
mainland Chinese carriers to operate special non-stop, cross-strait
charter flights during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday, which
runs from Feb. 6-13, 2005, Chiu said, it will mark a new breakthrough
in the development of cross-strait relations.

<P>
Former Panamanian President Mireya
Moscoso said in a statement Wednesday that she did not receive US$1
million from Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian as alleged by
Taiwan's opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The Arnulfista Party, to which Moscoso belongs, issued the
statement amid allegations made by some Taiwan opposition People
First Party politicians and a radio program host that President Chen
gave the outgoing Moscoso a check for US$1 million as a "birthday
gift" when he visited Panama in early September for the inauguration
of new Panamanian President Martin Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
Former Panamanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Harmodio Arias, who
telephoned Moscoso about the issue, said that Moscoso was furious
about the allegations, describing them as absurd and the persons who
made them as harboring evil intentions.
</P>
<P>
Arias noted that no one from Taiwan had presented Moscoso
birthday gifts, and the persons who said she had received a US$1
million check have no respect for her.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on
Wednesday refuted as ludicrous the allegations, and President Chen
Shui-bian decided to file a lawsuit against the two lawmakers and the
radio talk show host Thursday over the rumors, which the suit says
have seriously damaged the president's reputation.

OVER 300 BLACK-FACED SPOONBILLS ARRIVE IN TAINAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of black-faced spoonbills
that have arrived in the wetlands near the mouth of the Tsengwen
River in Tainan, southern Taiwan, has exceeded 300, almost twice the
number seen last year at this time.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tainan Black-Faced Spoonbills Conservation
Association, as of Thursday, 320 black-faced spoonbills have arrived
in the area, a favorite habitat for the rare birds, in comparison
with 155 that arrived in the area at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
The black-faced spoonbills usually migrate from North Asia to the
warmer wetlands in Taiwan and other Asian countries between late
September and early December every year to overwinter, with almost
half of the number of black-faced spoonbills around the world staying
at the wetlands near the mouth of the Tsengwen River, and the others
arriving in Hong Kong, Vietnam, China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a report conducted by the Tainan County
Animal Disease Control Center, one test site in the area has shown
positive for clostridium botulinum, a major factor in the death of
waterfowl, and the center has issued warnings to relevant agencies to
strengthen protection measures for the black-faced spoonbills and
other waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
The clostridium botulinum caused the death of 73 black-faced
spoonbills from late 2002 to early 2003, according to a bird

Members of the "truth investigation
commission" formed at the insistence of opposition parties to look
into the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian, called on the
Criminal Investigation Bureau Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ho Yu-yi, the director of the bureau in charge of the
investigation into the assassination attempt, told commission members
that the case is very difficult due to the lack of evidence and given
its political overtones.
</P>

Ho said many people are reluctant to come forward with
information about the politically charged case.
</P>
<P>
Citing as an example, Ho said the bureau appealed to the public
about three months ago to come forward with information about a man
who was caught on TV footage at the scene before the shooting, but so
far not single person has spoken up.
</P>
<P>
Police have offered NT$53 million (US$1.56 million) for
information leading to the arrest of the gunman who shot and lightly
wounded the president and Vice President Annette Lu.

Despite these difficulties, Ho said everything that can be done is

US EXPERT RECOMMENDS DUAL RESTRAINTS APPROACH TOWARD TAIWAN ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin &amp; Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-standing strategic ambiguity
in U.S. policy on the Taiwan issue should better be depicted as dual
restraints, Frank S. Jannuzi, a U.S. expert on East Asian affairs for
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in Washington Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jannuzi said in a speech at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced
International Studies, Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C.,
that dual restraints means the United States should urge Taiwan to
refrain from provoking China by toying with the idea of independence
while urging China to refrain from using force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Jannuzi, who was portrayed as the right-hand man of Senator Joe
Biden, the senior Democrat in the Foreign Relations Committee and a
favorite candidate for Secretary of State if John Kerry wins the
presidential election in November, said the dual restraints are not a
substitute for strategic ambiguity, which is favored by Kerry, but
rather the other side of the same coin.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there have been several contradictory developments
between Taiwan and the mainland, Jannuzi said Taiwan is increasingly
being woven together with the mainland in economics through its huge
investment there while seeking an identity separate from China in
politics, and China has been building up its military force and vows
to take over Taiwan at whatever cost.
</P>
<P>
Under this situation, Jannuzi said the United States should stick
to its policy based on its three comuniques with China and its Taiwan
Relations Act, and call for self-restraint from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Washington should also assure Taiwan that it won't improve ties
with China at the expense of Taiwan, and try to build trust with
one another, Jannuzi went on.
</P>
<P>
It takes times and patience to solve the disputes between Taiwan
and the mainland and Washington should give clear messages
rather then complicate things with confusing indications.
</P>
<P>
Jannuzi said he didn't think Kerry, if he wins the November
election, will drop any promises made by the proceeding government to
Taiwan, including the offer of arms to Taiwan.

TYPHOON NOCK-TEN EXPECTED TO BRING TORRENTIAL RAINS TO TAIWAN: CWB
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) is closely
monitoring Typhoon Nock-Ten, the 24th typhoon reported in the Pacific
Ocean region this year, CWB sources reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Nock-Ten was centered some 1,900 kilometers southeast of
Taiwan at 10 a.m. Friday, moving northwesterly toward the island at a
speed of 21 kilometers per hour. With a radius of 200 kilometers, the
typhoon was packing maximum sustained winds of up to 180 kilometers
per hour, CWB meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
The forecasters said that they won't be able to determine whether
Nock-Ten will directly hit Taiwan until Saturday at the earliest
given that the typhoon is still far away and that there are many
variables that could influence the typhoon's direction, including the
northeast trade winds.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Nok-Ten comes on the heels of Typhoon Tokage, another
"autumn typhoon, " which pounded Japan Wednesday and caused heavy
damage and the highest death toll of any typhoon to hit the country
in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
The CWB forecasters said they expect Typhoon Nock-Ten to bring
tremendous amounts of rainfall to Taiwan in the following couple of
days regardless of whether or not it hits the island directly.
</P>
<P>
The weather bureau warned people in Taiwan not to take any autumn
typhoon lightly because the arrival of such typhoons coincides with
the northeast monsoon season, a combination which can cause
torrential rains, that in turn can trigger torrents and landslides.

Estimates by U.S. see more rebels with
more funds

Senior American officials are beginning to
assemble a new portrait of the insurgency in
Iraq that has continued to inflict casualties on
American and Iraqi forces, showing that it has
significantly more fighters and far greater
financial resources than had been estimated.
These estimates contrast sharply with earlier
intelligence reports, in which the number of 
insurgents has varied from as few as 2,000 to a 
maximum of 7,000. The revised estimate is 
influencing the military campaign in Iraq, but 
has not prompted a wholesale review of the 
strategy, officials said.

Wall Street Journal: American International
Group could face criminal charges

U.S. federal prosecutors have told American
International Group Inc. that it is the target of
a grand-jury investigation into its sales of 
insurance policies that the government believes 
were aimed at helping companies improperly smooth
their earnings. The target designation,
disclosed by AIG on Thursday, means the
insurance and financial-services company could
face criminal prosecution. It marks the second
instance in which prosecutors have warned AIG or
one of its units of possible criminal charges.

RUSSIAN MAN FOUND ADRIFT AT SEA BY TAIWAN COAST GUARD RETURNS HOME
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Russian man who drifted on the seas
aboard his knockabout for over 5,000 nautical miles and ended up off
the coast of Tamshui, northern Taiwan several days ago, returned
safely to Russia Thursday, Coast Guard Administration (CGA) sources
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Rudnev, a real estate manager from Siberia, had never
imagined that his originally-scheduled 16-day sailing journey would
end up being a one-month ordeal of drifting on the high seas along a
course that took him from Vladivostok to South Korea, Japan and down
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Rudnev was found drifting aboard his unpowered single-mast
sailing boat "Falco" off Tamshui on the night of Oct. 16. When he was
found, Rudnev was in bad shape and had no idea of his location.
Arrangements were made for him to stay at the CGA's Tamshui
operations center.
</P>
<P>
The CGA Tamshui officials notified the Moscow-Taipei Economic and
Cultural Coordination Commission about Rudnev's situation. They also
hired a Taiwanese Russian-language student from Tamkang University in
Tamshui to act as an interpreter as Rudnev speaks no English or
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
After five days of rest, Rudnev departed Taipei for home
Thursday, this time aboard a Northwest Airlines flight. He expressed
his sincere gratitude to Taiwan and said that next time, he will take
his wife and children to Taiwan, "by airplane of course, " to say
thank you again and for tourism.
</P>
<P>
According to Rudnev, he departed from his home in New Siberia
City Sept. 12. After a six day train journey on the "Red Train, " he
reached the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok, from where he
sailed off alone aboard the "Falco" for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
After sailing for about 1,000 nautical miles, Rudnev reached
Pusan, South Korea, Sept. 26 as planned and went ashore for a
four-day backpacking trip.
</P>
<P>
He set off from Pusan for home Sept. 30 but was met with a storm
before long. Having no other option, Rudnev lowered his mast and
drifted. Four days later, he found himself beached ashore at a
fishing village in northwest Japan. With the assistance of the
Russian embassy in Japan, he obtained his visa and took a sightseeing
trip in Japan for seven days.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 10, he departed Japan for home and was immediately met
with strong northeast trade winds. Like a small leaf, his boat
drifted for about one week in high waves before it was pushed
southward.
</P>
<P>
Rudnev's situation turned for the worse when Typhoon Tokage, the
deadliest typhoon to hit Japan in two decades, swept the region with
gusty winds, downpours and a record-large radius of 500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
During the typhoon's onslaught, Rudnev on at least two occasions
felt certain he would not survive. However, he did, and after
drifting further southward, he was met by Taiwanese patrol officers
who brought him to safety in Tamshui.

GLOBAL CHINESE-LANGUAGE DOMAIN NAME AND ADDRESS SYSTEM POSSIBLE: ITU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,   Oct.   21  (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C.tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts from the International
Communication Union (ITU) are not optimistic about the development of
a global Chinese-language Internet domain name and address system,
noting that many technical problems still need to be solved before
such a system can be used by all the netizens in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based ITU is an international organization within the
United Nations System where governments and the private sector
coordinate global telecom networks and services.
</P>
<P>
As the management of Internet domain names and addresses has
become an important issue in the future development of the Internet,
the ITU experts have expressed that developing a Chinese-language
Internet domain name and address system is absolutely possible for
those who use computers with Chinese-language software.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that using Chinese-language Internet domain names
and addresses is very easy for Chinese computer users, the experts
said, however, that for those who not do know Chinese, even a Chinese
key-in operation might become a tough matter. Besides, they said,
Chinese has not yet become an international language.
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely possible to develop Chinese, Korean and Japanese
Internet domain names and addresses, the experts said, adding however
that in order to develop these domain name and address systems, many
technical problems still need to be solved.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that English letters and Arabic numerals are
most commonly used in Internet domain names and addresses, many
people have been researching how to develop Chinese, Korean,
Japanese, Arabic and Russian Internet domain name and address
systems, the experts said, adding that the ITU will also set up
working groups to do research on relevant matters.

DEFENSE MINISTER PLAYS DOWN REPORTED MAINLAND WARPLANE PROVOCATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Defense Minister Lee Jye said
Friday that mainland Chinese warplanes did not traverse the center
line of the Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from mainland
China, during a training exercise late last month.
</P>
<P>
Lee was responding to a media report that a large fleet of
mainland Chinese warplanes flew very close to the sensitive Taiwan
Strait center line in late September in an act of provocation.
</P>
<P>
The media report quoted U.S. sources as saying that more than 10
squadrons of various types of mainland warplanes, including Su-27,
Su-30, J-8 and J-10 (mainland versions of the MiG-21) jet fighters
and various kinds of bombers, flew 30-plus sorties close to the
Taiwan Strait center line in the second half of September. The number
of sorties broke the single-day record set in 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's military aircraft had scrambled into the air to monitor
the mainland warplane operations, the report said, adding that the
situation in the Taiwan Strait became extremely tense at one point.
</P>
<P>
Minister Lee played down the report when asked by lawmakers about
the event during a legislative session, saying that no mainland
Chinese warplanes joining the reported training exercise had
traversed the center line.
</P>
<P>
Lee further said the Ministry of National Defense had dispatched
military aircraft to scramble to monitor the mainland warplane
exercises in accordance with the armed forces' combat regulations.
</P>
<P>
In the face of mainland China's growing military threat, Lee
said, the military will continue to beef up its defense capabilities
and intensify its combat preparedness.

KMT DEMANDS AUTHORITIES RETRIEVE FORMER PRESIDENT'S GIFT ITEMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislator
on Friday demanded that the Academia Historica retrieve the gifts
received by former President Lee Teng-hui during his presidency,
which the lawmaker said are part of national property.
</P>
<P>
Huang Te-hu, whip of the KMT's legislative caucus, was referring
to the collection, including a number of souvenirs presented to Lee
by foreign officials as diplomatic protocol, which is stored by Lee
at the Hupaokeng military base in Tahsi, Taoyuan County.
</P>
<P>
Huang argued that Lee became a regular citizen when he retired
from public office and that the military base cannot be used as a
"private treasure vault."
</P>
<P>
According to law, the Academia Historica is in charge of managing
the relics of presidents and vice presidents and therefore must check
on Lee's collection and have the items transferred to the
organization as soon as possible, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the items are national property and must be returned to
the people.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker threatened to lodge a complaint with the Control
Yuan and ask for the impeachment of Academia Historica officials for
failing in their duties unless actions are taken on the matter.
</P>
<P>
On the request, Academia Historica President Chang Yen-hsien
promised to work out a set of guidelines in one month on ways to
handle the collection and to send a formal notice to the offices of
the president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in retaliation for the KMT's move, Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) Legislator Chen Chien-ming said he will lead a group of
Academia Historica officials to the residence of KMT Chairman and
former Vice President Lien Chan to check on the gifts received by
Lien during his time as vice president.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Lee has agreed to hand over the collection at Hupaokeng
to the Academia Historica, but Lien has not followed suit.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the gifts collected by Lien, the Academia
Historica must also examine and retrieve those received by the late
Presidents Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo as well as the late
first lady Soong Mayling, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the TSU's accusation, KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung
said Lien has not kept any of the gifts he received during his term
as vice president.
</P>
<P>
Chang said Lien had submitted all the souvenirs he received to
Lee because all the diplomatic missions performed by Lien during his
vice presidency were under Lee's directives.
</P>
<P>
Chang urged the TSU lawmaker "not to carry his political stunt
too far."

PRESIDENT MEETS WITH APEC SUMMIT ORGANIZING COMMITTEE CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
he would like to attend the annual informal leadership meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in person but that he
has instead named a Nobel laureate to attend on his behalf to spare
the host country any unnecessary trouble.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with Milenko E. Skoknic,
chief executive of the organizing committee of the APEC Chile 2004
activities scheduled to be held in the Chilean capital of Santiago in
November.
</P>
<P>
After receiving a formal invitation from Chilean President
Ricardo Lagos Escobar to attend the Nov. 20-21 APEC summit meeting,
Chen told his guest that he has decided to name Lee Yuan-tseh, the
head of Taiwan's most prestigious research body, Academia Sinica, to
represent him at the upcoming informal leadership gathering.
</P>
<P>
Lagos asked APEC Secretariat Executive Director Mario Artaza to
extend the invitation to Chen in Taipei Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
Chen told Skoknic that he feels regret over being barred from
attending the annual APEC summit meeting in person simply because of
Beijing's opposition.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take part in the event in person, but I do not
want to cause any trouble for the host country. Therefore, I have
named Lee to serve as my proxy at the meeting," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He requested that the Chilean organizing committee treat Lee with
dignity and extend the same courtesies offered to any national
leader.
</P>
<P>
Chen also asked Skoknic to help arrange for Lee to hold bilateral
talks with the top leaders or their representatives of other APEC
member states on the sidelines of the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
It will be the third time that Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel
Prize in chemistry, has represented Chen at the annual APEC summit.
</P>
<P>
Despite the inability of the president attending, Chen said
Taiwan has consistently played an active role in all APEC events. For
instance, Taiwan has made positive contributions in the promotion of
digitalization, public health and security cooperation -- major tasks
outlined in the declaration issued at the end of the 2003 APEC
summit.
</P>
<P>
"We feel honored and take pride in participating in APEC
activities, " he said, adding that Taiwan will continue to throw its
full support behind APEC's cause of promoting free trade, investment
and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen said, Taiwan will do it utmost to assist the six
developing countries in the APEC bloc in technological personnel
cultivation to narrow the "digital gap."
</P>
<P>
Chen also suggested that APEC organize a meeting of health
ministers each year to boost cooperation in prevention of
communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen promised that Taiwan will take an even more active
role in preventing avian flu, dengue fever and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups 21 Asia-Pacific economies -- Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines,
Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

EXPERTS SAY IMPROVE ECONOMY TO REVERSE FALLING BIRTH RATE TREND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of experts and scholars suggested
Friday that Taiwan improve its domestic economy as a fundamental
solution to the country's ever-declining birth rate.
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing sponsored by the Ministry of the Interior,
the experts offered stopgap measures as well as fundamental solutions
for the problem of Taiwan's declining birth rate, which is now one of
the lowest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The experts suggested that the government offer better subsidies
to married couples for births and for child-raising, lower tax rates
for adults with children, and provide better nursery facilities to
encourage married couples to have more babies. These, they said, are
just stopgap measures.
</P>
<P>
They said measures must be taken to improve the country's economy
as a fundamental solution to the problem of Taiwan's declining birth
rate. When the economy is revved up, the unemployment rate tackled,
and commodity prices stabilized, married couples will feel more
secure about having additional children, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Chien Tai-lang, vice minister of the interior, said at the
hearing that it is an imperative that the government move to reverse
the falling birth rate as the declining birth rate is leading to a
drop in the ratio of younger citizens to elderly citizens. "A greying
society is poised to trigger more social and economic problems for
Taiwan," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Interior Ministry tallies, the ratio of married
women to childbirths was 1.24 for 2003, representing a significant
drop from the figure of 1.8 some 10 years earlier and one of the
lowest figures in the world.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) , who were also present at the hearing, said that Taiwan's
average birth rate will post negative growth by 2022 if the current
trend is not effectively reversed.
</P>
<P>
With the birth rate continuing to fall, Taiwan will see fewer
people supporting more elderly people, CEPD officials said. They
noted that last year, each elderly retiree was supported financially
by eight working-age people in the country. By 2026, there will be
only three working-age people to support each retiree, creating a
serious social problem, they said.

PFP LAWMAKER APOLOGIZES FOR 'HUSH MONEY' REMARK ABOUT PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung apologized Friday for accusing President
Chen Shui-bian of having paid "hush money" to former Panamanian
President Mireya Moscoso after the comment received extensive
criticism.
</P>
<P>
A mainland Chinese Web site alleged that President Chen had given
Moscoso US$1 million as a birthday gift when he was in Panama
recently for the inauguration of the country's new president.
</P>
<P>
The story was picked up by Taiwan radio talk show host Jaw
Shau-kong and then repeated by Liu, who along with his colleague,
Tsai Chung-han, speculated that Chen had paid the money to keep her
quiet after President Chen made unwelcomed sexual advances toward
Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
President Chen on Thursday filed a civil lawsuit against all
three men, asking for the restoration of his reputation.
</P>
<P>
Liu said he was "only trying to be funny" by using the term "hush
money," and that he was sorry for his indiscreet expression.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu said his apology does not mean that he was wrong for
having doubts about the government's foreign aid policy.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the truth must be discovered regarding the country's
"secret funding" to its diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on reports that Moscoso plans to file a
libel suit against the three men over the allegations, saying he will
only express an opinion after he understands more of what is going
on.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso has denied she received US$1 million from President Chen.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, a group of female legislative candidates from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party demanded that the PFP remove Liu
from its list of nominees for at-large legislative seats because of
his chauvinistic language against a female head of state of one of
the country's diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
The politicians said Liu's remarks damaged Taiwan's international
image, and they also asked Tsai and Jaw to take responsibility for
what they said.

CIB DENIES REPORTS ABOUT MAINLAND GETTING NT$8 MILLION BOUNTY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
denied a media report Friday that mainland Chinese police have
received a share of NT$8 million in the NT$20 million bounty promised
by the Taiwan government to whoever helped nab two of its most wanted
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
"The report was all wrong, " a CIB official said, adding that no
mainland Chinese police have ever applied for the bounty following
the Sept. 23 repatriation of Hsueh Chiu and Chen Yi-hua from China to
Taiwan in accordance with the Kinmen Agreement signed by the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to current regulations, whoever provides leads
contributing to the arrest of felons is eligible to receive the
bounty as promised by the Taiwan government. Except for Taiwan's law
enforcement offices and their staff, the recipients could be local
people, foreigners or individual mainland Chinese people or agencies.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the CIB official said, the regulations stipulate
that bounty claimants must tip off Taiwan's law enforcement
authorities or their overseas offices and produce a detailed written
report of their actions.
</P>
<P>
"The NT$20 million bounty promised for the arrest of Hsueh and
Chen will be distributed in accordance with our existing regulations
and procedures, " he said, adding that mainland Chinese police have
never filed any application to share the bounty.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a Taiwan informant first tipped off
the CIB on the two notorious criminals' whereabouts on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"After we verified the tipoffs, we requested the informant to
report the case to mainland Chinese public security officers who then
arrested the two in Xiamen, Fujian province, in July.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh and Chen, wanted in Taiwan in connection with at least a
dozen robberies, kidnappings and extortion plots over the last three
years, were handed over to Taiwan police on the outlying island of
Matsu by mainland security officers and escorted by police officers
to Taipei via air Sept. 23.

NEW AIR ACCORD EXPANDS CAPACITY ON TAIWAN-JAPAN ROUTES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials from Taiwan and Japan approved a
new air pact Friday authorizing a robust increase in cargo and
passenger transport capacities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The pact -- endorsed by the Association of East Asian Relations
(AEAR) and the Japan Interchange Association (JIA) -- guarantees that
the number of passenger seats offered by airline carriers from the
two countries will be increased by some 200,000 a year and the
restrictions on bilateral charter flights will be canceled as well,
officials from the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said.
</P>
<P>
CAA officials attributed the increases mainly to the imminent
arrival of new A330-300 and A330-200 aircraft to China Airlines' and
EVA Airways' fleet plying the Taiwan-Japan route.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, which took immediate effect, CAL and EVA
will have a combined increase of 1,858 passenger seats aboard their
flights to and from Japan per week, representing nearly 200,000 seats
per year.
</P>
<P>
Under the new accord, the number of all-cargo flights will be
doubled from the current level.
</P>
<P>
Also under the accord, restrictions on the number of charter
flights between the two countries was removed. The number had been
fixed at 800 per year before 2002, but the two sides exchanged 1,000
charter flights in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Sendai, a city in northeastern Japan popular with tourists, and
Hiroshima in the Kansai area were added in April to the existing list
of Japanese cities operating weekly flights to and from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
With the inclusion of Sendai and Hiroshima, the number of
Japanese cities operating regular weekly flights to and from Taiwan
has increased to seven from the previous five -- Tokyo, Osaka,
Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo.
</P>
<P>
AEAR and JIA are quasi-official agencies authorized by the
Taiwanese and Japanese governments, respectively, to handle exchanges
in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The renewed air pact is a shot in the arm for Taiwan in its
efforts to double the number of foreign tourists arriving in Taiwan
by 2008, CAA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The pact will not only help attract more Japanese tourists to
Taiwan, but will also help boost economic and cultural exchanges
between the two countries, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Taiwan's largest source of tourists from overseas, with
about one-third of the two to three million tourists visiting Taiwan
each year being Japanese.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest effort to promote bicycling,
the Taichung County government announced Friday that it will build a
new route that will be the first in Asia to take advantage of an
abandoned train tunnel.
</P>
<P>
County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng said work for the
construction plan will begin in November and is expected to be
finished in the early months of next year. He also indicated that the
project will give his county its third bike-only trail built along
abandoned railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
There are currently two bike-only routes along old railways in
the county -- the 11-kilometer Tungfeng Green Corridor and the
12-kilometer Tanyalu Green Path. The former route, starting from
Fengyuan City and ending at Tungshi Railway Station has become very
popular because it passes through scenic parks, historic tourist
spots and skirts the Shikang Dam.
</P>
<P>
The Tanyalu Green Path was built on a military railroad that was
used by the Chingchuankang Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
The new route will start from the Houli horse stables in Houli
township, then enter the 1,269-meter No. 9 tunnel on the old Western
Railway Line. Exiting the tunnel, the trail will hook up with the
spectacular 382-meter Hualiang Steel Bridge on Tachia River. It will
end where the Tungfeng Green Corridor route begins.

GROWTH OF TAIWAN'S MANUFACTURING SECTOR TO SLOW NEXT YEAR: TIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's manufacturing sector is expected
to post slower growth next year due to a projected economic slowdown
in the United States, one of the island's major trading partners,
according to a report by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report was presented by TIER associate research fellow Chang
Chien-yi at a seminar on the status and market trends of technology
industries.
</P>
<P>
Chang predicted Taiwan's industrial production index in 2005 will
see moderate growth of between 10 percent to 15 percent, with the
economic growth of the U.S. likely to dwindle next year to around 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., as well as mainland China and Europe, are the top three
markets for Taiwan's electronics parts and components, chemicals and
basic metals, which are the three sectors that account for the
largest share of the island's industrial production, according to
Chang.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the economic showing of these three regions in 2005 is
related to the performance of Taiwan's manufacturing sector next
year, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the projected slowdown in the U.S., the mainland is
likely to see an economic growth of at least 8 percent, and Europe at
around 2 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that export orders received by Taiwan during the
first eight months of this year amounted to US$135.8 billion, up
26.21 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Export orders in August alone totalled US$18.06 billion,
increasing 25.54 percent year-on-year, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Orders for in the electronics sector registered the highest
growth rate at 36.45 percent, or US$1.09 billion, as the global
semiconductor industry recovered from a recession, he added.

<P>
The Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions
(TCTU) ended a 72-hour hunger strike Friday after the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's legislative caucus finally agreed to
their demands, which are aimed at slowing the government's
privatization efforts.
</P>
<P>
The appeal had gained the endorsement of the opposition
Kuomintang, People First Party and Taiwan Solidarity Union caucuses
in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hsu-chung, leader the protest, said the TCTU expects the
legislators to pass a resolution in line with the agreement reached
between TCTU and the caucuses, before the Legislative Yuan adjourns
on Nov. 10 in preparation for the legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the TCTU will start a negative publicity campaign
against any party that goes back on its promise.
</P>
<P>
The agreement states that the government should consult with the
TCTU on its privatization policies and postpone the selling of
state-run enterprises until a consensus is reached with the workers.
</P>
<P>
It also says that the state-run enterprises should sign group
contracts with trade unions before they are privatized.

A Taiwan-produced tea was given an
innovative food award at the just-concluded Paris SIAL 2004
international food trade fair for its creative packaging and
fortified anti-aging effects.
</P>
<P>
Lao Tsu Tea Industrial Co. Chairman Yeh Liang-chuan said after
receiving the award at the trade show's closing ceremony Thursday
that the prize marks the recognition of his company's efforts to
inject new life into traditional drinks.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the company's long-term marketing efforts, Yeh said,
the various kinds of Lao Tsu teas, which come in cans, have made
successful inroads into France, Great Britain and the Netherlands.

During the SIAL trade fair, Yeh said, several French supermarket
chains also expressed interest in selling Lao Tsu teas. Moreover, he
added, the teas, including mint- and jasmine-flavored tea and white

Chu Ming-tao, director of the Taiwan Trade Center in Paris, said
many trade fair visitors expressed interest in a variety of snack
and health foods exhibited by Taiwan manufacturers, some of whom
secured orders during the show. Chu said traditional foods and drinks
can find a new lease on life with innovative packaging and marketing
strategies.

TAIWAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's unemployment rate dropped in
September to a seasonally adjusted 4.35 percent, the lowest record
since April of 2001, according to statistics released Friday by the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).
</P>
<P>
Without taking the seasonal factors into consideration,
September's unemployment rate stood at 4.5 percent, down by 0.17
percentage points from the previous month's level.
</P>
<P>
The jobless ratio represents some 461,000 unemployed workers last
month across the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of workers hired across the country fell to
978,800 last month, a decrease of 48,000 people from the August
level, due to summer jobs ending.
</P>
<P>
The average unemployment rate for the first nine months of this
year was 4.52 percent, down 0.56 percentage points year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed had no work for an average of 27.4 weeks, up 1.2
weeks when compared with the figure of a month ago, which saw new
job-seekers being unemployed for an average of 25.2 weeks, while
others were jobless for an average of 28 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Liu Pei-cherng, a DGBAS deputy division chief, ascribed fall in
the unemployment rate to the country's economic recovery over the
past years. He predicted that the jobless rate will continue to fall
for the rest of this year.

NO EXACT TIMETABLE FOR LIFTING BAN ON U.S. BEEF: HEALTH DEPARTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Department of Health officials said Friday
that there is no timetable for reintroducing the importation of U.S.
beef to Taiwan after America was declared an area affected by mad cow
disease late last year.
</P>
<P>
The health department suspended the import of beef and related
products from the United States on Dec. 24, 2003, the same day that
the United States announced it had discovered a case of mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
In late March, the United States applied to Taiwan's health
department to have the ban lifted.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lu-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of Food
Sanitation, noted that although there was only a single case of mad
cow disease found in the United States, the actual situation in the
United States has to be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
If everything is fine, U.S. beef can again be imported to Taiwan
soon, perhaps sometime between late this year or early next year,
Chen added.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said, if there is any doubt over the quality of the
beef, the ban will not be lifted at that time.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, testing for mad cow disease from June 1 to Oct. 17 on
85,812 cows came up negative, indicating that there is very little
chance that American cows have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. government has adopted stricter
slaughtering techniques to prevent possible infection, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Chen also stressed that although a Taiwan "mad cow disease
advisory committee" has suggested a conditional re-importation of
American beef, Chen said it is necessary that a team be formed to
check whether the new butchery measures are fully implemented.

<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday he
hopes cultural exchanges and substantive relations between Taiwan and
Japan can be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while meeting with Hisaoki Kamei, an
influential member of the lower house of the Japanese Diet who is
heading a large Japanese delegation from his home prefecture of
Shimane on a goodwill visit in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ma told his guest that municipal senior high schools in Taipei
have offered second foreign language courses for its students.
</P>
<P>
"More than 4,000 senior high school students have chosen Japanese
as their second foreign language, while the combined number of
students who are studying French, German or Spanish is only about
3,000, " Ma said, adding that the figures indicate that Japanese is
the most favored second foreign language for young Taipei students.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he hopes Taiwan-Japanese cultural exchanges can be
further expanded and that senior high school students from both
countries can be given more opportunities to learn from each other's
cultures, languages, customs and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kamei, a senior member of Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, said he founded a pro-Taiwan association in Shimane
Prefecture four years ago to promote commercial and cultural
exchanges with Taiwan. Several agriculture schools in Shimane
Prefecture, which is located along the Sea of Japan in the Chugoku
region on Honshu Island, have forged close ties with Hualien
Agriculture School in eastern Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kamei assured Ma that he will continue to promote tourist,
cultural, educational and commercial exchanges between Taiwan and
Japan.

<P>
The Executive Yuan will earmark NT$10
billion (US$296 million) in 2005 to encourage mergers among
universities to create world-class universities, vice chairman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chang Jing-sen
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the announcement after Premier Yu Shyi-kun said
Thursday that a plan for the creation of world-class universities
began when two major universities in Taiwan -- National Chiao Tung
University and National Tsinghua University -- entered into
discussions on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that it is expected that the resultant university
will be listed as one of the top 200 universities in the world,

National Tsinghua University President Hsu Hsia-sen said he
appreciates the Cabinet's plan, adding that he is confident that the
new university will be listed in the top 100 universities in the

ECONOMIC AID TO NICARUGUA NOT FROZEN: NICARUGUA MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Panama City, Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By M.H.Huang and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nicaruguan Minister of Foreign Affairs
Norman Caldera said Friday that the Republic of China has not frozen
its economic aid to Nicaragua, noting that a proposal raised by some
ROC lawmakers to freeze the aid has already been rejected by their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks while responding to media questions
after Nicaruguan President Enrique Bolanos said Thursday that Taiwan
had decided to freeze its economic aid to the Central American ally.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that he had made a report to the president after his
ministry received a message from an unofficial channel saying that
Taiwan had decided to freeze its cooperation plan with Nicaragua,
Caldera, however, said that he later on realized that Taiwan did not
make such a decision.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that if Taiwan freezes its economic aid to
Nicaragua, then his country will not receive a donation of US$5
million and other loans from the island next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ROC Ambassador to Nicaragua, Antonio T.S. Tsai also
told local media that freezing the aid to Nicaragua was only a
proposal made by the Legislative Yuan's Committee for Foreign
Affairs, and that the yuan did not adopted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that ROC Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs
Francisco L.Y. Hwang has also confirmed that the proposal was
rejected by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Tsai also denied any involvement of the Taiwan government in
supporting Bolano's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaruguan Ministry of Audit requested Oct. 7 that the
Nicaruguan Parliament recall Bolanos since he has refused to explain
the source of his expenditures during the campaign. According to the
investigation of justice agencies, part of Bolano's outlay for his
campaign came from Taiwan's entrepreneurs.

TRAFFIC CONTROLS FOR GOVERNMENT LEADERS TRIGGERS WAR OF WORDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stopping traffic so that leaders of the
nation can move around the city unimpeded may seem like a routine
privilege accorded statesmen, but Taipei's mayor says that the public
is unhappy with the situation and he wants Taiwan's leaders to "go to
work on time" instead.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday that if traffic controls
for government leaders troubles the public, the practice ought to be
reviewed, but she denied reports that she is often late for
appointments.
</P>
<P>
Lu was responding to remarks by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou the
previous day that he hopes "the three top leaders will go to work on
time every day" so that special traffic controls will not take too
much of local beat-cops' time, adding that the controls create
traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
Although the mayor didn't name the three, he clearly meant
President Chen Shui-bian, Lu and Premier Yu Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
President Chen's staff said that the president often stays late
at his office. He usually eats lunch in his office and has take-out
in the evening; therefore, it is incorrect to say that he spends much
time commuting, certainly during rush hours. They added that when the
president travels outside Taipei, he does not ride in a motorcade so
as not to affect local traffic. The staff said that Mayor Ma was
"making a fuss out of nothing."
</P>
<P>
Lu denied allegations by local beat-cops that she was late eight
out of 10 times wherever she went, saying that such claims were an
"exaggeration," and were only attempts to smear her name.
</P>
<P>
She said that she understands the extra effort that the beat-cops
have to make on occasion, but protecting the head of state and the
vice president is the natural duty of a nation's security forces.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu, while campaigning in Miaoli in northern Taiwan.
responded Saturday by saying that "Ma could learn from President Chen
when Chen was Taipei mayor."
</P>
<P>
Yu said that poor traffic can be attributed to poor
implementation of traffic laws, and Ma shouldn't link the traffic
situation with other things, adding that while Chen was Taipei mayor,
the traffic was very good, and one premier "who later became the vice
president" -- meaning Chairman Lien Chan of the opposition
Kuomintang, which is Ma's party -- could go home for lunch and take a
nap every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus in the
Legislative Yuan also said Saturday that Ma was trying to "vilify"
the president and vice president and the DPP administration before
the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mayor Ma said Saturday on the sidelines of a stumping
trip for an opposition candidate, that it is a fact that special
traffic controls sometimes last longer than expected, and the public
has to wait patiently.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that he is not assigning blame, but wants to
"remind those responsible in a good-natured way."

PUBLIC URGED TO GET PNEUMOCOCCUS SHOTS

<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)

<TEXT>
<P>
The public is urged to get a flu shot as
well as a pneumococcus shot since the number of people dying from
pneumonia in Taiwan rises every year, doctors advised Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors noted that free flu shots began early this month, but in
addition to flu, pneumonia is also a common health hazard in the
autumn and winter, noting that statistics released by the Department
of Health showed that pneumonia is the seventh most common cause of
death in Taiwan, with 5,099 people succumbing last year. Pneumonia is
the fifth-largest killer of the elder over 65, with 4,380 dying last
year.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Huang Li-ming of National Taiwan University Hospital said
Saturday that industrialized countries such as the United States,
Canada, Australia and Germany have listed the pneumococcus vaccine,
along with flu vaccines, as important for the elderly and patients of
chronic diseases to have.
</P>
<P>
Pneumococcus causes 40,000 deaths and 500,000 cases of pneumonia
annually in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that pneumococcus vaccines are not needed each year as
one dose is good for five years. One shot in Taiwan costs about
NT$1,200 (US$35.70).

FORMER PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT DECLINES TO SUE TAIWANESE FOR LIBEL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Panama City,  Oct.  22 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Panamanian President Mireya
Elisa Moscoso Rodriguez has told the Republic of China's envoy to
Panama that she has decided not to sue three Taiwanese for libel.
</P>
<P>
Two members of the ROC's opposition People First Party (PFP)
caucus at the Legislative Yuan alleged Tuesday that Moscoso received
US$1 million from President Chen Shui-bian as a birthday gift,
allegedly as "hush money" to cover the president's unwanted sexual
advances.
</P>
<P>
The former president was furious after receiving a phone call
from former Panamanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Harmodio Arias
about the allegations and said at the time that she would sue the
lawmakers and a talk radio host for ruining her reputation.
</P>
<P>
But Moscoso on Friday told ROC Ambassador to Panama, David Hu via
Arias that she had decided not to sue and will make a declaration of
legal oath as proof for anyone who continues to believe the false
claims. The declaration will be sent to the ROC's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the same day that Arias also told him that
after consulting with her lawyer, the former president found that it
would be impossible for her to sue the Taiwanese from Panama.
</P>
<P>
The ROC Embassy to Panama released a statement Thursday, saying
that President Chen will sue two PFP lawmakers and the president of a
radio station's board of directors for making the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Hu also said that on behalf of the president and the Taiwan
government, he has asked Arias to convey his regret about the
groundless allegations to Moscoso.

PRODUCTION OF SOUTHERN TAIWAN SCIENCE PARK TO TOP NT$280 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Dallas,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Chang Hui-yen and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Production at the Southern Taiwan Science
Park is expected to reach at least NT$280 billion (US$8.24 billion)
this year and stands a chance of reaching NT$300 billion, an official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tai Chein, director-general of the Southern Taiwan Science Park
Administration, made the forecast while hosting an investment
conference in Dallas, which is known as the "Telecommunications
Corridor," in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Tai noted that the science park has set up a telecommunications
technology center in Kaohsiung's Luchu, and urged telecommunications
companies in Dallas to invest in the science park.
</P>
<P>
Tai said the optoelectronics sector, which accounts for 62
percent of manufacturers in the science park, is the main industry of
the park, followed by the semiconductor sector at 28.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
While 95 percent of the land in the Tainan compound of the
science park has been leased out, only 50 percent of the land in the
Kaohsiung compound has been booked, Tai pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A total of 150 manufacturers have passed the government's
screening for investment in the park, and they include a number of
well-known businesses such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,
United Microelectronics, Chi Mei Optoelectronics, Corning
Incorporated, 3M and NEC, Tai said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the total production at the science park will top
NT$280 billion this year, creating 35,000 job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Unless a violent fluctuation occurs in the global economy, the
park is likely to see its production jump to NT$1.9 trillion in 2015
and create 180,000 job opportunities, he added.
</P>
<P>
The delegation led by Tai visited Silicon Valley in San Francisco
and San Diego before arrived in Dallas on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the investment conference, the delegation had called on
the headquarters of telecommunications giant Nortel Networks in
Richardson, Texas.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is scheduled to go to St. Louis, Missouri on
Saturday. It will also participate in a venture investment conference
in Vancouver, Canada before returning to Taiwan on Oct. 29.

TAIWAN SHOULD POSITION ITSELF AS 'ARMED, NEUTRAL COUNTRY': SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan should position itself as an "armed,
permanently neutral country" in its new constitution, a respected
pro-independence scholar suggested Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ketagalan Institute President Lee Hung-hsi, who is versed in
constitutional studies, made the recommendation at the inaugural
ceremony for an aboriginal affairs research class organized by the
Ketagalan Institute, which was founded by President Chen Shui-bian to
nurture a new generation of leaders in various professional fields.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Taiwan should cash in on its economic strength and
technological power to build up an elite deterrent force to dissuade
mainland China from invading the island.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lee said he earnestly hopes that Taiwan can soon
formulate a new constitution which he said should define Taiwan as a
permanently neutral country with an adequate defense capability.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to spare Taiwan from war is to develop the island
in this way," Lee stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee said Taiwan will have to tackle three tough
challenges -- incessant natural disasters, industrial upgrading and
social schisms -- in the future.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan must craft a disaster prevention and post-disaster
rehabilitation mechanism as the island could face increased natural
disasters, such as typhoons and earthquakes, in the years ahead, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lee said Taiwan must upgrade its industries from export
processing to production of high-end products while simultaneously
giving emphasis to environmental protection to ensure sustainable
national development. Among others, Lee said, Taiwan should give
priority to developing the biotechnology and medical industries.
</P>
<P>
The third challenge is to promote internal harmony, Lee said,
adding that ethnic rifts should be addressed with mutual respect,
understanding, patience, love, tolerance and forgiveness.

'PAN-BLUES' SHOULD EXCLUDE OPTION OF TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE: SOONG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PDP)
Chairman James Soong on Saturday urged the "pan-blue alliance" to
insist that Taiwan independence not be a political option, and not to
mix their ideals with those of former President Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
Soong made the remarks in response to reports that Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, a vice chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , said Friday that if there is time, he would not
exclude the possibility of stumping for legislative candidates from
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , which, jointly with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), belongs to the "pan-green camp."
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" is made up of the KMT and PFP.
</P>
<P>
The TSU considers Lee their spiritual leader because of his
advocacy of Taiwanization and Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Soong stressed that the year-end legislative elections will be a
war to defend the Republic of China, reaffirming that he will not
support candidates who list Taiwan independence as an option.
</P>
<P>
Soong also urged "pan-blue alliance" candidates to issue a joint
statement to distinguish their ideals from those of Lee, and
criticized Lee and the DPP as the ones that caused the ethnic rift on
the island.
</P>
<P>
While expressing regret for the allegations made by PFP
Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung against President Chen Shui-bian that Chen
had presented a US$1 million check to former Panamanian President
Mireya Moscoso as a "birthday gift, " Soong noted that the DPP's
decision to sue several PFP lawmakers over the issue is only to shift
public attention from allegations related to the Presidential Office,
in which a former assistant of first lady Wu Shu-jen was said by
opposition lawmakers to have abused some privileges.
</P>
<P>
Soong urged the public to vote for the "pan-blue alliance" to
strictly supervise the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said he can understand that
Wang, being the president of the Legislative Yuan, sometimes is
obligated to stump for candidates of other parties, but he believes
that Wang has the wisdom to handle the issue well.

Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday most of
the huge assets possessed by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) today
were "robbed" from the people and that the government certainly must
have them back.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remark while addressing the opening of the campaign
headquarters of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative
candidates Tu Wen-ching and Chen Chao-ming in Miaoli County.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the KMT was penniless when it fled to Taiwan from
mainland China, but it has gathered assets worth more than NT$100
billion (US$2.94 billion) over 50 years by "robbing the people."
</P>
<P>
The government cannot tolerate this kind of exploitation and will
make every effort to retrieve the "booty," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged voters to help the DPP win over half of the
seats at the Legislative Yuan to facilitate the implementation of
President Chen Shui-bian's policies, pointing out that a lot of the
bills raised by the DPP government were blocked by the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and People First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
The alliance, meanwhile, was able to push through bills they
favor such as the "unconstitutional" special statute on the
establishment of a "truth investigation commission" to probe the
March 19 shooting of President Chen, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
He said only by letting the DPP gain control in the legislature
will such chaotic situations be brought to an end and foster progress
and reforms.

The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
recently completed the installation of a teleconferencing system,
which it says will serve as a mobile command center in the fight
against crime.
</P>
<P>
The system establishes a real-time connection among the 36 police
units around the island, and also links with more then 300 government
agencies, providing them with key information on events as they
unfold.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the system, the CIB will be able to better understand
security situations and the latest developments in various places,
giving them the ability to make adjustments and timely decisions.
</P>
<P>
CIB agents noted that the system connects police bureaus in
various cities and counties, aviation police, harbor police, traffic
police and CIB crime centers in central and southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to upgrading the efficiency of investigations and
reducing the time and cost needed for police to travel, it will
increase the chances that a crime will be solved. It will also be
useful in transferring criminals and in joint efforts to fight
cross-border crime, the agents said.
</P>
<P>
CIB Commissioner Hou You-yi said that the teleconference system
would be a powerful tool in fighting against crime, adding that the
installation of the system also work in tune with the government's

<P>
The government's "Challenge 2008" six-year
development plan has started to make headway as Taiwan's unemployment
rate is expected to dip below 4 percent next year ahead of schedule,
Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hu was addressing the opening of an exhibition on the "Challenge
2008" program at the National Taiwan University stadium in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Hu said Taiwan is facing an unprecedented challenge in the 21st
century with the combined impact of globalization, technological
innovation and green reforms.
</P>
<P>
The program was drafted by the government against this backdrop
two years ago to realize its visions of building Taiwan into a "green
silicon island" to enhance the country's competitiveness, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The program has produced some preliminary results after the
efforts over the past two years, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the country's economic growth will reach 5
percent this year; the unemployment rate will drop to below 4 percent
next year; and investment in research and development is expected to
account for 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2006.
</P>
<P>
These goals are being achieved ahead of schedule, according to
Hu.
</P>
<P>
On the plan to assist the development of high-value industries,
the production of the semiconductor sector will top NT$1 trillion
this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 3.51 million households have access to broadband
networking in Taiwan today, and the island successfully completed the
construction of the Hsuehshan Tunnel -- the world's fifth-longest and
the longest in Southeast Asia -- on Sept. 16, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The free trade zone at Kaohsiung Port will start operations in
January next year, after the openings of a similar one at Keelung
Port on Sept. 30, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hu continued, 95 research and development centers
have been set up by domestic and foreign corporations in Taiwan, and
200 corporations have set up their operations headquarters on the
island.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which showcases Taiwan's technology and lifestyle
of the future, is being held in the northern, central and southern
parts of the island.
</P>
<P>
The show in Taipei will run through Nov. 1. It will move to the
National Museum of Natural Science in Taichung from Nov. 6-15 and
then to the National Science and Technology Museum in Kaohsiung from
Nov. 20-29.
</P>
<P>
Items displayed in the exhibition include anti-bacterial cups,
baseballs and leather couches developed with nanotechnology,
interactive digital TV shows, solar powered generation facilities and
a model of a newly developed anti-mudflow dam.

CLA WILLING TO REVIEW BARTHEL INDEX FOR HIRING FOREIGN CAREGIVERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Barthel index used by the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) to determine whether a local family can hire a
foreign caregiver can be subject to review whenever necessary, a
labor affairs official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Meng-liang, a CLA official in charge of foreign laborers'
vocational training, made the remarks at a public hearing on
caregiver issues sponsored by Legislator Hsu Yuan-kuo of the
opposition People First Party.
</P>
<P>
The Barthel index assesses the degree of disability in a
particular individual.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Chuang An-chi, a representative of employers
of foreign caregivers, complained that the existing Barthel index
adapted by the CLA is too stringent.
</P>
<P>
"According to the CLA standards, only those who have an almost
completely disabled family member can hire a foreign caregiver. It's
a nightmare for prospective employers. For instance, only a
terminally-ill cancer patient can apply to hire a foreign caregiver.
In many cases, when the applicant finally receives a CLA permit, the
patient has already died," Chuang said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Tsai said, the CLA is willing to review its
measurement system whenever necessary. Nevertheless, he added, the
ceiling on the total number of foreign laborers to be imported must
be maintained. Tsai said the CLA will discuss technical details
regarding amendments to foreign caregiver employment regulations.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Legislator Hsu pointed out that the current
NT$18,400 minimum wage protection for foreign caregivers tends to
encourage them to abscond from their original workplace shortly
before their work contracts expire so that they can find another job
illegally in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The minimum wage is usually 10 times the amount a foreign
laborer can earn in his or her home country. Against this backdrop,
foreign laborers like to run away before their original work contract
expire so that they can continue staying in Taiwan to work. I think
we should cancel minimum wage protection for foreign laborers, " Hsu
said, adding he believes that the stringent regulations for hiring
foreign workers are one of reasons for local employers to be willing
to employ runaway foreign laborers.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hsu's proposals, Tsai said lowering the minimum
wage for foreign workers would affect local people's job
opportunities. Under current regulations, he added, a local employer
who hires an absconded foreign worker could face a fine ranging
between NT$150,000 and NT$700,000.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan now has more than 300,000 legal foreign workers, most of
whom are from Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and
Mongolia.

BUSH AND KERRY HAVE SIMILAR CHINA POLICIES BUT DIFFER OVER TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. administration with John Kerry as
president would likely maintain much of the current U.S.-Taiwan
policies with a few critical differences, according to a report
released Saturday by George Washington University's Elliott School of
International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The report on the foreign policies of the two U.S. presidential
hopefuls said that if President George W. Bush is re-elected, his
administration will continue as before, meaning adhering to the
"three communiques" with mainland China and the Taiwan Relations Act.
The United States would also maintain that force by Beijing is no
solution to cross-strait issues and that Taiwan must not do anything
unilaterally to change the status quo.
</P>
<P>
If Kerry is elected, his administration is not expected to change
U.S. China policy dramatically, but where Taiwan is concerned, there
could be less overt backing of President Chen Shui-bian's government
and restrictions could be imposed on the amount and kinds of military
hardware and software, as well as assistance that the United States
would be willing to offer.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Kerry administration is expected to "draw a line
in the sand" for Taipei to observe and would more actively promote
cross-strait dialogues.
</P>
<P>
But the report also said that whoever moves into the White House,
the United States will not forsake Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that even though the stalemate across the
Taiwan Strait has been in effect for many years, a flash point is
drawing near and could even erupt during the next president's term.
If the United States doesn't want to get involved in a terrible war,
even a nuclear one, then its government must have sufficient
contingency plans, it concluded.
</P>
<P>
On trade policy, both candidates attach great importance to the
mainland Chinese market, and will likely pressure mainland China to
fully open its economy to market forces.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with trade disputes with China, the Bush
administration will adopt a more moderate approach, while Kerry will
be more likely to take a harsher stance. Basically, a Bush
administration sees opportunities in an expanding Chinese economy,
while a Kerry administration would see it as a potential threat.

TAICHUNG MAYOR REAFFIRMS GUGGENHEIM BRANCH WILL BE ASSET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu reaffirmed Saturday
that a Guggenheim branch in the central Taiwan city will not be a
liability, adding that he won't do anything that will leave large
debts for future generations.
</P>
<P>
Hu was responding to a challenge by Taichung City Councilwoman
Lin Pei-le who asked the mayor to vow on the fortune of himself and
his family, that a Taichung branch of the Guggenheim Museum won't
leave huge debts in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Taichung City Council is currently reviewing the initial
agreement on building the branch signed between the Taichung
government and the prestigious museum earlier this month. Most of the
members of the reviewing group of the city council and several
lawyers taking part in the review said that this is an "unequal"
contract for Taichung City.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that the Taichung City Government has to pay expenses
of up to NT$15.8 billion (US$468.84 million), including construction
costs, management bills, funding for collecting artistic works,
development costs, subsidies and other miscellaneous fees to
establish the branch.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said categorically that he will never leave behind huge
debts for the nation's children, adding that anyone who had read the
feasibility study of the Guggenheim branch project will understand
that its financial assessment is stated quite clearly, and that it
will "bring prosperity to Taichung's service sector."
</P>
<P>
"If we leave huge debts to our children, do you think the Central
Government will support us and subsidize the budgets? " Hu asked,
referring to earlier promises in August by President Chen Shui-bian
and Premier Yu Shyi-kun to support the project.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that even before the Guggenheim branch comes to Taichung,
it has already brought benefits to the city, meaning that land values
have increased sharply, especially the land surrounding the scheduled
construction site of the branch.
</P>
<P>
On question that the agreement is unfair, Hu said that the
agreement only stipulates the payment Taichung City has to make, and
does not cover the benefits brought with the establishment of the
branch.
</P>
<P>
He urged a "different and a broader perspective" to look at the
matter, saying that the fund for artistic collection belongs to the
branch and the city, which can hardly be called a debt to the central
Taiwan city.

An official of the opposition Kuomintang

Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan in support of candidates from both the KMT

Lin's remarks were an aboutface from the KMT's earlier stance

PRESIDENT CHEN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday he
is optimistic about the resumption of long-stalled dialogue between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that there should be a good chance for resuming
cross-strait dialogue next spring. We may be able to turn a new page
in the cross-strait history and even to create history, " Chen said
while giving a lecture at the Ketagalan Institute.
</P>
<P>
Noting that kicking-start the deadlocked cross-strait dialogue is
an important part to determine his historical status, Chen said he
will make every possible effort to realize this goal.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he believes that the "pan-green" camp of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally -- the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) -- will be able to win a majority in the Dec.
11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. presidential election will conclude in November and our
legislative elections will be held in December. So long as the
'pan-green' camp manages to win a majority in the upcoming elections,
we'll stand a better chance to have Beijing resume cross-strait
dialogue. I think 2005 and 2006 are good time for cross-strait
engagements. Next spring, in particular, should be an auspicious time
for talks. After 2007, Taiwan will enter a presidential election
season again when the thorny cross-strait issues may not be high on
the agenda of both the ruling and opposition camps," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, Chen said, he has extended olive
branches to Beijing on more than 30 occasions. "I think nothing is
impossible in the development of cross-strait ties in the next three
years," he added.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that Chen has taught at a class at the
Ketagalan Institute since its inauguration more than a year ago. The
institute was founded by Chen to nurture a new generation of leaders
in various professional fields.
</P>
<P>
Students of the institute's "national leadership and development
strategy" class came from various social quarters, including
lawmakers, media executives, bankers and other professionals.
</P>
<P>
Students raised 10 questions related to cross-strait relations,
constitutional re-engineering, arms procurement, economic and
financial reforms, historical status, political reforms and national
competitiveness during the closed-door two-hour class. Chen responded
to all the questions in detail.

CABINET TO FORM SPECIAL TASK FORCE TO COPE WITH KYOTO PROTOCOL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet will form a supraministerial
task force to work out strategies for coping with the possible impact
of the Kyoto Protocol which will take effect in three months, a
senior official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), said that with Russia's parliament ratifying the
Kyoto Protocol Friday, the 126-nation U.N. pact, aimed at battling
global warming through curbing greenhouse gas emissions, will come
into force 90 days later.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the treaty is expected to affect greenhouse
gas emission standards in many industries, including semiconductors,
flat-panels, household electric appliances, automobiles,
petrochemicals, steel mills and cement, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a Kyoto Protocol signatory, Hu said,
Taiwan will certainly face pressure from the treaty's signatories
because the country ranks 22nd in the global greenhouse gas emission
rating.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD already held a meeting Friday to discuss relevant
issues, Hu said, adding that he has urged the Cabinet to form a
supraministerial task force to draw up a comprehensive package of
measures to cope with all possible impacts.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hu said optimistically that the impact to Taiwan
should be not as great as in the past now that Taiwan has shifted its
focus on the service industry development.
</P>
<P>
"The service sector now accounts for 67.8 percent of our gross
domestic product (GDP). When the ratio reaches 71 percent in the next
few years, our greenhouse gas emissions will further drop, " Hu said,
adding that the government has been endeavoring to develop
eco-friendly and energy-saving high-technologies and turn Taiwan into
a "green silicon island."

<P>
Local citizens are welcome to apply for
"Natural Person Certificate" (NPC) soon, a Ministry of Finance (MOF)
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
NPC applications before the end of this year are free of charge,
the official said, adding that starting next year, applicants will
have to pay NT$275 each.
</P>
<P>
The official said the ministry will award the 500,000th NPC
applicant with a full set of personal computer, including terminal,
monitor, laser printer and NPC card reading machine.
</P>
<P>
The Natural Personal Certificate is an electronic identity IC
card on the Internet. The certificate is a protocol of the electronic
signature and electronic code between the smart card holder and the
government.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the certificate is an infrastructure service for the
promotion of e-government to upgrade administrative efficiency and
strengthen services for ordinary citizens, the official said more
than 280 public services can now be provided through the Internet
with the NPC card. The number of such services will break the 1,000
mark in three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MOI began to accept NPC card applications April 30, 2003, and
more than 490,000 cards have been issued so far. The number is
growing by 1,000 pieces a day, the official said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to encouraging local people to apply for the NPC
cards, the official said, the ministry will award a personal computer
plus all necessary accessories to the 500,000th applicant.
</P>
<P>
"The application procedures have been simplified. Prospective
applicants can apply with the household registration offices near
their homes," the official said.

A magnitude-4.1 earthquake jolted northern
Taiwan at 10:04 p.m. Saturday, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said.
No damage or injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
The moderate earthquake was centered 6.6 kilometers southeast of
Taipei at a depth of 8.8 kilometers, CWB seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
The quake was felt in the greater Taipei area and the
northeastern county of Ilan.
</P>

The earthquake came a few hours after several powerful quakes
rattled northwestern Japan over a span of two hours starting 5: 56
p.m. But CWB seismologists said they didn't think that the Taipei
tremor had anything to do with the temblors in Japan.

Earthquakes frequently hit Taiwan, but most were minor and
cause little or no damage. However, a magnitude-7.6 earthquake in

CWB ISSUES LAND WARNING AGAINST TYPHOON NOCK-TEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a
land warning Sunday morning for Typhoon Nock-Ten, several hours after
the bureau issued a sea warning.
</P>
<P>
Nock-Ten is the 24th typhoon reported in the Pacific Ocean this
year.
</P>
<P>
As Typhoon Nock-Ten had slowed its pace to 19 kilometers per hour
as of 11 a.m. Sunday as it moved directly toward Taiwan, the weather
bureau warned that the sphere of Nock-Ten's influence on the island
has increased.
</P>
<P>
CWB forecasters expanded their warning against Nock-Ten from
Taitung and Hualien in eastern Taiwan, and Orchid Island, Green
Island, and the Pingtung Peninsula in southeastern Taiwan, to Ilan
and Keelung in the northeast, Taipei, Taoyuan and Hsinchu in the
north, and Nantou in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The CWB meteorologists also warned that ships operating in the
Bashi Channel and waters southeast, northeast and north of Taiwan, as
well as in the Taiwan Strait should be on alert against strong winds
and high waves triggered by Typhoon Nock-Ten.
</P>
<P>
Expecting Nock-Ten to dump tremendous amounts of rainfall on
Taiwan over the following couple of days regardless of whether or not
it hits the island directly, the weather bureau also expanded its
warning against flash floods, landslides and storm surges from
eastern and southeastern Taiwan to the north, northeast, northwest
and central parts of the island.
</P>
<P>
Precipitation in mountainous areas in north and northeastern
Taiwan is expected to exceed 1,000 millimeters a day over the
following several days, the forecasters warned.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Nock-Ten was centered some 520 kilometers east-southeast
of Taiwan at 11 a.m. Sunday, moving west-northwesterly toward the
island at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour, the forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
With a radius of 250 kilometers, Nock-Ten was packing center
winds of up to 155 kilometers per hour, they said.
</P>
<P>
The weather bureau warned people in Taiwan not to take any autumn
typhoon lightly because the arrival of such typhoons coincides with
the northeast monsoon season, a combination which can cause
torrential rains, that in turn can trigger torrents and landslides.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Nok-Ten comes on the heels of Typhoon Tokage, another
"autumn typhoon, " which pounded Japan Wednesday and caused heavy
damage and the highest death toll of any typhoon to hit the country
in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Disaster Prevention and Relief Center
activated its operations against Tyhpoon Nock-Ten at 10 a.m. Sunday,
with Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan presiding.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 tourists on Orchid Island and Green Island were forced
to cut short their leisure trips in the areas and returned to Taiwan
proper Sunday morning and afternoon.

CHANCES OF TAIPEI BEING STRUCK BY MAJOR QUAKE SLIM: SEISMOLOGIST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chances of Taipei being hit by a major
earthquake with a magnitude of 5.5 or greater are slim, given that
fracture zones under the Taipei basin are relatively much smaller and
shorter than most faults found elsewhere in Taiwan, a leading
seismologist with the Central Weather Bureau said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hsin Tsai-chin, a deputy director of the CWB, said that although
there are many faults in the greater Taipei area, they are small and
short, with lengths ranging from three kilometers to five kilometers,
and are unable to accumulate too much tectonic momentum for major
earthquakes to occur.
</P>
<P>
Quoting CWB tallies on earthquake history in the Taiwan area,
Hsin said that the Taipei basin experiences an average of 12
earthquakes per month, although most of these are imperceptible
except to seismological monitoring instruments.
</P>
<P>
This figure is relatively much smaller than those recorded in
other areas around Taiwan. For example, Hsin said, Hualien in eastern
Taiwan experiences about 400 earthquakes per month, although most of
them are also imperceptible.
</P>
<P>
Only two earthquakes larger than magnitude 3.0 with their
epicenter located in the Taipei basin were recorded over the past 10
years -- one with a magnitude of 3.76, which occurred in 1992, and
another of magnitude 3.7 in 1997, Hsin added.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he pointed out, the Taipei area could be hit by
major earthquakes that are centered in other areas in Taiwan, much
like the magnitude 7.3 earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999, which was the
deadliest in five decades in Taiwan, killing 2,415 people and
injuring more than 10,000 others.
</P>
<P>
The 921 earthquake sent a tectonic shock north to Taipei, where
the intensity was registered as 4.0, one of the strongest in hundreds
of years.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the 921 earthquake was in the Chelungpu Fault,
which has a length of over 80 kilometers, Hsin said.
</P>
<P>
According to CWB archives on seismological activity, the Taipei
basin gradually settled after a magnitude 5.5 temblor occurred in
April 1694 during the Kanghsi period of the Ching dynasty.
Immediately after that quake, a lake was created in the heart of
Taipei, with sea water pouring into the area from an opening in
today's Tamshui River.
</P>
<P>
Hsin made the remarks in response to concerns expressed by Taipei
residents after a magnitude 4.1 earthquake jolted northern Taiwan at
10:04 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
That quake, centered 6.6 kilometers southeast of Taipei at a
depth of 8.8 kilometers, had an intensity of 3.0 in Taipei City, but
caused no damage or injuries anywhere, CWB seismologists reported.
</P>
<P>
The jolt came a few hours after several powerful quakes rattled
northwestern Japan over a span of two hours starting at 5: 56 p.m.
Saturday. CWB seismologists said that the Taipei temblor had nothing
to do with the earthquakes in Japan.
</P>
<P>
A magnitude 7.0 earthquake occurred off Taiwan's eastern coast
Oct. 15, marking the strongest temblor to shake Taiwan since Sept.
21, 1999, the CWB seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
The quake, centered about 110 kilometers off the coast from Ilan
City at a depth of 59 kilometers beneath the surface of the sea, was
also the third strongest "undersea" earthquake since Taiwan began to
keeping firefighting records in the early 20th century. No major
damage was reported, and only two people were slightly injured.

BEEFING UP DEFENSES SHOULD COME BEFORE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES: EXPERT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los  Angeles,   Oct.   23  (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan should build up its
self-defense capability before amending its Constitution, John J.
Tkacik, an Chinese affairs expert at the Heritage Foundation said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech to the Friends of Taiwan in Monterey Park, a
suburban residential city of Los Angeles County, Tkacik said the
Republic of China Constitution was formulated in 1947 on the Chinese
mainland and doesn't fit today's Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, any amendment to the Constitution would inevitably
invoke Beijing's anger, even though President Chen Shui-bian has
pledged that the country's official name, definition of its
territory, and national flag would be left intact.
</P>
<P>
In order to stand up against Beijing's bullying, Tkacik pointed
out, Taiwan should beef up its defense capability, which he said
means that Taipei should not miss the opportunity to purchase the
US$18.23 billion worth of arms being offered by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Tkacik said Washington will contact the European Union in
November to try to dissuade it from lifting its ban on arms sales to
mainland China which would give Beijing more access to advanced
military technology.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he believes that only the people of Taiwan have the
right to determine the future of Taiwan, Tkacik pointed out that he
is concerned about Taiwan's self-defense capability, which he said is
important in terms of deterring Beijing from launching an attack.

YU PROMISES TO USE KMT'S 'ILL-GOTTEN' ASSETS TO PROVIDE FREE TEXTBOOKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Sunday that the
assets "illegally" accumulated by the Kuomintang (KMT) during its
five decades in power will be used to provide free textbooks for
elementary and junior high school students once the assets are
recovered by the current government.
</P>
<P>
Stumping for Democratic Progressive Party legislative candidates
in Panchiao, Taipei County, the premier said that the government is
working to recover the assets and that the assets will be used toward
helping the cash-strapped central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
The premier promised that elementary and junior high school
students will get free textbooks for one year, providing his
government can recover NT$3 billion (US$88.8 million) worth of KMT's
"ill-gotten" assets, and free text books for one hundred years, if it
can recover NT$300 billion (US$8.88 billion) worth of assets.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the December legislative elections, the DPP
has been focusing in its campaign on the issue of the KMT's
"ill-gotten" assets.

TAIWAN WILL DO ITS UTMOST TO RESUME CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: DPP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will do its utmost to resume talks
with Beijing in the next year, a lawmaker from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Huang-liang, the whip of DPP caucus in the
Legislative Yuan, said next year would be a favorable time for a
resumption in talks between Taipei and Beijing as there are no
national elections scheduled in Taiwan and as this December's
legislative elections will usher in a new era in Taiwan, adding that
President Chen Shui-bian has continuously reached out to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan has already done its part to try to restart
cross-strait dialogue, which he said would benefit the people of both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, adding that the ball is now in Beijing's
court.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the remarks in line with a statement by President Chen
Shui-bian the previous day that he has a free hand in terms of
negotiating with Beijing as he does not face any pressure to be
re-elected for a third term.

V.P. SOLICITS WORLD SUPPORT TO FACILITATE CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu on Sunday
solicited the support of nations around the world in Taiwan's efforts
to resume the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Beijing has been working toward becoming a hegemonic
power in the region, Lu appealed to governments across the globe to
recognize and appreciate Taiwan's determination in maintaining and
upholding peace across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that in light of Beijing's ambitions, the so-called
Taiwan issue is not an issue between two nations, but instead a
regional issue that requires regional efforts to tackle successfully.
</P>
<P>
The vice president made the remarks during an audience at the
Presidential Office with a group of foreign academics and opinion
leaders who are in Taipei to take part in the Workshop on
International Negotiations and Conflict Resolution sponsored by
National Chengchi University.
</P>
<P>
Lu's guests included Jacob Bercovitch, dean of the Institute of
Mass Communications Studies of the University of Canterbury, New
Zealand; Norbert Ropers, director of Sri Lanka Department of the
Berghof Foundation for Conflict Studies; and Quansheng Zhao, a
director with the Institute of International Affairs, American
University of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said that the people of Taiwan have for a long
time been ingenious in preventing an outbreak of war in the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is one of the very few countries in the world that has
continued to survive under persistent and long-term political and
military threats from a neighboring country plus diplomatic isolation
in the international community, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The world may have recognized Taiwan's economic miracle and its
political democratization, but the "miracle of peace" that Taiwan has
achieved needs greater recognition, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
She said that the last thing that the Beijing leadership wanted
to see was the re-election of President Chen Shui-bian and herself,
despite the fact that she and President Chen extended olive branches
to Beijing on at least 30 occasions between 2000 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that in his Oct. 10 National Day speech, President Chen
suggested that the two sides of the strait build a mutual trust
military mechanism, enter an era of cross-strait peace negotiations,
and conduct arms control talks. His words were aimed at facilitating
a resumption in the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue, Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that in the era of globalization, the concepts of
cross-strait reunification and Taiwan independence are both
"outdated, " saying that Taiwan does not belong to China. "Taiwan
belongs to the world," she asserted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday that next year is the best time
for Taiwan and mainland China to resume cross-strait talks as there
are no national elections scheduled in Taiwan and as this December's
legislative elections on the island will create a new situation
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will do its utmost in this regard, and if Beijing
continues to refuse to return to the negotiating table, it will have
to bear full responsibility for the results, said Legislator Tsai
Huang-liang, a DPP party whip.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said Saturday while giving a lecture at the
Ketagalan Institute that he is optimistic about a resumption in the
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that there is a good opportunity for resuming
cross-strait dialogue next spring," Chen said, adding that "we might
be able to turn a new page in cross-strait history."

NO PROGRESS IN TAIWAN-U.S. FTA TALKS LIKELY IN SHORT TERM: EXPERT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regardless of who wins the upcoming U.S.
presidential election, bilateral Taiwan-U. S. talks on signing a free
trade agreement (FTA) won't see much progress in the short term,
according to a Taiwan analyst.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chun-jieh, a researcher at the Chung-Hua Institution for
Economic Research, made the comments in the latest issue of a weekly
magazine on the international situation run by the Cabinet -level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, regardless of whether President George W. Bush
is re-elected or Democratic presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry wins
the presidential poll, there won't be any new breakthroughs in the
Taiwan-U.S. FTA talks in the near term.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang added that if Bush wins, the two countries will be
more likely to re-open the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement
(TIFA) talks based on the existing model.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan-U.S. TIFA talks have been suspended for more than a
year due to what the United States has called a lackluster
performance on Taiwan's part in resolving key matters related to
foreign rice market access, telecommunications services,
pharmaceutical pricing, and intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection.
</P>
<P>
Wang also contended that economic exchanges between the two
countries are expected to become closer and more frequent if Bush
wins a second term.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEPD, the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan
has suggested to the U.S. administration that it resume the TIFA
talks with Taiwan in late November and remove Taiwan from its "301
priority watch list" on the grounds that Taiwan has made noticeable
progress in IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang pointed out that the hope of Taiwan and the United
States concluding FTA negotiations in the short term is slim due to
the sharp differences that exist between the two sides regarding
Taiwan's market access for foreign rice.
</P>
<P>
If Kerry is elected, he is very likely to resort to the "super
301" in dealing with Taiwan to settle bilateral trade disputes,
leaving no room for fresh progress in bilateral FTA and TIFA talks,
Wang claimed, adding that Taiwan-U.S. trade ties will become more
tense with Kerry in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Bush and Kerry remain widely divided on the
diplomatic, economic and environmental protection fronts, it is worth
noting that both men have said they will stick to the "one China"
policy, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
Although some prominent figures in Taiwan have pushed for the
United States to review its "one China" policy, the efforts will
undoubtedly be in vain, Wang said.

EX-AIT CHIEF SUGGESTS FIVE-YEAR TAIPEI-BEIJING PEACE AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Williamsburg,  Virginia, Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin &amp; Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Dean, a former chief
of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) suggested Sunday that
Taiwan enter into a five-year agreement with mainland China wherein
Taiwan promises to forsake the idea of independence while China
promises not to attack Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Dean, who served as the Washington-based AIT chairman between
1979 and 1986, told the 46th annual conference of the American
Association for Chinese Studies in Williamsburg, Virginia, that
Taiwan could ask the United States to broker such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Dean suggested five years as this is a relatively short period of
time and therefore more likely to be accepted by Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement would benefit all the parties involved, Dean
noted, saying it would allow China to concentrate on hosting the 2008
Olympic Games, allow Taiwan the time to mend fences with the United
States, and allow the United States to focus its attention on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to a line from Washington that its ties with mainland
China are better now than at anytime in the last thirty years, Dean
said that U.S.-Taiwan ties are in a bit of an "unhealthy" state at
present because the U.S. administration feels that Taiwan hasn't
given enough thought to Washington's need to concentrate its efforts
in wrestling with the issue of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Such an accord might only represent a small step toward settling
the dispute between China and Taiwan, but it's better than no step at
all, Dean said, adding that much would still remain to be done even
if the agreement were concluded.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that his idea is at the preliminary stage, Dean said
the question of what Taiwan forsaking its independence would mean
still needs to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
He added that brokering such an agreement wouldn't contradict
Washington's longstanding policy of facilitating but not mediating
any talks between Taiwan and China.

TAIWAN'S MAJOR CARRIERS FARING WELL DESPITE SOARING OIL PRICES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite soaring world oil prices, Taiwan's
two leading airlines have been faring well, with China Airlines (CAL)
recently raising its profit forecasts for 2004 and EVA Airways
expected to follow suit shortly.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for CAL, Taiwan' s largest carrier, the
airline has raised its gross revenue forecast for 2004 to NT$93.549
billion (US$2.76 billion), with estimated pre-tax profits of NT$4.051
billion and after-tax profits per share of NT$1.35.
</P>
<P>
The CAL spokesman attributed the carrier's good performance to
its upgraded transport capacity thanks to its new fleet and effective
damage control by having hedged 80 percent of its fuel oil. In
addition, he said that the carrier's improved flight safety record
has also helped it save a considerable amount on insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
CAL registered total business revenue of NT$70.05 billion for the
first three quarters of this year, up by 30.8 percent over the
previous year's level. Pre-tax earnings for the January-September
period hit NT$3.5 billion, or 11.1 percent higher than the original
forecast.
</P>
<P>
As the fourth quarter is traditionally the peak season for cargo
transport, CAL's profits are expected to continue to grow through the
end of the year due to a hike in transport fees, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
With a quickened delivery of new all-cargo planes set for January
next year, CAL expects its cargo business revenue and profits to
increase by 14 percent and 15 percent, respectively, in 2005.
</P>
<P>
EVA Airways Corp. has forecast gross revenue of NT$76.778 billion
for 2004, with pre-tax earnings of NT$3.121 billion, and after-tax
profits of NT$2.784 billion, or NT$0.93 per share. EVA Airways has
hedged 60 percent of its fuel oil at US$35 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Taiwan's second-largest carrier may raise its
2004 business revenue forecast soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price of oil shot up to an all time high of more
than US$55 per barrel Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange
after mainland China announced that its Q3 economic growth had
surpassed its original forecast.

New York Times: Bush and Kerry focus
campaigns on 11 key states.

U.S. President George Bush and Senator John Kerry move into the
last days of the presidential contest in agreement that the race
has come down to just 11 states, and have laid out plans for a
barrage of visits and television advertisements across this final
battleground between now and Nov. 2. Aides said Bush and Mr. Kerry
will spend virtually all their time - and most of their remaining
advertising budgets - in those states.

Wall Street Journal: Official report about 50 bodies from Iraqi
troops are found.

The bodies of about 50 Iraqi soldiers were found on a remote road

Ministry spokesman Adnan Abdul-Rahman said the victims were believed
to have been killed about sundown Saturday on a road about 95 miles

TYPHOON AFFECTS EX-SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT'S TAIWAN VISIT SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
The schedule of former South Korean
President Kim Young Sam's Taiwan visit has been affected by Typhoon
Nock-Ten, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kim was originally scheduled to arraive at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway, at 11: 30 a.m. on a
China Airlines flight.
</P>
<P>
As Typhoon Nock-Ten battered Taiwan with strong winds and
torrential rains early Monday, Kim's arrival has been delayed to
around 6 p.m., MOFA officials said, adding that the exact arrival
time will depend on the weather condition.
</P>
<P>
Kim's originally scheduled news conference at the Grand Hotel in
Taipei at 6:30 p.m. will also be postponed and rescheduled later, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
As to the dinner to be hosted by Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan
Sun Chen in Kim's honor, the officials said it will be scheduled
based on Kim's actual arrival time.
</P>
<P>
Kim and his wife were invited by President Chen Shui-bian to
visit Taiwan. Kim is expected to exchange views on issues of mutual
concern with President Chen as well as with other government
officials and business leaders during his eight-day visit.

Kim, who served as president between 1992 and 1997, visited
Taipei in July 2001 to lay the groundwork for a resumption of direct
flight services between the two countries. After a 12-year hiatus,
the two countries finally agreed to resume direct airlinks last

VICE PREMIER ASKS FOR RIGOROUS DISASTER PREVENTION AND RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan on Monday
inspected the central disaster prevention and relief center in
Taipei, asking all local relief centers to carry out disaster
prevention works rigorously.
</P>
<P>
Yeh made the remarks as northern, eastern and northeastern Taiwan
were in the grip of Typhoon Nock-Ten, which made landfall between
Toucheng and Santiaochiao in Ilan County, northeastern Taiwan, at
10:30 a.m, according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).
</P>
<P>
The CWB has issued the highest-level torrential rain warning in
the four-level rainfall warning system, indicating expected hourly
rainfall of 15 millimeters, or over 350 mm in a 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
CWB meteorologists urged the public not to take Nock-Ten lightly
because the arrival of the autumn typhoon coincides with the rising
tides and the northeast monsoon season, a combination which can cause
torrential rains and in turn trigger torrents and landslides.
</P>
<P>
Yeh instructed the center to monitor low-lying areas and areas
prone to mudslides. She also urged the public not to take any
unnecessary risks while Taiwan is under the typhoon's influence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou instructed that residents in
hazardous areas be evacuated quickly for safety reasons. While
inspecting the city's disaster prevention and relief center, Ma
warned that the earthquake that jolted some parts of the city over
the weekend may have made them more prone to landslides with the
onslaught of torrential rains brought by Typhoon Nok-ten.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan stock and foreign exchange markets were closed Monday,
as were schools and offices in Taipei City and Taipei County, Taoyuan
County, Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County, Keelung, Ilan, Hualien, and
Taitung due to the typhoon, the 24th reported in Pacific Ocean this
year.

U.S. HOPES TO DISCUSS BEEF MARKET REOPENING WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,   Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By J.L. Chi and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior official of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said discussions will take place on the
resumption of beef exports to Taiwan after Japan recently agreed to
resume part of its beef imports from the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to J.B. Penn, Under Secretary, Farm and Foreign
Agricultural Services of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the
United States and Japan concluded an agreement Oct. 23 in Tokyo that
paves the way for a partial resumption of beef trade between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the United States will hold bilateral
consultations with the Taiwan and South Korean governments on
reintroducing U.S. beef imports.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, Japan and South Korea decided to ban beef imports and
related products from the United States immediately after Washington
announced Dec. 24, 2003 that it had discovered a case of mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the largest importer of U.S. beef, and before it imposed
the ban last year, its annual beef imports from the United States
amounted to more than US$1.4 billion, or more than 30 percent of
total U.S. beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Taiwan will follow Japan to reopen part of its
market for U.S beef, a high-ranking official of the Republic of
China's Council of Agriculture (COA) said that Taiwan's Department of
Health officials are currently holding bilateral consultations with
their U.S. counterparts on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Ying, deputy director-general of the COA's Bureau of Animal
and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, who recently visited
Washington, D.C., also said that the U.S.-Japan agreement on the
resumption of beef trade can be used by Taiwan as a reference, and
that the bureau will serve as a watchdog once the island agrees to
reintroduce the importation of U.S. beef into its market.
</P>
<P>
Whether Taiwan will resume its beef imports has become a matter
of serious concern for the United States. The U.S. beef market in
Taiwan has been replaced by Australian beef since the discovery of
mad cow disease in the U.S. last year, and Washington requested in
March of this year that Taiwan reopen its market for U.S. beef.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation is
optimistic about the resumption of U.S.-Taiwan beef trade, saying
that the island will soon reintroduce its importation of beef from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Lynn Heinze recently said that Taiwan will send a group
of experts to the United Sates to better understand its new butchery
measures and its surveillance system for beef exports.

PRESIDENT CHEN EXTENDS SYMPATHY TO JAPAN OVER TYPHOON, EARTHQUAKES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian expressed concern
and sympathy for the people of Japan Monday after the country was hit
by a strong typhoon and a series of earthquakes in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Chen extended his regards on behalf of the Republic of China
government and people while meeting with Hisaoki Kamei, an
influential member of the lower house of the Japanese Diet.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Tokage pounded much of Japan Oct. 20, leaving at least 66
dead and 22 missing; and a magnitude 6.8 earthquake and a series of
aftershocks shook the northeastern Japanese prefecture of Niigata
over the weekend, resulting in 25 deaths and over 2,200 injuries.
</P>
<P>
Chen took advantage of his meeting with Kamei to express his
condolences to the families who have lost members to the disasters or
have had to seek shelter.
</P>
<P>
Both Taiwan and Japan are located in earthquake-prone areas and
face the threat of typhoons, Chen said, adding that he hopes the two
countries can cooperate in research on natural disaster prevention
and post-disaster reconstruction technologies.
</P>
<P>
Touching on bilateral relations, Chen said he looks forward to
seeing Taiwan tourists enjoy visa-free treatment by Japan starting
from next year.
</P>
<P>
In the face of mainland China's strong attraction of foreign
investment, Chen said Taiwan and Japan should sign a free trade
agreement as early as possible to prevent a regional trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is convinced a Taiwan-Japan free trade agreement
would benefit both sides and contribute to free flow of capital,
goods and information as well as help regional economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Chen also expressed his gratitude for Kamei's long-term efforts
in promoting friendship and substantive relations between Taiwan and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Kamei, a senior member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, founded a pro-Taiwan association in his home prefecture of
Shimane four years ago to promote commercial and cultural exchanges
with Taiwan. He is currently heading a large delegation of
association members on a goodwill visit to Taiwan.

<P>
Lawmakers must not forsake their
obligations in the Legislative Yuan because of the Dec. 11
legislative elections, an anti-nuclear power association said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Kuo-lung, convener of the Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative
Association (Nuke-4 RIA), and Yeh Po-wen, executive director of the
group, made the appeal as they paid a visit to the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The two said that they would visit the opposition Kuomintang and
People First Party Tuesday to make sure their legislators don't get
sidetracked from reviewing bills because of campaign activities.
</P>
<P>
They said that according to the regulations on the election and
recall of the public functionaries, the official campaign period
begins 10 days before the legislative elections on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
However, they lamented that legislators had agreed to recess for
a month starting Nov. 10. Recently, most legislators have returned to
their constituencies to concentrate on campaigning.
</P>
<P>
They noted that several committees in the legislature have only
one or two legislators left to review the budgets, and that several
budgets recently passed the committees without any cuts.
</P>
<P>
They also said that some articles in the referendum law that was
rammed through the legislature late last year were unreasonable, and
that both the ruling and the opposition parties agreed that an
amendment is needed, but when they sought the signatures of the
legislators for the amendment, they found that most of the
legislators were not even in the legislature, but had returned to
their constituencies.
</P>
<P>
They said that lawmakers shouldn't violate the law by jumping the
gun and campaigning early. Besides, they are duty-bound to sit in the
legislature and review bills, instead of just caring about the
elections.

went to the sluice at Yuanshantse that diverts water from the
Keelung River to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said that the reporters' vehicles became stuck in a
low-lying area about 200 meters from the Yuanshantse sluice on
their return trips and were penned in by rising waters rushing down
the mountainside. The water in the area was about a meter deep.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles and reporters were swept away just before 11: 30 in
the morning; however, firefighters managed to save Huang Chun-ming
from the China Times, Yang Huei-chi from the United Daily News and
Yang Shu-ling, a local cable television station reporter.
</P>
<P>
Ping, 30, was recovered almost an hour later barely alive. He was
rushed to Rueifang Hospital and pronounced dead later despite efforts
to revive him.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the reporters had come to the area to cover
the story and were preparing to leave when they were told that
Premier Shyi-kun would come later and inspect the sluice. Not wishing
to miss the story, most reporters stayed on to wait for the premier.
</P>
<P>
Unbeknownst to them, however, Premier Yu's inspection tour was
called off because the severe weather had not abated.
</P>
<P>
Another reporter, Lee Wen-yao from the Chinese Television System,
said that they were the ones that remained because other reporters
had to hurry back to their offices to file their stories.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu had intended to inspect the diversion of water at
Yuanshantse, and he and his entourage even started out for the area
by cars, but were forced to turn back because of the vicious winds
and rain.
</P>
<P>
The sluice is still under construction and was first opened to
divert Keelung River water to the ocean last mouth after an all-night
downpour caused serious flooding in low-lying areas in northern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu said he was saddened by the news of the tragic death
of the reporter and instructed the Government Information Office to
provide all necessary assistance to the man's family.
</P>
<P>
The Central Weather Bureau said that although the lashing rain
and winds had begun to slacken at noon, the public should be alert
for any sudden changes in the situation.
</P>
<P>
Methodologists said that Typhoon Nock-Ten made landfall between
Toucheng and Santiaochiao at Ilan at around 10: 30 a.m. and that the
eye of the typhoon will slowly pass the greater Taipei area. The rain
and winds are expected to intensify and will only ease in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
Land warnings have been lifted for the Henchun Peninsula,
Taitung, Kaohsiung and Pintung, they said, adding that the typhoon
will leave Taiwan Tuesday morning and that sea warnings will likely
be lifted then at noon.

TAIPOWER DENIES REPORT OF MISSING NUCLEAR FUEL RODS

<TEXT>
<P>
State-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower)
denied Monday a media report of missing nuclear fuel rods at its
nuclear power plants, calling the story a far cry from the truth.
</P>
<P>
According to a Taipower spokesman, no fuel rods at its three
nuclear power plants are missing as reported by a local daily
newspaper, which cited a source as saying that "the U. S. Department
of Energy had found that various nuclear fuel rods installed in the
reactors at Taiwan's nuclear power plants had gone missing."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman categorically denied the report and stressed that
the three nuclear power plants are constantly under strict scrutiny
by the Taiwan and U. S. authorities and the International Atomic
Energy Agency, although Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that all facilities at the three nuclear power
plants are closely inspected by monitors and that key parts are
sealed, he said that what the report said is totally impossible.
</P>
<P>
Uranium and plutonium are the main substances contained in a
nuclear fuel rod, which is the source of nuclear energy in a reactor.
The two sensitive materials can be extracted from the highly
radioactive spent rods for applications in other fields, including
making nuclear weapons.

TAIWAN PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR URGES UNITY ON RETROCESSION DAY

<P>
Taiwan Provincial Governor Lin Kuang-hua on
Monday urged the ruling and the opposition parties to unite for a
better future for the nation, saying that the country cannot afford
to have its people divided.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks as the Taiwan Provincial Government marked
the 59th Taiwan Retrocession Day Monday with a party.
</P>
<P>
Lin invited all living Taiwan governors to attend the party, but
only former governor Chang Po-ya was on hand. She and Lin toasted to
the prosperity of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The progress of Taiwan can be attributed to the efforts of
governors passed and the people, he said, adding that the process
might have been flawed, but Taiwan's achievements have won
recognition from around the world, and that the sweat of the people
was not in vain.
</P>
<P>
He also went out of his way to plead for the unity of the people,
saying that Taiwan cannot afford to be divided, but added elections
seem to bring the worst out in candidates and society is pitched into
chaos.
</P>
<P>
Both former Governor Chang and Taiwan Provincial Consultation
Council Speaker Yu Ling-ya lamented that the people in Taiwan no
longer care about or observe Retrocession Day, saying that it is a
day worth remembering.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was under the colonial rule of Japan for half a century
before it finally returned to the fold of its motherland on Oct. 25,
1945. It used to be a national holiday, but it gradually lost its
luster after the streamlining operations of the provincial government
began in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian, in a congratulatory message to the
party, was positive about the contributions Taiwan province has made
in the democratic and economic development in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A fireworks display was arranged at the arena in front of the
provincial government hall at night to bring the celebrations to a
climax.

INDIAN OFFICIAL WELCOMES TAIWAN INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
India,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Huang Chao-ping and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan and India should expand trade and
economic cooperation in a variety of fields, including the
telecommunications and information technology (IT) industries, an
Indian official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Umesh Kumar, director of the commerce department of the Ministry
of Commerce and Industry of India, further said Taiwan businessmen
investing overseas, known in Taiwan as "Taishang, " are welcome to
invest in India.
</P>
<P>
With a population of more than 1 billion, Kumar said, India is
the world's second-largest market after mainland China. Moreover,
India can serve as a springboard or a midpoint for taishang to tap
into the European or Middle Eastern markets.
</P>
<P>
Given these benefits, Kumar said, taishang should take immediate
steps into India. "Otherwise, you'll miss the opportunity," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kumar, who made the remarks during an interview with a team of
reporters from the Central News Agency, visited Taiwan last month and
is familiar with Taiwan's economic and technological developments.
</P>
<P>
He said there is great potential for Taiwan's IT hardware makers
to cooperate with India's world-renowned IT software manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the IT industry, Kumar said, India can offer enormous
business opportunities in many other fields.
</P>
<P>
With abundant cheap labor, Kumar went on, India is very
competitive in the manufacturing sector and has been selected by
major automakers as their automotive and spare parts production
bases. Among others, he said, South Korea's Hyundai Motors has
selected its Chennai plant in India as the production center for the
company's Santro cars, which are to be marketed around the world.
Japan's Suzuki Motors has also recently set up a second production
facility in India.
</P>
<P>
Kumar claimed that foreign investors in India, regardless of the
lines of business they enter, can begin to turn profits or even earn
back all of their paid-in capital, in five or six years. South
Korea's Samsung and LG business groups, for instance, began to turn
profits six or seven years after they each invested US$1 billion in
consumer electronics production in India, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian market is immense. You can succeed easily so long as
you have good products and good services. The market is out there.
Whoever is interested is welcome to explore," Kumar said, adding that
taishang should not drag their feet debating whether to invest in
mainland China or in India.
</P>
<P>
"Time waits for no man. If you come late, you may lose
opportunities. If you don't come, others will come," Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
For taishang, Kumar said, the mainland may have a competitive
edge due to its geographic proximity to Taiwan and the shared
language and cultural backgrounds. However, he went on, India is a
democratic country with more comprehensive legal and accounting
systems than those of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
With its huge population, Kumar said, India has a massive
domestic market and can additionally serve as a conduit for taishang
wishing to explore the European and Middle Eastern markets.
</P>
<P>
Kumar said India is now the world's six-largest mobile phone
market and that its telecommunications market will continue to grow
even faster in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Other promising fields for taishang investment include
infrastructure construction, auto parts, food processing, chemical
and petrochemical production, Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he expressed reservations regarding the signing of
a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with Taiwan in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
"The time is not yet ripe for talks about FTA issues, " Kumar
said, adding that the time for such talks will be when bilateral
trade and investment further increase. Two-way trade between Taiwan
and India amounted to US$1.2 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
As to the signing of a double taxation avoidance agreement, Kumar
said the two countries need not sign such an accord because Taiwan
investors will automatically be exempt from Indian taxes under
current Indian laws and regulations.

"world-class elites" in San Francisco Monday to pave way for a
project to send more than 2,000 students overseas to study over the

CEPD Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said that more than 130 Chinese
American scholars were invited to attend the seminar in the hope that
with them as intermediaries, Taiwan can establish cooperation
relations with prestigious schools in the United States and that if
the U.S. experience proves successful, the model can be expanded to
Britain and Germany.

society's reluctance to offend Beijing, Chen said Taiwan should
actively take part in APEC activities with dignity and parity.
</P>
<P>
"We should also come up with forward-looking initiatives to boost
regional development and signify the value of Taiwan's separate
existence, " Chen said, adding that Taiwan must win international
friendship and respect with vision and insightful overtures.
</P>
<P>
APEC is one of the few international cooperation forum that
simultaneously admits Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the upcoming APEC conferences will discuss for the
first time the feasibility of forming an Asia-Pacific free trade
agreement (FTAAP).
</P>
<P>
"We should express our support for the formation of an
Asia-Pacific free trade bloc and compe up with concrete proposals for
its materialization," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen said, the delegation should continue to solicit
other member economies' support for Taiwan's proposals to boost
regional cooperation in health care, vian flu prevention and avian
flu vaccines production.
</P>
<P>
As human security will be one of the main themes to be discussed
at this year's APEC conferences, Chen said, the Taiwan delegation
should express Taiwan's desire to play an active role in cultivating
safe living environment and its past contributions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho
Mei-yueh, Finance Minister Lin Chuan and many other officials were
also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
After receiving a formal invitation from Chilean President
Ricardo Lagos Escobar to attend the Nov. 20-21 APEC informal
leadership meeting, President Chen has decided to name Lee Yuan-tseh,
the head of Taiwan's most prestigious research body, Academia Sinica,
to represent him at the gathering. Lagos asked APEC Secretariat
Executive Director Mario Artaza to extend the invitation to Chen in
Taipei Sept. 21. Beacuse of Beijing's opposition, Taiwan's president
has been unable to attend the annual APEC summit in person and has to
name a proxy to attend on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in Taipei last Friday with Milenko E. Skoknic,
chief executive of the organizing committee of the APEC Chile 2004
activities, Chen said he would like to attend the annual APEC summit
in person but that he has instead named a Nobel laureate to attend on
his behalf to spare the host country any unnecessary trouble.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups 21 Asia-Pacific economies -- Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines,
Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

MAWEI PORT AGREES TO LANDING VISA TREATMENT IN LINKS WITH MATSU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of lengthy negotiations, the
Mawei Port Zone authorities in mainland China's Fujian Province have
finally agreed to grant landing visa treatment for visitors from
Taiwan's Matsu Island in bilateral direct transport links, Lienchiang
County Magistrate Chen Hsueh-sheng said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The practice, scheduled to be put in place from Jan. 1, 2005 by
both sides, will boost the existing direct trade and transport links
maintained between Matsu and Mawei and between Taiwan's Kinmen Island
and Fujian's Xiamen Port since Jan. 1, 2001 -- popularly known as the
"mini three links" -- Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen and Xiamen have granted landing visa treatment for
visitors from either side since the inception of the mini links, but
such a measure has been absent in bilateral links between Matsu and
Mawei due to financial difficulties and lax facilities on the part of
Mawei, despite repeated appeals from Matsu.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the much larger number of passengers traveling
between Kinmen and Xiamen heightens the urgent need for Matsu and
Mawei to implement the same visa practice, and the Mawei Port Zone
authorities eventually agreed to do so after a recent visit he made
to discuss the issue with Mawei officials.
</P>
<P>
Chen also suggested that the Mawei Port Zone authorities pay
attention to the service attitude of customs agents and called for an
improvement in baggage check facilities.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the Fuzhou city government and the Mawei Port
Zone authorities have decided to split spending on building and
expanding the facilities needed to allow the landing visa procedure
to operate smoothly by the beginning of next year.

Former South Korean President Kim Young Sam
arrived in Taipei Monday at the head of a 23-member delegation for an
eight-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after their arrival, Kim and his delegation attended a
dinner party hosted by Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen in
their honor.
</P>
<P>
Kim and his delegation, who were originally scheduled to arrive
in Taiwan earlier in the day, were forced to delay their trip due to
typhoon Nock-Ten, which brought gusty winds and torrential rain to
the country.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will receive Kim and his delegation and
host a dinner party for them at the Presidential Office Tuesday,
according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
During their stay, Kim and his delegation will also meet with
Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou,
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, business leaders and scholars, ministry
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They will also tour various economic and cultural establishments
before departing Nov. 1, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure from Seoul, Kim said that his trip is
designed to show support for the resumption of Taipei-Seoul air links
in September after a hiatus of 12 years since the two nations severed
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that when he visited Taiwan three years ago, he promised
President Chen that he would come back to convey his congratulations
if the air links were resumed.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who served as president between 1992 and 1997, visited
Taipei in July 2001 to lay the groundwork for a resumption of direct
flight services between the two countries.

Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen said
Tuesday that U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's remarks on Taiwan
the previous day "are the harshest by the United States to date."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the comments while fielding questions in the

China" policy and said that "Taiwan is not independent. It does not
enjoy sovereignty as a nation."

Chen said that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent state --

which "is a fact that cannot be denied."

RULING PARTY PROTESTS AGAINST POWELL'S REMARKS ON TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Tuesday protested strongly
against U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's remarks on Taiwan the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
Powell, currently on a three-nation tour in Asia, reaffirmed the
U.S. "one China" policy, saying that "Taiwan is not independent. It
does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation, and that remains our policy,
our firm policy " during an interview with Hong Kong-based Phoenix
Satellite TV Monday prior to his departure from Beijing for Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is in fact an independent and sovereign
state, the DPP legislative caucus protested strongly against Powell's
"ignorance of the facts."
</P>
<P>
Lee Chun-yi, DPP whip in the Legislative Yuan, said he regrets
and condemns Powell's remarks, noting that President Chen Shui-bian
stated clearly in his Double Ten National Day speech that "the
sovereignty of the Republic of China is vested with the 23 million
people on Taiwan. The Republic of China is Taiwan, and Taiwan is the
Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
But he also said that there is no sign of change in U.S. policy
toward the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which is not to encourage
the People's Republic of China to solve the Taiwan issue by force,
and not to encourage Taiwan to unilaterally change the status quo.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang echoed Lee's words, and asked:
"If Taiwan isn't a sovereign state, then what is it?"
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that the DPP legislative caucus could not accept
Powell's remarks which he described as "ignorant of the facts."

PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE REAFFIRMS NO CHANGE IN NATIONAL POLICY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office reaffirmed Tuesday
that there has been no change in national policy after U.S. Secretary
of State Colin Powell said in Beijing a day earlier that "Taiwan is
not independent. It does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation."
</P>
<P>
James Huang, deputy secretary-general to the president, said the
government's policy toward relations across the Taiwan Strait and the
nation's future development will continue to follow the principles
outlined in President Chen Shui-bian's May 20 inauguration speech and
Oct. 10 National Day address.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance remains unchanged, " Huang said. He declined to go
into further details.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Huang said U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Adam
Ereli has made clarifications of Powell's remarks in an interview
with the Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite TV during his Oct. 25
visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Ereli made it clear at a daily briefing the same day that the
United States has not changed its cross-strait policy.
</P>
<P>
"One element of our policy has been to favor a peaceful
resolution of the cross-strait issue through dialogue and through a
resolution that is acceptable to both sides," Ereli said, adding that
Powell's remarks should be interpreted in terms of the context of the
interview.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that since Ereli has made a clarification, it is not
necessary to engage in too much speculation.
</P>
<P>
President Chen proposed in his National Day address that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait use the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong
Kong to seek possible ways that are "not necessarily perfect, but
acceptable" in preparation for a step forward in the resumption of
the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to himself by his nickname 'A-bian, ' Chen further said
that as any conflict would cause irreparable damage to both sides,
Taiwan and mainland China should seriously consider practical steps
toward "arms control."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore A-bian proposes that both sides should seriously
consider the issue of arms control and take concrete actions to
reduce tension and military threats across the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
Quoting Chen's National Day speech, Huang said Taiwan has
consistently pursue cross-strait peace and stability. "We hope the
two sides can shelve disputes and sit down to talks."

Typhoon Nock-Ten, which pounded northern
and northeastern Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rains
Monday, has caused NT$169 million in agricultural losses, Council of
Agriculture (COA) officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to COA tallies, 1,802 hectares of farmland was affected
by Nock-Ten, the 24th typhoon reported in the Pacific Ocean so far
this year. The hardest-hit crops included rice, leafy vegetables,
papayas, citruses, guavas and other in-season fruits.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said most of the agricultural losses were in the
farming sector, while losses in the fishery, poultry and forestry
sectors were comparatively minimal.
</P>
<P>
With the lifting of the typhoon warning, the COA officials said,
vegetable supplies in the greater Taipei area have returned to
normal.
</P>
<P>
As the main vegetable production areas in central and southern
Taiwan were not hit by the typhoon, the officials said, urban
consumers do not need to make panic purchases.

New York times: U.S.
action bars right of some captired in Iraq

A new legal opinion by the Bush
administration has concluded for the first time
that some non-Iraqi prisoners captured by
American forces in Iraq are not entitled to the
protections of the Geneva Conventions,
administration officials said Monday. The
opinion reached in recent months,
establishes an important exception to public
assertions by the Bush administration since March
2003 that the Geneva Conventions applied 
comprehensively to prisoners taken in the 
conflict in Iraq, the officials said.

Wall Street Journal: Bush focuses on
weathering wave of bad news

U.S. President Bush is getting hit by a wave
of bad news -- including further setbacks in
Iraq and slumping financial markets -- just a
week before a dead-heat election. Bush's ability
to ride out the gloomy headlines hinges on a
strategy that has served him for months
--keeping the campaign on terrorism while trying
to under mine public confidence in Democratic
challenger John Kerry's ability to protect the
country.

U.S. CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT POLICY REMAINS UNCHANGED: STATE DEPARTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By W.C. Lin and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior U.S. State Department press
officer reiterated Monday that the U.S. cross-Taiwan Strait policy
remains unchanged and that cross-strait differences must be resolved
peacefully and in a way that is acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Adam Ereli, deputy spokesman of the State Department, made the
comments at a daily press briefing in response to reporters'
questions related to Secretary of State Colin Powell's remarks on
cross-strait issues during visit to Beijing a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
In an interview conducted with the Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV
, Powell said: "There is only one China. Taiwan is not
independent. It does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation, and that
remains our policy, our firm policy."
</P>
<P>
"Both sides should show restraint, not take any unilateral
actions, look for ways of improving dialogue across the strait and
move forward toward that day when we will see a peaceful
unification, " Powell also said, adding that " we want to see both
sides not take unilateral action that would prejudice an eventual
outcome, a reunification that all parties are seeking."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Powell's remarks represent a change in U.S.
cross-strait policy, Ereli said that the secretary was very clear
that the United States remains firmly committed to its "one-China"
policy based on the three communiques and to its responsibilities
under the Taiwan Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also made it clear that Washington opposes any
unilateral actions by either side, that the United States does not
support Taiwan independence, and that the way to resolve the issue is
through peaceful dialogue, Ereli added.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions regarding whether Powell's remarks
regarding "looking for ways of improving cross-strait dialogue and
moving forward toward that day when we will see a peaceful
unification" are in contradiction to the longstanding U.S.
cross-strait policy, the deputy spokesman said that one should not
read into the remarks a hinting or departure from Washington's
longstanding position.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that the U.S. cross-strait policy has not changed,
Ereli said that "one element of our policy has been to favor a
peaceful resolution of the cross-strait issue through dialogue and
through a resolution that is acceptable to both sides."
</P>
<P>
"There are a whole wealth of possibilities there. We are not
prejudging those possibilities: we are simply emphasizing that it has
to be done through dialogue," Ereli said, adding that he thinks that
the secretary is very outspoken and very emphatic about encouraging
an intensification of that dialogue, and that's where the United
States thinks the focus ought to be.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the question of Taiwan's sovereignty, Ereli said that
he does not think that there was any new ground broken on that issue,
noting that the words the secretary used accurately reflect
Washington's longstanding policy on Taiwan's status. "Frankly, I
think we are today where we were yesterday," he added.

PROMOTING MULTILATERAL TRADE A PRIORITY: ROC'S WTO TRADE OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China's top trade official
in Geneva on Monday strongly supported the European Union's focus on
a multilateral trade mechanism and urged all members of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Yen Ching-chang, Taiwan's permanent representative to the WTO,
also lauded the EU's great attachment to multilateral trade
negotiations and the "go slow" approach to the formation of
bilateral free trade agreements (FTA).
</P>
<P>
Yen was speaking at a meeting to review the EU's trade policies.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan fears being marginalized because of the number of WTO
member economies that are seeking to establish FTAs, even though
trade experts and WTO officials have said that a collection of FTAs
cannot replace a multilateral trade system.
</P>
<P>
Yen said Taiwan's stance is that WTO members should treat the
promotion of multilateral trade talks as a priority.
</P>
<P>
Since FTAs or Regional Trade Agreements might have an impact on
the participation of many WTO members in WTO trade talks, Yen said
that the "go slow" approach used by the EU in dealing with its FTA
negotiations with other economies and its attachment to multilateral
trade talks ought to be emulated.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Taiwan and the EU have the same idea, the
representative said that Taiwan believes that multilateral trade
liberalization will bring more economic benefits than from regional
or bilateral trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yen also said that the EU's experience of enlargement
might provide other WTO members an opportunity to review whether
closer economic integration is the best choice.
</P>
<P>
While affirming the EU's contributions to the new Doha Round of
trade negotiations and to the improvement of a multilateral trade
mechanism, the representative also expressed his concern about trade
compensation problems that emerged after the EU's May 1 expansion.
</P>
<P>
Noting that several European countries have raised part of their
import tariffs after joining the EU, and that more than 20 countries,
including Taiwan, have formally requested that the EU offer
compensation through negotiations, Yen said that Taiwan will
cooperate with the EU to seek a reasonable settlement of the issue.

AMERICANS OF TAIWANESE, INDIAN ORIGINS PLAN TO FORGE PARTNERSHIP

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two senior executives of the U.S.-India
Institute for Strategic Policy are currently in Taipei to promote
cooperation between Taiwanese-Americans and Indian-Americans in an
effort to help boost substantive Taiwan-India relations.
</P>
<P>
Armeane Choksi, chairman of the Washington-based U.S.-India
Institute for Strategic Policy, and Manish Thakur, executive director
of the institute, arrived in Taipei Monday for a five-day visit at
the invitation of the Taiwan Democracy Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Choksi told the Central News Agency that his institute looks
forward to forging cooperative ties with Taiwanese-American groups in
the United States with a common goal of helping reinforce Taiwan's
defense capability and promoting India's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both Taiwan and India are Asian democracies with
advanced high-tech industries and have shared values in promoting
democracy, freedom, security and prosperity, Choksi said he feels
that Taiwanese-Americans and Indian-Americans also have a lot in
common in U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
Choksi said he believes that there should be ample room for the
two ethnic groups to cooperate in helping promote Taiwan-India
relations as well as boost Taiwan's and India's national interests.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Choksi said, the institute will follow the formula
used in promoting its cooperation with Jewish-American groups in the
past.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-India Institute is willing to play an intermediary role
in organizing seminars or conferences in various U.S. cities and
communities to facilitate opinion exchanges and integration, " Choksi
explained.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Thakur said that Indian-Israeli relations
were not close in the past. But the situation has changed since
1997-98 when Indian-Americans formed cooperative ties with
Jewish-Americans who have traditionally held great influence in U.S.
society, Thakur said, adding that such a development has been widely
viewed as contributing much to the significant progress in
India-Israel and India-U.S. relations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To the best of his understanding, Thakur said,
Taiwanese-Americans have maintained good relations with
Jewish-Americans. He acknowledged that engagements between
Taiwanese-Americans and Indian-Americans have remained sparse. If the
three ethnic groups cooperate closely, Thakur said, they could form a
powerful lobbying force in U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
Academic sources said noted Indian geopolitical scholar Monu
Nalapat has helped arrange for the two U.S.-India Institute
executives' current Taiwan visit.
</P>
<P>
During their stay, Choksi and Thakur will meet with Vice
President Annette Lu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael
Ying-mao Kau as well as academics from Taiwan Thinktank and the
Taiwan Democracy Foundation.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial tallies, Americans of Taiwanese, Indian
and Israeli origins total more than 10 million, with Israeli
descendants accounting for 600 million, Taiwanese descendants about
2.5 million and Indians about two million.

BOTH SIDES OF TAIWAN STRAIT SHOULD SIT DOWN AND TALK: PREMIER

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that
Taiwan has always pursued peace across the Taiwan Strait and dialogue
is the best way to achieve this.
</P>
<P>
The premier was responding to U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell's remarks the previous day when he reaffirmed the "one China"
policy of the United States, saying, "Taiwan is not independent. It
does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation, " during an interview with
Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite TV prior to his departure from
Beijing to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Powell also said that President Chen Shui-bian's Double Ten
National Day address provides an opportunity for the resumption of
cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that it is a fact that Taiwan is a sovereign
state and that it has always sought to pursue cross-strait peace and
stability, which was evident in the peace overtures offered by
President Chen in his inauguration speeches in 2000 and early this
year.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Powell's remarks that "we want to see both sides [of
the Taiwan Strait] not to take unilateral action that would prejudice
an eventual outcome, a reunification that all parties are seeking, "
the premier said that President Chen has stated clearly in his May 20
inauguration speech early this year that both sides should shelf
disputes and sit down to talk.

LAWMAKERS SAY POWELL CANNOT DICTATE SOVEREIGNTY ISSUE FOR TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislators from across the political
spectrum on Tuesday disputed U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's
remarks about Taiwan the previous day, stressing that Taiwan is in
fact a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
They made the remarks after Powell reaffirmed the "one China"
policy of the United States, saying, "Taiwan is not independent. It
does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation." Powell was speaking during
an interview with Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite TV prior to his
departure from Beijing to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Chin-jun of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said that Taiwan is a sovereign state and its name is the
Republic of China, which is an "indisputable fact, " and that Powell
has no reason to interfere with the internal affairs of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen asked, "If Taiwan is not a sovereign state, why would there
even be a Taiwan Relations Act, and why would it contain the
provision that the United States will provide Taiwan with defensive
weapons?"
</P>
<P>
Chen criticized the United States for ingratiating mainland
China, saying that it is regrettable that a superpower like the
United States has turned a deaf ear to the voices of the 23 million
people on Taiwan and trampled the dignity of an ally country.
</P>
<P>
Another DPP legislator, Lin Cho-shui, said that Powell's remarks
were the "most negative from a U.S. administrations on Taiwan's
sovereignty issue over the past three decades."
</P>
<P>
Granted, Lin added, that there are American interests involved
what Powell had to say, Taiwan must also shoulder some of the
responsibility for the Secretary of State's view. "It is obvious that
Taiwan's foreign policy has not earned the trust of the United
States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lin said both the ruling and opposition camps need to be
introspective and forge a consensus on diplomatic issues. The
administration should also review its overall foreign policies and
form a steadfast and consistent path.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said that it insists
on the " sovereignty" of the Republic of China, adding that it does
not condone other countries, regardless of how powerful they might
be, that try to dictate the future of Taiwan, since that is a matter
that can only be left up to the 23 million people on the island.
</P>
<P>
The People First Party, an ally of the KMT, said both sides
should maintain the status quo and return to a 1992 cross-strait
consensus, being that both sides agree on their own version of "one
China," for further talks to reach a consensus on peace.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the DPP, said that
whether Taiwan is a sovereign state will not be dictated to Taiwan by
Powell, but by its 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chung-yuan, TSU whip in the legislature, said that Taiwan
has its own people, land and government and that this denotes a
sovereign state according to international law.
</P>
<P>
Pro-independence groups such as the Taiwan Independence Alliance
and the Alliance to Campaign for Rectifying the Name of Taiwan said
Tuesday that Powell made the remarks because Taiwan's present name is
the Republic of China, which they said is not recognized
internationally.
</P>
<P>
They said that the name of the country must be changed to Taiwan
so that the words "Republic of China" or the "ROC" can be avoided.

CHINA'S CITIES WILL STILL BE USED IN NAMING WARSHIPS: DEFENSE MINISTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
The practice of using the names of cities
in China for the names of Taiwan's warships will remain unchanged, a
spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Suey-sheng made the remark amid criticism by some
legislators that warships are traditionally named after places in
mainland China, believing that Taiwanization should take precedence
over sinicization.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that under the framework of the Republic of China
Constitution, the names of warships are to be taken from the
geographical names defined by the Constitution as national land and
from national heroes.
</P>
<P>
The ROC Constitution was promulgated in 1947 when the Republic of
China still ruled the mainland.
</P>
<P>
He said the principle of naming warships will not change and
there is no political consideration involved since the defense
ministry acts in accordance with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the defense ministry has used places in Taiwan
for the names of some vessels.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HOPEFUL OF MAKING ITS OWN MARK: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Oct.   26  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The production value of Taiwan's
telecommunications industry is expected to hit about NT$432.3 billion
(US$12.8 billion) this year, marking an annual growth rate of 21.4
percent, according to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA).
</P>
<P>
In view of the domestic industry's strong performance on the
global market, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh has recently
said that it possesses the potential to become the third-most
profitable technology capable of creating an output value of over
NT$1 trillion, in addition to biotechnology and the digital content
industry keenly promoted by the government in its flagship
"two-trillion, two-star" program.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than NT$400 billion in production output, the
broadband industry and the telecommunications facilities sector will
generate some 40.8 percent and 59.2 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
A senior manager at the Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI) forecast that the telecommunications facilities sector will be
able to yield NT$480.9 billion in production this year, up by 11.2
percent over the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that the telecommunications equipment sector
is gradually gaining an upper hand over the broadband sector thanks
to the widespread penetration of cell phones, which the ITRI manager
said will lead to rapid development in the wireless local area
network.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications service sector is another key focus in the
global market, he said, citing information provided by the Garnter
Group as predicting that it will account for 80.4 percent of the
world's overall telecommunications industry market valued at US$1.414
trillion this year. The ratio is expected to increase to 82.7 percent
of the world market scale of US$1.675 trillion in 2008, he added.
</P>
<P>
He is highly optimistic about Taiwan's chances of becoming a
front-runner in the global wireless telecommunication industry,
citing Taiwan companies' high self-content percent in making key
parts, a comprehensive supply chain and their long-term cooperative
ties with the world's top multinationals.

that the economic reforms that started in India in the 1990s will
remain unchanged despite the power transfer of political parties.
</P>
<P>
Ramesh was referring to the INC's success in elections earlier
this year, in which the INC upset the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ,
which had called for an early election because it was confident of
its own economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Jagdish Shettigar, chief economic adviser for the BJP, concurred,
saying that it would be impossible for the INC to backtrack after it
took the helm of the nation, saying, "India's basic policy,
especially its economic policy, will only be adjusted in a minor way;
there will be no dramatic changes."
</P>
<P>
The course of liberalization, reform and opening to foreign
investment will continue, Shettigar said.
</P>
<P>
Ramesh added that privatization of state-owned enterprises will
continue, although this will not all be open to foreign investment.
Currently, foreigners are not allow to invest in such sectors as the
petroleum, natural gas, railway, national defense, space and public
health sectors.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Taiwan and India, Ramesh said they are in
good shape although there is still room for further development.
Two-way trade between Taiwan and India amounted to US$1.2 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that India can provide Taiwan more resources, adding that
both sides can consider cooperation in the areas of software,
information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and
semiconductors. In tourism, there is also room for further growth.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Taiwan has focused too much in mainland
China. It is too risky, he said, suggesting that Taiwan ought to
diversify its investment.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that India is populous, and its population is
expected to surpass that of mainland China by 2030 or 2035. It also
has a great history, and is a democratic country as well as a
pluralistic society with 18 languages. It has maintained economic
growth of 6 percent over the past 20 years, and that growth is
expected to be between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent in the next few
yeas.
</P>
<P>
He also said that India has 300 universities and 2 million
graduates every year, adding that individuals talented in
high-technology are India's advantage, although the number of such
people needs to rise.
</P>
<P>
Believing that India has more potential than mainland China in
terms of investment, Ramesh said that both countries should further
cooperate and engage in exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should take a closer look at the Indian market, Ramesh
said, adding that investment is never like instant coffee, and that
the key is to have determination and perseverance, adding that South
Korean enterprises such as Samsung group and Hyundai Motors have
long-term plans and determination in their investments in India.
</P>
<P>
Ramesh expressed the hope that he would be able to visit Taiwan
within six month to enhance bilateral understanding.
</P>
<P>
Shettigar also welcomed Taiwan businessmen to invest in his
country, suggesting that they can buy local companies or bid for
major construction projects. The food processing and technical
sectors are also worth investing in, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged Taiwan businessmen to set up plants in Indian
special economic zones, using them as springboards to make inroads
into the Middle East, the European Union and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Shettigar said he is scheduled to travel to Taiwan to attend an
international seminar next month to express his views on matters of
mutual concern.

DEFENSE UPGRADING PREREQUISITE TO MAINTAINING STATUS QUO: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Tuesday
his claim that upgrading Taiwan's defense capabilities is a
prerequisite to maintaining the status quo and a buttress to engaging
in dialogue with mainland China on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Chen also stressed that he will continue to promote dialogue
across the Taiwan Strait under the principle of safeguarding national
sovereignty, dignity and security.
</P>
<P>
Chen's reaffirmations, which were made during a meeting with
senior executives of major Taiwanese associations in the United
States and Canada, came after U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell
said in Beijing a day earlier that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are
based on the Taiwan Relations Act and that the U.S. government
encourages both sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Chen said national security should never be compromised by
partisan political wrangling and that investment in national defense
is ultimately aimed at safeguarding permanent peace for posterity.
</P>
<P>
"We should never let mercurial political partisan strife undermine
our defense capabilities and national security, " Chen said,
referring to the opposition-controlled legislature's stonewalling of
a NT$610.8 billion arms procurement budget bill.
</P>
<P>
In the face of mainland China's continued military buildup and
missile threat, Chen said, Taiwan must beef up its defense arsenal in
order to keep its status quo from being changed and to enable it to
engage in cross-strait dialogue with dignity and parity.
</P>
<P>
While endeavoring to upgrade Taiwan's defense capabilities, Chen
said, his administration will also spare no efforts to forge
rapprochement and mutual trust with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue to promote cross-strait engagements under the
principle of ensuring national sovereignty, dignity and security, "
Chen said, adding that his administration looks forward to working
with Beijing in crafting a viable mechanism for peaceful and stable
cross-strait interaction and guiding cross-strait relations to
develop in a "normal, win-win" direction.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Chen took advantage of a meeting with
visiting Marshall Islands Minister of Foreign Affairs Gerald Zackios
to express his gratitude for the Pacific island nation's support for
the Republic of China's independent sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
Marshall Islands President Kessai Note and the nation's
ambassador to the United Nations have on many public occasions spoken
out for Taiwan's quest for U.N. representation on the grounds that
the ROC should enjoy the same rights and status as all other
countries around the world, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"We are grateful for your country's firm support for our national
causes, including joining the United Nations and the World Health
Organization," Chen told his guest.

PRESIDENT SETS DPP TARGET OF 100 SEATS IN LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian set a target
Tuesday for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to win 100
seats in the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly DPP Central Standing Committee meeting in
his capacity as party chairman, Chen said that the "pan-green camp"
-- formed by the DPP and its political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) -- will be able to control a majority of seats in the
225-member legislature if the DPP captures 100 of them in the Dec. 11
elections.
</P>
<P>
Chen encouraged party members to do their utmost and to set aside
personal interests to achieve the party's goal. "Only when the DPP
dominates the legislature will the administration be allowed to do
its job and push forward Taiwan's reform programs," Chen claimed.
</P>
<P>
DPP officials said that they are confident of achieving the goal
and predicted that the TSU will win at least 20 seats in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of various recent surveys, Chung Jia-ping, a
DPP deputy secretary-general, said that 73 of the DPP candidates for
the constituent seats, 18 for the legislators-at-large and three for
the overseas Chinese seats have been listed as "sure" to win in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieving Chen's target, Chung said the DPP must
pursue five additional constituent seats and one more overseas
Chinese seat.
</P>
<P>
A total of 387 candidates have registered to vie for 168
constituent and eight aboriginal seats, of which 92 have been
recommended by the DPP.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has nominated 74 candidates,
followed by the People First Party (PFP) with 41, the
pro-independence TSU with 30 and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
(NPSU) with 26.
</P>
<P>
The parties will add additional seats for 41 legislators-at-large
and eight overseas Chinese legislators based on proportional
representation of the ballots that each party secures in the
election.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted earlier this month by the Chuan
Kuo Credibility Polling Company, the DPP is the most popular in the
year-end legislative elections with a 24 percent approval rating,
followed by the KMT with 14 percent, the PFP with 5.12 percent, the
TSU with 2.74 percent and the NPSU with 2.33 percent, while 44.03
percent of the respondents said they were undecided.

MAC OUTLINES NEW PRINCIPLE FOR DETENTION OF MAINLAND ILLEGALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(BY sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Illegal mainland Chinese immigrants will be
sent to Taiwan-held frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu for
temporary detention in the future to facilitate repatriation, a
senior mainland affairs official said Tuesday. Both Kinmen and Matsu
lie closer to mainland China than to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun made the
remarks while delivering a speech at the Tainan City Government in
southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Liu said mainland China has often delayed in taking back illegal
mainland immigrants for political reasons. As a result, it usually
takes more than 100 days for mainland authorities to send ships to
take back seized mainland immigrants, adding up to Taiwan's
financial burden and staff workload. In some cases, he said, illegal
mainland immigrants have to stay far longer in Taiwan's detention
centers. For instance, a group of illegal mainland immigrants seized
on March 18 were not repatriated until in late August due to
Beijing's reluctance to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the government is constructing a new detention center
in Kinmen which will be inaugurated by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
There are currently two special detention centers for mainland
illegal on the Taiwan proper -- one in Hsichu and the other in
Ilan. There is also a similar detention in Matsu.
</P>
<P>
"Once the Kinmen detention center is completed, it will
accommodate all illegal mainland immigrants seized in the Taiwan
proper," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Liu also said the government has no timetable to
lift the ban on local civil servants from making sightseeing trips to
mainland China. According to Liu, the ban is not expected to be
lifted anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, civil servants can travel to the mainland for
family reunions, visiting ailing relatives or attending meetings
with prior government approval.
</P>
<P>
Liu also said that presently, an average of 1,000 to 2,000
mainland Chinese citizens make pleasure trips to Taiwan via a
third area per month.

TAIWAN, JAPAN TO FORGE COOPERATION LINKS BETWEEN SCIENCE PARKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's Science-based Industrial Park
Administration under the National Science Council recently reached
consensus with Kitakyushu City officials on proposed sisterhood links
between the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park and the Japanese
city's Science and Research Park, NSC officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NSC Chairman Chi Kuo-chung visited the Kitakyushu Science and
Research Park a few days ago, where, in addition to touring the
advanced park's various facilities for scientific and industrial
research, he also called on park administrators, as well as
representatives of a number of local universities that are in
collaboration with the park, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Chi's visit also focused on the promotion of cooperation and
exchanges between the two science-based parks, they noted, indicating
that an official agreement for the proposed relations will be sealed
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is seeking to learn more about high-tech manufacturing and
has therefore been making efforts to borrow knowledge and experience
from other countries, one of which efforts involves seeking exchanges
and cooperation with foreign science and research facilities, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Hsinchu park has so far signed sisterhood accords and
protocols of cooperation with 15 science parks or institutions in
eight countries, according to the NSC.
</P>
<P>
Japan is one of the major trade partners of the Hsinchu facility,
with its exports of high-tech equipment and raw materials to the park
from January to September this year reaching NT$99 billion (US$2.97
billion) in value, according to park administration statistics.
</P>
<P>
The amount accounted for 36 percent of the park's total imports,
making Japan the largest exporter to the park. During the same
period, the park exported NT$45.3 billion-worth of products to Japan,
a figure that accounts for 12 percent of its total exports and makes
Japan the third-largest customer of the park, according to the
statistics.

TAIWAN NOT ENGAGED IN DOLLAR DIPLOMACY: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will never engage in dollar
diplomacy against mainland China, and the financial aid provided to
other countries is for humanitarian purposes rather than being
bargaining chips to win diplomatic recognition, President Chen
Shui-bian said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who also serves as chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , made the remarks after hearing a report by
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kau Ying-mao in a weekly meeting of
the DPP's Central Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan's economic assistance to friendly countries
is by no means a cash-backed offensive to seek diplomatic ties in the
face of Beijing's diplomatic blockage of Taiwan, Chen said it is the
country's right and obligation to give back to the international
community for the help that it received from the United States and
other countries in the past.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Taiwan will stick to this ideal and will do its
utmost to play a constructive role in international society by
helping friendly countries in need through proper and adequate
channels, he said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid speculation, misunderstanding or corruption, the
government will further increase its transparency and strengthen and
consolidate related mechanisms and sources of such outbound
humanitarian operations, he said.

POWELL'S REMARKS ABOUT TAIWAN `CONTRADICTORY': OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's
recent remarks on Taiwan were "contradictory" and made Taiwan "feel
very uncomfortable, " a senior government official familiar with U.S.
affairs said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was commenting
on Powell's statements during an interview Monday in Beijing with
Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite TV that the United States will
continue to sell defensive weapons to Taiwan in line with the Taiwan
Relations Act while claiming that "Taiwan is not independent. It does
not enjoy sovereignty as a nation."
</P>
<P>
"If Taiwan is not an independent sovereign state, as Powell
claims, how can the United States sell weapons to Taiwan? Isn't the
United States encroaching upon China's sovereignty by selling
defensive arms to Taiwan?" the official asked.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan can understand the nature of "big power diplomacy, "
the official said, Powell's comments were "too straightforward and
too harsh. His comments made us very uncomfortable, particularly as
he made the comments in Beijing."
</P>
<P>
Even though the United States diplomatically recognizes China and
terminated diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979, the official said
such facts cannot justify Powell's claim that Taiwan is not an
independent sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the United States cut diplomatic ties with
Cuba after Fidel Castro took power in 1959. The absence of formal
ties with the United States does not invalidate Cuba's independent
sovereignty, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Powell's defining Taiwan's status quo as "not
independent, not enjoying the sovereignty as a nation" is extremely
dissatisfying, the official said Taiwan must carefully review whether
its relations with the United States has undergone grave changes.

<P>
The agricultural losses resulting from
Typhoon Nock-Ten, which pounded northern and northeastern Taiwan with
strong winds and torrential rains Monday, have surged to NT$300
million, Council of Agriculture (COA) officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to COA tallies, 2,895 hectares of farmland was affected
by Nock-Ten, the 24th typhoon reported in the Pacific Ocean so far
this year. The hardest-hit crops included rice, leafy vegetables,
papayas, citruses, guavas and other in-season fruits.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said most of the agricultural losses were in the
farming sector, while losses in the fishery, poultry and forestry
sectors were comparatively minimal.
</P>
<P>
With the lifting of the typhoon warning, the COA officials said,
vegetable supplies in the greater Taipei area have returned to
normal.
</P>
<P>
As the main vegetable production areas in central and southern
Taiwan were not hit by the typhoon, the officials said, urban
consumers do not need to make panic purchases.

ROC IS AN INDEPENDENT SOVEREIGNTY: PRESIDENT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China is an independent
sovereignty and its de-facto existence is a reality that cannot be
denied or changed, President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during a meeting with former South Korean
President Kim Young Sam at the Presidential Office. Kim arrived in
Taiwan a day earlier for an eight-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the ROC is a great nation that is not a part of
the People's Republic of China, Chen said that the existence of this
country and its status are nothing but the truth.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's status as an independent and sovereign nation cannot be
denied or changed, a fact that has nothing to do whether a foreign
country sets up diplomatic ties with it or not, " Chen noted,
pointing to his March 20 re-election.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he will safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty, dignity and
security as the country's paramount leader and he called for a
normalization of cross-Taiwan Strait ties through an early reopening
of negotiations with mainland China. This has always been his basic
stance and was outlined in his Oct. 10 National Day address and his
May 20 inaugural speech, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Kim for visiting Taiwan and made it clear that
maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait and the Asia-Pacific region is
one of his top concerns.
</P>
<P>
Peace in Northeast Asia is in the best interests of both Taiwan
and South Korea, and the establishment of a trilateral security
dialogue forum among Taiwan, Japan and South Korea is vital to that
end, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president's comments came a day after U.S. Secretary of State
Colin Powell reaffirmed in an interview with the Hong Kong-based
Phoenix Satellite TV that the United States will maintain its "one
China" policy and said that "Taiwan is not independent. It does not
enjoy sovereignty as a nation."

<P>
The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA)
launched its premium "Formosa Star" tourist train Tuesday as part of
its efforts to help boost the country's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara and Minister of Transportation
and Communications Lin Ling-san jointly presided over a ceremony to
inaugurate the top-end tourist train at the Taipei Railway Station.
Both men boarded the train along with reporters and tourists for
its maiden journey to Ilan, Hualien and Taitung in eastern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Ishihara was invited to take the ride to help introduce
Taiwan's beautiful scenery and delicious cuisine to the Japanese
people.
</P>
<P>
During a visit by Ishihara in May to attend President Chen
Shui-bian's inauguration, Lin said he asked the Tokyo governor how to
attract Japanese tourists to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Ishihara reminded me that we can better use Taiwan's hot springs
and train services to attract both senior and young Japanese
holidaymakers, " Lin recalled, adding that he then directed the TRA
and the Tourism Bureau to jointly design the premium "Formosa Star"
tourist train and its round-the-island journey.
</P>
<P>
The tourist train has all sorts of modern amenities and
entertainment equipment as well as catering services. Food and
beverages are included in the ticket price. Moreover, the TRA has
joined forces with five-star tourist hotels and major recreation
centers to offer three-day, two-night or four-day, three-night tour
packages.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara said this is his fifth visit to Taiwan. He noted that
Taiwan has beautiful scenery, a diverse cultural heritage and
delicious cuisine. "These are precious tourism resources.
With well-designed marketing strategies, Taiwan will be able to
attract many foreign tourists, including Japanese citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Six major Japanese news media organizations sent journalists to
cover Ishihara's trip. They will produce special programs introducing
Taiwan's tourist attractions, Lin said, adding that the programs will
be a boon to Taiwan's tourism promotion drive.

TAIWAN AGREES IN PRINCIPLE TO RESUME IMPORTS OF U.S. BEEF: USDA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By J.L. Chi and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has agreed in principle to
resume imports of U.S. beef and beef products, which were suspended
in December 2003 due to safety concerns, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. J. B. Penn, undersecretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural
Services, at the head of a U.S. delegation, met with Taiwan health
and agriculture officials early this week for talks on the matter,
USDA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan officials will travel to the United States Nov. 10 to
begin on-site inspection of the major features and implementation of
the U.S. safeguards against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) ,
also known as mad-cow disease, according to a USDA news release.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan officials have indicated that they are close to
completing the reviews necessary for resuming the beef trade, with
on-site inspections as the final step in the process, the USDA news
release indicated.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes smoothly, it is expected that Taiwan will
reopen its doors to U.S. beef and beef products before the end of
2004, the USDA officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with this progress in yet another important
beef market, " Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said. "We are
continuing our market opening efforts in the remaining key countries.
Our goal is a return to a normal beef trade as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan suspended U.S. beef imports in December 2003 following the
discovery in the U.S. state of Washington of a single BSE-infected
cow. Taiwan purchased $325 million worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003, according to USDA officials.
</P>
<P>
According to Penn, the United States and Japan concluded an
agreement in Tokyo Oct. 23 that paves the way for a partial
resumption of the beef trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the largest importer of U.S. beef before it imposed a
ban last year, with annual beef imports from the United States
amounting to more than US$1.4 billion, or more than 30 percent of
total U.S. beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was the sixth largest importer of U.S. beef before it
imposed the ban. Only Mexico continued to import U.S. beef and beef
products after the discovery of the case of mad cow in Washington
State, according to USDA.

POWELL'S 'PEACEFUL UNIFICATION' REMARK ONLY AN 'ORAL MISTAKE': EXPERT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior U.S. China policy expert said
Tuesday that some State Department officials told him a day earlier
that Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent comment that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should move forward to a peaceful
unification through dialogue was only an oral mistake.
</P>
<P>
John J. Tkacik, senior research fellow at the Asia Studies Center
of the Heritage Foundation, also said that the secretary had no
intention of prejudicing the eventual outcome of the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In an interview conducted with Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite
TV during his visit to Beijing Oct. 25, Powell said that "both sides
should show restraint, not take any unilateral actions, look for ways
of improving dialogue across the strait and move forward toward that
day when we will see a peaceful unification."
</P>
<P>
The secretary also said that "we want to see both sides not take
unilateral action that would prejudice an eventual outcome, a
reunification that all parties are seeking."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tkacik said that some of his friends working at the
State Department told him that the department's spokesmen are ready
to clarify some of the secretary's remarks and to reiterate that the
U.S. cross-strait policy remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Tkacik also noted that the State Department officials told him
that unification is only one of the possible outcomes of cross-strait
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli made it
clear at a daily press briefing Monday that the United States has not
changed its cross-strait policy.
</P>
<P>
"One element of our policy has been to favor a peaceful
resolution of the cross-strait issue through dialogue and through a
resolution that is acceptable to both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ereli also said Tuesday that "our concern is that neither side
should act unilaterally to change the status quo and that differences
between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan are matters to be
resolved peacefully, absent the threat or use of force, and should be
acceptable to people on both sides of the strait."

TAIWAN RANKS 60TH IN PRESS FREEDOM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Berlin,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-li and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan ranked 60th among 167 countries and
areas surveyed in the world in terms of respect for press freedom, up
one notch from its 2003 ranking, in the latest report released by the
Reporters without Borders (RWB) organization Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its 2004 press freedom report, the RWB said that Scandinavian
countries continue to rank at the top of list, while East Asian and
Middle Eastern countries continue to take up most of the spots at the
bottom of the list.
</P>
<P>
The RWB reported that in the year between September 2003 and
September 2004, East Asia remained the area with the least amount of
press freedom, with North Korea finishing at the bottom of the list
for the third consecutive year, Myanmar ranking 165th and mainland
China placing 162th. The other two countries on the "five worst
offenders" list are Turkmenistan and Bhutan. Vietnam placed 161th,
while Laos ranked 153rd.
</P>
<P>
Press freedom also remained under threat in the Middle East, with
Saudi Arabia ranking 159th; Iran placing 158th; Syria ranking 155th;
and Iraq finishing 148th, the RWB report indicated.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, placing ninth, was the highest ranked country among
all non-European states.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China continued as the "largest jail in the world" for
reporters and journalists, with 27 currently locked up, according to
the report. The RWB said that although Beijing had promised when
bidding for the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games to improve
treatment of members of the media, foreign media organizations
continue to be regularly monitored and censored by mainland
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The RWB report also mentioned that government authorities in
South Korea, which ranked 48th, and in Taiwan have "not always" been
tolerant of opposition in the media.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based NGO group drew up the press freedom ranking
report by asking journalists, researchers and legal experts to answer
52 questions about the whole range of press freedom violations, such
as murders or arrests of journalists, censorship, pressure, state
monopolies in various fields, punishment for press law offenses, and
regulation of the media.

BEIJING BLOCKS TAIWAN'S PROPOSAL AT WTO'S SPS COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China blocked a proposal Tuesday
put forward by Taiwan to establish working relationships with other
international organizations via the framework of the World Trade
Organization's Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) Committee, a
trade source in Geneva said the same day.
</P>
<P>
The organizations include the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE), the CODEX Alimentarius Commission and the IPPC, which
is based on an international treaty to secure action to prevent the
spread and introduction of pests in plants and plant products, and to
promote appropriate measures for their control.
</P>
<P>
The SPS concerns the application of food safety and animal and
plant health regulations. According to the WTO Web site: "It allows
countries to set their own standards. But it also says regulations
must be based on science. They should be applied only to the extent
necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health. And they
should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between
countries where identical or similar conditions prevail."
</P>
<P>
"Member countries are encouraged to use international standards,
guidelines and recommendations where they exist. However, members may
use measures which result in higher standards if there is scientific
justification. They can also set higher standards based on
appropriate assessment of risks so long as the approach is
consistent, not arbitrary."
</P>
<P>
As the SPS committee's mandate is closely related to the missions
of the three international organizations, Taiwan fears the lack of
memberships in such organizations might affect its right and
interests; therefore, Taiwan's representative made a proposal
recently at the SPC Committee, requesting that it establish a
mechanism to help Taiwan and other WTO members that encounter the
same problems participate in the work of the organizations.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, Taiwan also suggested that the SPS request that
the organizations invite those WTO members who are interested in
their operations to attend their technical meetings as guests or
observers.
</P>
<P>
However, the source said at an informal SPS Committee meeting
held Tuesday at the WTO headquarters that mainland China's delegates
opposed the idea, saying that Taiwan is not a developing country as
it mentioned in the proposal, and that the WTO should not be involved
in other international organizations' affairs.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian delegate to the WTO also said at the meeting that the
committee has reinforced its contacts with other applicable
international organizations, and that the WTO has no right to intrude
in other international organizations' operations.

PASSENGERS ON FLIGHT WITH SMUGGLED BIRDS UNLIKELY TO BE INFECTED
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European Union authorities have been
searching all passengers who traveled on flights with a Thai man who
tried to smuggle two Asian eagles into Belgium on Oct. 17-18 due to
health concerns. Most of the passengers were from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 135 passengers were reportedly aboard a Taiwan-based
EVA Airways flight from Bangkok to Vienna the night of Oct. 17 with
the Thai man who carried in his hand luggage two mountain hawk eagles
which were confirmed Oct. 23 of having been infected with the bird
flu virus.
</P>
<P>
Of the passengers, 122 were Taiwan citizens.
</P>
<P>
The birds of prey were then smuggled into the passenger cabin on
an Austrian Airlines flight from Vienna to Brussels in the morning of
Oct. 18, according to European Union officials.
</P>
<P>
Belgium asked the European Commission for help to find the
passengers of different nationalities who might have been exposed to
the avian flu virus.
</P>
<P>
"Although the risk of transmission from animals to humans is
limited, it cannot be excluded since the birds traveled in the
passenger cabin in hand luggage, " the European Commission said in a
statement a couple of days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Thai man was apprehended by customs officers at Brussels
airport when the eagles were discovered in his bags, alive and in
plastic tubing Oct. 18. But he was apparently then released.
</P>
<P>
The eagles have been destroyed, as have some 200 parrots that
were being kept at the same quarantine center.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Taiwan's Department of Health said Tuesday that it
was highly unlikely that the Taiwan passengers were inflicted with
bird flu by the two eagles because the birds were contained in closed
luggage and the Thai man was examined in Brussels and found not to
have any infection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the officials said that since the bird flu virus
incubation period is about one week, passengers who do not display
any symptoms after seven days from Oct. 18 should not have been
infected.

TRANSPORTATION MINISTER AFFIRMS SAFETY OF "FORMOSA STAR"
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The maiden journey of the premium-class
"Formosa Star" tourist train was launched after railway traffic
conditions had been determined safe, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in response to
questions by some lawmakers who doubted the safety of the journey,
which was inaugurated on the east coast of Taiwan with the
participation of Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara Tuesday morning,
when normal passenger train services for the route were still stopped
because of damage caused by Typhoon Nock-Ten a day before.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers wondered if the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications was granting "special privileges" to Ishihara by
allowing him to go ahead with the journey.
</P>
<P>
Lin said workers had conducted a safety inspection on railway
traffic conditions before the journey.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the ministry decided to go ahead with the trip mainly to
accommodate Ishihara's tight itinerary. He was invited to Taiwan as a
special guest to help promote Taiwan's tourism.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Ishihara was aware of the condition of railway
before boarding the train, and the governor observed that the damage
caused by typhoons in Japan was 10 times more severe than that done
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Also, Lin said the train would not have been ready for its
official operation on Oct. 30 -- the tickets for which are fully
booked -- had the inauguration ceremony been delayed.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) Director-General
Hsu Ta-wen, Ishihara is joining a three-day, two-night tour and it
would leave insufficient time for the train to undergo maintenance
before it starts official service unless the inaugural journey was
made as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lin said regular passenger services along the east
coast were not resumed until Tuesday evening because the signals and
electricity were down.
</P>
<P>
While regular train services are not allowed to run under this
circumstance, a special train is not subject to this restriction, Lin
said.
</P>
<P>
The top-end tourist train has all sorts of modern amenities and
entertainment equipment as well as catering services. Food and
beverages are included in the ticket price.
</P>
<P>
The TRA has also joined forces with five-star hotels and major
recreation centers to offer tour packages.

57 KMT/NEW PARTY CANDIDATES IN SECURE POSITION: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
estimated that about 57 legislative candidates nominated by the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the New Party are in secure positions
ahead of the Dec. 11 elections, KMT sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks when he attended a KMT Central Standing
Committee meeting during which the participants heard assessments on
the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The New Party, a splinter party of the KMT, is now running under
the banner of the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who serves concurrently as a KMT Vice Chairman, told the
participants that as the elections drew near, the party should pay
close attention to the changes in the overall situation, issues
concerning current affairs and personal factors.
</P>
<P>
Wang's remarks came on the heels of President Chen Shui-bian's
call Tuesday for 100 seats to be won by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the 225-seat legislature so that the DPP
and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , will command a
comfortable majority. The president concurrently serves as the DPP
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Wang also estimated that some constituencies are precarious for
the KMT and the New Party -- Taoyuan, Yunlin and Changhua -- and
urged the candidates in those areas to go all out to win votes.
</P>
<P>
The participants also heard the strategy of "redressing the
weaknesses of the KMT and attacking the weaknesses of our rivals."
</P>
<P>
A record 387 candidates have registered to vie for 168 regional
and eight aboriginal seats, of which 92 have been recommended by the
ruling DPP. The at-large seats will be awarded in proportion to the
votes each party garners.
</P>
<P>
The KMT has nominated 74 candidates, followed by its ally, the
People First Party (DPP) with 41, the pro-independence TSU with 30
and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union with 26.

POSITION ON LUNAR NEW YEAR CHARTER FLIGHTS UNCHANGED: CABINET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's position regarding special charter
flight services to carry mainland-based Taiwan businessmen to spend
lunar new year at home has not changed, and the government and the
private sector have joined forces to study the issue, Executive Yuan
spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun has instructed the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) , the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) and
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to begin
assessing the feasibilities based on the framework laid down by
President Chen Shui-bian in his Oct. 10 National Day address and May
20 second inaugural address, Chen Chi-mai said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai said that the president has raised many constructive
proposals in terms of cross-Taiwan Strait relations in the two
speeches and he urged Beijing leaders to be wise enough to accept
Taiwan's goodwill overtures and reopen bilateral negotiations based
on parity and dignity.
</P>
<P>
Next spring should be the right time for the two sides to
rekindle negotiations, he said, adding that both can start first with
technical issues, referring to Taiwan's proposed charter flight
services.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan has instructed the MAC, the CEPD and the MOTC
to accelerate the pace in studying the issue with the six leading
trade groups and various shipping companies, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Statute Governing the Relations between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, relevant government
authorities, such as the MAC or the semiofficial Straits Exchange
Foundation, are entitled to commission the private sector to handle
the issue with the mainland side.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai's remarks came shortly after Zhang Mingqing,
spokesman for Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, earlier the same day
told a news conference that lunar new year charter flight services
for Taiwan businessmen could be "workable, " as long as it is dealt
with as an internal issue of a country.
</P>
<P>
Under this prerequisite, private groups or corporations from the
two sides would be allowed to negotiate the issue or even the opening
of direct trade, transport and postal links, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The three direct links have been absent across the Taiwan Strait
since 1949, when Taiwan and mainland China split at the end of a
civil war.

A damage report on a Transasia Airways
Corp. A320 airplane that skidded off the runway after landing Oct. 19
at Taipei's Sungshan Airport is expected to be completed by next week
when Airbus engineers will decide whether or not the plane can be
repaired.
</P>
<P>
TransAsia flight GE536 from Tainan, southern Taiwan, suffered
damage to the front wheel of the aircraft and the cowling covering a
generator. One hundred passengers and six crew members were on board
at the time.
</P>
<P>
Aviation safety experts have been analyzing data on the incident
to determine if the cause was pilot error, weather or mechanical
failure.
</P>
<P>
TransAsia Airways officials said Wednesday that experts from the
aircraft's manufacturer, Airbus Industrie, are currently in Taiwan
assessing the damage.
</P>
<P>
A similar incident happened in Tainan Airport in March last year,
when an airplane owned by the same airlines hit a construction
vehicle while taxiing on the runway. The military was faulted for
leaving the vehicle in the wrong place at the dual-use airport and
the airlines subsequently petitioned the government for NT$400
million (US$11.9 million) in compensation.

HEARING HELD ON CONSTITUTIONALITY OF 'TRUTH COMMISSION'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Grand Justices held a
hearing Wednesday on the constitutionality of a special statute
authorizing the formation of an investigation commission to probe the
March 19 election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the two sides -- the "pan-green camp" of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) on the one hand and the Legislative Yuan on the other -- made
opening statements followed by a question time and ending with final
statements. The process lasted for about eight hours.
</P>
<P>
The hearing -- the second such hearing -- was arranged by the
Council of Grand Justices after the "pan-green camp" asked for an
interpretation of the constitutionality of the "3-19 Truth
Investigation Commission" that passed the Legislative Yuan in
August. The first hearing was held Oct. 14 to hear the petition
from the "pan-green camp" for an injunction of the operations of
investigation commission, which started formal operations Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green camp" criticized the bill for seriously violating
the division of power and the checks and balances principles
stipulated under the Constitution, encroaching on the judicial and
prosecutorial powers and representing a serious violation of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Yu Ching wanted the grand justices to proclaim the
bill void from the beginning. The "pan-green camp" failed to overturn
the bill in its reconsideration bid in September due to the slight
edge enjoyed by the "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Wu Tung-sheng said that though one should respect
the authority of the legislature, "evil law is no law" and that the
grand justices should pronounce its annulment.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan, who represented the ministry,
claimed that the 3-19 bill is the "most gross violation" example
of the constitutional system since the Constitution was first
promulgated in 1947.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the commission for being granted with unlimited
power to target a specific and individual shooting and pointed out
that the commission is not under any jurisdiction whatsoever under
the current five-branch government structure system, but can still
exercise all the powers of a government agency.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Legislator Kao Yu-jen of the Kuomintang, spoke
in favor of the bill, saying that the controversy over the
election-eve shooting has created a deep cleft between the ruling and
the opposition parties and claiming that a so-called "independent"
investigation is the opposition's "responsibility to history."
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Chen Chin-hsin claimed that the bill was passed in
response to public calls for an independent investigation of the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
He rebutted accusations that the bill encroaches on judicial and
prosecutorial powers, or criminal immunity for the president,
claiming that it is for the upholding of social justice and is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
Chen denied that the commission has unlimited power, claiming
that only when individuals, groups, or government agencies resist the
investigation of the truth commission will related laws be overruled
by the commission.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the grand justices will give a ruling
on the constitutionality bill so that the commission, which has been
getting nowhere since its inauguration because of a boycott by the
administration, can begin to operate efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and professors from both sides were also on hand to
provide their views to the Council of Grand Justices, which will hold
its last hearing Friday.

TAIWAN REGRETS "REUNIFICATION" REMARKS BY U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
expressed regret and grave concern Wednesday over recent remarks by
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell in which he used the term
"reunification" to refer to the future development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and denied Taiwan has "sovereignty as a nation."
</P>
<P>
Chen reaffirmed that "the Republic of China (Taiwan) " is a
sovereign state, a fact which he said no country can deny.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable to Taiwan and regrettable that Secretary
Powell has denied the sovereignty enjoyed by Taiwan and predetermined
a position on future cross-strait development, " Chen said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Powell's remarks have harmed Taiwan's democracy and
prestige because they were made in ignorance of the fact that Taiwan
has for a long time participated in international affairs and
exercised its sovereignty as an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government should respect the will of the 23 million
people of Taiwan, which should be a crucial basis for its policies
toward Taiwan and for its efforts to promote peaceful dialogue across
the strait," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Powell spoke of Washington's stand on the status of Taiwan during
interviews with CNN and Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV in Beijing Monday.
</P>
<P>
Powell said: "We want to see both sides not take unilateral
action that would prejudice an eventual outcome, a reunification that
all parties are seeking."
</P>
<P>
Powell also reiterated that the United States does not support
independence for Taiwan, saying the island "does not enjoy
sovereignty as a nation, and that remains our policy, our firm
policy."
</P>
<P>
The remarks were obviously different from the usual U.S. practice
of urging both sides to seek a "peaceful resolution" without
specifying its stance on future relations between Taiwan and mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Chen invited American Institute in Taiwan
Director Douglas Paal -- Washington's de facto ambassador to Taipei
-- to his office to find out if there has been a shift in
U.S. policy toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , Paal
emphasized during the meeting that the U.S. policy toward Taiwan
remains unchanged, pointing out that the U.S. Department of State has
reaffirmed Washington's policy favoring a "peaceful resolution" of
the cross-strait dispute.
</P>
<P>
Paal also said Powell spoke in favor of Taiwan during his recent
meeting with Beijing leaders, according to MOFA.
</P>
<P>
Powell defended Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization, the island's full participation in the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and Washington's arms sales to
Taiwan, Paal said.
</P>
<P>
Powell also urged Beijing to take seriously President Chen
Shui-bian's peace overtures -- made in his Oct. 10 National Day
address -- and to resume dialogue with Taiwan soon, Paal said.

POWELL'S REMARKS ARE SERIOUS WARNING TO TAIWAN: KMT CHAIRMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Recent remarks by U. S. Secretary of State
Colin Powell on cross-Taiwan Strait ties are a "very severe warning"
to Taiwan and the government must assume responsibility for the
situation, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lien's comments came after Powell said Monday in an interview
with the Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite TV in Beijing that the
United States will maintain its "one China" policy and that "Taiwan
is not independent. It does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation."
</P>
<P>
Powell also said that "the United States wants to see both sides
not take unilateral action that would prejudice an eventual outcome,
a unification that all parties are seeking."
</P>
<P>
Lien described Powell's remarks as a "very serious warning" to
Taiwan and said that the government led by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) must be held accountable for the lion's share
of responsibility for the development.
</P>
<P>
Lien blamed what he described as the government's flip-flops and
doublespeak in its dealings with the United States for Powell's
remarks and said that the KMT has always remained firm on its stance
that the Republic of China is a wholly independent sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"There must not be the slightest bit of doubt about this fact,
because Taiwan, of the sovereignty of the ROC, is our home where we
were born and set our roots, " the KMT chairman said, arguing that
the government and President Chen Shui-bian owe a clear explanation
to the Taiwan people in the wake of the U.S. rhetoric suggesting a
peaceful unification across the strait.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the same day, the legislative caucuses of the KMT and the
People First Party (PFP) , annoyed by Powell's words, called a news
conference at the Legislative Yuan to defend Taiwan's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Pointing their fingers at the United States, they said that the
U. S. government has no right to "arrange, meddle in or interfere
with" any issue that is of maximum concern to Taiwan's 23 million
people.
</P>
<P>
KMT whip Tseng Yung-chuan claimed that Powell's words are a
reflection that Chen's performance over the past four and a half
years has not won approval from the United States and he urged the
government to carefully handle Taiwan's delicate relations with the
United States, especially now, at a time when the Bush administration
is skeptical of Taiwan's cross-strait policy.
</P>
<P>
PFP whip Liu Wen-hsiung ascribed the situation to what he said is
the problem of Chen's integrity, which he described as the country's
"largest crisis."

CABINET FULLY BEHIND GUGGENHEIM TAICHUNG BRANCH PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan fully supports the plan
for a Guggenheim branch in the central Taiwan city of Taichung, a
spokesman for the Executive Yuan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai made the remarks amid reports that Taichung city
councilors had lashed out at the plan during a review of the initial
agreement reached between Taichung and the prestigious museum.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed confidence that Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who made
a Taichung Guggenheim branch his campaign platform when he ran for
mayor, can use his tact and influence to resolve the differences over
its construction.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that if there is a need for the government to
explain the situation to the Guggenheim Foundation, then President
Chen Shui-bian and Premier Yu Shyi-kun will be willing to meet with
the heads of the foundation to lend support to Taichung City.
</P>
<P>
The Taichung city council began a two-day review of the initial
agreement Wednesday, with most of the councilors questioning the
agreement as an "unequal treaty" and expressing worry that the
project would become a financial "black hole."
</P>
<P>
Councilor Yu Ming-tze said that the agreement would strip the
city of its dignity, pointing out that under the plan, the city would
have to appropriate a 10-year budget for the branch and then turn it
over to the Guggenheim Foundation after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Councilor Lin Pei-le asked Hu to pledge the fortune of him and
his family that the branch will not leave huge debts for future
generations.
</P>
<P>
However, the mayor defended the project as an "asset, " noting
that when the idea of a central Taiwan science park was broached
years ago, a lot of people were pessimistic, but the park has now
reaped economic benefits for the city.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Guggenheim branch plan has been subjected to a
feasibility study that came to the conclusion that it would bring
benefits in the long term. Taiwan has enjoyed no such international
cooperation projects before, he said, urging the naysayers to adopt a
newer and broader perspective on the matter.

BOFT UPBEAT ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR TAIWAN-INDIA TRADE TIES
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prospects for future trade relations
between Taiwan and India are promising, with significant growth
already seen this year, Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT)
Director-general Huang Chih-peng said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that Taiwan's exports to India at present
account for only 0.6 percent of its out-bound shipments.
</P>
<P>
However, these exports amounted to US$767.7 million from January
to September this year, equivalent to the amount for the whole of
2003, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Imports from India during the same period stood at US$630
million, Huang added.
</P>
<P>
While fewer than 100 Taiwanese businesses have invested in India
in the past -- mainly because of language differences and the
geographic distance between the countries -- India has in recent
years become a major target of Taiwanese investors and traders in
light of its fast economic growth, vast domestic market and excellent
IT software design capacity, according to Huang.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the BOFT has been promoting trade activities with
India by maintaining close contact with India's investment and trade
authorities and organizing fact-finding tours to India to look at
trade and investment opportunities there.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the IT industry, other industries with cooperation
potential between the two sides include textiles, bicycles, medical
equipment, sports equipment, stationery and gifts, and mechanical
instruments, Huang said.

TAIWAN OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT  RELATIONS WITH INDIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relations between Taiwan and India are
becoming closer and the prospects for bilateral trade and economic
cooperation are rosy, government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both Lin Sung-huan, director-general of the Asia-Pacific Affairs
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Kao Cheng-chiung,
representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New
Delhi, said that the two countries are complementary in the economic
and technology fields and that there is an ample room for the
promotion of cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-India relations were revitalized in 1995 when the two
sides decided to establish representative offices in each other's
countries, Lin noted, adding that the bilateral ties have become even
closer since 2002, when the two countries signed an investment
guarantee accord.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan greatly appreciates its relations with India, Lin noted,
adding that he believes the complementary effects between the two
countries in the economics and technology industries will contribute
to the promotion of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to do its best to promote relations
with India and make it another destination for Taiwan's overseas
investment under the government's "southward" policy, Lin went on.
</P>
<P>
India has large-scale market potential given that it is very
populous and an emerging market, Lin said. He encouraged Taiwan
enterprises to explore business opportunities in the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
In comparison with mainland China, Lin said, it is a safer
destination for investment because India has a market-oriented
economy, while the mainland is less open in the political and
economic fields and lacks the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kao said that Taiwan-India ties have steadily
improved since 1995 and exchange visits by government officials have
been increasing.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the existing investment guarantee accord, the two
countries are seeking to sign a double taxation prevention accord and
to hold regular meetings of senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New Delhi is also
seeking to set up a technological group that will be in charge of
further promoting technological exchanges between the two countries,
Kao revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan-India Forum, which was established two years ago, has
been serving as a second track of official communications between the
two countries, with the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses
(IDSA) in India and the Institute of International Relations of
National Chengchi University in Taiwan as their communication
channels, Kao added.

TAIWAN ECONOMY FLASHES YELLOW-RED LIGHT FOR SEPTEMBER: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's economy in September posted a
yellow-red light in the government's five-color rating system, a
spokesman for the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The composite index fell from August's 33 points to 32 points for
September, which is close to a green light, as the domestic economy
flashed a fourth consecutive yellow-red light, said Hu Chung-ying,
director of the CEPD's Economic Research Department.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a green light indicates that the booming
domestic economy is likely to abate in the coming months, despite the
fact that sales volumes and export order numbers last month were
slightly up compared to August levels, Hu said, adding that a larger
percent of the Taiwan companies surveyed are pessimistic about their
business conditions in the short term compared to August.
</P>
<P>
According to the five-color rating system designated by the CEPD,
a red light indicates an overheated economy, yellow-red indicates a
heating up economy, green means steady growth, yellow-blue signals
sluggishness and blue points to recession.
</P>
<P>
The leading index for September stood at the August level of
107.8 points, while the month's current index fell by 0.7 percent to
110 points.

BEIJING UNLIKELY TO PROVOKE WAR AGAINST TAIWAN: FORMER KOREAN LEADER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beijing leadership is unlikely to
rashly launch an attack against Taiwan, because such a move would
come at a huge price for mainland China, former South Korean
President Kim Young Sam said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kim made the remarks while giving a speech at National Chengchi
University.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the mainland's invasion of Vietnam as example, Kim
said it is impossible that Beijing will stir up a war rashly against
Taiwan at a very possible terrible cost to itself.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, like Taiwan, is also a democratic country and the
South Korean people, like the Taiwan people, will never give way to
military intimidation from North Korea's unification scheme, Kim
said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that democracy is the highest value for all mankind to
live in freedom and with human rights, Kim said the people in both
Taiwan and his own country should cherish their democratic systems.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent remarks made in Beijing by U.S.
Secretary of State Colin Powell that Taiwan is not independent and
does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation, Kim declined to speculate as
to why Powell said what he did.
</P>
<P>
But he said, citing his many American friends, that he strongly
believes Washington will not give up on Taiwan because it is an
important partner of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The former South Korean president arrived in Taiwan Monday for
an eight-day visit.

Taiwan's sovereignty should be dictated by

Governor Shintaro Ishihara said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, who was visiting Taiwan, made the remarks while
commenting on U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent remarks

made a mistake by saying what he did.

<P>
He also reminded the United States to remember what happened in
Tibet and the cruelty demonstrated by the Chinese military during
China's invasion decades ago.

China may split into various parts in years to come given that it
is facing serious economic problems with a great gap between the rich

U.S. OFFICIAL REAFFIRMS NO CHANGE IN 'SIX ASSURANCES' TO TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top representative to the
United States confirmed Wednesday that U.S. officials have reassured
him that Washington will stick to the "Six Assurances" it pledged to
Taiwan in 1982 as the guidelines in its policy toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Chinese-language media in Washington, D.C.,
David Ta-wei Lee confirmed that Randall G. Shriver, U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian Affairs, told him Tuesday
that the United States' stance on Taiwan's sovereignty has not
changed and that the "Six Assurances" remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Reagan administration offered the "Six Assurances" to Taiwan
after it signed a joint communique on Aug. 17, 1982 with mainland
China over arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he immediately contacted the State Department to
express Taiwan's "grave concern" and ask for clarification after
Secretary of State Colin Powell made some remarks regarding Taiwan
and its relations with mainland China in an interview with the Hong
Kong-based Phoenix TV Group during his Oct. 25 visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Powell said that "Taiwan is not independent. It
does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation, " and that "the two sides
should move forward to a peaceful unification through dialogue."
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, Shriver reiterated in a "face to face" talk
with him Tuesday that the "Six Assurances, " particularly the fifth
point -- namely, the United States would not alter its position about
Taiwan's sovereignty, which was that the question was one to be
decided peacefully by the Chinese themselves -- remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee said that Powell clarified during an interview
with Ron Insana of CNBC Wednesday that the words "peaceful
reunification" of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait that he
mentioned during his 24-hour visit in Beijing should be "a peaceful
resolution" of the problem.
</P>
<P>
"The term of art really is to have a 'peaceful resolution' of the
problem. And that's the term of art, and that is our policy and
remains our policy," Powell was quoted as saying to CNBC.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he believes that Washington will formally reiterate
its "Six Assurances" toward Taiwan again shortly, adding that he will
be briefed by U.S. officials Wednesday or Thursday about Powell's
recent Beijing visit.
</P>
<P>
The "Six Assurances" stipulate that the United States has not
agreed to set a date for ending arms sales to the Republic of China;
has not agreed to hold prior consultations with Beijing on arms sales
to the Republic of China; will not play any mediation role between
Taiwan and Beijing; has not agreed to revise the Taiwan Relations
Act; has not altered its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan;
and will not exert pressure on the Republic of China to enter into
negotiations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee said that actually, Powell has on many occasions
during his talks with the mainland Chinese leadership spoken
favorably for Taiwan, including that the United States remains firm
in its stance on arms sales to Taiwan despite Beijing's strong
opposition and that the United States has continued to encourage
Beijing to face squarely the goodwill that President Chen Shui-bian
demonstrated toward mainland China in his Oct. 10 National Day
address.

WANG HOPES ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL CAN BE PUT TO REVIEW BEFORE ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday that he still hopes a bill authorizing a major arms
procurement package from the United States will be put to review by a
legislative committee before the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Wang's words came amid grave concerns in Taiwan over U.S.
Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent remarks about Taiwan in
which he denied Taiwan has "sovereignty as a nation" and used the
term "unification" to refer to the future development of cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possible impact of Powell's remarks on the bill
authorizing a special budget of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion)
proposed by the Executive Yuan for arms procurement, Wang said there
are positive and negative views on Powell's remarks, and some may
think arms procurement is more necessary while others may think it
less necessary.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he "personally hopes the Procedure Committee in the
Legislature can arrange for it to be put on the agenda for review
Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
An attempt by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to put the
bill on the agenda for review failed last week. The DPP has said it
hopes the bill can be reviewed quickly and complete its third reading
in the Legislative Yuan before the legislative elections. The party
also said that an arms procurement bill can be passed before talking
about the budget for the arms procurement after lawmakers reconvene
after the elections.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Kuomintang said the Legislative Yuan is
scheduled to go into a one-month recess Nov. 10 in preparation for
the elections, and that there is not enough time to review the bill.
</P>
<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye has said that if the arms
deal, mainly for six batteries of anti-missile PAC-III missiles,
eight diesel-electric submarines, and a squadron of anti-submarine
aircraft, failed to pass the legislature before next January, he
would resign.

When police officers arrived, the victim had already lost
consciousness due to excessive bleeding. He was later pronounced dead
upon arrival at a nearby hospital.

ROC-EL SALVADOR RELATIONS UNCHANGED: ROC FOREIGN MINISTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday
reaffirmed that relations with El Salvador are unchanged and
high-level exchanges are continuing as usual.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Michel Lu was responding to an AFP
report that El Salvadoran Foreign Minister Francisco Lainez said that
the government will study the possibility of establishing diplomatic
relations with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
After checking with the ROC Embassy in El Salvador, the foreign
ministry found that the El Salvadoran Chamber of Commerce had
suggested that establishing formal diplomatic relations with mainland
China could be good for expanding El Salvador's exports of coffee and
pharmaceuticals to the mainland, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that President Antonio Saca led a
delegation to attend a Democratic Pacific Assembly in Taipei in
August, showing the high level of exchanges that take place between
the two countries, adding that there is no need to worry about any
change of relations with the Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thomas Hou, ROC Ambassador to El Salvador, said in San
Salvador that he had a pleasant meeting with Lainez Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hou said that some El Salvadoran enterprises have designs on the
vast market in mainland China, believing that they have the
opportunity to increase exports of coffee and other agricultural
products to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
He will try to talk with the business leaders on the subject when
he attends a seminar sponsored by the El Salvador Chamber of Commerce
this Saturday, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Central American countries export a large
number of textile products to the United States, and El Salvador
textile manufacturers worry about the impact after the United States
lifts its quota on mainland Chinese textile products in 2005.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) -- an
economic integration agreement between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay -- recently said it desired to enter into a free trade
agreement with mainland China, and Central American countries are
simply trying to jump on the bandwagon and this is the reason the
chamber of commerce is calling for increased trade with the mainland.

FIRST KIDD-CLASS DESTROYER TO BE DELIVERED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE: ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first of the four Kidd-class
destroyers that the United States agreed to sell to the Republic of
China Navy in 2001 is expected to be delivered ahead of schedule and
commissioned into service in 2005, the ROC's top envoy to Washington
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
David Ta-wei Lee said that he visited a shipyard in Deytens,
South Carolina several days ago and was briefed there that the
process of de-mothballing and renovating the four Kidd-class
destroyers has been going smoothly, with the work expected to be
finished ahead of the original schedule.
</P>
<P>
Lee did not give an exact date on when the first destroyer will
be delivered to Taiwan out of security considerations. However, it
has been learned that the destroyer will be formally commissioned
prior to the Oct. 10 National Day in 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to the ROC Navy officials who are currently in Deytens
to oversee the destroyers' warfare software renovation work, the
first Kidd-class destroyer was originally scheduled to be delivered
to Taiwan at the end of 2005, followed by the second, third and
fourth destroyers between 2006 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he was impressed by the performance and work ethic
demonstrated by the some 300-plus ROC Navy officers who are taking
part in the de-mothballing and renovation projects in a shipyard in
Charleston, S.C., and another in Deytens.
</P>
<P>
The navy officers are also working there in preparation for
taking delivery of the four 9,600-ton destroyers that the United
States originally built for the Shah of Iran in 1979 but were later
mothballed when Iran canceled the deal.
</P>
<P>
According to an assessment by the ROC Navy, the Kidd-class
destroyers -- to be equipped with a new missile package -- have
superb naval and air defense capabilities and will provide Taiwan
with an effective deterrent against a mainland Chinese naval attack
up to around the year 2010 ahead of China further beefing up its navy
with advanced weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
The Kidd-class destroyers are also expected to serve as a
training platform for ROC naval officers in preparing them to operate
Aegis battle management system-equipped Arleigh Burke-class guided
missile destroyers in the future, according to the ROC Navy. Taiwan
has expressed interest in purchasing the highly advanced
Aegis-equipped destroyers, but the United States has not yet agreed
to negotiate such a deal.
</P>
<P>
To be included in the missile package that will be mounted aboard
the Kidd-class destroyers will be 248 SM-2 Block IIIA Standard
missiles and 32 RGM-84L Block II Harpoon missiles.
</P>
<P>
Also included in the destroyer sale, which has a price tag of
more than NT$28.4 billion (US$818 million) , are shippyard and port
support services as well as post-transfer activities, including
personnel training and spare parts.

TAIWAN IS A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY: FORMER S. KOREAN PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is an independent country with
sovereignty, visiting former South Korean President Kim Young Sam
said in Taipei Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Answering reporters' questions at his first news conference since
arriving in Taiwan Monday, Kim said that Taiwan is a sovereign state
with a population of 23 million with its president, legislators and
local government officials and representatives being popularly
elected.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that Seoul has no alternative but to engage Beijing
given the existing world situation, but Taiwan's existence as a
sovereign state is an undeniable fact that should not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Kim said, he has stressed that Taiwan and South
Korea should further enhance bilateral ties in political, economic
and many other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Kim disclosed that Beijing had tried to lobby him prior to his
Taiwan trip for closer ties with mainland China rather than with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that he was not moved by the Beijing invitation to
visit China again and "meet whoever I want to meet," Kim said that he
has no strong urge to visit China and as far as future development is
concerned, he would like to let nature take its course.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that he met with former Chinese President Jiang Zemin on
many occasions during the five years he was in office as South
Korea's president and became aware that Jiang had great concerns
about the Taiwan issue. One of Jiang's concerns was the eventual
unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, according to Kim.
</P>
<P>
Kim added that he sees no difference in Beijing's policy toward
Taiwan in the reign of current Chinese President Hu Jintao from that
when Jiang was in office.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Kim suggested that Taiwan and mainland
China solve their differences via dialogue. "Taiwan should make it
very clear that it is ready to return to the negotiating table and an
attitude of resistance against this effort by any side would be
unacceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kim pointed out that the United States should also play a key
role in efforts to safeguard Taiwan's security given the island's
strategically important position in the northeastern Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The former South Korean head of state arrived in Taiwan Monday
for an eight-day visit at the invitation of President Chen Shui-bian.
It is his fourth visit to Taiwan.

<P>
Taiwan has stepped up efforts to attract
European tourists to realize its goal of doubling tourist
arrivals by 2008, a tourist official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Lan-hsuan, a Taiwan Tourism Bureau official stationed in
Frankfurt, Germany, made the remarks at a promotional presentation
held in Rome Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Republic of China Ambassador to the Vatican Tu Chu-sheng and ROC
Representative to Italy Lin Chi-cheng also attended the presentation,
which was jointly organized by the Taipei Tourism Office in Frankfurt
and the Italian office of China Airlines (CAL) -- Taiwan's largest air
carrier.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 travel agencies in Rome and its nearby areas sent
staff members to the presentation in which Huang introduced Taiwan's
tourist resources with a slide show. The participants were also
entertained with a variety of delicious Taiwanese dishes and snacks.
A similar presentation will be held in Milan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the Tourism Bureau has set the goals of attracting
37,000 Germans, 35,000 Britons, 23,000 French, 5,000 Italians, 4,000
Spaniards and 5,000 Scandinavians to make pleasure trips to Taiwan
this year.
</P>
<P>
"All of our promotional programs have so far proceeded smoothly
and we have confidence in presenting a satisfactory score card by the
end of the year, " Huang said, adding: "If all promotional projects
are carried out in line with our goals, the number of total European
tourists to Taiwan will reach 160,000 by 2008."
</P>
<P>
Huang said the Tourism Bureau has adopted many measures to
introduce Taiwan's tourist attractions to European tour operators and
prospective individual holidaymakers, including taking part in travel
fairs, organizing evening presentations and cooperating with airlines
in offering tour packages. She said the Taipei Tourism Office in
Frankfurt has established promotional networks in France and Britain
by cooperating with public relations firms.
</P>
<P>
Chen Fai-fan, general manager of CAL's Italian office, said CAL
hopes to attract more than 12,000 Italian passengers to travel to
Asia via its flights annually.

EX-SOUTH KOREAN PRES URGES TAIWAN NOT TO OVERREACT TO POWELL'S WORDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting former South Korean President Kim
Young Sam Thursday urged Taiwan not to overreact to the recent
remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell on Taiwan's status,
saying "slips of the tongue" do happen to politicians.
</P>
<P>
Kim was referring to the comment made by Powell early this week
in Beijing that Taiwan "does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation."
Powell also used the term "reunification" to refer to the eventual
development of cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
headquarters, Kim said the existence of Taiwan is a reality and that
"realities are not to be denied by politics."
</P>
<P>
Kim said Taiwan does enjoy sovereignty and has never been ruled
by China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has met all the requirements of a democracy for having a
population of 23 million, a directly elected president, independent
legislature and a complete judicial system, Kim pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Kim said the defense capabilities of Taiwan and the firm
commitment of the United States to defend Taiwan will deter China
from attacking the island.
</P>
<P>
He called on Taiwan and China to resume dialogue to seek to
resolve their disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, meanwhile, said Taiwan
regrets the fact that Powell felt it necessary to say something
inconsistent with reality.
</P>
<P>
Chang said Kim's visit is very valuable to Taiwan because it
represents an enduring friendship that has remained undeterred
despite Beijing's protests.
</P>
<P>
After ending his visit to the DPP headquarters, Kim met
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng over lunch.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, Kim believes Taiwan and China should be able
to maintain peace and stability as long as they stick to "a certain
principle, " noting that Washington's policy toward Taiwan has
remained the same since President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Taiwan and South Korea, Wang said the
recent agreement on the resumption of air links between the two sides
shows that bilateral ties are improving.
</P>
<P>
Kim arrived in Taiwan Monday for an eight-day visit at the
invitation of President Chen Shui-bian. It is his fourth visit to
Taiwan.

Court actions to repossess homes have leapt to the highest for

PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE REGRETS 'FRIVOLOUS" LAWSUIT BY RADIO HOST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office said Thursday it
was regrettable that a popular radio talk show host had filed a
"frivolous" lawsuit against President Chen Shui-bian and
Secretary-General to the President Su Tseng-chang in Taipei District
Court earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
James Huang, deputy secretary-general to the president, was
responding to a civil suit by Jaw Shau-kong, the chairman of UFO
Radio, that seeks to "restore his reputation."
</P>
<P>
Jaw's countersuit came on the heels of a suit by President Chen
against him and two legislators who cited Jaw's remarks in his
program and said that Chen offered US$1 million to former
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso as a birthday present, ostensibly
to cover up unwanted sexual advances.
</P>
<P>
Jaw said in his lawsuit that he obtained the information from a
Web site he had found using Google.
</P>
<P>
However, Su described him as a "media disgrace" and an
"unscrupulous media man." During a recent visit to a Chinese
calligraphy show, President Chen used a play on words to insinuate
that Jaw was a "mean people" when asked about his feelings in filing
the suit.
</P>
<P>
Jaw said that freedom of speech, from which a free press is
derived, is the basic right of the people, and the nation should give
it maximum protection. As a member of the media, he was only quoting
news that have been talked about at home and overseas for a long time
and there was nothing "improper" or "illegal" in so doing.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the Presidential Office will be taking Jaw's lawsuit
seriously.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that Jaw has been in the media long enough to
understand the standards of journalism, yet he did not follow the
basic tenet of verifying a report before transmitting it as "news."
</P>
<P>
Jaw was citing a mainland Chinese Web site that is well known to
have a high degree of animus toward Taiwan, a fact he was most likely
aware of, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Jaw's rumor about the US$1 million "birthday gift"
to the former Panamanian president in his program "created a social
disturbance" and was "a serious defamation to the personality and
reputation of our national leader as well as damaging to the nation's
friendship with its allies."
</P>
<P>
Huang said that President Chen, to redeem the dignity of a
national leader, was forced to file suit last week, and that Moscoso
would support the president by providing a written statement under
oath to refute the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the matter is now entering the judicial process
and the Presidential Office will respect the ruling of the court and
will refrain from further comment.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Su said he "was chilled to bone" to hear that
ill-intended political and senior media figures had spread unfounded
"news" without proper verification, adding that such a reaction is
understandable to the public.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that Jaw, however, instead of reflecting on the
incident, turned around and filed lawsuit, which was done only to
"try to shift the focus from himself."
</P>
<P>
The president demanded that the three defendants publish the court
verdict and an apology to him on the front pages of five major local
newspapers for three consecutive days. Jaw asked the president and
his top aide to do the same.

TAIWAN ENJOYS LEADERSHIP ROLE IN GOVERNMENT IT INFRASTRUCTURE: IDC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's government is a world leader in
information technology (IT) infrastructure because of its programs
and funding of the sector, according to a recent report published by
the International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Different from most other countries with advanced IT
infrastructure, Taiwan's e-solutions have deeply penetrated into the
government's daily operations, the IDC said in its Asia/Pacific
Policy and Strategies Influencing Government IT Spending, 2004.
</P>
<P>
Although many Asia-Pacific governments are hoping to get more
value and effectiveness from their IT investments, the IDC said that
most of them still rely on "brick operations" and pointed out that
the key issue now is how to create maximum value-added services
through their IT infrastructure to serve the people.
</P>
<P>
According to an IDC senior researcher in Taiwan, the government
of Taiwan has an across-the-board e-program, which has helped its
agencies build a massive Internet service basis. The country's
continued investment in improving its government sector's e-solutions
has achieved initial successes in many fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Taiwan government agencies have performed well in
providing quick digital content information on a wide range of fronts
to the public, successfully linking the government and a society keen
for knowledge, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"One of the foremost policy challenges for Asian governments is
tackling how to successfully develop cross-agency services, further
increasing the effectiveness of their IT infrastructure, " an IDC
Asia/Pacific research manager said.

ANTI-INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PIRACY POLICE UNIT TO BEGIN NOV. 1
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new, 220-man police unit specializing in
preventing intellectual property rights infringements will begin
operations Nov. 1, Ministry of Economic Affairs officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in an inter-ministerial meeting hosted by
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh.
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 1 last year, police officers have been assigned to
perform the mission in the form of an ad hoc task force.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Wen-hsiung, deputy director-general of the
ministry's Intellectual Property Office, the task force has produced
good results over the past 20 months and he hopes Taiwan will perform
even better in terms of its anti-piracy efforts after the new unit
begins its work.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the United States is expected to announce in December the
results of its review on whether to downgrade Taiwan's status or
remove the island completely from the "Special 301" priority
watchlist.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who visited Washington, D.C. earlier this month to present
Taiwan's anti-piracy efforts to authorities and groups there, said
the U.S. side has expressed its satisfaction with what Taiwan has
done, especially the amendments to the Copyright Act.

YANGMINGSHAN MOST POPULAR NATIONAL PARK IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hikers and tourists made a total of 4.06
million person-visits to Yangmingshan National Park in Taipei's north
suburb in the first nine months of this year, making it the most
popular national park in Taiwan, the Ministry of the Interior
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yangmingshan, named after the great ancient Chinese philosopher
Wang Yangming, is popular mainly because the park can be reached by a
20-minute drive from downtown Taipei, in addition to its volcanic
scenery, thick forests and mountain trails, interior ministry
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest survey, the interior ministry found that Taiwan's
six national parks posted a total of 12.06 million person-visits
during the Jan.-Sept. period, with Yangmingshan attracting about 33
percent of these people.
</P>
<P>
Trailing Yangmingshan was Kenting National Park located at the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, which attracted 3.17 million
person-visits, and Taroko Gorge located in the eastern section of the
island, which attracted 2.54 million person-visits. Taroko Gorge used
to be Taiwan's top tourist attraction. It is known for its stunning
natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
Of the six national parks, Kinmen National Park, located in the
ROC-held outlying island of Kinmen, posted a whopping growth of 19
percent in the number of tourists and visitors during the nine-month
period, representing the greatest growth in this regard among all six
national parks.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Jade Mountain National Park in the Central
Mountain Range and Sheipa National Park, another high-mountain
natural attraction, witnessed a decline of 15 percent and 10 percent,
respectively, in numbers of visiting tourists due to damage to their
trails caused by typhoons and torrents, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey also found that a total of 870 cases of
national park law violations were reported in the six national parks
during the nine-month period.
</P>
<P>
Charges involved trespassing into off-limit wildlife conservation
areas, illegal entry by vehicles, installing stands to sell food or
items illegally and construction private buildings, in that order,
interior ministry officials said.

CHEN REAFFIRMS SINCERITY TO PROMOTE NORMALIZATION OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
sincerity Thursday to promote normalization of relations across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen also reiterated that his administration's constitutional
re-engineering plan is primarily aimed at enhancing government
efficiency and upgrading Taiwan's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Although Taiwan is a sovereign state, it has not been that
normal or complete. We need constitutional re-engineering to ensure
good governance, " Chen said, adding that it's extremely unfair to
Taiwan to distort the constitutional reform program as a tactic to
promote de jure independence in a gradual manner.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with Douglas Bereuter,
chairman of the U.S. Asia Foundation, and other senior executives of
the foundation, who arrived in Taipei Wednesday to attend a meeting
marking the foundation's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
In his May 20, 2000 inauguration address, Chen said he has made
it clear that he will not declare Taiwan independence during his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
Even though facing divided opinions in domestic society, Chen
said he is still willing to extend an olive branch to mainland China
with maximum sincerity to promote normalization of cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said, mainland China has stubbornly insisted on its
"one China" principle aimed at forcing Taiwan to accept its "one
country, two systems" unification scheme.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of Taiwan people cannot accept such unification
terms, and this is the biggest obstacle to the opening of
cross-strait dialogue and negotiations," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen expressed his gratitude for the U.S.
Asia Foundation's contributions to Taiwan's democratic development
over the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
Between 1954 and 1996, Chen said, the foundation has contributed
much to having such universal values as democracy, freedom, rule of
law and human rights take root in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has also assisted Taiwan's Legislative Yuan in
establishing a library and an assistant system. Moreover, it has
helped elite members in various Taiwan quarters to do advanced
studies in the United States. Thanks to the foundation's assistance,
more than 700 aspiring Taiwan youths, including Vice President
Annette Lu, have managed to pursue tertiary academic degrees at U.S.
universities over the past years.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bereuter said, the U.S. Asia Foundation will
cooperate with the Taiwan Asia Foundation in promoting grassroots
democratic participation and cross-strait exchanges and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chen said he believes that Taiwan's democratization
can spawn a "lighthouse effect" to inspire mainland China to evolve
into a liberal democracy in the future. Such a development would be
conducive to the easing of cross-strait tensions, he added.

TAIWAN TO DO ITS BEST TO CONFORM TO KYOTO PROTOCOL MANDATES: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the
Kyoto Protocol, the country will do its utmost to abide by its new
rules aimed at easing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), a spokesman
for the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a constructive member of the global village, Taiwan is poised
to comply with the pact's new measures, whatever they may call for,
the spokesman said, adding that the ministry and relevant agencies
are already carefully assessing the possible impact on Taiwan
industries.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's remarks fully echoed recent statements by Vice
Minister Chen Ruey-lung, who said Tuesday that the MOEA is very
concerned about the energy issues underlined by the Kyoto Protocol
and that it has actively been promoting public awareness of energy
efficiency, energy diversity and pollution prevention.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the MOEA has also worked out a program to help
Taiwan's top 100 energy consumers save energy.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan will undoubtedly conform to the Kyoto
Protocol's stricter regulations, Chen said that Taiwan will consider
resorting to the World Trade Organization mechanisms to seek
resolutions to disputes should Kyoto Protocol member states impose
trade barriers against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto Protocol, which is slated to become effective at the
beginning of next year, is expected to have a serious impact on
Taiwan's semiconductor, flat panel, automobile and home appliances
industries that are high energy consumers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 36 industrialized countries ratified the Kyoto
Protocol Oct. 24, pledging to slash their output of greenhouse gases
by the deadline during the 2008-2012 period. The United States and
Australia, however, failed to sign the high-profile environmental
protection accord.

INDIAN OFFICIAL URGES EXPANSION OF TRADE EXCHANGES WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan and India should focus on bilateral
trade and economic exchanges at the present stage and should then
expand the exchanges to other areas, the head of the India-Taipei
Association said in Taipei Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vijay Gokhale, who was referring to the areas of hi-tech,
academia, culture and tourism during an interview with CNA, added
that his association is hoping to act as a bridge for promoting such
exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also said that when bilateral trade reaches "a certain
degree, " it will be natural for the two countries to sign an
agreement to avoid double taxation.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Taiwan External Trade
Development Center, bilateral trade in recent years has continued to
increase and is expected to reach US$2 billion this year. Two-way
trade between mainland China and India was between US$6 billion and
US$7 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
But he said it is too early to talk about signing a free trade
agreement between the two countries, saying that India has in fact
only signed such agreements with Sri Lanka and Thailand so far.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperation, he made particular mention of the
information technology (IT) and software industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taiwan's electronics, communications, IT,
manufacturing and food processing industries are competitive, while
India is good in the field of software research and development,
making the two countries complementary in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Acer Corp. is now the third-largest PC manufacturer in
India, while BenQ is the third-largest cellular phone manufacturer
and D-Link Corp., Taiwan's leading supplier of telecommunication
devices, has enjoyed good development after venturing into India in
1993, he noted, adding that India has a vast market for
communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
Vehicle parts and components represent another advantage for
Taiwan manufacturers, he went on, noting that they are specialized in
producing high-priced parts, while Indian manufacturers concentrate
mostly on mid- or low-level products.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the overall investment environment in
India is far from ideal, especially its infrastructure, it has great
potential with its vast population and market.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to invest in India. Come later and the opportunities
will be missed forever," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that others have often compared the investment
environment between India and mainland China and recalled that when
he was sent to the mainland in 1990, the investment environment there
was also not good because of insufficient infrastructure, but Taiwan
businessmen came in droves nonetheless. Taiwan businessmen also
flocked to Vietnam, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the three strengths of his country -- vast market,
rich resources and well-trained manpower -- which make it a superb
option for Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the middle-class is increasing among the 1.1
billion population, accounting for at least 200-300 million, while
those who have the ability to purchase consumer goods probably number
500 million. He urged Taiwan businessmen not to look at the dark side
of his country, such as the poor infrastructure, high illiteracy and
poverty.
</P>
<P>
He noted that India's judicial system is patterned after that of
Britain, which provides domestic and foreign manufacturers with the
same protection under the law. It also offers good conditions for
foreign investment, such as the establishment of special economic
zones and custom tariff incentives, and allows the products to be
sold both domestically and overseas.

New York Times: Red Sox erase 86 years of
futility in 4-game sweep of Cardinals.

The Red Sox won the World Series on Wednesday for the first time
since 1918, overcoming, at last, the sale of Ruth to the Yankees. The
Red Sox, the franchise that perfected heartbreak, won the title with
one of the most dominating performances in World Series history,
silencing the St. Louis Cardinals, 3-0, in Game 4 to sweep a series
in which they never trailed. They won their last eight games of the
season.

Wall Street Journal: If election isn't resolved Nov. 2, battles
loom in seven key states.

U.S. Presidential Election day is less than a week away, but
Americans may not know the winner for days, if not weeks, after
the polls close. Never before have states faced so many ballots that
won't be counted until after Election Day. This year will see the
first nationwide use of provisional ballots, for voters whose
eligibility is questioned at the polls. How those ballots are counted
has already been a matter of dispute. And with participation expected
to be high, states are bracing for an unprecedented number of
absentee, early-voting, military and overseas ballots that in some
states could total more than one-third of votes. Both campaigns'
legal teams are focusing on real and potential problems plaguing a
number of states including Ohio, Florida, and five other crucial
states. Republicans are poised to challenge voters' legal status,
suspecting Democratic fraud. Republicans generally have an interest
in damping participation: Larger turnouts typically suggest greater
participation from infrequent and downscale voters who tend to vote
Democratic.

PRESIDENT THANKS TOKYO GOVERNOR FOR PROMOTING TAIWAN TOURISM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian expressed his
heartfelt gratitude to Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara Thursday,
saying that Ishihara's assistance in promoting Taiwan's new tourist
train is "priceless."
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Ishihara at the Presidential Office, Chen
also apologized for what he described as "wrongful accusations"
against the Tokyo governor by some opposition politicians and
pro-unification radicals.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara was a guest of honor on the maiden journey of the Taiwan
Railway Administration's (TRA's) premium-class "Formosa Star" tourist
train from Taipei to the eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung
Tuesday, at a time when normal passenger train services on the route
were still suspended because of damage caused by Typhoon Nock-Ten a
day earlier. Opposition lawmakers blamed the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) for granting "special
privileges" to Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
"I feel regret that you have been wronged, " Chen told his guest,
adding: "There have been some abnormal phenomena in Taiwan society
these days. Foreign friends who truly support Taiwan are often
stigmatized and for this I feel sadness and regret."
</P>
<P>
Chen said some countries have spent large sums of money inviting
popular fashion models to spearhead their tourism promotion programs.
</P>
<P>
"What a precious gift Ishihara has given us. He traveled to
Taiwan to help promote our country as a new tourist paradise. Without
spending a dime, we got such a heavyweight spokesman for our new
tourist train," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japan has been battered by a typhoon and a series of
earthquakes in recent days, Chen said that Ishihara honored his
promise to visit Taiwan as scheduled. "We appreciate your true
friendship and we take pride in having a friend like you, " Chen told
Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, Chen said, diehard pro-unification and pro-China
supporters in Taiwan like to wrong foreigners who support Taiwan's
independent sovereign status. Similarly, the international community
does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty and has not treated the 23
million Taiwan people fairly, he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ishihara said he did not care about the wrongful
accusations against him, brushing them aside lightheartedly as
"probably just a ploy to get a bit of media hype."
</P>
<P>
MOTC Minister Lin Ling-san said earlier this week that Ishihara
gave the idea of cashing in on Taiwan's hot springs and train
services to attract Japanese tourists during his visit to Taipei in
May to attend President Chen Shui-bian's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
"During that trip, I asked Ishihara how to entice Japanese
citizens to visit Taiwan. Ishihara reminded me that we
can better use Taiwan's hot springs and train services to attract
both senior and young Japanese holidaymakers, " Lin recalled, adding
that he then directed the TRA and the Tourism Bureau to jointly
design the premium "Formosa Star" tourist train and its
round-the-island journey.
</P>
<P>
The tourist train has all sorts of modern amenities and
entertainment equipment as well as catering services. Food and
beverages are included in the ticket price. Moreover, the TRA has
joined forces with five-star tourist hotels and major recreation
centers to offer three-day, two-night or four-day, three-night tour
packages.
</P>
<P>
The top-end train will begin formal operations on Oct. 30 and the
the tickets for its first three journeys have been fully booked.

PEACEFUL CROSS-STRAIT TIES IN U.S. INTERESTS: U.S. SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mutually beneficial relationship between
Taiwan and mainland China is in the interests of the United States,
and Washington should urge the two sides to move in this direction, a
respected American scholar said Thursday in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harry Harding, dean of the Elliot School of International
Affairs at George Washington University, made the remarks in an
exclusive interview with CNA.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is growing concern in the United States about
the current tense situation across the Taiwan Strait, including a
military buildup on both sides, Harding said Washington is taking a
more active role to prevent an outbreak of conflict between Taiwan
and the mainland by discouraging either side from taking unilateral
action to disrupt the status quo.
</P>
<P>
Harding made the remarks in reference to comments made recently
by U.S. Secretary of States Colin Powell regarding the future course
of cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
"From my understanding, he simply made a mis-statement, he
mis-stated American policy on that issue, of unification versus
independence, " he said, adding that "the really important point is
that his statements contain a very clear repudiation from the
American perspective of the idea that Taiwan is an independent
sovereign country."
</P>
<P>
Powell said Monday in an interview with the Hong Kong-based
Phoenix Satellite TV in Beijing that the United States will maintain
its "one China" policy and that "Taiwan is not independent. It does
not enjoy sovereignty as a nation."
</P>
<P>
Powell also said that the "the United States wants to see both
sides not take unilateral action that would prejudice an eventual
outcome, a unification that all parties are seeking."

Harding is in Taipei to take part in the 50th anniversary of the

FATE OF TAICHUNG'S GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM PROJECT STILL IN LIMBO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taichung city council decided Thursday
to shelve a draft bill on cooperation with the New York-based Solomon
R. Guggenheim Foundation to build a branch museum in the central
Taiwan city, leaving the fate of the long-talked about project up in
the air.
</P>
<P>
According to a consensus reached during a visit by Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu to the Guggenheim Foundation Sept. 21, the two parties
should have signed an initial agreement before Oct. 12 and the
Taichung city government would have had to pay a total of US$8
million in initial royalties, project management and architectural
design fees before Oct. 29 as a guarantee that it would carry out the
cooperative project. Failure to do so would cause the foundation to
scrap the project.
</P>
<P>
As the city council did not open its new session until Oct. 18,
Hu obtained the consent of the Guggenheim Foundation to postpone the
signing of the initial agreement by fax until Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
The city council began screening the cooperative project
Wednesday and was expected to come to definite decision the following
day, but as many councilors felt that some provisions of the proposed
agreement are unfair to Taiwan, City Council Speaker Chang Hung-nien
ruled at the end of the morning session that the proposal be shelved
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the city council will ask Hu to continue negotiating
with the Guggenheim Foundation based on recommendations by the city
council's legal advisers.

"The negotiation results should be sent to the city council for
further discussion before the end of its current session on Dec. 3, "
Chang said, adding that the council will also put the draft agreement
on its Web site to help Taichung citizens better understand the
content.
</P>
<P>
Observers originally expected that the city council would decide
the project's fate by a showdown vote, so the decision to shelve the
bill came as a surprise. Some observers said the decision has in
effect killed the project as the Guggenheim Foundation is not
expected to agree to revise the cooperation terms, nor will it agree
to any further delay in striking the deal.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Hu said he will do his utmost to negotiate with the
Guggenheim foundation in hopes of reaching a mutually acceptable
formal agreement before Dec. 3. If all goes well, he said, the
project will remain alive. But if the foundation would not tolerate
any delay, Hu said, the city government will have to forget the
project.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Wednesday the central
government fully supports the project adding that both President Chen
Shui-bian and Premier Yu Shyi-kun would be willing to meet with
Guggenheim foundation executives to lend support behind the Taichung
City Government.

Young Sam, Yu said that Taiwan is a democratic country with its own
territory, people, Constitution and elected president. He described

faced strong opposition from Beijing, for his long-term support for
Taiwan and his moral encouragement to the island after Powell's

second-largest banking group in Japan and the world -- to upgrade its

Mencius' lesson of the day: "When a ruler regards his ministers
as his hands and feet, they regard him as their belly and heart; when
he regards them as dogs and horses, they regard him as a common
citizen; when he regards them as dirt and grass, they regard him as a
robber and enemy."

BEIJING URGED TO AUTHORIZE PROPER PERSON TO NEGOTIATE CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) urged
mainland China Friday to authorize a appropriate person or persons to
negotiate with Taiwan for the opening of direct charter flights
across the Taiwan Strait during the upcoming Chinese New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san made the call during a regular
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the Republic of China government has demonstrated
goodwill and flexibility toward the proposal for carriers from both
sides of the Taiwan Strait to operate direct non-stop charter flights
during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday which will begin Feb. 6,
2005 and runs through Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that neither side would set any political
prerequisite for negotiations about such holiday charter flight
services for the convenience of Taiwan businesspeople operating in
mainland China intending to return home for family reunions, "Chiu
said, adding that the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, would name a proper person or persons to discuss
relevant technical details with Taiwan as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated special charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese New Year period. Such services were not
offered during the 2004 Chinese New Year holiday because Beijing
insisted that mainland carriers be allowed to join such flight
services while declining to negotiate technical details with Taiwan.
The ROC government said that as the opening of two-way, non-stop
cross-strait charter flight services involve exercise of public
authority, prior negotiations are necessary.

ILLEGAL M'LAND CHINESE MURDER SUSPECT CLAIMS HE SHOT PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An illegal mainland Chinese immigrant who
has been locked up since Oct. 21 on suspicions of murdering a local
elected official in Kaohsiung, claimed recently that he was the
shooter in the assassination attempt against President Chen Shui-bian
on the eve of the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang Erjiang -- who had been using a forged Taiwan ID card with
the name Chen Chih-wei -- claimed to prosecutors in the southern
county of Kaohsiung several days ago that he shot at the president
because he was angry at being awakened by the noise of firecrackers
while he was napping in a park near the street in Tainan, southern
Taiwan where the president's campaign motorcade was passing.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that he does not remember how many times he shot at the
president and claimed that he threw the gun into the Tainan Canal
after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Most prosecutors might consider Wang's claims as frivolous
because of the many holes in his story, but some investigators on the
319 special investigative task force found that Wang looks "about 50
percent" like a suspect that the task force has been trying to track
down.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Chen-ni, a spokeswoman for the task force, said at a press
conference in Tainan City Friday that her team does not exclude the
possibility of dredging up the gun that Wang has claimed he dumped in
the Tainan Canal.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said that only solid evidence counts. She added that the 319
task force will subpoena Wang shortly for further questioning about
his shooting story.
</P>
<P>
Wang was arrested in Kaohsiung Oct. 21 on suspicions of shooting
Kuo Ching-hua, chief of the rural township of Yungan, Kaohsiung
County, in May this year. Kuo died of gun wounds in hospital about
one month later.
</P>
<P>
During a recent questioning, Wang claimed that he shot the
president but could not pinpoint where exactly in the Tainan Canal he
dumped the weapon used in the assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigators, Wang first arrived in Taiwan in
early 2002 under an arrangement by a cross-strait "snake head" human
smuggling ring. Within half a year, he was given an ROC passport with
the name of Chen Chih-wei. He then used the passport to exit and
enter Taiwan several times via Chiang Kai-shek International Airport.
The last time he entered Taiwan was in November 2003. Law enforcement
authorities said they believe that Wang was supported by an organized
crime ring in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 319 task force spokeswoman said Friday that two
more men, Wu Cheng-tao and Tsai Ming-che, were recently indicted for
possessing bullets that match the characteristics of the one found at
the scene of the March 19 shooting. So far, five people have been
indicted and 10 more are currently in police custody on similar
charges, Kuo noted.
</P>
<P>
On August 30, officials from the State Public
Prosecutor-General's Office reported that 12 bullets had been found
that were identical in structure with the one found lodged in
President Chen's jacket after he was shot.
</P>
<P>
Kuo also said that after the election-eve shooting, investigators
followed up on more than 3,100 cases regarding violation of
regulations on guns and ammunition. Of these cases, 22 involved
ammunition that match the characteristics of the bullet found in
Chen's jacket, according to Kuo.

PFP LEGISLATOR STABBED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislator Shen Chi-huei of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) required several stitches after being
stabbed in the back of her head and neck Friday, doctors at Taichung
Veterans General Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
Shen, whose injuries are not life-threatening, also suffered a
mild concussion, the doctors said, adding that they will keep her in
hospital for further observation.
</P>
<P>
Shen, who is seeking another term in the year-end legislative
elections, was attending a veterans activity when she was stabbed
from behind with a pair of scissors wielded by Hsu You-san, a
80-year-old veteran.
</P>
<P>
Taichung City Councilwoman Shen Yu-lien, sister of Shen Chi-huei,
said that the veteran had lost his life savings in an investment scam
by a fraud ring and had solicited her sister's assistance without
success.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Shen said in hospital that she bears no ill-will
toward Hsu and forgives him out of consideration of the fact that he
was the victim of a fraud ring.
</P>
<P>
Hsu told Taichung City police during questioning that he had
petitioned Legislator Shen several times for her assistance to get
his money back. He also said that he began to suspect that the
legislator had colluded with the investment company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Shu will face justice for the
stabbing incident, and vowed to step up protection for legislative
candidates, although he added that this doesn't necessarily mean more
police officers will be assigned to such duty.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he regrets the stabbing incident and that
he has instructed Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan to find out how the
incident took place.
</P>
<P>
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, after visiting Shen at the hospital,

TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT BEDROCK OF U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS: VP LU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Relations Act is the bedrock of
relations between Taiwan and the United States, and the U.S. law
stipulates clearly that differences across the Taiwan Strait must be
resolved peacefully, Vice President Annette Lu said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lu invited all parties concerned to return to the Taiwan
Relations Act at a time when widespread anxiety has been aroused in
the country by the recent remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell in Beijing that she said have added confusion to the question
of Taiwan's sovereignty and U.S.-Taiwan relations.
</P>
<P>
Lu called for the people of Taiwan not to panic over Powell's
remarks, which she said do not reflect a change in the U.S. stance
and policy toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The vice president called for her fellow compatriots to realize
that in the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. government does not say
that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while stumping for Legislator Chao Yung-ching
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for the Dec. 11
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
She said that following the controversies stirred up by Powell's
remarks, Washington has reiterated that its policy toward Taiwan
remains unchanged, that it will not pressure Taiwan to reunify with
mainland China, and that the so-called Taiwan issue should be
resolved in a peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
Lu added that although Powell's remarks have hurt the feelings of
the people of Taiwan, they should respond by engaging in some soul
searching about their own ideas and positions on Taiwan's
sovereignty.

PFP SOLICITS SUPPORT FOR PROPOSED DRAFT BILL ON CROSS-STRAIT PEACE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP)
called on the legislative caucuses of the various political parties
Friday to solicit support for its proposed draft bill on cross-Taiwan
Strait peace, but was rejected outright by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP legislative whip, said the progress of
cross-strait exchanges should have the support of all political
parties and that the proposed bill represents an earnest hope of a
contribution to break the cross-strait impasse.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang said that cross-strait talks should
not just be "empty talk" and that a cross-strait peace promotion bill
would serve as a platform for cross-strait exchanges.
</P>
<P>
However, Tsai Huang-liang, the DPP whip in the legislature, said
that the PFP's proposal is "impractical" and "an encroachment on the
right of the executive branch that may also be unconstitutional or
illegal."
</P>
<P>
Instead, he urged the PFP to support a bill authorizing the
Executive Yuan to take on a major arms procurement package from the
United States, saying that only a stable national defense, boosted by
the arms procurement, will lay the solid groundwork for cross-strait
talks.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi said that cross-strait peace and
exchanges should be based on the principle of equal footing and that
the PFP-proposed bill would constrain Taiwan rather than the other
side of the strait.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that cross-strait talks must be based on strength and
not illusion and that the country's self-defense capability should
not be forfeited.
</P>
<P>
"The PFP has to support the arms procurement bill, otherwise
peace is only empty talk," he said.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei said that if the DPP has differences
over the proposed bill, it can propose its "own version of bill."
</P>
<P>
The PFP caucus incurred the ire of the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU), an ally of the DPP, after it failed to call on the TSU caucus.
Chen Chien-ming, TSU legislative whip, rushed to the DPP caucus to
question if the cross-strait peace promotion bill is based on the
stance of "unification, independence or one country on each side of
the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , which is an ally of the PFP,
lent its support to the proposed bill.
</P>
<P>
Huang Teh-fu, KMT legislative whip, said that cross-strait peace
is the common aspiration of all sides and that an insistence on peace
is not capitulation, but allows both sides to have the opportunity
for development.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and the PFP advocate peace and are opposed to war, Huang
said, adding that the passing of the law would be a step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has so far failed in its attempt to put the arms
procurement bill on the agenda for legislative review before the Dec.
11 legislative elections because the opposition parties feel there is
not enough time to review the bill before the elections, as the
legislature is scheduled to go into a one-month recess starting Nov.
10 in preparation for the elections.

ELITE-NURTURING PROJECT EXPECTED TO KICK OFF BY YEAREND: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A project aimed at nurturing high-caliber
intellectuals and technocrats for the country in research institutes
abroad is expected to kick off by the end of this year, a Council of
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Operations of the new elite-building project -- to be jointly
sponsored by the CEPD, the Ministry of Education and the National
Science Council (NSC) -- is expected to begin in December at the
latest to begin accepting applications by Taiwan students hoping to
pursue advanced studies with state funding in research institutes
abroad, mainly the United States, according to CEPD Vice Chairman
Hsieh Fa-ta.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, potential government scholarship winners can
choose their subjects for advanced studies in institutes abroad under
three major research areas -- fundamental sciences, humanistic and
social studies, and national development -- that a guiding committee
of the project has mapped out.
</P>
<P>
Under the three major areas, there will be 12 research fields for
the applicants to choose from. These fields include biotechnology,
image display, digital content, telecom technology, semiconductors,
energy technology, environments and natural disasters, nanotechnology
and cutting-edge materials, international law and politics, as well
as arts and history, Hsieh added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a group of officials and academics, including
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng and NSC Chairman Wu Mao-kun, and
presidents of several leading universities around Taiwan, traveled to
San Francisco last week to meet members of Academia Sinica and
U.S.-based Taiwanese academics for discussions on the elite studying
abroad program.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few valuable solutions were concluded during the meetings
that will serve as guidelines when the project is implemented, Hsieh
said.
</P>
<P>
The program was initiated earlier this year after the government
became aware that there is an ever-growing gap between Taiwan's
educational sector and the industrial sector in terms of quality and
quantity of supplies of high-caliber manpower.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to allow more Taiwan students to seek
advanced studies abroad with government funding in an effort to
reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech, Premier Yu Shyi-kun quoted a research report
by the Council for Cultural Affairs as indicating that Taiwan's
hi-tech industrial sector as a whole has 6,100 openings for various
jobs this year that are still unfilled and that the manpower shortage
is expected to top 10,000 individuals in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that Taiwan's hi-tech industrial sector -- a driving
force pushing Taiwan to become one of the world's economic
powerhouses -- was established and is nurtured by high-caliber
scientists and specialists who returned to Taiwan after obtaining
advanced degrees abroad.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, the number of Taiwan students going
abroad for higher education, particularly to the United States, has
continued to drop, Yu said. This is a situation about which the
government is most concerned, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to government tallies, a total of 13,767 Taiwan
students went to the United States for advanced studies in 2002,
compared with 10,324 students in 2003, marking a whopping decline of
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that there are a variety of factors behind the
decline, including the fact that more and more Taiwan college
graduates continued their studies at Taiwan graduate schools, while
the considerable increase in the numbers of students from mainland
China and South Korea seeking advanced studies in the United States
is another factor adversely affecting the enrollment of students from
Taiwan.

MAINLAND INTEREST RATE HIKE HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON TAIWAN COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China's surprise key interest rate
hikes will not have a large impact on Taiwan businesses operating
there, a market analyst predicted Friday.
</P>
<P>
K. C. Chung, a vice manager at the JIH SUN Securities Investment
Consulting Co. Ltd., said the mainland's decision to increase the
interest rates will only have a slight impact on Taiwan companies,
as a 0.27 percentage point hike is on par with a 0.25 percentage
point raise made by Taiwan's central bank in late September, Chung
said.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China announced a day earlier that it will
adjust its one-year loan and deposit interest rate from 5.31 percent
to 5.58 percent and from 1.98 percent to 2.25 percent, respectively,
</P>
<P>
According to Chung, the mainland's interest rate raises are aimed
at supporting its efforts to curb its overheating economy and a
complementary measure to ease strong pressure on the renminbi to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan company manager said that Taiwan businesses with
operations in mainland China will have to pay more interest on their
loans, but he pointed out that the additional costs will be less
significant than an appreciated renminbi, as many of them are
involved in export-oriented businesses.
</P>
<P>
Academia Sinica researcher Wu Chung-shu and National Chengchi
University Professor Chu Hau-min both said that the mainland move has
no immediate leverage on Taiwan's central bank, which is not expected
to raise interest rates in the short term due to its
higher-than-expected interest rate hike in September.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that an interest rate increase is necessary if the
mainland wants to stem its economic growth rate. The mainland economy
in the third quarter expanded by 9 percent, well exceeding a
government target of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chu contended that a deposit interest rate hike will help lure
foreign capital into the mainland, but will put increasing pressure
on its currency to appreciate. He predicted that the mainland will
raise its interest rates again in the near future to gauge an
acceptable range for the renminbi to gain in value.

EL SALVADOR REAFFIRMS TIES WITH TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Salvadoran President Elias Antonio Saca
assured Taipei Thursday that his government will not switch
recognition to Beijing during his term, following reports that El
Salvador is to study the possibility of forming diplomatic relations
with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Saca emphasized that the friendship between El Salvador and
Taiwan has remained unchanged and that if necessary, he will
telephone President Chen Shui-bian up to clarify the
misunderstanding, according to ROC Ambassador to El Salvador Hou
Ping-fu.
</P>
<P>
It was reported Wednesday that the government of the Central
American nation would "analyze the possibility" of establishing
diplomatic and trade relations with the mainland in response to a
call from a group of Salvadoran business leaders who believe
normalizing ties with Beijing will help Salvadoran goods gain access
to the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Saca and Salvadoran Foreign Minister Francisco Lainez phoned Hou
in person to clarify the reports Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Hou said he had just returned to his residence from the El
Salvador Ministry of Foreign Affairs when the report was published
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hou said he felt at the time that the report was mistaken because
he and Lainez had just been discussing strengthening bilateral
cooperation in terms of agriculture, environmental protection and
career guidance for young people.
</P>
<P>
Although El Salvador is under intense pressure from the private
sector, which is pushing the government to exchange trade offices
with the mainland, diplomatic relations between Taiwan and El
Salvador have remained steady, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to an exchange of visits by the heads of state of
both countries earlier this year, a series of visits to Taiwan by
Salvadoran government officials will take place over the next five
months, Hou added.

FORMER SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT VISITS KAOHSIUNG
</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former South Korean President Kim Young
Sam said Friday he looks forward to seeing enhanced cultural and
commercial exchanges between Taiwan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who is currently on an eight-day visit to Taiwan at the
invitation of President Chen Shui-bian, made the remarks while
meeting with Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh at the municipal hall of the
southern Taiwan port city.
</P>
<P>
Despite a cooling-off in Taiwan-South Korea relations following
Seoul's switching of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing,
which prompted Taipei to cut ties with Seoul Aug. 23, 1992, Kim said
friendship between the two countries has gradually regained steam.
</P>
<P>
"I hope our two countries can continue to expand engagements and
cooperation in various fields for mutual benefit," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hsieh said that throughout history, Taiwan and
Korea have experienced being bullied but they have never bullied
other countries. This similar background has contributed to the
development of friendship between the two countries, Hsieh said,
adding that Kaohsiung has formed sisterhood ties with South Korea's
second-largest city of Busan and maintains close exchanges with
several other South Korean cities.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Hsieh said, average Taiwan people were not familiar
with South Korea but thanks to the popularity here of South Korean
soap operas, Hsieh said, many Taiwan people have become fascinated
with the country.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh lauded Kim for his contributions to South Korea's
democratic development, calling him South Korea's "Mr. Democracy."
</P>
<P>
Kim said South Korea has come a long way liberating its people
from authoritarian rule and building up a liberal democracy. "In the
pursuit of democracy, I consistently fought against armed forces with
courage, self-confidence and perseverance," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's democratization process has been similar to
that of South Korea, Hsieh said he has much to learn from Kim.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Kim toured Kaohsiung Harbor in the company of
Deputy Mayor Yao Kao-chiao. Kim said he was impressed by the port
facilities and by the harbor's outstanding geographic location and
natural conditions that have helped made Kaohsiung into a fine
deep-water port.
</P>
<P>
Kim arrived in Taipei Monday for his fourth visit to Taiwan. In
the past few days, he has met with President Chen and other local
political heavyweights, as well as delivering a speech at National
Chengchi University.

U.S. POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN REMAINS UNCHANGED: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that
U.S. policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged despite recent remarks by
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During interviews with Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite TV and
CNN Monday in Beijing, Powell denied that Taiwan "has sovereignty as
a nation" and referred to the possible development of cross-strait
relations as "peaceful reunification," which is wanted by all parties.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen said Powell's remarks were
the "most harsh" remarks from the United States over the past three
decades and called in Douglas Paal, director of the American
Institute in Taiwan in Taipei, for consultations.
</P>
<P>
The premier reiterated that the consultations show that U.S.
policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged and continues to be based
on the Taiwan Relations Act under which the United States
promises to provide Taiwan with sufficient defensive weapons, and the
"six assurances."
</P>
<P>
The latter means that the United States will not set a date for
ending arms sales to Taiwan, will not hold prior consultations with
mainland China on arms sales to Taiwan, will not play any mediation
role between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, has not agreed to
revise the Taiwan Relations Act, has not altered its position
regarding sovereignty over Taiwan, and will not exert pressure on
Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Powell has also clarified that he should have said cross-strait
"peaceful resolution, " instead of "peaceful reunification, " the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
But the premier also noted that Powell's remarks went out of the
bounds laid out in a briefing U.S. officials gave to Taiwan prior to
his departure for a three-nation visit in Asia last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that senior U.S. officials had briefed a Taiwan
mission before Powell's visit and that he himself read the report but
saw nothing resembling Powell's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that Powell's remarks during the interviews took him "by
surprise" and show that Taiwan should further work on its relations
with the United States.

<P>
When asked why the national security system was not made aware of
Powell's possible remarks beforehand, the premier said "the entire
government, including myself, should review this question."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the premier said that he had not read a report by
world-renowned U.S. forensic expert Henry Lee on the March 19
election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu, either in English or in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Lee submitted his report based partly on forensic studies he made
during a trip to Tainan where the shooting took place in April and
partly on information provided by the Criminal Investigation Bureau,
in late August.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that out of respect for judicial independence,
the Executive Yuan will not interfere with it.
</P>
<P>
He was fielding a question in the Legislative Yuan from
Legislator Huang Chao-shun of the opposition Kuomintang on whether he
had read Lee's report and whether the spirit of the original English
copy was retained in the Chinese translation.

NO COMMENT FROM GUGGENHEIM ON TAICHUNG CITY COUNCIL'S DECISION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  Oct.  28 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official from the New York-based
Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation refused to comment Thursday on a
decision by the Taichung city council to shelve a long-discussed
project to build a Guggenheim branch in the central Taiwan city.
</P>
<P>
The city council began a two-day screening session Wednesday and
was expected to come to a definite decision the following day, but as
many councilors felt that some provisions of the proposed agreement
were unfair to Taiwan, Council Speaker Chang Hung-nien ruled Thursday
that the proposal should be shelved temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Chang also said the city council will ask Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
to attempt to continue negotiating with the Guggenheim Foundation,
based on recommendations by the city council's legal advisers.
</P>
<P>
A staff member of the office of Thomas Krens, executive director
of the Guggenheim Foundation, said the foundation would not comment
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
On whether Hu had contacted Krens to discuss the latest demand by
the councilors that the draft agreement be amended, the staffer said
that even if there was such contact, it would be secret.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of a Taichung branch has been in the works for some
time -- Hu made it one of his major campaign platforms when he ran
for the mayorship in 2002 -- and the mayor went to New York last
month to discuss how to push for the long-delayed international
cooperation project, which has been plagued by problems on how to
finance it, after the government promised Aug. 31 to earmark NT$2
billion (US$58.99 million) in its 2005 budget to help finance the
project.
</P>
<P>
The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation is founded in 1937. Its
primary accomplishment has been the construction of a number of
international museums in New York, Venice, Bilbao, Berlin and Las
Vegas.

PRODUCTION OF PETROCHEMICAL SECTOR TO TOP NT$1.8 TRILLION IN 2004

<P>
The total production of Taiwan's
petrochemical sector is expected to amount to NT$1.8 trillion
(US$53.73 billion) in 2004, which will represent a growth of 27.3
percent over last year, according to a report by the Industry
Technology Intelligence Services (ITIS) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The demand for basic industrial chemicals including ethylene,
polylene and butadiene is estimated at 591.9 metric tons, and that
for aromatics is estimated at 536 metric tons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the combined production of petrochemical intermediates,
synthetic fibers, polymers and petroleum products in the first three
quarters of this year amounted to NT$1.36 trillion, up 31.7 percent
compared with the levels of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Of these products, petrochemical intermediates posted the highest
growth rate at 48.2 percent mainly because the prices of
petrochemical raw materials were rising in tandem with soaring oil
prices, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
On the market outlook for next year, the report predicted that
the margin of profit for CPL, VCM, EG and PTA will expand owing to
strong global demand.

The DP Dietmen's Alliance for Japan-Taiwan Friendship said in a

TAIWAN STUDENTS SEEKING ADVANCED DEGREES IN U.S. FALLS SHARPLY IN 2003

Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Nick Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of Taiwan students applying in
2003 to pursue advanced studies in the United States was the lowest
in eight years, Hsieh Fa-dah, Vice Chairman of Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of students applying for admittance to universities in
the United States in 2003 was 10,324, down 25 percent from 2002,
Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
The enticements of the national defense training and reservation
program and the increasing number of enrollment in graduate schools
at Taiwan's universities dissuaded many students from studying in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Draftees performing military service under the national defense
training and reservation program may pursue advanced studies during
their services, which makes university graduates drop their
willingness to pursue advanced studies abroad, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
If the trend continues, Taiwan's knowledge pool might be drained,
thus resulting in the decline of Taiwan's competitiveness in the
world, Hsieh said. Because of this, CEPD officials will promote an
"elite study abroad program" by earmarking a budget of NT$200 million
(US$5.97 million) every year for those willing to study abroad.

RESTRUCTURED AIR FORCE UNITS COMMISSIONED TO UPGRADE AIR DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restructured air force combat units were
commissioned into service at Hsinchu, Chiayi, Hualien and
Chingchuankang (CCK) air bases around the island Friday as part of
the military's efforts to upgrade its air defense capabilities.
ROC Air Force Commander-in-Chief Gen. Liu Kuei-li presided over a
joint commissioning ceremony for the newly formed "independent
combat squadrons" belonging to the 499 Tactical Jet Fighter Wing at
Hsinchu air base, the 455 Wing at Chiayi air base, the 401 Wing at
Hualien air base, and the 427 Wing at CCK air base.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ROC Air Force General Headquarters said that
except for the "independent combat squadrons," other units of those
wings were not restructured and will remain intact.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the restructuring was aimed at
upgrading command and control efficiency, extending the warplane
pilot service period and thus enhancing their airborne combat
prowess.
</P>
<P>
Air force authorities would not divulge details of the
restructured combat units, saying the "independent combat squadrons'"
structures are "military secrets." Military analysts said the jet
fighter pilots' flight service period will be extended by three to
five years.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous system, jet fighter pilots who had just
matured in flight skills were often transferred to handle ground
staff due to rank promotions work. The phenomenon had exacerbated the
air force's pilot shortage problems. Military sources said the number
of air force pilots has not grown in proportion to the expansion of
the nation's second-generation jet fighters in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chief of the General Staff Lee Tien-yu
proposed a restructuring of air force combat units during his tenure
as air force commander-in-chief to upgrading airborne combat
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The 443 Wing at the Tainan air base began to undergo
restructuring in December 2002 on a trial basis. After the experiment
proved the feasibility of Lee's restructuring proposal, the air force
began an across-the-board restructuring of its combat wings and the
restructured "independent combat squadrons" were formally
commissioned into service Friday.

<P>
The Republic of China government and
private groups have offered aid to help Japanese people affected by
the recent earthquakes in the northeastern Japanese prefecture of
Niigata, Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai said Premier Yu Shyi-kun expressed his concern and
sympathy to Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Koizumi through the ROC
representative office in Japan right after the Niigata prefecture was
shaken by a magnitude 6.8 earthquake and a series of aftershocks last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chen Hung-chi, Taiwan's deputy representative to
Japan paid a visit to the Niigata Prefecture Government Tuesday in
the company of Kazuo Okazawa, president of a pro-Taiwan Japanese
parliamentarians association, to convey President Chen Shui-bian's
and Premier Yu's concern for earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
"Chen Hung-chi also presented 2 million Japanese yen in relief
funds to the Niigata Prefecture Government on behalf of the ROC
government, " Chen Chi-mai said, adding that ROC Representative to
Japan Ko Se-kai will travel to Niigata Oct. 31 to express his concern
for Japanese victims as well as Taiwan expatriates living in the
quake-affected regions.
</P>
<P>
According to the ROC representative office in Japan, there are
about 146 Taiwan expatriates and students in the Niigata area. Only
the home of a Taiwanese physician in the region was partially
damaged, while all other expatriates and students didn't incurred any
losses in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japan had offered various kinds of assistance to
Taiwan when the island's central mountainous region was rattled by
magnitude 7.6 earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999, Chen Chi-mai said the
government has invited major private groups, including the Chinese
National Association of Commerce and Industry, the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, Christian churches and other
charitable organizations, to donate relief goods to be sent to
the Niigata disaster zone.

TAIWAN'S Q3 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS POSTS US$1.855 BILLION SURPLUS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's balance of payments for the third
quarter of this year was about US$1.855 billion, down from both the
Q1 and Q2 levels, a spokesman for the Central Bank of China (CBC)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing the newest statistics compiled by the CBC, the spokesman
said that the figure represents a fall from the Q1 level of US$21.1
billion, a historical quarterly high. It is also smaller than the Q2
level of US$3.05 billion, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The CBC official attributed the lackluster performance for the
July-September period to a smaller net influx of foreign capital due
*o a sluggish stock market and mediocre growth in the foreign trade
surplus registered by the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Capital outflows in the third quarter were quite obvious compared
to the Q2 capital movement, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tallies published that same day by the Bureau of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs show that
the number of Taiwan's foreign trade companies grew by 123 percent
over the past decade, with their business volumes expanding by an
average 136 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the BOFT statistics, there were 88,978 foreign trade
companies in 1993 in Taiwan, with the number rising to 109,446 in
2003. Each company did business worth more than US$1.82 million on
average in 1993, with the average value increasing to over US$2.47
million.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, mainland China emerged as one of Taiwan's
leading export markets.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, Taiwan's trade with the
mainland totaled US$39.646 billion, accounting for 17.9 percent of
the country's total foreign trade and up by 1.1 percent over the year
earlier level, BOFT tallies show.

New York Times: Sharp increase in early
voting alters campaign

State election officials around the country said on Thursday that
there had been a surge in early voting this year, with people lining
up in numbers so large that some analysts predict that one-fifth of
presidential ballots will be cast before Nov. 2. The early voting
trend is sharply altering the home stretch calculus of campaign
strategists, affecting where candidates are sent and money is spent
in the final days. And it has turned the get-out-the-vote drives that
are usually reserved for the final hours of the campaign into a
half-month marathon.

Wall Street Journal: Big dealers pressure car makers to cut
production

Some of the biggest auto-retailing groups in the United States,
citing higher interest cost and thinner margins in their new-car
businesses, say they no longer will crowd their lots with slow-
selling cars and trucks to help Detroit's auto makers avoid
production cuts. General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are already
making plans to cut overtime or lay off temporarily thousands of
workers to avoid a repeat of this summer's inventory glut. Industry
executives expect even more cuts.

ORAL PROCEEDING CLOSED IN DISPUTE OVER TRUTH COMMISSION

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The oral proceeding in the dispute over the
constitutionality of the Truth Investigation Commission closed
Friday, and the Council of the Grand Justices said they will hand
down a decision at a yet unspecified date.
</P>
<P>
The oral proceeding was the last step in the hearing of
the dispute in which the lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) asked the Council of the Grand Justices to
annul a statute proving for the formation of the Truth Investigation
Commission on the ground of unconstitutionality.
</P>
<P>
The council is obliged to hand down a decision in the form of an
interpretation of the Constitution within two months.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's proceeding, which was the second day of arguments
that began on Wednesday and recessed on Thursday, both the applicant,
DPP Legislator You Ching, and the representatives of the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan, which passed the
controversial statute, including Koumintang Legislator Kau Yu-jen and
several others who gave opinions as friends of the court.
</P>
<P>
You Ching argued that by creating the Truth Investigation
Commission, the legislature has expanded its role by usurping the
power of crime investigation which was shared by the Ministry of
Justice under the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan.
</P>
<P>
His argument was echoed by friend of the court Tsai Tsung-chen,
who said the legislature has infringed on the power of the Executive
Yuan and is therefore inappropriate under constitutional theory.
</P>
<P>
However, another court participant, Chen Ai-er, said the Control
Yuan, whose members are appointed by the president with the approval
of the Legislative Yuan, is no longer a representative office of
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Legislative Yuan has no power to investigate
irregularities in the government even if it reflects public opinion,
and this is a defect in the current Constitution, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Kau Yu-jen said the statute enacted by the Legislative Yuan had
some of its articles approved unanimously by the lawmakers, including
those from the DPP, and it would be ridiculous to called the whole
statute unconstitutional and invalid.
</P>
<P>
Another representative of the Legislative Yuan, KMT lawmaker Chen
Ching-hsing defended the legality of the statute claiming that every
article in it had been thoroughly debated at the Legislative Yuan
before enactment.

LIEN URGES SUPPORT FOR KMT LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATES

<TEXT>
<P>
Lien Chan of the opposition Kuomintang
urged voters Saturday to cast their ballots for the right people in
the year-end legislative elections so that the country can have a
brighter future.
</P>
<P>
Lien made the remarks when he attended the inauguration of the
campaign office of KMT legislative candidate Chu Chun-hsiao in Taipei
County to lend support to the former National Assembly member in the
Dec. 11 elections.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the nation faces five problems, according to Lien.
First and foremost is its national identity, he said, adding that the
name of the Republic of China needs no change and neither does the
Constitution, as has been advocated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
He also noted that both sides of the Taiwan Strait need peaceful
relations and he advocated the signing of a 50-year peace agreement
with the other side of the strait.
</P>
<P>
The democratic development in Taiwan needs further strengthening,
Lien said, adding that the executive branch needs to maintain
neutrality, while the judicial system has to have independent status
and there should be freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
The various ethnic groups should be able to live in harmony and
equality and there should be no incitement of ethnic rivalry in the
election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Last and not least, Lien stressed that Taiwan has been seriously
marginalized in the international community and that it has been shut
out of major international and economic organizations, which he said
is a grave warning signal for the country.

FORMER PRESIDENT TAKES POWELL'S WORDS AS ENCOURAGEMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwanese people should take U.S.
Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent remark on the status of
Taiwan as an encouragement for them to continue to strive for the
country, former President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lee was referring to Powell's comment in Beijing earlier in the
week that Taiwan "does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation."
</P>
<P>
Lee, who advocates drafting a new constitution for the country,
said Powell's remark should not be taken as a threat but as
motivation spurring the people of Taiwan to fight for and take care
of their country.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "a lie" the interpretation from some quarters
that Powell's remark indicates that the United States is abandoning
Taiwan to engage mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Lee spoke on the issue while addressing the opening of the
campaign headquarters of Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Hsu
Teng-kung in Sanchung, Taipei County. Hsu is running for re-election
in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the people of Taiwan must develop a "Taiwan
consciousness" in order to build up the country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his support for a controversial proposal on the
elimination of questions related to the mainland from the section on
"domestic history and geography" for civil service examinations,
saying that it is very improper for Taiwan civil servants to know
nothing about the history of their own country.
</P>
<P>
Lee repeated his claim that the "Republic of China" does not
exist and urged the "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and People First Party to stop "deceiving themselves."
</P>
<P>
He said the Legislative Yuan, which is controlled by the
"pan-blue alliance, " has become the main origin of chaos in the
country and the biggest obstacle hampering Taiwan's democratic
development.
</P>
<P>
He called on the voters to support candidates with "Taiwan
consciousness" and allow them to take control of the legislature so
as to bring stability to the country.

KMT STUDYING BALLOT ALLOCATION STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the crucial year-end legislative
elections approaching, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Saturday it is studying its strategy for ballot allocation, while its
ally, the People First Party (PFP) called for an overall
consideration of ballot allocation among candidates from the
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP.
</P>
<P>
Lin Fong-cheng, KMT secretary-general, said the KMT will first
study the guidelines for ballot allocation and then take into
consideration the factors of each candidate and constituency.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the KMT has not employed this strategy before -- a
method at which the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) excels
and has used to repeated success, Lin said related operations should
be ready in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the party will consider the situation of each
constituency when coordinating with the candidates on ballot
allocation. In places where such a strategy is not feasible, the
party will pool its strength to help prop up struggling candidates.
</P>
<P>
The two methods will be used simultaneously, Lin said, with the
main purpose being to ensure that as many KMT candidates as possible
win a legislative seat.
</P>
<P>
"Ballot allocation will give priority consideration to KMT
candidates and will not consider candidates from other parties or the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) for the time being," Lin added.
</P>
<P>
The KMT does not want to place too much emphasis on "political
superstars" that have more votes than needed to win, but will try to
salvage those who are struggling on the election threshold through
the ballot allocation strategy, he added.
</P>
<P>
But his remarks immediately raised the ire of PFP Chairman James
Soong.
</P>
<P>
Soong said that both the KMT and the PFP need to perform well so
that the "pan-blue alliance" can command a majority in the
Legislative Yuan. The scale of the ballot allocation should include
all alliance members, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Even if all the KMT nominees are elected, this will amount to a
little more than 70 seats, and only if more than 40 PFP candidates
are also elected will the "pan-blue alliance" have the needed
majority in the 225-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the PFP has been restrained in its nomination
for overall consideration, although it will inevitably affect the PFP
at-large seats, which are awarded in proportion to the number of
ballots garnered by each political party.
</P>
<P>
Lin later responded to Soong's remarks by saying that "we of
course have the 'pan-blue alliance' in mind, " adding that the KMT
will also help PFP candidates who are struggling.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the KMT can stump for PFP candidates in Nantou in
central Taiwan, but "in fact, the PFP can also take the initiative to
allot ballots, " citing the example of PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei of
Taipei County, who is far ahead of his closest rival in Taipei County
according to several polls.
</P>
<P>
"The urgent task now is to communicate with the
'pan-blue' candidates around the island," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
A record number of 387 candidates have registered for the Dec.
11 elections, among which, 92 were nominated by the DPP,
followed by the KMT with 74, the PFP with 41, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union with 30 and the NPSU with 26.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian, in his capacity as DPP chairman, has
vowed to take 100 seats in the legislature to ensure a comfortable
majority of the "pan-green camp" which includes DPP ally the TSU.

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu called Saturday
for solidarity among the Taiwan people amid the increasing threat
from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the appeal during a visit to Taichung County to stump for
two ruling Democratic Progressive Party candidates for the year-end
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that Taiwan has faced many challenges during recent
years, such as Beijing's deployment of more than 600 missiles aimed
at Taiwan and its increasing military buildup. All these reflect the
Beijing's ambition to include Taiwan as part of its territory, she
added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the mainland might become the new superpower after
its organization of the 2008 Olympic Games and the 2010 World Expo in
Shanghai, which could enable it to directly challenge the power of
the United States and take Taiwan, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
The anxiety of the Taiwan people has increased further after U.S.
Secretary of State Colin Powell said recently that "Taiwan does not
enjoy sovereignty as a nation," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
She rebutted Powell's remarks, saying that Taiwan is an
independent sovereign country and that the "Taiwan problem" should be
resolved peacefully through the will of its people.
</P>
<P>
Noting that these coming few years will be a crucial time for
Taiwan's future, Lu urged the public to show solidarity and support
the government.
</P>
<P>
On constitutional reforms, Lu urged the lawmakers that will be
elected in the Dec. 11 legislative elections to engineer a new
constitution that fits the island's development.
</P>
<P>
On the topic of environmental protection, Lu said that in
addition to the devastating earthquake of 1999, Taiwan has faced
frequent typhoons and consequent mudslides, which she claimed are
"due to global warming." She called for new and comprehensive
planning for land preservation.

60% OF YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six out of 10 young people currently working
want to start their own businesses, while 66 percent also said they
could be successful within one year, according to the results of a
survey unveiled Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by www.9999.com.tw -- an online human
resources company -- between Oct. 11-26 among respondents aged under
28 via e-mail, sent out 20,000 questionnaires and collected 8,363
effective samples with a margin of error of 1.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the economic recovery, 18.7 percent said they are ready
to start their own businesses, while 41.4 percent said they are
mulling the idea, showing that 60 percent of the respondents want to
be their own boss, up six percentage points from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The reasons most cited for wanting their own business is "to make
a fortune" (55.6 percent) , followed by "do things one is interested
in" (44.1 percent), and "have the technical skills or specialties to
start own business" (38.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
In order to "do things one is interested in," 19.1 percent of the
polled said that they would accept a net profit of less than
NT$100,000 (US$2,990) a month, while 3.7 percent said they would be
happy "as long as they are earning money."
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the respondents are most afraid of
four things when starting their own businesses: patrons do not like
their service; earning are not coming in a stable way; insufficient
business information; and poor location.
</P>
<P>
Asked how long they expect to be successful, the answer of
between six months and one year accounted for the most at 36.5
percent, followed by three months to six months (24.2 percent). 5.6
percent predicted with confidence that they could reach their goal in
three months, according to the survey results.

<P>
A legislator from the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) expressed displeasure Saturday with the
Institute of Linguistics of Academia Sinica for listing its budget
for Taiwanese language or Hoklo research for next year as "nil."
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chien Lin Huei-chun threatened that if the institute
does not redress the issue, the legislature will cut all its research
funds except those for the research of the Hakka and aboriginal
languages during a review of the institute's budget.
</P>
<P>
She said she is opposed to the institute' appropriation of up to
NT$100 million (US$2.99 million) per year to study obscure languages
such as Hsi Hsia language which was spoken in today's Inner Mongolia
and Gansu areas in mainland China during the Sung Dynasty, and a
little-known tongue spoken in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
"These languages have nothing to do with the great majority of
Taiwan people, " she said, and the institute should be taken to task
for making use of taxpayers' money in that way.
</P>
<P>
As the nation's highest research institute is financed by the
taxpayer, she said, it should study the major languages in Taiwan,
especially those languages that have been listed for study in schools
-- namely Hoklo, Hakka and aboriginal languages -- and it should also
focus on basic research into the mother tongues of the various ethnic
groups in Taiwan, as well as the connection between local languages

BEIJING SUPPRESSION AT NUREMBERG SHOW COUNTERPRODUCTIVE: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China's suppression of the Taiwan
delegation at the ongoing Nuremberg International Invention
Exhibition (NIIE) in Germany is counterproductive to relations across
the Taiwan Strait, a diplomatic official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA),
was commenting on the mainland delegation's repeated demand at the
Oct. 27 opening ceremony that the Republic of China flag be removed
from the NIIE venue. A clash between delegates from the two sides
almost broke out at the exhibition site over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the ROC's representative office in Munich had helped the
Taiwan delegation to negotiate with the NIIE authorities and that the
organizing committee finally reached a decision that none of the
participating countries would be allowed to hoist their national
flags at the venue.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the NIIE is a non-governmental international event,
Lu said mainland China's suppression of Taiwan's equal participation
in international activities, regardless of governmental or
non-governmental in nature, has gravely hurt Taiwan people's feelings
and is counterproductive to the improvement of cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
Lu said MOFA staff in Munich have been assisting the Taiwan
delegation in fighting against the mainland's repressive act and that
he himself has kept close contact with Chou Hsiu-chen, chairwoman of
the Child Welfare League Foundation, who is a staff member of the
Taiwan delegation to the annual invention exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"The NIIE decision to remove the flags of all participating
countries was the result of the MOFA staff's hard work, " Lu said.
"Mainland China's suppressive act was not unexpected. We were well
prepared and our top priority is to protect our right to
participate."

As to a report that the mainland delegation had pressured the
NIIE organizers to ban Taiwan journalists from covering the event, Lu

the MOFA has worked out response strategies.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed
Saturday his campaign promise to include a special chapter on the
rights of indigenous people in the new constitution that he plans to
introduce in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that he signed a document on "the new
partnership between the aborigines and the Taiwanese government" with
tribal representatives on Orchid Island during the run-up to the 2000
presidential election and promised to set up a special chapter on the
issue in the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the aborigines are the earliest settlers of Taiwan and
that they must enjoy dignity and hope in order to make Taiwan
dignified and hopeful.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the government has proposed various
projects and legislation to realize the concept of a "quasi
nation-to-nation" partnership between the aborigines and government,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
These include a project aimed at restoring the traditional
territories of aboriginal tribes, which will involve land surveying
and mapping of the traditional distribution of indigenous people, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The president said representatives of various aboriginal tribes
have participated in drawing the map, which he said symbolizes the
exercise of self-determination of the indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will continue to work to complete the
rights of the indigenous people by realizing their natural autonomy,
right to land and self-government.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while participating in a briefing held in
Pingtung on the aboriginal tribal territories survey project.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, while attending the 40th anniversary celebration
of the Tainan Woman's College of Arts and Technology, Chen spoke of
his wish to see a woman becoming the head of one of the five
government branches, and even president, in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the performance of Taiwanese women is the
20th-best among more than 190 countries around the world and that
promoting equality of the sexes has been one of the main policies of
his government.

<P>
The chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip
maker, encouraged his staff Saturday to adhere to the company's three
core principles in the face of a cyclical slowdown and keen
competition in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Morris Chang said at the TSMC sports fair for workers that only
by maintaining the company's technology, manufacturing process and
customer service in the best possible shape can the company keep its
leading position in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chang was kicking off the annual workers' games at the TSMC
headquarters in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, which drew over 10,000 TSMC
workers their families.
</P>
<P>
In his address at the opening ceremony, Chang noted that TSMC's
revenue for the third quarter of this year reached NT$69.74 billion
(US$2.09 billion) , with a net income for the three-month period
hitting NT$27.93 billion, both figures representing the highest on
record since the semiconductor foundry's establishment in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the CEO said, the company is expected to see an annual
revenue of more than NT$250 billion for the year, and over NT$90
billion in net income after tax in the first three quarters of the
year.
</P>
<P>
At the workers fair, a group of workers and employees from TSMC's
Songjiang factory in Shanghai, mainland China, drew a great deal of
attention. The factory is the first investment project of its kind by
a Taiwan company in mainland China to be permitted by the Taiwan
government. It did not enter mass production until the third quarter
of this year, according to the TSMC.

MEDICAL GROUP TO RAISE FUNDS FOR JAPANESE QUAKE VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Foundation of Medical Professionals
Alliance in Taiwan (FMPAT) launched a fund-raising campaign Saturday
as part of its efforts to help Japanese people affected by recent
earthquakes in Niigata Prefecture in northeastern Japan.
</P>
<P>
FMPAT Chairman Wu Shu-min, who is also a national policy adviser
to the president, said the fund-raising campaign is aimed at
expressing the Taiwan people's concern for the earthquake victims and
gratitude for Japan's pass assistance to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to raising at least NT$5 million in the next
week or two to help with Japan's post-disaster relief work," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that Japan is richer and more advanced than Taiwan,
Wu said the planned donation is primarily moral support to express
Taiwan's goodwill toward the Japanese people. Taipei's Jen Chi
Hospital, where Wu works, has decided to donate NT$1 million, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting recent statements by Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun
Chen, Wu said Taiwan's annual foreign aid accounts for a marginal
0.07 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) , far below the
U.N.-proposed 0.7 percent of the GDP standard.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Wu went on, Taiwan should be more active in
fulfilling its international obligations as a member of the global
village now that the nation has become the world's 18th-largest
economy.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said a day earlier that the ROC
government has extended condolences and sympathy to Japan over the
recent earthquake disaster.
</P>
<P>
"Premier Yu Shyi-kun expressed his concern and sympathy to
Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Koizumi through the ROC representative
office in Japan right after Niigata Prefecture was shaken by a
magnitude 6.8 earthquake and a series of aftershocks last Saturday, "
Chen Chi-mai said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chen Hung-chi, Taiwan's deputy representative to
Japan, paid a visit to the Niigata Prefecture authorities Tuesday in
the company of Kazuo Okazawa, president of a pro-Taiwan Japanese
parliamentarians association, to convey President Chen Shui-bian's
and Premier Yu's concern for the earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
"Chen Hung-chi also presented 2 million yen in relief funds to
the Niigata prefecture government on behalf of the ROC government, "
Chen Chi-mai said, adding that ROC Representative to Japan Ko Se-kai
will travel to Niigata Oct. 31 to express his concern for the quake
victims, including Taiwan expatriates living in the quake-affected
regions.
</P>
<P>
According to the ROC representative office in Japan, there are
about 146 Taiwan expatriates and students in the Niigata area.
However, only the home of one Taiwanese physician in the region was
partially damaged, while none of the other expatriates or students
incurred any losses.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japan offered various kinds of assistance to Taiwan
when the island's central mountainous region was devastated by a
magnitude 7.6 earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999, Chen Chi-mai said the
government has invited major private groups, including the Chinese
National Association of Commerce and Industry, the Buddhist
Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, Christian churches and other
charitable organizations, to donate relief goods to be sent to the
Niigata disaster zone in the near future.

The Construction and Planning Agency under
the Ministry of the Interior said Saturday it is reviewing a project
on natural environment protection of the coastal areas of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Agency officials noted that Taiwan is surrounded by sea with
diverse biological and landscape resources along its coastal areas,
and said that management and protection of these resources will
ensure their sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the Ministry of the Interior set up 12 coastal
protection areas, including the mouth of the Tamshui River, the coast
around Kenting, and the Northeast Coast, between 1984 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the agency started to review Taiwan's coastal areas
in 2001 in three stages and it is expected that the third stage will
be completed by the middle of next year, making it possible for
planning, management and conservation of the country's coast.
</P>
<P>
The officials expect that the completion of the environment and
biology survey will help establish a comprehensive information
databank and allow mapping of major wetland and coral shelf areas so
tangible measures can be worked out to protect and manage the
valuable coastal resources.

<P>
The nation's top health official said
Saturday that the rigorous implementation of a family doctor patient
referral project will contribute to the sustainable development of
the national health insurance system.
</P>
<P>
Department of Health Minister Chen Chien-jen made the remarks
when he attended an activity to promote awareness of the project to
integrate family doctors into the medical care system sponsored by
the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).
</P>
<P>
The BNHI has in recent years promoted the project, hoping that
with family doctors referring patients to the appropriate hospitals,
it will end the habit Taiwan people have of visiting one hospital
after another when they have the slightest discomfort because of the
cheap and convenient service under the current health insurance
program or of visiting large medical centers for minor health
problems, which has been the major reason for the depletion of the
valuable medical resources.
</P>
<P>
"A good family doctor can keep a record of all the health
problems of his patients," Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There were 223 community medical groups in operation as of
September, provide the best possible medial care for all the families
in their communities, he said, adding that he hopes that everyone
will develop the habit of going first to their family doctor when
they feel unwell.
</P>
<P>
The project refers to between five and 10 grassroots clinics in
the same community forming a community medical care network by
working with regional hospitals in their areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
Legislator Lee Chen-nan of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the military Saturday to
phase out the ensigns currently flown by the nation's naval ships and
marine forces, which he said do not reflect their nationality.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Lee
claimed that the ensign flown at the stern of Taiwan's warships
closely resembles the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) party flag and
that the marine ensign looks very like mainland China's "red star"
national flag.
</P>
<P>
"As these ensigns were adopted during KMT rule, they reflect the
party-state and Chinese ideological thinking prevalent at the time.
Now that Taiwan has evolved into a liberal democracy, those outdated
ensigns, which do not feature any trace of Taiwan, should be phased
out," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Ministry of National Defense hold a
public contest to solicit new designs for the naval and marine
ensigns. In his view, Lee said, the new flags should be designed in
line with the principles of professionalism and should highlight
Taiwan's unique national identity as opposed to that of China, in
order to boost military service members' morale and patriotism.

MND PLANS NEW WARPLANES DEPLOYMENT BETWEEN 2020-2035
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
come up with a plan to deploy a new generation of warplanes between
2020 and 2035, military sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the acquisition and deployment of
new-generation jet fighters will be carried out after the NT$610.8
billion arms procurement project is completed over the next 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The NT$610.8 billion arms procurement budget bill, which is
pending legislative approval, will cover the cost of purchasing eight
diesel-powered submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft and six PAC II Patriot anti-missile batteries from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
According to a three-to-one combat power ratio, the sources
said, the offensive side would certainly win in case the assault force
is three times that of the defensive side; the defensive side would
certainly win in case the combat power ratio falls below 1.5-to-one;
and the result is uncertain when the ratio is two-to-one.
</P>
<P>
MND officials said if the NT$610.8 billion arms procurement
package fails to clear the legislature, the mainland China-Taiwan
combat power ratio would be 1.46 to 1 between 2006 and 2012, and
the ratio could widen to 2.18 to 1 between 2013 and 2019; and the
ratio would become 2.8 to 1 between 2020 and 2035. In terms of the
three-to-one ratio, mainland China's determination to invade
Taiwan could become firmer during the 2020-2035 period.
</P>
<P>
But if the critical arms procurement project can proceed
smoothly, the officials said, the combat power ratio could maintain
at 1.46 to 1 between 2006 and 2012 as Taiwan will take delivery of
the Kidd-class destroyers during this period. And the ratio would
decline to 1.24 to 1 between 2013 and 2019 with the deployment of
weapons acquired from the new arms procurement package. After that,
the officials said, Taiwan must begin purchasing and deploying a new
generation of jet fighters to maintain its defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"If we can complete deployment of new warplanes between 2020 and
2035, the combat power ratio would be about 1.67 to 1. And this
scenario could help deter mainland China from mounting an attack on
Taiwan," said an MND official.

In a new videotape televised Friday, Osama
bin Laden made a direct, formal address to the
American people, saying that the best way for
Americans to avoid a repeat of the attacks on
Sept. 11, 2001, was to stop threatening Muslims'
security. The videotape was first broadcast on
Al Ja zeera, the Arabic-language satellite

TAIPEI TERRY FOX RUN FOR CANCER RESEARCH RAISES NEARLY NT$3 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 2004 Taipei Terry Fox Run was held
Sunday, successfully raising nearly NT$3 million (US$89,820) for
cancer research in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It was the 10th year that the Terry Fox Run was held in Taipei to
commemorate the late Canadian Terry Fox, who raised cancer awareness
in his country by attempting to run across Canada. The run raises
funds for cancer research and prevention.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 people, including some 1,000 foreign nationals,
took part in the run, which featured a three-kilometer and a
six-kilometer run.
</P>
<P>
Participants donating NT$300 or more received a Terry Fox Run
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the start of the run, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou,
who has been director of the organizing committee of the Terry Fox
Charity Run Competition in Taipei for 10 years, exhorted the people
of Taiwan to remember Terry Fox -- a young Canadian athlete who lost
his right leg to bone cancer but tried to run across North America --
and try to emulate his courage and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
Fox, who had his leg amputated in 1976 at the age of 17, began
his cross-Canada run in 1980 with a prosthetic leg, asking every
Canadian to donate one Canadian dollar for cancer research. He
accomplished his goal before dying of cancer in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who visited the headquarters of the Terry Fox Foundation in
Toronto in August 2003, said that whenever he is distressed, he
thinks about Terry Fox and regains his inner strength.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he feels very proud that the number of Taipei residents
participating in the Terry Fox Run is the fifth-highest in the world,
and the amount of money raised through the runs has been the
seventh-highest in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the annual run, which started at the Taipei City
Hall plaza, will be donated to the Cancer Research Foundation of
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Terry Fox Run, originated in Canada in 1980, has become a
worldwide event with over 1.3 million people from more than 50
countries participating.

DIVISION OF SUPPORT IN TSU AND DPP CAMPAIGNS GOOD STRATEGY: DPP WHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and former
President Lee Teng-hui should coordinate their campaign appearances
for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) for the Dec. 11 legislative elections to
better cover the most constituencies, Legislator Tsai Huang-liang,
DPP caucus whip at the Legislative Yuan said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The TSU, which is made up of political followers of Lee, firmly
supports the DPP in the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, said Tsai,
President Chen, who duals as DPP chairman, can stump for TSU
candidates if the situation and timing is suitable.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if TSU candidates want Premier Yu Shyi-kun to campaign
for them, Tsai said he was sure that Yu would be more than willing
to do so.
</P>
<P>
Tsai added that the best strategy would be for former President
Lee to campaign for those DPP candidates whose followers are most
closely enamored with Lee.
</P>
<P>
Some TSU candidates have called for efforts to be made to more
evenly distribute the share of possible votes for both the TSU and
the DPP to optimize the potential number of seats for each in the
legislature, to which Tsai said that this was possible, but a
strategy best deployed in areas where the two parties' supporters are
already spread thin.
</P>
<P>
Since the DPP is vying for a simple majority at the Legislative
Yuan, the number of seats the DPP wins is much more important than
the number of ballots any individual DPP candidate can garner, Tsai
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 378 candidates will compete for 176 seats in the
Legislative Yuan in the Dec. 11 elections, with 49 other seats to be
appointed by political parties in proportion with their share of
votes they win in the elections.

319 SHOOTING REPORT WILL BE MADE PUBLIC IN DUE TIME: HENRY LEE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los Angeles,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By L.S. Chu and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's law enforcers will make
public the entire contents of the report regarding the presidential
election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and the vice
president when they feel the time is right, U.S.-based forensic
scientist Henry Lee said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who was asked by the Taiwan authorities to help examine the
attempted assassination site and the two bullets found there,
delivered his report to the Taiwan authorities on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he guesses that Taiwan investigators have yet to make
the report public because they themselves have not obtained enough
evidence.
</P>
<P>
"If the report is publicized, it may scare away suspects or lead
to further destruction of evidence," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee led a team to Taiwan in April to examine the wounds of
President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu, inspect the scene of
the shooting and tour the hospital where the president and the vice
president were taken for medical treatment in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks after delivering a speech on his life in
America in Rosemead, a city near Los Angeles, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He was asked by reporters his opinion on why the Taiwan
authorities have not released the full results of his report more
than two months after it was presented to Taiwan's State Public
Prosecutor-General Ru Jen-fa prior to Ru's retirement in September.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that he suggested to the Taiwan authorities that an
independent investigation committee be established in Taiwan to
investigate into all matters surrounding the election-eve shooting.
</P>
<P>
He added that members of the independent investigation committee
should come from parties across the political spectrum in Taiwan and
all the material in the report should be reviewed by completely
neutral individuals before further investigations begin.
</P>
<P>
Lee reiterated that the way to crack the March 19 shooting case
is to find the gun, believed to be a remodeled handgun, or the
underground gunsmith where the weapon was made, or find the gunman
who fired the two shots.
</P>
<P>
He said that he arrived at the scene in Tainan, southern Taiwan,
April 9, almost 20 days after the shooting and, therefore, had
difficulty reconstructing the scene.
</P>
<P>
As a forensic expert, Lee said his job is to reconstruct the
scene and find as many clues as possible, not to crack the case.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Lee shed no new light on the case, in which little
headway has been made with no major leads and no arrests after seven
months. He said in the report that the president's injury to the
abdomen was caused by a bullet and that the bullets retrieved were
not used in regular handguns.
</P>
<P>
The most significant finding in his draft report was the special
"tool marks" on a shell casing found at the scene. Lee suggested in
the report that Taiwan law enforcement officers continue to
aggressively search for and seize all illegal firearms in the country
and "examine and compare all the guns."
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party has insinuated that the shooting was staged to
win President Chen sympathy votes in the bitterly contested election.
Chen beat his rival, Lien Chan of the KMT, by a slim margin.

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's first elementary school for
aboriginal people, established during the Japanese colonial period,
will turn 100 in a few days.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony is scheduled to be held at Tah Pang Elementary School
near Mt. Ali in Chiayi County Nov. 4 to celebrate the 100th birthday
of the school established by the Japanese in 1905 to provide
education to children of the Taiwanese timber workers who felled
high-valued Taiwan teak to be shipped to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Most of the school was destroyed by an earthquake in 1989 and new
buildings were added until 1991, according to Pu Chung-yung, the
principal of the school.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the school runs six classes in six elementary school
levels for 108 students. More than 90 percent of the school's
students have been children of the Tsou tribe, one of the smallest
groups among Taiwan's nine mountain-dwelling aboriginal tribes.
</P>
<P>
The school has strived to conserve the language of the Tsou
people and their culture, which, like most of the other aboriginal
tribes in Taiwan, are gradually dying out, Pu said.

TAIWAN-MAINLAND TRADE CONTINUES GROWING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bilateral Taiwan-mainland trade in the
first eight months of this year totaled US$39.646 billion, up by 38.5
percent over the previous year's level, according to the latest
government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) show that the figure accounts
for 17.9 percent of the country's overall foreign trade for the
January-August period.
</P>
<P>
During the eight-month period, Taiwan exports to mainland China
hit US$29.311 billion, or 25.9 percent of the country's total
outbound shipments -- a 1.7 percentage point growth over the
year-earlier level. Mainland exports to Taiwan stood at US$10.335
billion, making up 9.6 percent of the country's total inbound
shipments -- a 1.3 percent increase year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan enjoyed a surplus of US$18.976 billion in trade with the
mainland, up by 23.9 percent compared to the year-earlier mark.
</P>
<P>
Major items among Taiwan exports to mainland China (including
Hong Kong) are electrical engineering equipment and parts,
opto-electronics, machinery, steel, chemicals and man-made fibers,
while prime inbound shipments from the mainland are cement, aluminum,
chemicals, electrical engineering facilities and parts and machinery
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics made public by mainland customs authorities,
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea were the mainland's top three trading
partners in the January-August period. The United States came in
fourth, followed by Germany, Malaysia, Singapore, Russia, Hong Kong
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Except for imports from Hong Kong, which grew by 2.2. percent,
those from other countries and areas all had double-digit expansion.
</P>
<P>
With an economic growth rate running at more than 9 percent per
year now, mainland China is the main engine of the world economy and
also a strong underpinner of international oil and commodity prices.

LEGISLATORS ARGUE OVER MERITS, DRAWBACKS OF U.S. ARMS PROCUREMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The military balance of power across the
Taiwan Strait will tip in China's favor next year and Taiwan will
have to acquire advanced defensive weapon systems to counter this
situation, Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party claimed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a recent U.S. Pentagon report indicating that "the threat
to Taiwan will become critical in the 2005 to 2010 timeframe, " Lee
said this is a major reason the U.S. administration has been
pressuring Taiwan to invest in missile defenses and anti-submarine
weaponry, adding that the implementation of the special arms
procurement program is imperative.
</P>
<P>
Under the NT$610.8 billion (US$18.28 billion) program, the
Ministry of National Defense plans to buy eight diesel-powered
submarines, 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six new Patriot
anti-missile batteries and associated PAC-3 interceptor missiles.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that no legislator, including himself, is qualified to
judge whether the cost for the defensive weapons is too high or not,
since legislators are not professional arms dealers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same television talk show where Lee made his
remarks, Legislator Lin Yu-fang from the opposition People First
Party said that he personally does not oppose the special arms
procurement package, but NT$610.8 billion is an astronomically high
amount.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan already has a debt of NT$11 trillion, Lin said
that going further into the red because of the arms purchases and
given the proposed NT$500 billion budget for the five-year national
development project, citizens will have to shoulder a national debt
that amounts to about NT$500,000 per person.
</P>
<P>
Leaving such massive debts as a legacy to our children and
grandchildren is immoral and irresponsible, Lin said, adding that the
price to be paid the United States for the arms procurements needs to
be reconsidered.

SOCIAL ACTION URGED TO BLOCK GOVERNMENT ARMS PROCUREMENT: ACTIVISTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scholars and social activists spoke out
Sunday advocating the formation of an alliance to protest what they
described as an incorrect government policy regarding military
procurements.
</P>
<P>
Prominent figures from the private sector, such as poet Chan Che
and Professor Chu Yun-peng, issued the call at a news conference.
They urged the public to join forces with them to block the
government's plan to purchase weapons from the United States with a
special budget of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion).
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the government's poor policy is much more
devastating than corruption and that such a situation is increasingly
taking shape in Taiwan, they called on people from all walks of life
to back the alliance to try to counter the government's wrongheaded
policy.
</P>
<P>
They cited some countries in the Caribbean and Latin America as
examples and warned that buying large amounts of weapons from foreign
countries at the cost of the people's benefit will only lead to
economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
The government's flip-flop on the issue of the Fourth Nuclear
Power Plant cost the nation's coffers NT$74 billion, they said,
adding that its funding of the private Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.
to build the country's first "bullet" train and its role in the
privatization of Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd. also set the country back
NT$27 billion and NT$65.4 billion, respectively.

Annoyed by what they called inadequate monitoring by the various
opposition parties, they said that forming a vanguard social force to
combat wrongheaded government policies is very necessary, especially
at a time when the government is becoming the country's largest
"capitalist" by embezzling official properties and funds.
</P>
<P>
They urged the Taiwan people to challenge the inept government,
whose inadequate policies have made poor people poorer, but rich
people richer, and called on the public to actively endorse their
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the same day, an anti-war group from the academic sector
protested against the government's military procurement plan in front
of the Legislative Yuan by displaying a large, child's painting
calling for peace.
</P>
<P>
A group leader said that they will send the painting to the
United Nations in mid-November to express the Taiwan people's desire
for peace and to urge the world body to play a key role in arranging
a 50-year peace accord between Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The group leader argued that the government should not just
rashly rely on the United States to determine Taiwan's future, as the
recent remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell show.
Taiwan must walk its own path, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the legislative steering committee is slated to screen the
NT$610.8 billion special budget allocations, the fourth such meeting,
group members aired their strong dissatisfaction about the
development and vowed to launch an attack against legislators should
they allow the budgets to clear the floor.

MINISTER OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's economic prospects remain rosy
despite some indications showing that the booming domestic economy is
likely to abate in the coming months, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho
Mei-yueh said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's economy enjoyed a growth of 6.67 percent in the first
quarter of this year and 7.68 percent in the second quarter, Ho
noted, adding that the third quarter's growth rate is estimated to
post more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the minister said that export orders
received by Taiwan in the first nine months of this year accumulated
to US$155.29 billion, up 26.26 percent from the previous year's
level.
</P>
<P>
In September alone, she went on, Taiwan received export orders
worth US$19.5 billion, an increase of 26.61 percent year-on-year and
marking a new monthly record.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicate that Taiwan's economy has been growing
steadily and will continue to keep rising, Ho explained, claiming
that she is confident that the annual growth rate will meet the
target of 5.87 percent set by the government for this year.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) last week showed that Taiwan's economy in
September posted a yellow-red light in the government's five-color
rating system, with the composite index falling from August's 33
points to 32 points, which is close to a green light.
</P>
<P>
According to the five-color rating system designated by the CEPD,
a red light indicates an overheated economy, yellow-red indicates a
heating up economy, green means steady growth, yellow-blue signals
sluggishness and blue points to recession.
</P>
<P>
The domestic economy flashed a fourth consecutive yellow-red
light in September, which was the ninth month with a heating-up
economy over the past 10 months, Ho noted. A red light rating was
registered for May, she added.

President Chen Shui-bian praised literature
Sunday as a key force in advancing Taiwan and he urged veteran
writers to help cultivate new talent to further promote the country.
</P>

Chen made the remarks at a ceremony held by Unitas Literary
magazine in celebration of its 20th anniversary and its 18th annual

</P>
<P>
Calling Unitas Literary the cradle of the Taiwan people's
spiritual comfort over the past 20 years, Chen said the magazine
provides an important channel for local writers to express their love
and concerns for the land and the environment, even in the days under
the rule of a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
The people in Taiwan have learned respect and leniency from their
past experiences, Chen said, encouraging the magazine to keep on
standing tall as a guidepost of "independence, freedom and openness"
for the country.

New York Times: Focus narrowing as close
contest nears finish line.

As the U.S. presidential campaign nearing its finish line, both
candidates are focusing on the three pivotal states that they depend
most: Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Both President Bush and Senator
John Kerry have invested tens of millions of dollars on advertising
there, deployed armies of field workers and spent hundreds of hours
on the stump, including visits in the race's final weekend. With the
furor over a new Osama bin Laden tape filtering through the
campaigns, both men crossed through Midwestern swing states on
Saturday and are to appear in Florida on Sunday. In the end, the
outcome is likely to be decided by what political pros call "the
ground war": the effort by both parties to get every supporter to the
polls on Tuesday. Although there are almost limitless ways either
candidate could reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes needed
to win, whoever wins two of the big three states would have an
advantage that would be difficult to overcome.

Wall Street Journal: Bush, Kerry focus on terrorism.

President Bush and Sen. John Kerry charged into a sharp final
round of argument Saturday over which one can best fight global
terrorism, the import of their debate underscored by Osama bin
Laden's sudden reappearance on tape at "a time of great consequence,"
in the words of the president.

PRESIDENT STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF BEEFING UP DEFENSE CAPABILITIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Oct.   31  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan must beef up its defense
capabilities to deter any military adventures from mainland China,
President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally marking the 50th anniversary of the Veterans
Affairs Commission under the Executive Yuan, Chen said that the
mainland has never abandoned the option of using force against
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing dared not to initiate an attack on Taiwan over the past
five decades because Taiwan had sufficient defense capabilities, Chen
noted.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's growing military buildup nowadays, he
added, Taiwan must beef up its defense capabilities to avert war and
ensure peace across the Taiwan Strait as well as the country's and
regional security.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at the opposition camp's boycott on a special arms
procurement budget of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) introduced
by the executive branch in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Although legislators of various political parties can have
different opinions on the matter, they should seek a consesus through
rational discussions and communications, the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is irresponsible to ground the budget proposal by using
technically the steering procedures in the legislature, he
criticized.
</P>
<P>
Chen called on lawmakers across the political spectrum to put the
national security and interests on the priority instead of personal
and party's interests in dealing with the budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
Chen's administration has approved the special budget for the
purchase of eight diesel-powered submarines, six baterries of Patriot
PAC-III missiles and 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the United
States over a 15-year period starting in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposal is pending screening by the legislature.
