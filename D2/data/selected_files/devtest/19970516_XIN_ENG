<HEADLINE> US Consumer Prices Up by 0.1 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The consumer prices in the U.S.
increased by a small 0.1 percent in April resulting from declining
energy and food costs, U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tiny rise in the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) held the
inflation rate to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 1.5
percent for the first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Much of the inflation relief has come in the volatile food and
energy sectors, where prices are unwinding from earlier increases.
</P>
<P>
The report said that energy prices fell by 1.5 percent in April
following a 1.7 percent drop in March. Food prices also declined
by 0.2 percent with declines in fruit and vegetables, cereal and
dairy products offsetting increases in meat, poultry, fish and
eggs.
</P>
<P>
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core prices rose a
moderate 0.3 percent in April, the largest since September. The
core prices in the U.S. increased at the annual rate of 2.7
percent in the first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) policy-makers will meet on next
Tuesday to consider if another increase of interest rate is needed
to check the inflation.
</P>
<P>
Some economists expect the central bank will wait to see if
recent signs of economic slowing continue, while others expect
another rate rise as insurance to make sure growth slows to a
non-inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Fed raised the short-term interest rate by a quarter of a
percentage point on March 25, the first increase in two years.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Rate Drops to 2.4 pct in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain's headline annual inflation
fell to 2.4 percent last month from 2.6 percent in March as retail
prices rose only 0.6 percent in the month, according to figures
released today by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The underlying annual inflation rate, which excludes mortgage
interest payments and which the government has set as a target at
2.5 percent or less, also showed a fall from 2.7 percent in March
to 2.5 percent, which surprised City experts.
</P>
<P>
This was the lowest annual figure since November 1994 when
underlying inflation was at 2.3 percent and means that the former
Conservative government met its target in its last month in power
as it was ousted from office when Labor leader Tony Blair won a
landslide victory in the May 1 election.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that the falls were largely due to a drop in
motoring costs, with prices for vehicles, petrol and oil all
falling in April.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that the short term outlook of inflation
remains stable as the strength of the pound is keeping a lid on
prices.

<HEADLINE> Germany Issues Arrest Warrants for Three Iranian Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- German federal prosecutors announced
today that they have issued arrest warrants for three Iranian
secret service officials in connection with the 1992 killings of
four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made by the federal prosecutor's office in
Karlsruhe, came five weeks after a Berlin court ruled that Iranian
leaders ordered the killings in Berlin in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling has soured the diplomatic relations between
Bonn and Teheran, and prompted Germany and other European Union
countries to temporarily recall their ambassadors to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office said the three Iranian secret service
officials were charged with murder and attempted murder in
connection with the Berlin attack.
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant issued last year against Iranian intelligence
minister Ali Fallahiyan suspected of ordering the attack would
remain in force, the office said.

<HEADLINE> Huaneng Power International Issues Convertible Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's Huaneng Power International
issued 200 million US dollars of 7-year notes on Wednesday,
convertible into the company's Overseas Shares or American
Depositary Shares (ADS).
</P>
<P>
The issue marks the first time a Chinese company has issued
SEC-registered convertible bonds with JP Morgan as lead manager
for the transaction.
</P>
<P>
The 1.75% notes pay interest semi-annually and are convertible
at 29.20 US dollars per ADS, an 18% premium to the closing price
of 24.75 US dollars on 13 May, according to a press release
issued by JP Morgan here today.
</P>
<P>
The notes are callable at par from 21 May 2000 provided the ADS
price is at least 130% of the conversion price for 30 consecutive
trading days.
</P>
<P>
Investors have the right to put the notes on 21 May 2002 at
price that would produce a yield of 6.66%, or 10 basis points over
comparable five-year US Treasury notes as of noon London time on
14 May.
</P>
<P>
The notes were offered simultaneously in the North American,
European, and Asian markets and will be listed on the New York
Stock Exchange and Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Technology Teaching in UK Needs "Money Boost" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain's schools need heavy input
for technology teaching if the country's future as a highly
competitive and innovative nation is not to be jeopardized,
according to a report published today by the Engineering Council.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on a survey of 344 state secondary schools by
Brunel University, found that the teaching of technology in
secondary schools is "bedevilled by underfunding".
</P>
<P>
According to the report, In 1994-1995, the average technology
departmental grant was 5.86 pounds (9.37 US dollars) per pupil,
well below the 9.30 pounds (14.88 US dollars) recommended by the
Design and Technology Association.
</P>
<P>
The following year, nearly two-fifths of the country's
technology departments suffered a cut in grant funding which was
bound to affect on the teaching quality of technology.
</P>
<P>
Because schools did not have enough money to teach technology
as prescribed by the national curriculum. At several schools,
facilities were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
In over a fifth of schools, the specialized workshops were too
small and there was an overspill into ordinary class rooms, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the schools could not even hire properly qualified
staff. In a fifth of specialist technology colleges, the equipment
existed, but not the teachers trained to use it.
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, in nearly half of all schools, technology
departments did not have a full-time technician.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that "a rolling program of 100 million
pounds (160 million US dollars) per year for 10 years" is required
to provide the necessary capital investment.
</P>
<P>
There should also be "a relatively modest" 10 million pounds
(16 million US dollars) annual investment to bring recurrent
funding up to an "acceptable level", it added.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Optimistic About Renewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite the lack of breakthrough
from U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross' mediation, Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu still voiced optimism about renewing
the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Ross this morning, Netanyahu told his
coalition executives at a meeting that Ross' mission created the
basis for more talks despite the failure of the Wednesday night
meeting between Israeli and Palestinian officials to break the ice.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday meeting, the first between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators since the Har Homa construction, was held
at the Herzliya residence of U.S. Ambassador Matin Indyk and
attended by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and other officials.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said no results were achieved at the meeting, which he
described as only a dialog and not formal negotiations. He said
Israel had rejected the Palestinian demand that Israel should
first freeze settlement activities, including the Har Homa
project, before resuming formal talks.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current stalemate in the peace process, Netanyahu
expressed the hope that the Knesset's summer session would
witness the renewal of peace talks with the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA). He stressed that the talks had to be renewed
because they are in the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Erekat painted a bleak picture of the prospects
for renewing the peace process. In an interview with Israel Radio,
he said Israel was no longer a peace partner to the Palestinian
side, because of its continued expansion of settlements and
confiscation of Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
Erekat described Ross' mission as a failure which resulted
from Israel's intransgiency on the settlement issue. He urged
the U.S. government to stand firm against Israel's policies of
continuing expanding settlements.
</P>
<P>
He also refuted Israel's charges against PNA President Yasser
Arafat for giving the green light to terrorist attacks against
Israel, saying Arafat "has made it very clear that he would not
tolerate anyone who may even think of inflicting harm or violence
against Israelis."
</P>
<P>
By blaming Arafat for giving the green light to terrorism,
Israel is citing the PNA's promise to launch a long-term fight
against terrorism as a precondition for renewing the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ross held talks with Israeli President Ezer Weizman
this afternoon and is scheduled to meet with Arafat in Gaza late
today. He was trying to arrange another meeting between Israeli
and Palestinian security officials to discuss security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived here last Wednesday, is expected to
travel home Friday to report to President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on his current mission.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends Mandate Renewal of Macedonia Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan recommended on Thursday that the mandate of the U.N.
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in Macedonia be renewed for
an additional six months until 30 November 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan stated that it
would be imprudent to recommend that the UNPREDEP mission be
terminated.
</P>
<P>
"As pointed out in my letter of 3 April 1997 to the President
of the Security Council, recent developments in Albania have
demonstrated that stability in the Balkan region remains extremely
fragile," he said. The letter led to a suspension of drawdown of
military component of UNPREDEP by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in light of request of Macedonia for a continued
UNPREDEP presence, the continuation of the conditions that led to
the suspension of the drawdown of the military component, he is of
the view that it would be imprudent to recommend that the UNPREDEP
mission be terminated.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Presents U.S. Defense Plan to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen today presented leaders of Congress the Quadrennial Defense
Review (QDR), a new plan for U.S. military strategy.
</P>
<P>
The QDR, which is due to be made public on Monday, aims at
force cuts and arms modernization into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Cohen had called for new base closings and shrinking costly jet
fighter programs. Reports say that the QDR would cut only some
60,000 troops from the 1.4 million-member military.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of senior lawmakers and staffers from four key security
and appropriations committees of the House and Senate gathered at
Cohen's office in the Pentagon and attended the close-door
briefing by Cohen.
</P>
<P>
The QDR, which is the most important defense strategy document
mapped out by the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War,
basically has not changed much the strategic goal of the United
States: it should be capable of winning two regional wars
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The QDR, Cohen said earlier this month, is a compromise to face
the realities of growing demands on the military such as fighting
wars, keeping the peace and performing humanitarian duties along
with saving save money to spend on needed arms modernization.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the end of the Cold War had not ended
international threats to U.S. security and that more domestic
military bases must be shut to save money for new high-tech
weapons.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Li Peng's African Visit a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng's latest
visit to seven African countries has deepened mutual understanding
and promoted traditional friendship, a commentary carried in
Friday's People's Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Li's African tour, highly praised and well received by African
people, is a major diplomatic success coming after Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's historic visit to the continent last year,
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit between May 3 and 14, Li met and talked with
leaders of the seven African nations -- Zambia, Mozambique, Gabon,
Cameroun, Nigeria, Tanzania and Seychelles -- on a wide range of
topics and signed more than 20 cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier and the African leaders, by exchanging
ideas, have reached common ground for the further development of
traditional Sino-African friendship and cooperation under new
international conditions.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said, "Africa is a developing continent. It has
more than 50 countries, accounting for nearly a third of the
members of the United Nations and half of the members of the
Non-Aligned Movement".
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, Africa is an important element in safeguarding world
peace and regional stability. It is a vital new force in
changing the unfair and unreasonable old international political
and economic order, and an important influence in pushing the
world towards multi-polarization", said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to see that many African countries are achieving
political stability, seeking social systems and development roads
suited to local conditions, and have made progress in regional
cooperation," it said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the Organization of African Unity and
other regional organizations have played a more active role in
promoting unity, safeguarding regional peace and promoting
economic development and social progress. Africa is a continent
full of promise.
</P>
<P>
With its vast lands and rich resources, Africa has good natural
conditions and great potential to develop its economy. The
comparatively backward economic development in Africa today is the
aftermath of hundreds years of colonial rule and plunder, and the
consequence of the prevailing unreasonable international economic
order.
</P>
<P>
To help African countries in their economic development, the
commentary said, China has, in the decades since their
independence, provided them with the aid which was within its
power to give. The sincere aid from China, although small in
amount, has been warmly received in Africa, especially in view of
its extension without political strings attached.
</P>
<P>
China and African countries, which are all developing nations,
have been the victims of unequal trade and discriminatory economic
policies. With common historical traits, common development
objectives and common interests, cooperation between China and
African countries is based on equality.
</P>
<P>
China and African countries, having their own respective
strengths, can promote economic cooperation by giving full play to
their economic complementarity. African countries welcome Chinese
enterprises to start joint ventures there.
</P>
<P>
China believes there is great potential for economic
cooperation based on equality, mutual respect and mutual
benefit. China's reforms to its aid delivery and economic
cooperation has been understood and supported by most African
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the commentary said, China will emphasize
enterprise-level cooperation while providing assistance to the
African continent to the best of its ability.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening consultation and friendly cooperation between
China, the largest developing country, and Africa, the largest
developing continent, will be of great importance to world peace,
stability and development and will have a far-reaching influence
on creating a better world and taking it into the next century, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li's visit to Africa has strengthened the long-lasting
friendship and cooperation between China and African countries. We
believe this friendship and cooperation will bear rich fruit, the
commentary said.

<HEADLINE> German Tax Revenue Shortfall Estimated at 18 Billion Marks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Tax revenues by federal, state and
community governments in Germany this year will be 18 billion
German marks (10.65 billion U.S. dollars) lower than earlier
estimated, a government-appointed tax estimate group announced
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest projections, federal taxes for this
year were expected to be 9.1 billion marks lower than earlier
expected, those of the country's 16 states would be 6.9 billion
lower, and the community governments would also expected 1.8
billion marks less tax revenues than before.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel attributed the huge
shortfall to the sluggish German economy and the record high
unemployment. He was scheduled to make a statement later Thursday
to say what the government will undertake to try to close the
financial gaps.
</P>
<P>
The tax projections Thursday was made by the so-called "Working
Group for Tax Estimates", which is comprised of experts from
federal, state and community governments as well as officials from
the central bank known as Bundesbank, the Federal Statistics
Office and the independent economic research institutes.

<HEADLINE> Ireland to Have General Election on June 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
announced in Dublin today that he is to dissolve the Irish
parliament and call an early general election on June 6, five
months before the November deadline.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Irish parliament early today, Bruton said that
he intended to go to Irish President Mary Robinson to request her
permission to dissolve the country's 27th parliament, according to
press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Bruton, who came to power in late 1994 when the previous
government collapsed because of a row over legal appointments,
said that the current three-party coalition, including Fine Gael
party, Labor Party and the Democratic Left, should fight off the
opposition on the coalition's record of creating jobs and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"Promises are one thing. Performance is another. Jobs are the
centerpiece of this government. We want to halve unemployment and
add 1,000 jobs each week over the next five years just as we have
over the last two years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls indicate that the popularity of the ruling
coalition has been fading fast in the wake of revelations that an
Irish tycoon, Ben Dunne, paid millions of pounds to politicians
from all parties.
</P>
<P>
Irish elections are held under a proportional representation
system. A poll last week gave the main opposition Fianna Fail
party 43 per cent of votes with the Progressive Democrats taking
eight. For the coalition, Fine Gael was on 26 percent, Labour 12
and Democratic Left two.
</P>
<P>
Irish political commentators said that unemployment, law and
order and the Northern Ireland peace process are expected to
dominate the election campaign.

<HEADLINE> 87 PKK Rebels Killed in Cross-Border Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-seven rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed since the
50,000-strong Turkish troops crossed the border into northern Iraq
Wednesday in a bid to wipe out the PKK militants based in the
region, a military statement said here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the office of the General Staff said
that the PKK rebels were killed along the Sirnak and Hakkari
border lines when they fleed the heavy clashes with Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) forces in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish private Show TV reported this evening that the
Turkish security forces have entered into 40 kilometers of
northern Iraq since Turkey launched a large-scale cross-border
military operations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that one soldier of the Turkish
security forces died and four others were wounded in the clashes
with the PKK rebels in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK militants are still fighting with the KDP forces in
the region, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Sermat Atacanli, deputy spokesman of the Turkish Foreign
Ministry, said Wednesday that the Turkish government troops
launched the cross-border military operations following a call
for aid by KDP Chairman Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since August 1984. Its armed wing, based in
northern Iraq, has been waging hit-and-run battles against the
government forces.

<HEADLINE> World Silver Supply Sets to Tighten, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- World silver supply is not keeping
pace with demand and the supply gap sets to widen, according to
the latest World Silver Survey published Wednesday by the
London-based Gold Fields Mineral Services consultancy.
</P>
<P>
The survey, sponsored by 28 silver miners, refiners,
fabricators and bullion banks from nine countries, said that world
silver market was moving in the direction of a genuine tightening
of supply and 24,800 tons of silver were drawn from stocks
between 1991 and the end of 1996 due to short of supply.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that the gap between fabrication demand and the
combined total of supply from mine production and scrap widened to
nearly 5,000 tons last year although it was below the record
5,600 tons in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that identifiable silver stocks would be
eliminated if the gap between supply and demand continued at the
same level for another four years.
</P>
<P>
There would be a point at which the fall in stocks began to
make a noticeable difference to the availability of silver to the
market, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"If the existing holders of the remaining stocks of bullion
should choose to maintain rather than to dispose of their
holdings, the only way that the market will achieve a balance is
via a significant increase in the silver price," the report added.

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov Calls for More Active Russian Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Gennady Zyuganov, secretary
general of Russia's Communist Party, who is currently touring
the Middle East, today urged the Russian government to play
a more active role in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov, who arrived here from Damascus this morning, held
meetings with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Deputy House
Speaker Elie Frizli as well as Walid Jumblatt, chairman of
Lebanon's Progressive Socialist Party and minister of the
displaced.
</P>
<P>
The Russian communist leader said that "in a friendly and
cordial atmosphere" he and the Lebanese president exchanged
views on various issues especially the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the end of the meeting, Zyuganov
urged all parties involved in the peace process to implement all
resolutions adopted by the United Nations and its Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the priority in Russia's foreign policy
should be linked with an increasing activation of its relations
with the Arab states, in the middle east and especially in
supporting resolutions of the Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he held talks in Damascus Wednesday with
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and other officials on issues in
the region and bilateral relations between the Russian Communist
Party and the Syrian Arab Socialist Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov noted that the position of Yevgeny Primakov, the
Russian foreign minister, was not different from that of the
communist-dominant Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that the position of the majority was to support
the peaceful ways which should be practised in the region for a
settlement of the Middle East problem, and the commitment to the
legitimate right and resolutions of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, we call for an activation of Russia's
relations with Syria and Lebanon and a support for the two
countries in Russia's foreign policy," he said, adding that his
visit will contribute to the cooperation with the two Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with Frizli, Zyuganov underlined
that the peace process needs a unification and cooperation of
those powers who have interests in the peace.
</P>
<P>
"Russia should be more active in playing its role in this
region and in supporting all the peaceful moves of Syria and
Lebanon," he reiterated.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Denies Manufacturing Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government today
officially dispelled the rumour that it manufactures
anti-personnel landmines, saying it had not done so since
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Defence Minister Moven Mahachi said that it was not
Zimbabwe's policy to either manufacture or keep the devices in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, tenders would soon be invited for the
removal of landmines from the country's north-eastern border.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''you may be aware that Zimbabwe has been accused of
manufacturing anti-personnel mines.''
</P>
<P>
''To restore our image which has been maliciously tarnished, I
am proud to announce the following policy position -- Zimbabwe
has not manufactured anti-personnel mines since 1980,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Various groups, including the human rights body, British-based
Human Rights Watch, has in the past challenged the government to
clarify a situation where it has been seen to be manufacturing
and exporting landmines.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi also dispelled assertions that his government had
exported landmines to Sudan, for use by rebels.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, did not have the technology or
capacity to manufacture the landmines, nor did it intend to
acquire such technology in future.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government has now secured a 11.4 million US
dollars loan from the European Union for removing about one
million anti-personnel mines in northeastern Zimbabwe. enditem

<HEADLINE> EAC Passports to Be Issued in Septmeber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The East African
Co-operation (EAC) passports launched in Arusha, Northern
Tanzania on April 29, will be issued to the public in September,
EAC Executive Secretary Francis Muthaura said today.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the local Daily News from
Arusha, Francis Muthaura said the travelling documents are being
produced in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"We have ordered 300,000 passports, 100,000 for each member
country of the EAC - Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. We expect to
receive the first batch in August," said Muthaura.
</P>
<P>
He said the introduction of the EAC passports is aimed at
promoting trade among the east African states and easing
cross-border movements of the East Africans.
</P>
<P>
The regional passport is only valid in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, Ugnadan President Yoweri
Museveni and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa launched the
passports on April 29 at the Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium in Arusha,
urging East Africans to make full use of the documents.
</P>
<P>
On the EAC flag, Muthaura said the Permanent Tripartite
Commission has decided that it be hoisted at the EAC headquarters
in Arusha and at the ministries responsiblle for regional
co-operation in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The flags will also be hosted at the international airports
and harbours of the member states, immigration posts at border
towns and a few places to be allowed by the commission later.

<HEADLINE> Waigel: Germany's Chances to Join Euro Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
insisted today that Germany's chances to join the single European
currency remain unchanged, despite projections issued today
pointing to a huge shortfall in the government's 1997 tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
An estimated shortfall of 18 billion German marks (10.6 billion
U.S. dollars) -- caused mainly by record unemployment and a
sluggish economy -- would have no effect on Germany's prospects to
join the single currency known as the Euro, Waigel said.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that there should be no weakening of the tough
financial targets set by the European Union Maastricht treaty for
Euro membership.
</P>
<P>
But economists in Frankfurt said Bonn was unlikely now to meet
the Maastricht criteria, meant to ensure that the Euro will be as
strong as the German mark.
</P>
<P>
With high unemployment pushing up social security spendings,
German government is now facing urgent financial measures to bring
its budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product
(GDP), as required by the Euro criteria.
</P>
<P>
The decision on which states are to qualify for the Euro in the
first wave on January 1, 1999 will be made early in 1998, based on
countries' full economic data of 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot scientist in the United
States has announced he has composed a chemical substance that
destroys malignant cells, which was described as a major leap
forward in battle against cancer.
</P>
<P>
Kyriakos Nicolaou, who has taught and conducted research in
several U.S. universities since 1972, told the Cyprus
Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) today that the chemical substance
known as Epothilone can destroy malignant cells which proved
resistant to the preparation drug Taxol, also discovered by
Nicolaou.
</P>
<P>
Taxol is considered a revolutionary drug because it has
produced remarkable results against malignant melanoma, breast
cancer and ovarian cancer, CyBC said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nicolaou said the importance of his discovery rests on the
fact that this chemical compound acts effectively where other
drugs cannot. But he did not elaborate on the chemical.
</P>
<P>
He added that it will be three years until the perfected drug
reaches the market.
</P>
<P>
Nicolaou, 51, is president of the Scripps Institute in La
Jolla, California, and is a professor at California's San Diego
University.
</P>
<P>
He has also synthesised many other chemical compounds in
the fight against cancer, hyper-cholesterinaemia and other diseases.

CAIRO -- The private sector now controls nearly 40 percent of
Egypt's annual 1.8-million-tonne sugar market, up from less than
10 percent in 1990, according to the May 1997 issue of Egypt's
Business Monthly magazine.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of the government's privatization drive
which encouraged the private sectors to play a more active role
in the trade, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, private firms are now entirely responsible for
importing 700,000 tonnes of sugar Egypt needs to make up for its
production deficit each year.
</P>
<P>
The Sugar and Integrated Industries Company (SIIC), an
affiliate of the Food Industries Holding Co., has controlled the
sugar market ever since President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized
the holdings of sugar-magnate Abu Pasha.
</P>
<P>
Sugar is considered Egypt's second most sensitive commodity
after wheat. Contrary to a popular belief, Egyptians' sugar
consumption lags behind that of developed nations.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Britain has agreed with Egypt with its participation
in developing the Abu Tartour Phosphate Scheme Mines, in the west
of the Nile River, towards stepping up production, reducing
costs of opening up the ore.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Wednesday by Egyptian Minister of Industry
and Mineral Resources Sulaiman Reda after a meeting with a
British delegation of mining industry experts in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Reda said that the British side agreed on extending technical
assistance in training phosphate mine workers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Britain had promised to offer aid in search for
subscribers to the Scheme in building the Abu Tartour Phosphate
Chemical Complex when phosphoric acid from the Abu Tartour
Phosphate Mines ore can be successfully produced at the Abu Zaabal
Fertilizers Plant near Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Retired French General Predicts "Pitched Battle" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Former chief of staff of the French
army, General Jeannou Lacaze, said today that there will surely be
a "pitched battle" for Kinshasa between Zairian government
forces and the rebel forces of Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Lacaze, who also served as chief of staff of the presidential
office and personal advisor of President Mobutu Sese Seko, told
Agence France-Presse that the rebel forces are from now on meeting
more serious resistance from government troops backed by former
Angolan rebel soldiers of Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"I have the impression that the troops of Kabila advanced
without having any pitched battle. There will surely be a pitched
battle for the possession of Kinshasa. It is possible because, as
the Zairian forces are narrowing (their front), they will gain
strength," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lacaze, who recently toured Zaire for humanitarian purposes and
met with both Mobutu and Kabila, said that although Mobutu is
sick, "he is not a man who will say I go and leave the place to
Kabila."
</P>
<P>
"He will surely try, with the help of the Europeans, the
Westerners, to leave an intermediary (to succeed his power),"
said the general, who is widely regarded as an expert on Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Wants to Resume Trade With Iraq, Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said today that it was
considering resuming trade with the sanction-ridden Iraq, but
under the U.N. convention.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Energy Minister Recai
Kutan said that the government was working out ways of
circumventing the U.N. trade embargo imposed on Baghdad following
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Taking Jordan as an example, Kutan said the kingdom was taking
advantage of Article 50 of the U.N. Convention, which sets terms
for one country to trade with another that is under sanction.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has simply informed the U.N. under the article and is
going ahead with trade with Iraq, the minister said, indicating
that Turkey could also resume its trade with Baghdad in the same
way.
</P>
<P>
During his recent trip to Baghdad, Kutan signed a oil and
natural gas deal with Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed,
which is termed as an important step in the two countries'
trade ties.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with the Iraqi minister, Kutan called the
trade embargo on Iraq "meaningless and unjust."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly suffered an estimated economic loss of
around 30 billion U.S. dollars as a result of the U.N. trade
sanctions on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Months ago, Turkey had tried to ask for permission from
the United Nations to trade with Iraq, but received a reply
that this would be considered only after outcome of the
oil-for-food agreement had been assessed.
</P>
<P>
To relieve the suffering of the Iraqis, the United Nations
has allowed Iraq to sell two-billion-U.S. dollar worth of oil
in order to buy badly needed food and medicine in the
sanction-stricken country.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Supports U.N.-Sponsored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has voiced
its support to an upcoming bicommunal concert, an event it hopes
will carry a message of hope to the young people of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today after a meeting of the Council of
Ministers, Government Spokesman Manolis Christofides said "we
look forward to the concert with the wish that it will open a
window of hope."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has organized a concert for Greek and
Turkish Cypriots, in a bid to build bridges between the two
communities who are kept apart since Turkey sent troops and took
control of the northern third of the island in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Greek pop star Sakis Rouvas, along with Turkish singer Burak
Kut will perform during the Monday night's concert.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,000 tickets - 3,000 for each side - are being
distributed free of charge, for the concert will take place on a
vacant football court in the buffer zone in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the young generation is the "golden hope" for all
nations, Christofides stressed that the young people of Cyprus
"have been kept apart for decades against nature and their own
interest."
</P>
<P>
"Greek and Turkish Cypriots will come to the concert proud of
their descent and to declare they want peace and peaceful
coexistence," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He thanked both Rouvas and Kut for their responding to the
U.N. invitation, stressing that they will contribute to the
creation of an environment of friendship between the young
people of Cyprus, through the universal language of music and
songs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Cypriot government encourages young
people to participate in the event and called upon political
parties to use this opportunity to "send the message that the
youth of Cyprus can work and live together peacefully."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "other similar events will follow,
bringing the people of Cyprus to live and create together."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the event has met opposition from
certain organizations in both sides, but the U.N. has said it
will deploy some 400 security personnel to the concert, to
guarantee the safety of all those present.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General to Seek Death Penalty in Unabomber Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
has authorized prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Unabomber
suspect Theodore Kaczynski, Justice Department official and a
lawyer for the Kaczynski family said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Washington, D.C. attorney Anthony Bisceglie
said he had informed Kaczynski's brother David and his mother
Wanda of Reno's decision to authorize prosecutors to seek the
death penalty in the case.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, a 54-year-old former mathematics professor, is
accused of being the Unabomber, who killed three people and
injured 23 during a campaign against technology between 1978 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
David and Wanda turned in Theodore Kaczynski last year after
authorities had mounted an unsuccessful 18-year search for the
Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
The family argued that other families in the future might be
reluctant to turn in relatives if a death sentence were imposed in
this case.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department sources said Reno agreed to prosecutors'
request and had authorized the death penalty in the case, and said
the decision was expected to be disclosed in a court filing later
on Thursday in Sacramento, California, where the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, arrested in Montana in April 1996, has pleaded not
guilty to the Sacramento charges accusing him of four bomb
attacks, in which two people were killed.
</P>
<P>
He faces a later trial in Newark, New Jersey, on federal
charges that he mailed a package bomb that killed advertising
executive Thomas Mosser in New Jersey. Kaczynski has also pleaded
innocent in the case.

<HEADLINE> Gold Market Trend Depend On EMU, Says GFMS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The decline in investment interest
in gold last year could be coming to an end, according to an
annual report published here recently.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter of this year is showing some of the
characteristics which led to the bull market of 1993, despite the
spirit of pervading gloom which surrounded gold at the end of last
year, Gold Fields Mineral Services (GFMS) said in the report.
</P>
<P>
The parallels are similar, with a depressed price and record
levels of demand from Asian gold markets.
</P>
<P>
There was clearly a circular relationship between the falling
price and the lack of investment interest, with the perception of
falling prices encouraging short selling and the resulting sale of
borrowed gold pushing the price down further, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Yet the gold price this year has so far not been outstanding.
At the close of trading on 12 May, gold was 348.2 US dollars per
ounce, trailing behind last year's low of 367.4 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We might begin to see the message get through to investors as
some start to believe that there is a reason for prices to rise,"
said Stewart Murray, chief executive of GFMS.
</P>
<P>
"This will lead others to come in and push prices higher
again," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the stock market was the main reason for
poor gold prices last year. The market's buoyancy, particularly in
the US, where one expects most gold investment to stem from, meant
investors stayed away from gold.
</P>
<P>
The continued fall of the price during the first quarter of
this year triggered a tremendous physical reaction in the Asian
markets, which certainly prevented the price from sliding any
further, and may even have had a big enough impact on sentiment to
encourage some short covering, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
For the future, the report said:"The trend in the gold market
may depend to quite an extent on the market's perception of the
probability of success or otherwise of European Monetary Union."
</P>
<P>
"Much remains to be decided about gold's role in this process
and there is still no clear consensus on whether gold will benefit
or suffer from it," it added.

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Unchanged in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial production
was unchanged in April after a downward-revised increase of 0.6
percent in March, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the production was held back by auto
strikes, which caused a 6.4 percent drop in production of autos,
trucks and parts.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the decline in the production of motor vehicles and
parts, the index of U.S. industrial production rose 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The output of durable goods, items expected to last for more
than three years, fell 3.5 percent in the month, mainly resulting
from the big decline of automotives.
</P>
<P>
The output of nondurable goods advanced by 0.2 percent boosted
by increase in the production of energy products.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output overall slipped by 0.2 percent, the first
drop in 13 months. Mining, which includes oil drilling, fell by
0.5 percent. However, cold, rainy weather helped boost output at
utilities by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The changes left American industry operating at 83.4 percent of
its capacity, down from 83.7 percent in March. It was the lowest
operating rate in three months and an indication consumer demand
isn't creating inflationary bottlenecks in the production
pipeline.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today put forward new initiatives aimed at clamping down harder on
gun sales and ensuring gun safety.
</P>
<P>
In a wreath-laying ceremony today on the Capitol steps to honor
police officers killed last year, Clinton announced initiatives to
help protect police officers and keep guns from "dangerous
drifters who threaten our safety."
</P>
<P>
New statistics show that the 116 officers killed in the line of
duty in 1996 were the fewest since 1959, when 95 were killed. By
comparison, 162 law enforcement officers were killed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Clinton attributed the improvement to better training,
beefed-up forces and gun-control legislation that he signed during
his first term.
</P>
<P>
He said that all guns carried by agents with the FBI and the
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms have been newly equipped
with child safety locks. Guns for all other federal law
enforcement officers are to be fitted with the locks by October
15.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also announced a new, more restrictive federal form
that gun buyers must complete under the Brady law, which imposes a
waiting period and background check on potential purchasers.
</P>
<P>
With the new form, buyers will be required to show a photo ID
plus some other proof.

JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Botswana
Telecommunications Authority (BTA) today called for tenders for
the establishment of a cellular telephone network to cover a
large part of its vast, mostly desert land.
</P>
<P>
A South African Press Association report from Gaborone,
capital of Botswana said two state licenses are to be awarded to
qualified tenderers and applications would close on August 7.
</P>
<P>
Applicants, which must be foreign joint ventures with at least
one Botswanan partner, have to show that it can provide necessary
foreign technical expertise, according to the bidding requirement.
</P>
<P>
The two successful tenderers would each have to pay one
million Pula (about 286,000 U.S. Dollars) for a 15-year license.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC)
made it clear that it intends to apply for the license and is
seeking a partner.
</P>
<P>
At present there are 60,000 fixed line telephone subscribers
in Botswana. The initial cellular market was estimated by BTC at
about 10,000, rising over the next 10 years to between 50,000 and
60,000 potential subscribers.

<HEADLINE> ECOSOC Projects 4.3 Pct Growth in Western Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The economy in western Asia
will grow 4.3 percent in 1997, lower than the 4.8 percent growth
for 1996 but much higher than the 2.2 percent growth achieved in
1995, according to a survey of the UN Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC).
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the real per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) in the region consisting of 13 countries will
average 2.1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The economic outlook for the region will mainly depend on the
international prices of oil, the implementation of economic
reforms of the countries in the region, the development in the
Middle East peace process and Iraq's return to the international
oil market and lifting of the sanctions on Iraq, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the overall economic performance in 1996, the
survey noted that the region's GDP, in nominal terms and excluding
Iraq, totaled 353.3 billion dollars, up by 10.1 percent from the
320.8 billion dollars in 1995. Its per capita nominal GDP was
estimated at 2,828 dollars in 1996, compared with 2,638 dollars in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Major factors for the strong economic growth include the
significant rise of oil price and introduction and acceleration of
economic reforms in the region. Average oil price registered a
20.3 percent increase in 1996, reaching 20.29 dollars per barrel
and the highest since 1990.
</P>
<P>
But, the unstable political situation caused by the stalling of
the Middle East peace process and economic sanctions on Iraq
hindered the region's growth rate to a certain degree.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the region increased by 15 percent and its imports
recorded a 9 percent growth in 1996. Exports of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, namely Bharain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, came to 117.4
billion dollars, accounting for 89 percent of the region's total
and recording a 16 percent growth over the previous year. Exports
from other countries in the region registered a 5.6 percent growth
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The region's balance of trade recorded a surplus of 30.5
billion dollars in 1996, much higher than the 21.7 billion dollars
the year before.
</P>
<P>
However, high unemployments remain a major problem in the
region, despite the significant growth rate. The highest
unemployment rate in the region was reported in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip, affecting 28 percent of the labor force there;
second came Yemen with an estimated unemployment rate of 25
percent. Egypt and Jordan had a relatively high unemployment rate,
estimated at 13 percent. Even some GCC countries suffer from
unemployment among their indigenous populations because of
unrealistic expectations of the nationals and mismatch between job
seekers' qualifications and job opportunities.

students, while the ratio of students to computer is 17 to 1 at
schools where minority enrollment exceeds 90 percent, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The ratio is even higher for more expensive computers with
enhanced graphics and interactive video capabilities. At schools
with a large minority enrollment, the ratio is 30 students for one
computer, at high-poverty schools, the ratio is near 35 to 1,
compared with a ration closer to 20 to 1 at other schools.
</P>
<P>
The report said that about one-third of high school seniors use
computers at least a few times a week to complete some of their
class work. But 37 percent of seniors never use computers, and at
many schools Internet access is still limited to one site.
</P>
<P>
The report also asserted that most teachers lack the education
and training they need to use technology effectively in their
classes. Only 15 percent of teachers have taken at least nine
hours of training in computer education.

<HEADLINE> Two Israelis Fined for Diamond Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli women, arrested
today at Johannesburg International Airport last Saturday for
possession of more than 3000 uncut diamonds, were each fined
200,000 Rand (about 45000 US Dollar) in a regional court here.
</P>
<P>
Dina Buzaglo, 53, and her daughter, Tamar Schwartz, 32, both
from Tel Aviv, pleaded guilty on charges of possession of the
diamonds to the value of 3.5 million Rand (about 778000 US
Dollar).
</P>
<P>
They were alternatively sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested minutes before boarding a flight to
Israel. They tried to take the diamonds out of the country in
five condoms hidden in their private parts.
</P>
<P>
In their statement to the Magistrate they claimed they were on
holiday in South Africa and were approached by a person to take
the diamonds to Israel.
</P>
<P>
They decided to take up the offer for financial needs and
picked up the diamonds from a Johannesburg hotel, but could not
give the court any further details on the whereabouts of the
person who approached them.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Futures Top 20-Year Highs in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Coffee futures prices soared to
20-year highs today in New York after Colombian exporters said the
country's crop will be much lower than official estimates, raising
the probability of world shortages by fall.
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures jumped an average 6 percent, closing in on 3
U.S. dollars a pound, after Gabriel Rosas, president of Colombia's
National Association of Coffee Exporters, predicted the world's
second-largest producer behind Brazil will harvest "a little bit
under 10 million bags" of arabica coffee for 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
It would be the second year of meager Colombian production,
making it likely that roasters and consumers will see much higher
prices in coming months.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Colombia's total crop production,
because of heavy rains, will fall to just 9.5 million bags,
compared with normal production of slightly more than 13 million
bags. Each bag weighs 132 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Many coffee-producing countries have curtailed production in
recent years amid sharply lower prices and were caught unawares by
the shortage.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Association of Coffee Exporters said Wednesday
the 1997-98 harvest will yield 24 million bags, up from 23.2
million estimated earlier. The estimate for arabica beans was
revised to 19.5 million bags from 18.7 million bags. But the
increase was below the average 27 million bags and was so slight
it will not make a difference.
</P>
<P>
Green, arabica coffee for May delivery on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange rose 15.55 cents to settle at 2.771 U.S.
dollars a pound, the highest since mid-1977. The active July
contract jumped 14.6 cents to 2.55 U.S. dollars a pound.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief Urges Global Tobacco Curb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The possibility of a setback
in efforts to settle tobacco liability cases in the United States
does not relieve governments of responsibility to curb the
industry's power to entrap children and adolescents elsewhere in
the world, the chief of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
said today.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the outcome of the US negotiations, the international
community urgently needs a comprehensive, long-term strategy to
combat tobacco, particularly in the developing world," Carol
Bellamy, executive director of the UNICEF, said in the wake of
press reports this week that optimism is fading for an omnibus
liability settlement between major US-based tobacco companies and
the attorneys general of some two dozen states.
</P>
<P>
"Given the tobacco industry's increasing focus on developing
country sales, the need for action is more pressing than ever,"
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 300 million of today's children and teen-agers
will eventually die of tobacco-related illness, a third of them in
developing countries. The total is projected to rise substantially
within 30 years, with the proportion of developing world deaths
jumping to two-thirds, according to the UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
Medical researchers have established clear links between
smoking in the home and the incidence of acute respiratory
infections and asthma in children exposed to second-hand tobacco
smoke.
</P>
<P>
"Acute respiratory infections already kill 4 million out of the
12 million children under five who die each year in developing
countries. Without across-the-board action to curb smoking, those
numbers are likely to rise in direct proportion to the global
marketing activities of the tobacco industry," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy today reiterated the need for prohibitions on the sale
of tobacco to minors; greatly increased taxation of tobacco
products; and intensified efforts to make the public aware of the
addictive qualities of nicotine and the overall dangers of
smoking.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 767 national and
international observers are in the country to monitor the may 17
legislative elections, Camerounian Vice-Premier Gilbert Andze
Tsoungui said today.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier in charge of territorial administration made
the statements this evening when he was briefing with journalists
of the national and international press.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsoungui, among 767 observers, 78 are
international observers, 689 are national observers. They came
from the Commonwealth, the French Agency for Cultural and
Technical Cooperation, the BBC, the Frontation France Afrique,
the Italian, American and Britain embassies in Cameroun, the
National Human Rights Commission among other international and
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Tsoungui said that that although the printing of candidate
lists is still going on, all will be ready before the voting
begins on saturday morning. The printing of all materials would
have been rounded up today, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the measures taken to avoid people from voting more than
once, Tsoungui said before voting day, all the national borders
will be closed.
</P>
<P>
To justify why the government rejected the idea of the
creation of an independent electoral commission, the vice-premier
said that such an organ is unconstitutional. Even if in advanced
democratic countries, such bodies did not exist, he added.

<HEADLINE> UK PM Ready to Ease Ban on Contact with Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Prime Minister Tony
Blair said today he was ready to ease a ban on official contacts
with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, if it renounced
violence in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He said he would allow his government officials to meet Sinn
Fein if the Irish Republican Army did not carry out further acts
of violence.
</P>
<P>
The previous Conservative government banned official contacts
with Sinn Fein after the IRA ended a 17-month ceasefire in
February 1996 and started bomb attacks again to try to win an
unconditional place at the Northern Ireland peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to allow officials to meet Sinn Fein provided
events on the ground, here and elsewhere, do not make that
impossible," he said in a speech at a Belfast farming fair.
</P>
<P>
Blair arrived in Belfast earlier today for his first tour
outside London since he became prime minister two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
But he said only an unequivocal IRA ceasefire would allow Sinn
Fein to take part in Northern Ireland peace talks which will
resume on June 3.
</P>
<P>
"Violence has no place in a democratic society, whatever the
motivation of those practicing it," the prime minister said. IRA
has been striving for an end to British rule in Northern Ireland
through armed struggle for the past 28 years.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and its political negotiator
Martin McGuinness have called on the new Labor government to
reopen contact with the party since it won seats in the British
parliament in the May 1 general election.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he would not make concessions to Northern Ireland's
Catholic Irish nationalists who want to unite Northern Ireland
with its southern neighbor, the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"My agenda is not a united Ireland, and I wonder just how many
see it as a realistic possibility in the foreseeable
future. Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom as
long as the majority here wish," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Railways Operating Well After Speed Lift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China's railways, which handle 50
percent of the country's passengers and 70 percent of its freight,
are gradually adapting to the new operational scheme that was
launched April 1 to raise the speed of major passenger express
trains.
</P>
<P>
This was learned from the Ministry of Railways, which has been
making efforts to enhance the viability of the country's railways
amid the increasingly fierce transport market in which it is
challenged by highway carriers and airliners.
</P>
<P>
Raising the speed of the trains while upgrading the existing
lines is seen as a quick and economical method as well as a new
battle to win back the traditional share of the transport market
which had long been dominated by the railways, some local experts
say.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1 a new timetable has been in operation, and eight
pairs of passenger expresses shuttling between Beijing and major
Chinese cities are now running at 140 kph, while all other
passenger expresses running on the country's four railway trunk
lines have had their speeds boosted to 120 kph.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 228 cargo-trains have become the country's first to
operate in accordance with a set timetable. In the past, nobody
knew what time their goods shipped by train would get to their
destinations, which often caused disputes among the railways and
their clients.
</P>
<P>
With the speedier expresses and freight trains, the ministry
wants to make the railways more attractive than their competitors,
in a bid to curb the steady and notable decline in passenger and
cargo-handling volumes in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from the ministry, in April
the railways carried 133.69 million tons of goods, 1.1 percent
less than in the same month of last year, while 307.43 million
passengers, 0.9 percent more, traveled by train.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Funds May Enter U.S. Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Communications
Commission is likely to soften its restriction on foreign
ownership in the country's telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the USA Today, The FCC will write a
new rule on the issue, which could start as early as May 22.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ownership of U.S. wireless carriers and international
long-distance carriers is currently limited to a 20 percent direct
investment and an additional indirect stake of 25 percent, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
There are several forces spelling the end of those
restrictions, it said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is party to a World Trade Organization agreement
signed in February that opens telecommunications markets around
the world. The FCC's current restrictions conflict with that
agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. wireless carriers desperately need access to global
investors. Many small carriers are having trouble paying for
licenses they won in FCC auctions and need foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
This is also an opportunity for companies that had trouble
raising capital in the United States to find partners abroad,
according analysts.
</P>
<P>
New rules could also spark a wave of mergers and
acquisitions, the paper said. They would make it easier for
big foreign companies to buy smaller U.S. firms.
</P>
<P>
It could also be a good news for U.S. consumers who will
enjoy lower prices of international calls.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets French President (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that state leaders of China and France have opened a new
chapter in Sino-French relations with their determination to
comprehensively deepen bilateral co-operation, proceeding from the
present new world situation.
</P>
<P>
This is of far-reaching significance for promoting the trend of
multi-polarization of the world and the formation of a new
international pattern, Li told visiting French President Jacques
Chirac during their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to Chirac, Li said that the Chinese
government highly appreciates the French president's contribution
to the improvement of Sino-French cooperation and the overall
development of bilateral relations since he took office.
</P>
<P>
Li described Chirac's visit as an important event in the
history of Sino-French ties. He said that China and France have
signed a series of important agreements and several contracts or
letters of intent on economic and trade cooperation during the
president's current visit.
</P>
<P>
What is more important is that Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and President Chirac have reached common understanding on a series
of issues and signed the Sino-French Joint Declaration, which he
said has demonstrated to the world the two countries' willingness
and determination to set up a comprehensive partnership oriented
to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chirac expressed his pleasure at visiting China as French
president. Over the past two years contacts and communications
between the two countries have witnessed considerable increase, he
noted, adding that he himself has defined the direction and
principles for the development of the overall mutually-beneficial
relations of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-French Joint Declaration signed today is the most
important document in Sino-French relations signed since 1964, and
the two countries showed their resolve to keep close political
links and develop reciprocally beneficial economic and trade
co-operation, he said, expressing satisfaction over his current
China tour.

<P>
On bilateral economic and trade ties, Li said that both China
and France enjoy advantages in their economies, which are highly
complimentary and of great potential for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches much importance to the
promotion of economic and trade relations between the two
countries, and considers it a major component of the comprehensive
partnership between the two countries, the premier said, adding
that economic and trade relations have witnessed rapid progress
since Chirac assumed office.
</P>
<P>
Through concerted efforts of both sides, China and France have
signed a framework agreement on China's purchase of 100-seater
aircraft and a contract and letter of intent to buy 30 Airbus
airplanes and ten ATR planes, respectively. They also declared the
opening of business of French insurance companies and banks in
China, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-French Joint Declaration has also set the direction
for the further development of bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, which shows that China and France have scored new and
substantial results in their co-operation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
With China's economic development there is great potential for
cooperation between the two countries so long as the two make
practical joint efforts, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chirac agreed with Li. He pointed out that France is one of the
world's strongest economies, and China is witnessing rapid
economic progress and enjoys a big market, which means great
potential for the two countries' economic and trade
cooperation. France and China should try to reinforce and expand
such co-operation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France fully supports China's early entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO), as the WTO cannot afford to
leave such an important country as China out.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed Chirac on his recent African tour and China's policy
toward the African countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that to develop Sino-African relations facing the
21st century is conducive to the promotion of world
multi-polarization, adding that future Sino-African economic and
trade relations will be based on the principles of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Chirac noted that the pessimistic attitude held by some people
toward the future of Africa is incorrect, and it is wise of China
to work for the development of Sino-African ties. He also
described Li's African tour as positive and successful.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, head of the Chinese Government Reception
Committee and minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, Herve de Charette, French foreign minister, and other

HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian soccer giants Inter Milan

of Sing Tao, the organizers confirmed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement quells weeks of speculation regarding the

which will be one of the major sporting events before Hong Kong's
return to the motherland at midnight on June 30 this year.
</P>

In a dramatic move for sports fans, the 13-time Italian league
champions readily accepted the opportunity to bring their
sensational line-up to Asia.
</P>
<P>
And organizers were delighted that Hong Kong could play host to
the Milan side, which is one of the world soccer's most
celebrated and successful club sides.
</P>
<P>
Among the big names on the team's second appearance in Hong
Kong will be such bountifully skilled midfielders as Frenchman
Youri Djorkaeff, experienced Dutchman Aron Winter and in-form
England star Paul Ince, Chilean international forward Ivan
Zamorano and Argentina's star defender Javier Zanetti.

Sing Tao has been very successful this season, already with
three major local titles to their credit -- Viceroy Cup, Regional
Council Cup and F.A. President Cup.

"With our triumph over South China days ago, I can say we have
now grasped half of the F.A. Cup trophy," said Ng Chung, chairman
of Sing Tao Sports Club Ltd. at today's press conference.

<P>
GLASGOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Rashid Sidek of Malaysia, who won
an Olympic badminton men's singles bronze in 1996, was not
selected for the national team for the Sudirman Cup world mixed
team championship and the world championships to start here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sidek failed to report on time for the Malaysian national
team's training and "does not make himself available for the
Sudirman Cup", Malaysian head coach Morten Frost told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Sidek, now world number 11 and Malaysia's second best player
after sixth-ranked Ong Ewe Hock, did not appear for training by
the deadline three or four weeks ago, said the Danish-born Frost,
who took over the team only three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Four-time All-England champion Frost said Sidek could neither
compete at the world championships because "we come here as a team
(for both events) but Sidek doesn't make himself for the Sudirman
Cup".
</P>
<P>
Frost said he did not know whether Nusa Mahsuri, the
professional badminton club which Sidek plays for, was invovled in
Sidek's decision.
</P>
<P>
Chen Kang, a former Chinese international who is now the coach
for Malaysian doubles team, said Sidek's club is frequently at
odds with the Malaysian Badminton Association.
</P>
<P>
"Sidek's club is a professional badminton club but the
Malaysian Badminton Association is mainly amateur. So there are
frictions."

<HEADLINE> Japan's Securities Reform Proposals Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The long awaited shake up of the
Japanese securities market came a step closer today after a
government advisory panel proposed a package of drastic measures
to deregulate securities trading.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's promise
to effect a sweeping "Big Bang"-style financial reform by 2001, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
An interim report drawn up by the Securities and Exchange
Council (SEC) put forward a wide range of measures to make the
Japanese market more competitive, ranging from lowering the
securities transaction tax, easing securities licensing
requirements and diversifing financial instruments, to
deregulating listed stock trading and forming a legal framework
for increasing electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
The core of the package is a proposal for liberalizing
brokerage commission fees in stock trading ahead of 2001, the
government's target date for completing financial reform.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for lowering the minimum trading value
subject to free rate-setting by brokerages to 100 million yen(0.9
million dollars) from 1 billion yen (900 million dollars) in April
1998.
</P>
<P>
It also recommends brokerages be free to set their own stock
trading commission rates by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Other business sectors are to be encouraged to enter the
securities business by requiring them to merely report their
intention to the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Tax on securities transactions are to be lowered to make it
easier for individual investors to take part in securities
trading.
</P>
<P>
The interim report, prepared by three teams of experts under
the SEC, will be finalized by mid-June.

GENEVA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government today announced
it was blocking the sale of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko's
luxury villa near Geneva, reports said here.
</P>
<P>
The move comes following a request from a prosecutor in Zaire's
second largest city Lubumbashi, now held by rebel forces, to
freeze the embattled president's assets in Switzerland, including
his property and bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Swiss media have estimated the villa's worth at between 2.5
million and 5 million U.S. dollars and Mobutu's total assets in the
country at about 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, whose government troops have been fighting rebel forces
led by Laurent Kabila for several months, reportedly fled the
Zairean caital of Kinshasa earlier today for Morocco after rebels
closed in on the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish F-4 fighters and Cobra
helicopter gunships today again bombarded the camps of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The jet fighters took off from the air bases in Diyarbakir
and Erhac, southeastern Malatya province, early this morning and
made 30 sorties to airraid the northern Iraqi regions of Sinat,
Haftanin, Hakurk, Kesan and Sarisavaklar, where the PKK rebels
are based, according to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombardment of the Turkish fighter planes, the
Cobra helicopter gunships strongly attacked the PKK-based five
areas in northern Iraq, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
With the support of artillery fire, the Turkish security
forces and some 150 village guards battled the PKK militants in
the Sarisavaklar region.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish government troops crossed into
northern Iraq Wednesday, and fighting is continuing in the places
of Sinat, Sivi, Begova, Kanimazi, Batufa and Hakurk in the region.
</P>
<P>
Most of the PKK rebels are fleeing toward the Iranian border
and a small group toward the Turkish-Iraqi border, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military operation, the largest in scale over the
past few years, followed a call for aid by Iraq's Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) Chairman Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has strongly protested the Turkish military campaign
against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since August 1984. Its armed wing, based in
northern Iraq, has been waging hit-and-run battles against the
government forces.

COLOMBO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Laksman
Kadirgamar said today that his country is "proud of the quality of
special relations between Sri Lanka and China, because this kind
of friendship is based on mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special meeting to celebrate the 40th anniversary
of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries,
the minister noted that Sri Lanka and China have enjoyed
cooperative and cordial contacts for several millennia.
</P>
<P>
Such contacts covered a wide spectrum of interaction in the
political, economic, social, and cultural fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "On February 7, 1997, we completed four decades
of full relations. Yet, in terms of time, 40 years is a short
period, considering the fact of the existence of state-to-state,
government-to-government and people-to-people interaction ... for
more than 2,000 years between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's new economic policies are a major source
of strength for Sri Lanka as they provide diverse opportunities
for the promotion of investment and trade between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Reform of State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's highest
administrative body, has decided to establish more pilot
enterprise groups to step up the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular just issued by the State Planning
Commission and two other central departments, the number of pilot
enterprise groups will be increased from 57 to 120, and these big
firms will play the leading role in some key industries of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
A modern industrial mechanism will be introduced into these
enterprises, which are expected to operate with a rational
economic structure and strong competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
They will operate on their own, and assume sole responsibility
for their profits or losses, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to allocate and distribute industrial
materials and resources in a more rational manner, and these
enterprises will serve as engines for reforming more state firms.
</P>
<P>
The functions of the government and the enterprises should be
separated, and inter-regional or trans-industrial cooperation
should be encouraged, so as to enable the government to exercise
better macro control.
</P>
<P>
In these enterprises there should be a clear relationship
between the parent companies and the subsidiary companies, the
circular stipulated.
</P>
<P>
The parent companies should have the authority to decide on the
introduction of foreign-financed projects worth up to 30 million
US dollars. In addition, some of the enterprises will have the
authority to handle foreign trade, the circular said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China was unanimously voted into
the International Federation of Accountants last Thursday, an
important sign that Chinese accountants are merging with the world
market.
</P>
<P>
This is another achievement made by the Chinese Institute of
Certified Public Accountants (CICPA) after it became a council
member of the Confederation of Asian-Pacific Accountants at the
end of April this year.
</P>
<P>
All these successes indicate that Chinese accountants are
getting closer to internationally accepted accounting norms,
officials with the CICPA said.
</P>
<P>
China resumed its certified public accountants (CPA) system in
the early 1980s, and the accountancy profession has become the
fastest growing, the most attractive and the most promising new
industry in the service sector as the nation is shifting to a
socialist market economy, said the CICPA officials.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are a total of 124,000 CPAs in
China, with 58,000 of them working with agencies.

<HEADLINE> BIS Official Lauds China's Financial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved remarkable
results in economic development and financial reforms, though it
still has some issues to address, a senior official of the Bank
for International Settlements (BIS) said here today.
</P>
<P>
"China has performed remarkably well in recent years," BIS
General Manager Andrew Crockett said in an interview with Chinese
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He lauded China's success last year in maintaining a high
economic growth rate while cutting inflation significantly.
</P>
<P>
China's gross domestic product, which had been growing nearly
ten percent annually for several years, rose 9.7 percent last
year, whereas its inflation rate measured by the retail price
index went down to 6.1 percent, as against 14.8 percent in 1995
and 21.7 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"As a visitor, one is impressed by the manner in which the
continuation of healthy growth has been combined with a reduction
in the rate of inflation," Crockett said. "That is a very
difficult combination to achieve for a soft landing."
</P>
<P>
China has done as well as any other country in achieving an
economic soft landing, which he said refers to sustaining a high
rate of development and investment while preserving a strong
currency and reducing inflation to a very low level.
</P>
<P>
Crockett said that China's banking reforms have achieved
significant progress, and the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, has played a major part in the realization of the present
good economic situation.
</P>
<P>
China is moving in the direction of applying market-oriented
measures for sustainable growth, he said, adding that the good
economic indicators reflect very much the activities of the
central bank and the instruments it has used.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the progress already made, China has yet to address
a number of issues in the financial sector, the manager pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the BIS, which sets standards for international
banking practices, will support China's effort to further its
financial reforms by providing technical assistance in payment and
settlement services.
</P>
<P>
Often referred to as a club of central banks, the BIS currently
has 41 member banks. China joined the international financial body
last November.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Cheng Jun of China led after the
second round in the China Open golf tournament at Beijing
International Golf Club on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Cheng carded a best of the day two-under-par
70 for a half-way total of two-under-par 142 and a one stroke
lead over first-round leader Hsieh Yu-shu of Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Cheng birdied his first two holes of the day and that gave him
a lot of confidence.
</P>
<P>
Only four players in the field of 144 broke par. American
Mike Cunning carded a one-under-par 71 to finish the day in third
place.
</P>
<P>
Cheng has lived in the shadow of compatriot Zhang Lianwei for
the past couple of years. He turned professional in 1994 but
failed to fulfill his potential.
</P>
<P>
India's Vivek Bandhari, David Bransdon and Rob Stephens of
Australia, Eric Meeks of the United States and Steven Armstrong
of Scotland are in a tie for fourth place on two over par for the
tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met here
today with Nishigaki Akira, president of the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the OECF, as the executive body for Japanese
government loans, has maintained sound cooperative ties with
the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC) and other relevant departments of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the concerted efforts of China and Japan the
first three batches of Japanese government loans to China have
been used successively and have played a major role in
China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the OECF's efforts to implement the loan
projects. He said that he hoped that Akira would make on-the-spot
investigations of the projects for which loans were used in order
to make a proper assessment of the Chinese side's implementation
of the loans.
</P>
<P>
Akira said that he had visited China in 1990 and had been
deeply impressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the successful use of Japanese government loans
in China resulted from the Chinese government's support and
China's reform and opening-up policy. The effective use of the loans
by the Chinese government has won praise and support from
the Japanese people for the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the OECF and he himself will continue their
efforts to make the loaning a success.
</P>
<P>
Akira is here at the invitation of MOFTEC.

</P>
<P>
From the 11 track and field finals, the trio of China, Japan and

</P>
<P>
China stood atop with 44 golds, beating Japan to second on 34 and
South Korea third on 23, while Mongolia opened its gold account with
three from the freestyle wrestling competitions.
</P>
<P>
"We were making our steady steps in the games as our athletes
retained their top forms, and we hope more gold medals from the track
and field events in the coming days," said Wu Shaozhang, Chef de
Mission of the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Kudok Stadium ushered in three Chinese veteran champions
in athletics, including the eldest 30-year-old Li Tong in the Chinese
squad. Three Chinese lifters outpaced their rivals as Xiong Guoming
notched up his first gold as the swimming competition concluded.
</P>

meter hurdles by clocking in 13.67 and 13.70 seconds respectively.
</P>
<P>
Li Tong, current Asian record holder who broke the marks 18 times,
said "we are strong in the discipline, and I alway win over teammate
Chen in international meets while he kept his clean slate against me
at home."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lianbiao, 28, who ranked 11th in Atlanta Olympics, took the
javelin title with his second attempt of 77.80 meters, surpassing his
own games record of 77.56 set in Shanghai in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Jin Ling, Asian record holder of 1.97 meters set in 1989 Japan,
cleared 1.91 meters to take the women's high jump title, beating
Svetlana Zalevskaia of Kazakhstan to second in 1.88 meters who had her
personal best of 1.98 meters set in Pierae Benite, Russia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"I was not sure to win the gold medal, but I was also not to
surrender nothing without exerting my every efforts," said the
1.83-meter slender mother athlete of a two-year-old girl baby.
</P>
<P>
Japan won three gold medals through Yuka Mitsumori in the women's
10,000-meter walk, Yvonne Kanazawa in the women's 100-meter hurdles
and Yasunori Uchitomi in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase.

medals at stake through Zhu Yingwen in the women's 50m freestyle and
Xiong Guoming in the men's 200m individual medley.
</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese swimmers still boasted of a lion's share of
21 out of 31 gold medals, beating China to second with seven, South
Korea with two and Kazakhstan with one.
</P>
<P>
"The games opens a new epoch for a tough Sino-Japanese contest, the
Chinese swimmers have to double their efforts in order to retain their
top spot in Asia, otherwise, their peers from Japan will become the
dominating forces in the pool," said Chen Yunpeng, former head coach
of the Chinese swimming squad.
</P>
<P>
However, Japanese head coach Ueno Koji said "China would garner
most gold medals at the games should it send in its best swimmers
here."
</P>
<P>
Takashi Yamamoto became the sole four-time champions and the sole
swimmer to break the Asian record in the swimming competitions.
</P>
<P>
He clocked in the new record of 1:58.01 to take the men's 200m
butterfly on Thursday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gun Trader Sentenced to 14 Years in Prison (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A man convicted of exporting 2,000
AK-47 rifles to the US was today sentenced to 14 years in prison
in this port city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
In an open trial today the Dalian City Intermediate People's
Court handed down the sentence to Qi Feng, former manager of the
Duoweidi Science and Technology Co. Ltd. in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Three other people, Lu Yilun, Qin Qixiu and Guo
Chengkun, were sentenced at the same trial to three to four years
imprisonment for dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
The court found that in July 1995 Qi Feng and Gu Hanqun, an
American businessman, jointly schemed to purchase disassembled
rifles in China for re-sale in the US.
</P>
<P>
In the same month Qi Feng contacted Qin Qixiu, an employee of
the China North Industries Dalian Corporation, and expressed the
intention of seeking customs clearance for exporting gun parts to the
US in the name of Qin's company.
</P>
<P>
Qin agreed and reported to Lu Yilun, assistant to the general
manager of the China North Industries Dalian Corporation. Lu
immediately approved the deal without asking the higher
authorities for instructions, and asked another company employee,
Guo Chengkun, to help Qin in the business.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996 Gu Hanqun and Qi Feng talked with Qin Qixiu and
Guo Chengkun, and reached an agreement to sell 2,000 disassembled
AK-47 rifles in the US after Gu had agreed to provide a US
import license.
</P>
<P>
On January 25, Qi Feng received from Gu Hanqun an import
license issued by the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau of the
US Treasury Department. Numbered 94-06831, the license approved
the import of 2,000 sets of AK-47 rifle parts from China.
</P>
<P>
Then Qi used counterfeit documents to order 2,000 sets of
parts of the AK-47 rifles at an ordnance repair workshop,
which, according to the contract, repaired 2,000 sets of
discarded rifle parts, and sold them to Qi.

<TEXT>
<P>
Following discussions between Qi Feng and Qin Qixiu, Guo
Chengkun helped Qi to clear customs in the name of the China North
Industries Dalian Corporation. The rifle parts arrived in the US
on February 15, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Qi Feng, who was arrested on December 18, 1996, earned 340,000
RMB yuan in profit and a certain amount of US dollars from the deal.
</P>
<P>
The court noted that all the above-mentioned facts had been
proved by spoken and written testimonies and material evidence, as
well as by the confessions of the four defendants during the trial.
</P>
<P>
It held that Qi Feng, who had turned a blind eye to Chinese law
and engaged in the illicit purchase and export of guns, had
seriously endangered public security and was guilty of trading
guns illegally.
</P>
<P>
It said that the sentence was handed down in accordance with the
stipulations of Article 112 of the Criminal Law of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
It also concluded that Qin Qixiu, Guo Chengkun and Lu Yilun
were guilty of dereliction of duty, for they had failed to perform
their duties as employees of state-owned enterprises, and had
violated the explicit stipulations of their company by helping Qi
to clear customs and export the gun parts.
</P>
<P>
The case was prosecuted by the Dalian City People's
Procuratorate, and the Dalian City Intermediate People's Court
formed a collegiate bench in accordance with the law after
accepting the case.
</P>
<P>
The trial was attended by the defenders of the four accused, as
well as by people from all walks of life and a number of

of the Chinese swimming squad.
</P>
<P>
Ueno Koji, head coach of the Japanese team, felt satisfied with the
feats achieved by his disciples at the East Asian Games, but remained

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers and two
Hezbollah gunmen were killed Thursday night during fierce
clashes in South Lebanon, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
About seven other Israeli soldiers were also wounded in the
fighting, which occurred two kilometers beyond the boundary of
the eastern sector of the Israeli-proclaimed south Lebanon
security zone. The clashes erupted when an Israeli paratroop unit
was ambushed by Hezbollah gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted around 9 p.m. Thursday night and
continued after midnight. Israel retaliated with heavy air and
artillery bombardments of the area, with over 350 shells being
fired within two hours, Israel Radio and televisions reported.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's fighting signaled the escalation of clashes
between the two sides. It was apparently an act of retaliation
launched by Hezbollah which lost four fighters on Monday in a
failed attempt to capture a position held by the pro-Israeli
South Lebanese Army in the eastern sector of the zone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Army has instructed troops in South Lebanon
to take precautions against possible kidnaping plot by the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Syria-based
anti-Israeli Palestinian group.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military officials have charged Iran for having
shipped large quantities of weapons to Hezbollah via Syria in the
past four months. He said the shipments may include some more
advanced weapons, such as long-range Katyusha rockets capable of
reaching Israel's Haifa port in the north.
</P>
<P>
A military officer from the northern command was quoted as
saying that the new weapons acquired by Hezbollah are affecting
the operation of Israeli military helicopters by preventing them
from penetrating further north. But he added that Israel could
find ways to cope with the problem.

<HEADLINE> HK Supreme Court Adopts Chinese Language in Civil Proceedings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Either Chinese or English can be
used in Hong Kong's Supreme Court civil proceedings, it was
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
A judiciary spokesman said that the publication of the new
Rules is an important step towards bilingualism in court. It
allows civil proceedings in the Supreme Court to be conducted in
either or both of the official languages.
</P>
<P>
At present, English has been the only official language in the
High Court, except appeals from the Magistracies, Small Claims
Tribunal and Labor Tribunal. While under the Rule, litigants may
file their documents in court in either Chinese or English.
</P>
<P>
"A judge may choose either of the official languages in the
whole or any part of the proceedings for the just and expeditious
disposal of cases," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Another step towards bilingualism in court would be made on
June 2 when appeals from the Minor Employment Claims Adjudication
Board could also be heard in either or both of the official
languages, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, either English or Chinese can be used in the
Magistracies. Restriction on the use of the Chinese language in
the District Court and the Lands Tribunal was lifted in February
1996. Some other similar restrictions were lifted in December
1996, according to the announcement.

<HEADLINE> World Tourism Body Predicts Growth in Macao Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A leading official of the World
Tourism Organization (WTO) predicts that Macao's tourism sector
will see "ideal growth" well until 2010.
</P>
<P>
Francesco Frangialli, secretary-general of the Madrid-based
WTO, said at a two-day meeting of the WTO's Commission for East
Asia and the Pacific, which concluded here today, that Macao's
tourism will achieve continuous growth in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"Following the opening of the Macao International Airport and
the vigorous efforts to cultivate long-distance market, Macao's
tourism will see an ideal growth within this century and well
beyond the first decade in the 21st century," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Regions Summit Debates on European Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Local and regional leaders and
representatives in the European Union (EU) today started
discussions on how the regions and cities could better contribute
to the European integration.
</P>
<P>
The Summit of the Regions and Cities, opening here on Thursday
with about 300 participants, was focused on issues of employment,
enlargement and the EU's institutional reform.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held before leaders of the 15 EU member states
meet here in July to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference
(IGC) launched in March last year so as to revise the Maastricht
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Baravian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber and Mayor of
the Portuguese city of Oporto Fernando Gomes will draft a report
on the meeting and submit it to the July summit.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting which is important for the Committee of Regions
(CoR), EU's consultative assembly on regional affairs, Stoiber
called for closer ties between the EU and its regions as well as
more involvement of the regional authorities in the process and
implementation of EU's policy making.
</P>
<P>
"Europe must no longer be allowed to restrict the scope of
action of the regions and cities," he said, adding that "instead
it must promote direct responsibility and dynamism on the part of
the regions and cities, for instance in structural policy,
agricultural policy and community aid."
</P>
<P>
Stoiber also urged greater contribution of the regions and
local authorities to reduce the distance between the EU and its
citizens so as to make the European integration more transparent.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the CoR has called for the IGC to rewrite the
Article 3 in the Maastricht Treaty, which sets a division of
responsibility between EU and its member states.
</P>
<P>
The CoR wants to ensure that the new treaty contains a specific
reference to the role of the regions and local authorities in
implementation of "subsidiariness", a concept which means all
action in the public domain must be entrusted to the lowest
institutional level of government.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Warns Against Election Frauds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today warned Interior Ministry officials against any
play around ballot boxes as the countdown starts on the
presidential election scheduled on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of audience at the Friday prayer on the
campus of the Tehran University, Rafsanjani noted it would be
"treason, sin and theft" if the public votes are played around by
officials in charge of the elections.
</P>
<P>
"The change of public votes would have very negative impact
on the society. The people will lose their trust in the
system. This treason will be unforgivable," warned the
64-year-old president.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Rafsanjani's statement reflected a
major concern of the public who feel that officials from the
Interior Ministry in charge of ballot boxes would play around the
votes in favor of their favored presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri is the
front-runner among the four contenders. But local observers say
that Nateq-Nouri is facing powerful challenge by his main rival
Seyed Mohammad Khatami, former minister of culture and Islamic
guidance, who is gaining more and more support from the
intellectual circles and citizens in big cities.
</P>
<P>
A specialist analyzed that Nateq-Nouri would win 60 percent
of votes in rural areas and small cities while Khatami would win
60 percent votes in big cities.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the moderate president on the eve of the
presidential elections also showed that the power struggle in
the Islamic regime is intensifying day by day.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani still called on the public to actively
turn out at the elections, saying "it is the national and
Islamic duty for everyone to cast its vote in the elections. No
one should have any excuse not to vote."
</P>
<P>
He also advised the contenders not to accuse each other or
defame other candidates during the elections.
</P>
<P>
On May 10, Iran launched a nationwide presidential campaign
with main streets inundated with colorful banners, flags and
pictures of presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Leaflets of candidates have been distributed door to door
among millions of Iranian households in early morning or in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
This is the 7th presidential elections since the Islamic
revolution led by late Ayatollah Khomeini toppled the Pahlavi
Dynasty and declared the founding of the Islamic Republic of Iran
in on April, 1979.

demobilization exercise gained in accordance with the Abuja peace
accord, they called on all interested parties in the conflict to

<HEADLINE> British Companies in HK Optimistic About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- British businesses in Hong Kong
are generally confident in their future development, according to
the result of a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the British Chamber of Commerce, found
that 93 percent of companies replying to the questionnaire
confirmed they hoped still to be operating in Hong Kong in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the chamber Patrick Paul said: "The overwhelming
message is of confidence and commitment to Hog Kong. Perceptions
abroad that Hong Kong is in some sort of crisis are totally
unfounded."
</P>
<P>
Access to China came out as the area which the chamber's
members were most optimistic about, and over 80 percent of them
saw the access improving.
</P>
<P>
Sino-British trade relations are another area of optimism, with
more than half the respondents expecting they would improve.
</P>
<P>
When asked if British firms might face discrimination because
of their colonial past, executive director of the chamber
Christopher Hammerbeck said he expected a level playing field to
be maintained in terms of awarding contracts.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Coffee Prices Continue to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan coffee prices will continue
to rally in the near term after touching highest levels since
1994, thanks to the global shortage of mild Arabica coffees, the
Kenyan Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
If good weather prevails, there will be a harvest of
100,000-to-110,000 tons of coffee in 1997/98 in the eastern
African country, the report quoted local traders as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly export auction on Tuesday, quality coffees
gained up to 30 Dollars per 50 kilograms on speculative buying.
</P>
<P>
The traders say prices are a major incentive for farmers to
improve coffee production, threatened in the 1996/97 fiscal year
to end in September by coffee berry diseases from June to July
last year and drought between December and March this year.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the 1996/97 coffee production in Kenya
will at most reach 80,000 tons compared with 97,575 tons in
1995/96 and 95,806 tons in 1994/95, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Premium grade ABs averaged 439 Dollars per 50 kilograms
compared to 403 Dollars last week while grade AAs sold at 451
Dollars from 417 Dollars, according to data from Kenyan Coffee
Auctions Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Traders here put sale prices even higher, at between 472
Dollars and 540 Dollars FAQ (Fair Average Quality) for AAs and
between 462 Dollars and 520 Dollars for ABs.
</P>
<P>
Traders were optimistic that prices would remain firm on
account of a lack of sufficient quality washed Arabica coffees in
the second half of the calendar year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"We can safely say that (Kenyan) coffee prices will remain
stable in the near future because there is a big demand for
Kenyan Coffee, normally used for blending," said Kenya Coffee
Board Public Relations Manager Paul Kivila.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans consume only around five percent of the 80,000-100,000
tons of coffee they produce.

<HEADLINE> UAE Overcomes Deficit, Gains Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A surge in oil prices in 1996
enabled the United Arab Emirates (UAE) not onely overcome the
budget deficit, but also gained a markable surplus, an official
report said today.
</P>
<P>
The UAE had projected a deficit of some 241 million dollars in
its 1996 federal budget, but by the end of the year it recorded a
surplus of 973 million dollars, said a quarterly bulletin issued
by the UAE's Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is the highest surplus in the UAE federal budget since it
started to have the problem of deficit due to weak oil prices in
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the surplus to a surge in actual
revenues by more than 1.1 billion dollars to 5.62 billion
dollars, compared with some 4.5 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The surge came because of higher crude prices which soared by
about three dollars per barrel to an averaged 20 dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 surplus was made in comparison with the actual budget
deficit of 256 million dollars in 1995, the reported showed.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 earnings included around 3.5 billion dollars in oil
income and the rest came from customs and corporate taxes, fees
on government services and return from overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> Police Urged to Work Together Against Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- It was important that police
forces worldwide shared information in the fight against Asian
crime syndicates, said a Hong Kong detective who attended a
two-day crime seminar in Sydney this week.
</P>
<P>
"Asian crime had become very much an international, global
problem," Chief Superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Michael
Dowie was quoted by the Australian Associated Press today.
</P>
<P>
Around 140 police officers attended the sixth
multi-jurisdictional Asian crime seminar, which was addressed by
officers from Honk Kong, the United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Dowie said, "It is very important that we keep in touch with
other jurisdictions, because many of the Hong Kong criminals are
international criminals and they do have an influence in Australia
and in the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Crimes such as drug trafficking, credit card fraud, immigration
fraud, tax fraud and wildlife smuggling were discussed at the
seminar. The potential for Asian crime syndicates to operate in
Sydney during the 2000 Olympics was also talked about.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Geoff Owens of the New South Wales Drug
Enforcement Agency told reporters that "there is a lot of
networking taking place at the seminar and that networking really
provided us with the opportunity to make contact with people
overseas and interstate, so that we can facilitate operations as
they come up".

<HEADLINE> ILO Threatens Nigeria With Sanction Over Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A more punitive measure is likely to
be taken by the International Labor Organization (ILO) against
Nigeria over its continued poor human rights record, the Guardian
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The organization is now prepared to take a formal stand on
the human/trade rights situation in Nigerian, as we are becoming
more and more firm on international labor matters," Bert
Essenberg, director of ILO's regional office, said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although he was not categorical on what the country should
expect, the ILO official disclosed that the idea of setting up an
"ILO special commission of inquiry on the Nigerian situation is
already being floated by the governing council".
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government recently ordered that trade unions in
the country are banned from international affiliation. This,
noted Essenberg, "goes contrary to general trend in Africa."
</P>
<P>
According to him, ILO has asked the Nigerian government to
explain why they took such a decision to which a reply is being
expected.

BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing

China trip will open a new chapter in Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to President Chirac, Qiao recalled his
successful visit to France at the end of March this year, and
expressed his heart-felt thanks for the warm reception he received
during that visit from Chirac, the French parliament, and
government leaders.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said President Chirac's current visit to China is a great
event in bilateral relations, and that the presidents of both
sides have conducted cordial and friendly talks.
</P>
<P>
Qiao voiced his conviction that the president's current visit
will surely be crowned with a success, and further push forward
the development of Sino-French friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, Qiao said, Sino-French ties have
maintained a good momentum for development with the attention and
efforts of leaders of both countries including President Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral friendly cooperation in various aspects including
politics, economy, science and technology, and culture have
continuously developed, and there have been a constant exchange of
visits between leaders of the two sides, noted Qiao, adding that
leaders of the two parliaments have also been in friendly contract.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the Sino-French Joint Declaration, which was signed

aspiration and determination to establish a comprehensive
partnership for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Qiao called the Declaration an important document guiding
bilateral relations, saying that it will bring Sino-French ties
into a new era of development.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to make joint efforts together with the French
side to cooperate more closely to promote the growth of the trend
in the world's multi-polarization and the economic growth of all
countries, to the benefit of humanity, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his visit here is smooth and fruitful, President
Chirac said the joint declaration signed just before his meeting
with Qiao signifies that France-China relations have entered into
a new period.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac went on to say that the world is undergoing
dramatic changes and the development of world situation demands
for a strengthening of cooperation between France and China, and
between Europe and China.
</P>
<P>
Both agreed to further increase exchanges and contacts between
parliaments of the two countries, so as to enhance the mutual
understandings and friendly cooperation between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, President Chirac conveyed greetings to Qiao
from Philippe Seguin, president of the French National Assembly,
and Rene Monory, president of the French Senate.
</P>

his regards to Seguin and Monory.

<HEADLINE> Manila Stocks Plunge for Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange index
fell for the second day today amid rising fears that the peso
would suffer the same fate as Thailand's battered baht.
</P>
<P>
The composite index, which lost 75 points Thursday, closed down
54.96 points today at 2,576.13 while the turnover totaled 5.5
billion shares with a value of 83 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Thailand's financial woes had spilled over to
other regional currencies including the Philippine peso,
triggering heavy selling pressure and sending Asia's main bourses
to plunge.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand itself, the share prices tumbled 4.2 percent at
Thursday morning session after the baht plunged in European trade
to a 10-year low.
</P>
<P>
To defend the peso, the Philippine Central Bank Thursday raised
its overnight borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage points to 12
percent and dumped some 70 million U.S. dollars to buy at the rate
of 1:26.375.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Stock Market just enjoyed a transient recovery
from continued plunges starting from the end of last month to
early this month.

<HEADLINE> ILO Threatens Nigeria With Sanction Over Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A more punitive measure is likely to
be taken by the International Labor Organization (ILO) against
Nigeria over its continued poor human rights record, the Guardian
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The organization is now prepared to take a formal stand on
the human/trade rights situation in Nigerian, as we are becoming
more and more firm on international labor matters," Bert
Essenberg, director of ILO's regional office, said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although he was not categorical on what the country should
expect, the ILO official disclosed that the idea of setting up an
"ILO special commission of inquiry on the Nigerian situation is
already being floated by the governing council".
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government recently ordered that trade unions in
the country are banned from international affiliation. This,
noted Essenberg, "goes contrary to general trend in Africa."
</P>
<P>
According to him, ILO has asked the Nigerian government to
explain why they took such a decision to which a reply is being
expected.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Obtains Strong Trade Surplus for March 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's external trade
surplus for March increased 375.3 percent over that in the
preceding month due to higher exports and lower imports, according
to the Statistics Department today.
</P>
<P>
The trade figures released by the department today show that
Malaysia recorded a surplus of 1.751 billion ringgit (over 700
million U.S. dollars) in March compared with the surplus of 368.5
million ringgit (about 147.4 million U.S. dollars) for February.
</P>
<P>
The country recorded a trade deficit of 102.9 million ringgit
(about 41.16 million U.S. dollars) in January.
</P>
<P>
The improved showing was due to the combined results of higher
exports, which increased 2.8 percent to 18.680 billion ringgit
(about 7.472 billion U. S. dollars) and lower imports, which
showed a drop of 4.1 percent to 16.929 billion ringgit (about
6.7716 billion U.S. dollars), the department said.
</P>
<P>
As for the January-March period this year, Malaysia recorded a
trade surplus of 2.016 billion ringgit (about 806.4 million U.S.
dollars) compared with a deficit of 1.357 billion ringgit (about
542.8 million U.S. dollars) during the same 1996 period, according
to the department.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of 1997, Malaysia's exports rose 3.5
percent to 48.956 billion ringgit (about 19.5824 billion U.S.
dollars) while its imports showed a drop of 3.5 percent to 46.939
billion ringgit (about 18.7756 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's exports during the corresponding 1996 period totaled
47.309 billion ringgit (about 18.9236 billion U.S. dollars) while
imports in the same period totaled 48.666 billion ringgit (about
19.4664 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, thermionic valves and
tubes, photocells and parts continued to be the major source of
revenue, with their receipts amounting to 18.9 percent of the
total exports.
</P>
<P>
Palm oil was the next most important foreign exchange earner,
accounting for 4.3 percent of the total exports.
</P>
<P>
The department said the other products which recorded strong
export increases in the first quarter were liquefied natural gas,
plain plywood, petroleum products and pepper.
</P>
<P>
However, there were big decreases in the exports of rubber,
sawn timber, palm kernel cake and palm kernel oil.
</P>
<P>
As for imports, machinery and transport equipment represented
58.4 percent of the total imports during the first three months
when "lumpy" imports comprising ships, boats and floating
structures, aircraft and associated equipment, fell a whopping
44.4 percent from total imports of 2.2 billion ringgit (about 880
million U.S. dollars) during the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The major import components under the machinery and transport
equipment sector which showed strong increases were automatic data
processing machines and units, heating and cooling equipment
parts, parts and accessories for office machines and automatic
data processing equipment.
</P>
<P>
Others included taps, cocks, valves and similar appliances and
steam or other vapor generating boilers, superheated water boilers
and auxiliary plants and parts.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, Malaysia's major trading partners
were Japan, Singapore, the United States, South Korea, Thailand,
Hong Kong, Germany and the United Kingdom, which combined to
account for 75.5 percent of the total trade value.

<HEADLINE> BHP Leads Australian Share Market to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market was
elevated to a record close today by a leap in the price of key
bluechip BHP and a strong resource sector, offsetting tumbling
bank stocks.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 13.1 points up to 2538.1, after
reaching an intra-day high of 2539.5.
</P>
<P>
The previous record close on the all ordinaries was set earlier
this week, when the market barometer reached 2634.3 on May 13.
</P>
<P>
The share of BHP, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited,
jumped 55.9 cents, or 3.08 percent, to 18.689 Australian dollars
with 7.879 million shares traded worth 145.7 million Australian
dollars (112 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Reynolds &AMP; Co senior broker Peter Struck said most investors
shifted out of the banks into the more attractive resource sector.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index jumped 30.4 points, or 2.13 percent, to
1460.3 while the all industrials fell 4.6 points to 3944.7.
</P>
<P>
CRA rose 38.3 cents to 20.41 Australian dollars, WMC lifted 21
cents to 8.08 Australian dollars, and Wooside Petroleum was 18
cents stronger at 11.20 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank sector plunged 67.6 points to 4450.1 in the wake of
bleak second half earnings predictions from the majors.
</P>
<P>
Struck said sentiments that the profits have peaked contributed
to the fall of the share prices.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 364.76 million shares traded valued
at 1.05 billion Australian dollars (814.8 million U.S. dollars),
with rises outnumbering falls by 586 to 460.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Lower on Rates Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
marginally weaker here today in quiet dealings with traders citing
investor uncertainty over the short-term direction for the
currency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 77.61 U.S. cents, down from
77.66 previously.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the domestic currency remained range-bound between
77.30 and 78.00 U.S. cents in the absence of any clear signals
from the Reserve Bank of Australia or the federal government on
the future course for interest rates.
</P>
<P>
A slide in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese
yen this week, which put downward pressure on the Australian
dollar/yen and Australian dollar/U.S. exchange rates, also had
skewed market views on the local unit.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Australian dollar might ease back next week if
the U.S. Federal Reserve opts to hike interest rates following its
policy meeting Tuesday although they think it unlikely the unit
will fall below 76 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar ended at 90.59/69
Japanese yen, up from 90.24/23.
</P>
<P>
It also was at 1.3213/25 German marks, up from 1.3146/58
previously.

LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has joined Nigeria, Cote
d'Ivoire, Gambia and Togo in bidding for the World Bank's West
Africa Load Center, the "Nigerian Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Director-general of Ghana Ports and Harbors, Kwaku Dolvo
confirmed his country's interests during a recent visit to the
Tincan-Island Port in Lagos, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Ghana is a smaller country, compared with Nigeria, and our
ports are smaller too. But we have very good facilities," Dolvo
reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
He added that every country with a port is likely to show deep
interest in the World Bank's gesture, because of its tremendous
economic potentials.
</P>
<P>
While answering reporters' questions after his visit, Dolvo
observed that Nigeria has the best natural ports in Africa, but
he also remarked Nigerian ports are not fully equipped with the
most relevant time-saving plants and equipment.
</P>
<P>
As to the ship turn around, Dolvo said Abidjan may have an
edge over Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire are widely regarded as the most
competitive candidates in the race for the World Bank's load
center, which is likely to have a great impact in the port and
shipping industry in the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> S'pore's Manufacturing Output Falls in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total manufacturing
output fell 8.5 percent in March this year, compared to a year
ago, as a result of reduced output from a broad spectrum of
industries, the government Economic Development Board (EDB) said
today.
</P>
<P>
The output of the electronics industry declined in March 12.4
percent year-on-year, the EDB said, adding that higher output in
the disk drives, telecommunication equipment and personal
computers segment was more than offset by the declines in the
semiconductor, consumer electronics and other electronics
segments.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry's decline led to the slowdown in the
fabricated metal, rubber and plastic products industries, it said,
adding that declines of 11.6 percent and 18.2 percent were
recorded in the segments respectively.
</P>
<P>
The chemical industries declined 5.2 percent due to reduced
production in petroleum and petrochemical segments, while the
output of the petroleum products fell 16.6 percent as two major
refineries shut down their plants for maintenance during the
month, and the output of petrochemical products dropped 9.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the output of food and beverages declined 13.8
percent with less export orders and keen competition from imports
contributed to a lower output, the EDB said.
</P>
<P>
The transport equipment industry seemed to be the brightest
spot as it grew 3.3 percent mainly because of higher output in the
aviation segment where overseas contracts continued to boost the
repair services and the manufacture of aircraft parts.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Strikes Lebanese Guerrilla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out this
morning four consecutive air raids at guerrilla bases of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon, but
there was not immediate report on casualties.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes fired eight air-to-surface missiles at targets
on the hill of Telal Al-Dhahr in Western Beqaa, some 85
kilometers southeast of the Lebanese capital Beirut, security
sources in the area said.
</P>
<P>
The air raids came several hours following a violent clash
between Hezbollah fighters and Israeli commandos near Telal
Al-Dhahr over the night.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army admitted that in the fighting, which lasted from
9:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) until 0:10 a.m. (2100 GMT), three Israeli
soldiers were killed and seven others wounded, the worst loss
for the 1,000-strong Israeli occupation forces in a single clash
since this year.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted when the Hezbollah militants spotted the
Israeli commandos attempting to infiltrate out of the
Israeli-occupied border strip and showered over the hill upon
them with various weapons.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said one guerrilla was killed, but the
Muslim Shiite fundamentalist organization denied any casualties
among its fighters.
</P>
<P>
The clash added to nine killed and 40 others injured the
Israeli casualties in south Lebanon since this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lake Victoria Threatened by Over-fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Lake Victoria, the second largest
fresh water lake in the world, has been threatened by
over-fishing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report from Uganda Fisheries and Fish
Conservation Association, the total fleet of fishing boats along
the shores of the lake in the country rose from 11,000 in 1970s
to 20,000 by late 1980, involving about 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
And the number of unregistered boats is also very high, the
report said, adding that this has put a lot of strain on the fish
stocks.
</P>
<P>
In another development, fish processing industries have
sprouted in the last six years. By last year, 12 companies, all
located on the shores of the lake, were operational. Fourteen
other companies have been licensed, of which several are under
construction.
</P>
<P>
All these companies rely on Nile perch which was introduced
into the lake in the 1950s. Their production is mainly of chilled
and frozen fish, of which about 90 percent is exported into the
European Union countries, Israel, North America, and Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Due to the increase of fish processing factories, the
country's fish exports increased from 6,238 tons in 1993 to 6,650
tons in 1994 and 7,000 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the figures above do not include exports of
smoked and salted fish of mainly Nile perch by small traders to
Zaire, Rwanda and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Installed production capacity of these fish plants in Uganda
was estimated at 73,000 tons of raw fish per year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the increase of fish processing factories, they are not
only consuming a lot of fish, but also have been encouraging the
catching of immature Nile perch.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen have thus narrowed the mesh of their fish nets from
five inches recommended for the lake to three even two inches for
catching more fishes including immature fishes.
</P>
<P>
Because of this situation, annual fish production in the whole
country decreased from 276,000 tons in 1993 to 213,000 tons in
1994 and 220,000 tons in 1995 respectively. It is estimated that
Lake Victoria provides a half of these figures above.
</P>
<P>
Experts here attributed this situation to the current number
of factories which is more than three times the number
recommended by a marine study carried out at the beginning of
this decade.
</P>
<P>
In short, the experts hold that it is disregard of the
available exploitable resources that has caused over exploitation
of fish in the lake.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still a way out. That is to develop proper
fishing gear and deep fishing methods in the lake with a total
area of 68,000 square kilometers, because though small Nile perch
is being over fished, the giant ones are not being caught.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Office spokesman today
denied reports alleging that Pakistan had asked the United States
to withdraw some of its Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officials
based in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"No such request had been made, nor was this matter discussed
with the U.S. authorities," the spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the government while enunciating its policy on
the case of Ayaz Baloch pointed out that the arrest of Ayaz Baloch
was in accordance with Pakistani laws.
</P>
<P>
Baloch, a local employee of the DEA, has been arrested recently
on charges of involvement in drug trafficking and anti-state
activities.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both countries have had a number of meetings and
these exchanges have already led to a better appreciation and
understanding of each other's points of view, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. government has in fact expressed
its appreciation for Pakistan's continuing strong commitment to
anti-narcotics measures.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan highly values the cooperation and assistance it
receives from the United States towards the common objective of
eradicating this curse," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> China Works Against "White Pollution" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China is moving against "white
pollution" caused by the heaping up of the used plastic products.
</P>
<P>
Ye Ruqiu, deputy director of the State Environmental Protection
Bureau, made the remark at an opening ceremony to launch a
publicity campaign against the "white pollution".
</P>
<P>
With the widespread use of the plastic products such as packing
bags and dinner sets, urban areas in China annually produce some
four million tons of plastic garbage, which cannot be treated.
</P>
<P>
Experts have noted that the final solution to the "white
pollution" problem is to develop the plastic products that can be
treated.
</P>
<P>
At present, one possible solution is to encourage enterprises
and consumers to use environmental-friendly products.
</P>
<P>
China has listed 32 enterprises and 67 kinds of products as
environmental-friendly over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Huge Foreign Exchange Siphoned out of Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Some internationally registered
firms are being siphoning Kenya's foreign exchange to western
countries under the cover of international business, the Kenya
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) had
confirmed the existence of the scheme involving a colossal
amounts of foreign exchange in the wake of economic
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, the CBK investigators learnt of a racket by two
Nairobi-based businessmen who had fled the country with over 30
million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued by the CBK said that a certain
director in one commercial bank was said to have obtained about
370,000 U.S. Dollars from a financial institution on the basis of
forged promissory notes.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the said director similarly obtained from
six local banks a total of about 9 million Dollars through a
motor vehicle firm in which he is said to be a director.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police spokesman Peter Kimanthi told the paper that
police had launched thorough investigations with a view to
uncovering the rackets and were awaiting tangible evidence to
pursue the fraud.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that the dirty tricks being employed in
the schemes involve political conspiracy, blackmail and corruption
and were hampering the CBK's investigations.
</P>
<P>
A senior opposition leader and two business executives are
said to be directly involved in the recent racket, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
The investigations by the CBK came as a result of complaints
by some local banks who complained of abuse of the Import
Declaration Forms (IDF) by a locally-registered firm called
Specialized Lighting System (SLS).
</P>
<P>
The SLS has their orders for goods canceled but the money
they had collected from Kenya in IDF is being retained in a
London bank.
</P>
<P>
The CBK boss Joseph Kamau has confirmed that SLS was being
investigated, said the paper, adding that the flagrant use of IDF
for fictitious business deals was far too common.

Under the new international circumstances, Jiang said, the
common grounds shared by the two countries have not reduced, but
increased.
</P>

Jiang noted that the common views, shared from a strategic
height, on the orientation and characteristics of the

This not only serves as important guidelines for the future
bilateral relations, but will also exert great and far-reaching
impact in the international arena, Jiang said.

Chirac said he was convinced that his current visit is an
important step for the development of the France-China relations
in the right direction.

<HEADLINE> Technology Markets Prosper in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 16 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, as more
manufacturers became market-oriented and aware of science and
technology, demand for technology has been growing in east China's
Zhejiang Province, where technology markets have flourished.
</P>
<P>
Technology markets first appeared in the province a decade or
so ago in the form of "crop hospitals", "scientific and
technological development centers", "development companies", and
"intermediary companies", but their business was quite small.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is one of the areas which have seen fast economic
growth in China since it started its reform and opening-up drive
in the late 1970s and the province reports a billion yuan in
technology business annually, local sources say.
</P>
<P>
This has made it possible for technology markets to become a
permanent fixture in many areas, said an official in charge of
technology market work of the provincial commission of science and
technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
visiting French President Jacques Chirac signed the Joint
Sino-French Declaration on the establishment of a comprehensive
partnership here this morning. The full text is as follows:
</P>
<P>
SINO-FRENCH JOINT DECLARATION
</P>
<P>
 Establishing Comprehensive Partnership
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of President Jiang Zemin of the People's
Republic of China, the President of the French Republic, Jacques
Chirac, paid a state visit to China, as of May 15, 1997. Following
friendly talks, the two parties have had in-depth exchanges of
views on the major international issues of the day and have
reached a broad identity of views, in the following terms.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, 1964, the establishment of the diplomatic
relations between the People's Republic of China and the French
Republic, opened the way to an international order based on
cooperation beyond oppositions.
</P>
<P>
The development of a new-type relationship between Europe and
Asia since the Bangkok Summit held in March 1996 opens up the
prospects of a reinforcement of economic cooperation and political
dialogue between the two continents.
</P>
<P>
At the dawn of the 21st century, the time has come for China
and France to prolong this initiative with a long-term,
comprehensive partnership aimed at moving Sino-French relations
into a new phase of development. Both parties have decided to
engage in reinforced cooperation, to foster the march towards
multipolarity, to support efforts to create wealth and well-being,
on the basis of respecting plurality and independence, to
contribute to the establishment of a new political and economic
international order that is both just and rational, and to oppose
any attempt at domination in international affairs, so that a new
world that is more prosperous, more stable, more secured and more
balanced can be brought about.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing Multipolarity
</P>
<P>
The two parties held that the world today is undergoing
profound changes, and is moving towards a multipolarity that is
replacing the bipolar structure inherited from the past. The
international situation is overall tending towards detente, but
there still exist a number of foci of tension. Peace and
development remain the two priority goals of human society.
</P>
<P>
Both parties note that the two countries, as permanent members
of the United Nations Security Council, have a special
responsibility in international affairs, and that a China in full
growth and a united Europe will play an important role in a new
multipolar world. The deepening of Sino-French and Asian-European
relations will have a positive impact on the international
situation at large.
</P>
<P>
In the new international situation, China and France will
strive to promote a better balance between small and large
nations, among the great regions of the world and between rich and
developing countries, in the political, economic, cultural,
linguistic, scientific and technical fields.

policy of peace. Countries and peoples of the world should
develop their cooperation, live on good terms with each other,

of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and seeking common
ground while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
Advancing the Reform of the United Nations
</P>
<P>
The two parties attach importance to the UN's primordial role
in the preservation of international security and peace. They
support a limited enlargement of the Security Council that would
make it possible to maintain its effectiveness and ensure that a

account the way international relations have evolved. The status
of permanent members as defined by the Charter must be respected.
</P>
<P>
Promoting Disarmament
</P>
<P>
Both parties deem that it is possible to make progress on the
road of disarmament. The two countries are resolved to work hard
for the validity as soon as possible of the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty. They appeal for a speedy start to the negotiation
of a convention banning the production of fissile material for
nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; they welcome
the coming into force of the Convention on Chemical Weapons; they
hope that progress will be made towards the settlement of the
question of antipersonnel mines, namely, in the framework of the
Disarmament Conference, taking into account the legitimate
security concerns of all parties involved and seeking a balanced
solution.
</P>
<P>
The two parties further emphasize the necessity to prevent the
proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and to
strengthen the universality and efficacy of the international
regime for fighting proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. Both the Chinese and French sides express their
readiness to exercise their stringent controls of sensitive
exports that could contribute to the proliferation of weapons of

and will beef up their cooperation in the fight against this
scourge.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening Development Aid

advanced countries, of which more than two thirds are in
sub-Saharan Africa, including through North-South cooperation and
South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Supporting Multilateral Trade
</P>
<P>
The two parties reaffirm their attachment to an efficient, fair
and open multilateral trading system. They welcome the recent
momentum of the negotiations on the accession of China to the

an earlier date, on the basis of equivalent rights and
obligations.

<P>
The two parties deem that differences in the historical,
cultural, economic, philosophical and social spheres are a source
of enrichment for the common assets of mankind. Following this
guideline, they hold, constructive and serious dialogue, rather
than confrontation, should be conducted in settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
The two parties emphasize that the aims and principles of the
United Nations Charter, and the universality of human rights
should be respected in the course of promoting and protecting
human rights, while giving full consideration to the respective
due particularities.

<P>
It is the wish of both parties that the constructive dialogue
between China and the European Union on human rights issue should

<HEADLINE> Coastal Areas Step Up Oceanic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province,
which has the longest coastal line in the country, plans to set up
a special fund for oceanic development within the year.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials hope that foreign investors will have
interest in the oceanic projects.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, mapping out regulations to protect and
develop oceanic resources is also progressing.
</P>

Besides Zhejiang, all the coastal provinces and cities in China
have worked out their plans to develop and protect the oceanic
resources.
</P>
<P>
China has a coastal line of 18,000 km and a sea area of more
than three million sq km. The output value of China's oceanic
industry accounts for four percent of the national gross product;
the figure for developed nations is about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials have attached great importance to the oceanic
industry. All the coastal provinces and cities have set up organs
in charge of marine affairs. To promote the oceanic resources
development, the provinces and cities have improved the
construction of infrastructure.

<P>
Zhejiang has decided to give priority to eight areas in
developing oceanic resources: salt water cultivation and high-sea
fishing, petroleum and gas development, oceanic engineering, usage
of salt water, marine biological engineering, oceanic energy
resources, disaster relief, and remote sensing technology
application.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Stock Exchange Ends Week Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Trading on the floor of the Dhaka
Stock Exchange (DSE) registered a significant rise as the
investors responded positively to the changes in the DSE Council
including its chairman.
</P>
<P>
The price index, the barometer of the stock prices, reached
1144.58 points Thursday, 82.36 points higher than the previous
week's closing of 1062.22.
</P>
<P>
Turnover increased remarkably last week as the bourse
experienced a balanced trading when both sellers and buyers were
active. Of the listed 212 issues, 136 changed hands at the
valedictory session which was highest in terms of transacted
issues so far this year.
</P>
<P>
However, prices of the traded issues fluctuated during the
period. Most of the issues posted rise, some issues incurred
marginal loss and some issues remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The traditional market leader Beximco Pharma was the major
gainer of the week as the issue registered a gain of about 54 Taka
(about 1.3 U.S. dollars) per share on speculative buying. There
was speculations in the market that Beximco Pharma would declare
healthy dividends and bonus shares soon.
</P>
<P>
The other major gainers of the week were ALCL (Pran), Quasem
Drycells, Shine Pukur Holsing, Olympic Industries, Padma Textile
and BTC.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Bangas Limited, Lonon Jute Stafflers and Lodern
Dyeing incurred losses. Besides, prices of the issues in the
textile sector remained almost static last week.
</P>
<P>
The investors regained their confidence in the capital market
as a new face took over the DSE leadership from Imtiyaz Hussain,
who was accused of share market manipulation.
</P>
<P>
The DSE Council Sunday removed its chairman Imtiyaz in a
no-confidence motion and elected MA Hug Howlader as the new
chairman. As a result, the market witnessed lively trading last
week, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
However, some brokers apprehended that the share prices would
tumble again as the former DSE chairman was planning to challenge
his removal in the court.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Up 3.8 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy grew 3.8
percent in the first quarter of this year amid mixed growth
performance, the Ministry for Trade and Industry announced today
when publishing the economic survey of the first quarter 1997.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector shrank 6.7 percent, down further from
0.7 percent a quarter earlier due to weak electronics demand,
while all major industries, except for chemicals, declined during
the quarter, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that apart from disk drives and
telecommunications equipment, other electronics segments such as
personal computers, consumer electronics and semiconductors
remained weak.
</P>
<P>
The non-electronics segments performed weakly due to structural
and industry-specific factors, it said, adding that growth in the
petroleum industry was affected by plant shutdowns while printing
and publishing continued to face keen competition. The only bright
spot was chemicals due to increased capacity coming on stream.
</P>
<P>
The financial and business services sector grew 10.5 percent,
up from ten percent a quarter earlier. Domestic credit remained
healthy, while business services continued to perform strongly,
expanding 8.4 percent on the back of strong information technology
and headquarters activities.
</P>
<P>
Commerce sector growth slowed to three percent. Entrepot trade
was dampened by sluggish regional growth and weak electronics
demand. The retail sub-sector remained affected by structural
factors, with sales growing 0.6 percent as a result that only
selected segments like furniture and clothing received a boost
from festive spending.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that transport and communications growth
was healthy at 7.6 percent in the first quarter, as the
communications sub-sector benefited from impending liberalization
of the mobile telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, despite the cooling property market, construction
growth remained healthy at 10.7 percent. The survey showed that
though contracts awarded in the first quarter of this year
declined 1.6 percent to 3.7 billion Singapore dollars (about 2.55
billion U.S. dollars), public-sector demand, especially in
residential activity, remained strong. Total contracts awarded are
expected to reach 18 billion Singapore dollars (about 12.41
billion U.S. dollars) this year, a bit lower than 1996.

LUSAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A commodity exchange scheme, known
as Kapiri Commodity Exchange (KCE) has been opened in Kapiri
Mposhi in Zambia's Central Province by a private agricultural
asset management company, Cornplus, to help farmers market their
produce.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press today, the company's Executive
Director Mululula Chilufya said that the KCE will be used as a
vehicle through which farmers will buy and sell inputs and
agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
The KCE is the second agricultural commodity exchange in the
country to one based in Lusaka. Some of its objectives are to
encourage the growth of the commodity market in Zambia by
providing trade information, good and fair mechanism for
commodity pricing.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to facilitate the marketing of agricultural
commodities by offering storage services and performing the dual
purpose of trading and distribution of produce.
</P>
<P>
It will also encourage the growth of commodity market and
provide a channel for speculative investment in the agricultural
sector.

<HEADLINE> China Pushes County-Level Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Comprehensive reform at China's
county-level is an important component of building the socialist
market economic system.
</P>
<P>
This view was shared by over 200 Chinese officials, economists
and scholars attending a national seminar on economic reform in
counties, which opened Thursday at Yiwu City in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that over 80 percent of the
population in China live in counties. Last year, 60 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) and half of the commodity
retail sales came from counties.
</P>
<P>
At present, the industrial output yielded by counties across
the country makes up half of China's total. Workers on the
payrolls of rural enterprises in counties surpassed the number
employed by the state-owned enterprises in the country, said Gao
Shangquan, vice-president of the China Society for Research on the
Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth at the county level will define national
economic development and is the basis of social and political
stability in China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Gao stated, that the majority of counties are facing
such problems like overstaffed government institutions, irrational
economic structure, some 50 percent of the counties need financial
allowance, nearly 60 million people still do not have adequate
food and clothing, and the gap between the counties in the western
and eastern regions is widening. "In-depth reform is the only way
to solve these problems," participants said.
</P>
<P>
Experts called on all counties to speed up the integration of
urban and rural development and diversify the rural economy.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Seeks 3.5 Billion-Dollar Loan from Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
intends to borrow 3.5 billion US dollars from international
financial organizations and foreign governments by the year 2000,
according to a senior provincial official.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be used to finance more than 60 projects
scheduled for the 1996-2000 period and feasibility studies,
executive vice-governor Cong Fukui said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the projects, such as those concerning water supply in
the rural and urban areas, environmental protection, and
afforestation in poverty-ridden areas, will be covered by loans
from the World Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lendings by the Asian Development Bank will be pumped into a
power plant and part of the Beijing-Shanghai expressway that runs
through Hebei, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The province is also seeking loans from the World Bank and foreign
governments to finance the construction of road systems around the
provincial capital and a number of other projects, Cong said.
</P>
<P>
Cong said that Hebei has since the 1980s implemented a total of
181 projects funded by overseas loans, with the combined amount
reaching 1.5 billion US dollars, 30 percent of the total
investment used by the province.
</P>
<P>
"The loans have to some extent eased our province's fund
shortage and helped accelerate construction of a large number of
key projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
The projects supported by overseas loans have played a positive
role in helping Hebei improve its infrastructure, basic
industries, and ecology, Cong noted.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Gov't Keeps 1997 Growth Forecast of 5-7 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government said
today that it retains its earlier 1997 economic growth forecast of
five to seven percent, though the country's economy grew 3.8
percent in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
In releasing the Economic Survey for the first quarter 1997,
the Ministry of Trade and Industry said that the slower growth
scored in the first quarter was due mainly to the decline in the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
"Electronics and electronics-related industries remained weak
as a result of the slowdown in global electronics demand. Entrepot
trade and the transport sub-sectors were similarly affected," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry said that on the external front, the
growth outlook for industrialized and regional countries remained
healthy. The United States is likely to remain strong, it said,
adding that the European Union is expected to continue its
recovery while Japan will grow more slowly than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that there are some signs of a pickup in global
electronics demand, with stronger demand for electronics
components and continued inventory adjustments in the United
States. Industry analysts are also generally optimistic about a
global recovery in semiconductors demand, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, forward-looking indicators like the Composite
Leading Index and business expectations remain generally
favorable, while business expectations for manufacturing have
become more positive, with selected electronics and chemicals
manufacturers expecting better business, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
However, it also warned that the recovery of the various
components is likely to be uneven, and the pace and timing of the
recovery also remain uncertain.
</P>
<P>
"Taking all these factors into consideration, the Ministry of
Trade and Industry retains its earlier 1997 growth forecast of
five to seven percent," it said.

<HEADLINE> Fish Canning Firms Rush to Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Five fishing companies have
proposed a total investment of 13.7 billion Tanzania Shillings
(about 22.8 million US Dollars) in Zanzibar's fisheries industry,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Director General of Zanzibar Investment Agency, Hemed
Hikmany told reporters in the town of Zanzibar on Thursday that
the proposed ventures could have taken off earlier if a wrangle
over the territorial boundary between Zanzibar and Tanzania
Mainland was not the obstacle.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have reached a compromise over the border and
foreign owned as well as locally based companies may soon start
fishing and canning their catches, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hikmany, Africa Fishing Company which has leased
premises and equipment from Zanzibar Fishing Corporation would go
to sea before the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Oman-based fishing firm, Asmak Oman, which had set up an
office in Zanzibar in 1992 and pulled out a year later, has
decided to return and install fish storage facilites at different
locations around Zanzibar and Pemba isllands.
</P>
<P>
Hikmany said Zanzibaris who have grown up by the sea, will
find employment and business opportunites in three other
companies, namely, Sea Fisheries, Ocean Seafood of Bumbwini
Makoba in North Zanzibar, and South Africa-based Fish shipping
Agency.

<HEADLINE> China to Cement Ties with Malaysia: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin spoke
highly of the smooth development of Sino-Malaysian ties during his
meeting with visiting Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah
Bin Haji Badawi here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the recent years have witnessed sound
advancement of the bilateral ties since the two countries share
each other's views on many issues.
</P>
<P>
For the long-term interests of the two countries, and peace and
prosperity of the Asian region as a whole, the two countries
should enhance their cooperation to establish mutual trust and
good-neighborly ties oriented towards the 21st century, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said that the leaders of the two countries have
exchanged visits frequently, and the cooperation of the two
nations in various fields have constantly increased.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Badawi said, China has made important
contributions to the development of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) by enhancing its ties with ASEAN and
actively participating in various dialogues and cooperation with
ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China stands for a multi-polar world because
such a world is beneficial to peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
As a big developing country, China would like to make its
contribution to safeguarding peace and promoting development, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed appreciation at Malaysia's efforts to push
forward China's ties with ASEAN. He expressed his hope that
Sino-ASEAN relations would enjoy more progress.
</P>
<P>
Badawi spoke highly of China's rapid development in recent
years, saying that Malaysia and ASEAN have always regarded China
as a "good friend and good neighbor", and never hold the view that
a strong China will pose threat to peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Those who hold the theory of "China threat" are ignorant about
China, he said, adding that Malaysia and ASEAN both believe that
China's development will make a positive contribution to the
peace, stability, and prosperity of the region.
</P>
<P>
Badawi conveyed Prime Minister Datuk Mahathir's warm regards to
Jiang, for which Jiang expressed his thanks.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
have agreed to revert to a common budget day in order to allow
smooth implementation of policy decisions which need the
co-operation of the three countries, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Following the agreement, ministers of finance of the three
countries will announce budget proposals for the next financial
year in their respective parliaments on June 12.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of the East African Co-operation (EAC),
the partner states have outlined specific areas for common action
in order to enhance economic integration of the region.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Uganda are scheduled to unveil the budgets on June
12, but Tanzania was looking on the possibility of rescheduling
its budget day from June 19 to coincide with its partners in the
EAC.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Tanzanian National Assembly, Pius Msekwa, told
the official "Daily News" recently that the decision to have a
common budget day was reached by the EAC Authority, during the
summit held in Arusha, northern Tanzania recently.
</P>
<P>
He said the move was in line with the spirit of strengthening
co-operation in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
Until the collapse of the East African Community in 1977, the
three countries unveiled their budgets at the same day.

<HEADLINE> Ruins of 2,500-Year Old Great Wall Discovered in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The ruins of part of the
2,500-year old Great Wall have been discovered in Tangxian County
in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The 10-km Great Wall ruins were found on the Maershan Mountain
near Caizhuang Village, 150 km north of the capital city
Shijiazhuang.
</P>
<P>
A local archaeologist said the Great Wall was built by
Zhongshan Kingdom (506-296 B.C.) in north China. The kingdom had
existed for more than 200 years under threats and attacks from
many powerful kingdoms in the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476
B.C.) and the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists and historians still know little about the
kingdom owing to the lack of historical relics and records, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery will help strip away the myths of the kingdom
and prove that the country's oldest Great Wall was built in the
Warring States Period, 100 years earlier than the famous sections
of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.)," the archeologist added.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Sign Peace Accord with Tribal Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
preparing to sign an accord with the tribal rebels in southern
Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) before the expiry of the current
ceasefire on June 30, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also wants to sign the peace
agreement before the expiry of the tenure of the three hill
district councils on July 5, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
A consensus was reached on all issues on Wednesday between the
government delegation and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sahhati
Samiti (PCJSS), the political wing of the armed tribal rebels, to
bring peace in the trouble-torn CHT.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the 1970s, the independence-seeking tribal
insurgents have launched a bloody bush war, which cost thousands
of lives, in the 14,200 square kilometer region, rich in
hydrocarbon deposits and teak.
</P>
<P>
The government in the talks agreed to re-elect the three
district councils and will make those more effective under elected
leadership, having wide powers and enjoying special status with a
tribal person heading each and non-tribals also having adequate
representation.
</P>
<P>
The other main issues both sides agreed on are: the security
forces would stay in CHT in cantonments, Bangalee settlers are to
vacate occupied lands belonging to tribal people, insurgents are
to lay down their arms and the government will arrange their
resettlement under a package.
</P>
<P>
The PCJSS delegation, headed by Shantu Larma, has left Dhaka
Thursday afternoon for their makeshift headquarters, ending four
and a half days of negotiations with the National Committee on
CHT.
</P>
<P>
"We would be back in the city again to initial the peace deal,"
claimed Shantu Larma before his departure.

<HEADLINE> 8 Israeli Casualties Reported in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- There were eight Israeli
casualties in overnight heavy fighting in South Lebanon between
Hezbollah forces and Israeli troops, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Hebrew daily Haaretz reported that heavy fighting occurred
around the northeastern sector of the south Lebanon security
zone when a group of Israeli soldiers were ambushed by Hezbollah
gunmen. It said there were at least eight Israeli casualties in
the fighting, but this has not been officially confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted around 9 p.m. Thursday night in the
Zumriyya area and continued after midnight. Israel retaliated
with heavy air and artillery bombardments of the area, with over
350 shells being fired within two hours, Israel Radio and
televisions reported without giving the number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's fighting signaled the escalation of clashes
between the two sides. It was apparently an act of retaliation
launched by Hezbollah which lost four fighters on Monday in a
failed attempt to capture a position held by the pro-Israeli
South Lebanese Army in the eastern sector of the zone.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, one Hezbollah gunman was killed in the Ali Tahr
hill range in the eastern sector. In a separate incident late
Wednesday night, Hezbollah forces fired Sagger missiles at two
Israeli tanks in the Barasheet area in the western sector,
damaging one tank but causing no Israeli casualties. Israel
responded with heavy shelling of Hezbollah targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Army has instructed troops in south Lebanon
to take precautions against possible kidnaping plot by the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Syria-based
anti-Israeli Palestinian group.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Washington Thursday, Israeli Coordinator on
Lebanon Uri Lubrani claimed that Iran had shipped large
quantities of weapons to Hezbollah via Syria in the past four
months.
</P>
<P>
He said the shipments may include some more advanced weapons,
such as long-range Katyusha rockets capable of reaching Israel's
Haifa port in the north.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied the 15-kilometer wide self-proclaimed
south Lebanon security zone since 1985 under the excuse of
protecting security of its north. The Hezbollah forces have been
fighting a vigorous battle to liberate the zone from the Israeli
occupation.

<P>
MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Military and defense officials from
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will
start a five-day meeting here next Monday to discuss "the
political and security implications of an expanded ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
A sequel to the ASEAN Defense Technology Exchange (ADTEX)
conference in 1995, ADTEX '97 "hopes to contribute to the thrust
of the ASEAN Regional Forum to foster confidence building measures
among its members," said a statement issued here today by the
ADTEX Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the statement said, the participants will
tackle regional security and development issues and articulate
specific insights and perspectives.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of direct and meaningful communication among
military professionals has inspired the formation of ADTEX whose
vision is to be part of the active and reinforcing organizations
advocating and working for peace in Asia," the statement said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls Off Meeting With Ross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat called off a meeting with U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross, which was to have taken place
Thursday night, according to a report of the state-run Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an announcement released by the Arafat's
Office, as saying that the Palestinian leader was too busy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a planned meeting for today between the heads of
the Israeli General Security Service and Palestinian Preventive
Security Service has also been canceled.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was to take place at the U.S. Embassy in Tel
Aviv. The two sides met at the embassy last week.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator, told reporters
Thursday that what is needed is a freeze of the Jewish
settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, and is,
particularly, an end of the construction of the settlement at
Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said bitterly that the Palestinians had not heard this
from Mr. Ross and that, in effect, the settlement will
continue.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived in the region last week, has shuttled
between Israeli and Palestinian leaders in an attempt to
revive the peace talks that have broken off for two months
since March. But his mediation turned out to be a failure.
</P>
<P>
Ross also visited Cairo and Amman. He is leaving for
Washington later today.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Indonesia's Ill-Fated Aircraft Still </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The flight recorder (black box) of
the Indonesia's Merpati Nusantara Airlines (MNA) aircraft which
crashed in Tanjung Pandan, South Sumatera, on April 19, 1997, has
been returned to Indonesia, but the cause of the mishap was still
unknown.
</P>
<P>
"We have received it from Australia about two weeks ago, and
the Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee is still studying
the case in their regular meetings, while the final outcome is
still unknown," MNA spokesman Prasetyo Wisaksono said here today.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated ATP-type aircraft flying from Jakarta to Tanjung
Pandan on April 19, went down when about to land at Buluh Tumbang
airport in Tanjung Pandan.
</P>
<P>
Built by British Aerospace, the plane had 48 people on board,
and 15 people, including its crew of three, were killed in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
Prasetyo said the committee meeting will also provide the
government with inputs on the condition of MNA's grounded ATPs.
</P>
<P>
"The committee will report the outcome of the investigation to
the government, and it would then be up to the government whether
or not the ATPs would remain grounded," he said.
</P>
<P>
On April 21, Transportation Minister Haryanto Dhanutirto
ordered the grounding of Merpati's all ATPs until the cause of the
accident has been established.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: Business Partnership Must Be Fully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto urged
big businessmen to fully implement the government business
partnership program which they have pledged to support.
</P>
<P>
Addressing businessmen attending the 1997 business partnership
meeting Thursday in Bogor Palace, West Java, the president said
that the program was a constitutional mandate, reports reaching
here today said.
</P>
<P>
At least 600 conglomerates and small businessmen attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Partnership activities should be based on mutual benefit and
interdependence, said the president.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "partnership is not an ordinary cooperation,
but should be accompanied by education and development from big
business in order to assist small enterprise."
</P>
<P>
Soeharto launched a national business partnership forum in May
last year to boost cooperation between large and small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The forum groups 41 large business leaders who signed a deal in
Jimbaran, Bali, to help the government eradicate poverty by
forging a partnership with small enterprises and cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The group has set up Pt. Mitra Dana Jimbaran with paid-up
capital of 50 billion rupiah (22.2 million US dollars) to provide
cheap financing to targeted enterprises and cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Soeharto said, several partnerships have been
established in seven provinces involving 600 conglomerates and
300,000 small business and cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
"Partnership between large and small enterprises will help
Indonesian business face economic globalization and will also
modernize Indonesia's economy," Soeharto added.
</P>
<P>
There are 34 million cooperatives comprising small-scale
enterprises in Indonesia, who are eager to participate in the
partnership program. Minister of Cooperatives and Small
Enterprises Subiakto Tjakrawerdaya said the number could be
covered by the program in 10 years.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have agreed to
jointly search for remains of American servicemen missing in the
Korean War, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will conduct three joint recovery operations
this year and the first one is expected to begin within a month,
Pentagon spokesman Larry Greer said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has agreed to pay the DPRK 105,000
U.S. dollars in expenses for each joint excavation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK agreed to give U.S. investigators access to the
Fatherland Liberation War Museum in Pyongyang for information on
missing U.S. servicemen, Greer said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached on Wednesday after five days of talks
between the two sides in New York last week.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,100 Americans are still listed as missing from the
Korean War, and as many as 4,000 remains potentially could be
recovered, Greer said.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said further talks are needed to agree on the
exact sites to be excavated.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Italy fully supports Georgia's bid to
integrate with Europe, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi told
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy has had an explicit policy: Europe should
not only be a union of the north European nations, and
international organizations should expand towards the south and
east of the continent.
</P>
<P>
So, he continued, the relationship between Europe and Georgia
is part of a political program rather than an isolated issue.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze arrived here Wednesday for a two-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
He said the more than 10 agreements, on issues ranging from
bilateral ties to scientific cooperation, signed between the two
countries during his stay here are of great significance to
Georgia, a former Soviet republic which has been undertaking
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Georgian leader also met Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini on bilateral relations, and ties between
the European Union and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze expressed appreciations for the role Italy has
played in stabilizing and developing central-eastern Europe and

<HEADLINE> Cuba Welcomes Planned Visit by Spanish Royalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- After a road accident two months ago
that strained Cuban-Spanish relations, Cuba welcomes a planned
visit by Spanish King Juan Carlos I and Queen Dona Sofia, the Foreign
Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Cuba always hopes to maintain normal ties with its former
metropolis and to strengthen them, although there are highs and
lows occurring in the process, said Cuban Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Marianela Ferriol.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish newspaper today quoted Spanish Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes as saying the royal couple was planning a visit to the
Caribbean island. But Matutes did not give a date.
</P>
<P>
Relations had soured when a Spanish tourist was detained by
Cuban police in March after a traffic accident. He was released
after the Spanish embassy paid the bail.
</P>
<P>
While hailing the royal visit, Ferriol also criticized the
Spanish parliament decision to deprive Cuba of its right as a full
member to attend the Spanish parliamentary summit later this month
in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban parliament was invited only as an observer this year,
despite its previous participations as a formal member.
</P>
<P>
Ferriol said that Cuban Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon
rejected such an attitude.
</P>
<P>
Cuban-Spanish ties began to cool after the Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar took office in May, 1996. It worsened
last November when Havana rejected the ambassador to Cuba, Jose
Coderch, who had said his embassy would be open to opponents of
the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
Spain has not named a new ambassador to Cuba since then.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hard, Positive Step Towards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of Pakistan
and India have taken a hard, yet positive step towards
normalization of relations between the two South Asian nations
who fought three wars in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart Inder Kumar Gujril had a meeting this week in Male,
capital of the Maldives, at the ninth Summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation and discussed a wide range of
issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the first meeting between the top executives of the two
countries since April 1993.
</P>
<P>
In their 90-minute talks the two leaders agreed to release
civil prisoners stranded in both countries and to establish a hot
line between them to have a consistent contact.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to set up working groups aimed at resolving
all outstanding issues including the Kashmir issue and continue
the foreign secretary-level talks.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the meeting was "constructive and meaningful,"
while Gujril termed it as "very warm."
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which broke the deadlock in relations between the
two South Asian neighbors, is widely hailed as a "breakthrough"
and a new start in the process of normalization of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The most encouraging thing is that the two leaders had their
first face-to-face meeting and expressed their desire to resolve
all outstanding issues between the two countries through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two sub-continental nations have long
been abnormal and sometimes strained since they gained
independence in 1947 mainly due to the Kashmir issue on which the
two still stick to their respective positions.
</P>
<P>
The three wars in 1947, 1965 and 1971, the first two caused by
the Kashmir issue, deteriorated the Pak-Indian relations and made
the two countries keeping their defense expenditures escalating.
</P>
<P>
The huge defense expenditures hindered greatly the
socio-economic development of the two countries where most people
are still living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India, the two biggest countries in the region who
shared the same historical past, are now facing the same tasks to
develop the economy and improve the living standard of the
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and Gujril, who assumed the premiership respectively in
February and April this year, have vowed to try their best to
improve the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
At the end of March, the two countries resumed the foreign
secretary-level talks which had been suspended for more than three
years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that though the Male meeting has achieved
some positive results, it is unrealistic to predict that relations
between Pakistan and India will be normalized over night.
</P>
<P>
There are still many obstacles, the Kashmir issue in
particular, on the way towards the establishment of good
neighborly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both Pakistan and India, in fact, have been victims of the old
colonialism. There is no reason for them to be hostile to each
other today when the rest of the world has focused on seeking
cooperation for economic development.

YANGON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh arrived here today, beginning his two-day official
visit to Myanmar at the invitation of Chairman of the Myanmar
State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and Prime
Minister Senior-General Than Shwe.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Chavalit to visit Myanmar since he
became prime minister last November.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral issues such as economic cooperation and trade, and
regional issues such as ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) and Mekong region cooperation are expected to be high on
the agenda in talks between Chavalit and Myanmar leaders during
the visit.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, a member of ASEAN, has adopted a "constructive
engagement" policy towards Myanmar and has become the third
largest investor in the country after Britain and Singapore, with
over one billion U.S. dollars at the end of March this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chavalit, commenting on the current United States'
economic sanctions against Myanmar, said despite the U.S.
unilateral move against the country, ASEAN should stick to its
decision on accepting Myanmar as a member, stressing that ASEAN
should pursue its 1995 decision on inclusion of Myanmar in ASEAN
and making clear that Thailand will not be swayed from adhering to
its position to support Myanmar in becoming an ASEAN member,
according to Thai official sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Italian-led Multinational
Protection Force (MPF) deployed in Albania now numbers 6,400,
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta said in a report to
the parliament today.
</P>
<P>
He said the MPF in Albania would shortly be expanding its
deployment northwards, eastwards and southwards.

</P>
<P>
The force's units carried out daily patrols to ensure freedom
of movement in the cities and along main roads by day and night,
Andreatta said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the difference between Italy's commitment within
the MPF to help create a climate of security in Albania, and its
bilateral activities, which include naval and coastguard patrols
to try to reduce the number of Albanians fleeing across the
Adriatic to Italy.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 have so far fled to Italy since the crisis
broke out in March, the report said.
</P>

BANGKOK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has approved a
budget of 126.61 million baht (5.06 million US dollars) to help
exporters obtain raw materials at a lower cost as part of its plan
to promote exports, according to Commerce Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
The budget, covering 1998 to 2001, will help exporters identify
new sources of raw materials. In addition, the money will be used
to help business cut production costs.
</P>
<P>
Wisitsee Chintana, senior official of the Commerce Ministry,
said the Commerce Ministry will have a meeting with exporters on
May 21 to identify ways to maximize the budget.
</P>
<P>
Thai commercial officers overseas will be in charge of the
project. Wisitsee said local producers of animal feed, fishmeal,
maize, canned sea food, textiles, jewelry and electrical
appliances and electronics are facing an inadequate supply of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
The plan is in line with the 8th national economic and social
development plan, which aims to turn Thailand into a regional
trade center by obtaining raw materials from cheaper sources.

LTTE organizations in London and Birmingham have contacted

Chavalit is expected to express his strong support for Thai
investors' activities in Myanmar and to urge Myanmar to facilitate

<HEADLINE> Brazil Hails U.S. Offer of Trade Barrier Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign
Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia today welcomed a United States
decision to send a mission to Brazil soon to study the possibility
of reducing U.S. trade barriers to Brazilian exports.
</P>
<P>
Calling it "a concrete step in the right direction," Lampreia
said: "It is a positive gesture that should make negotiations
easier."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Lampreia and Brazilian Industry and Commerce
Minister Francisco Dornelles, U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley said his country is willing to stop collecting compensatory
customs tariffs for Brazilian goods, including oranges and steel
products.
</P>
<P>
Dornelles said Daley also offered to review U.S. anti-dumping
procedures which, Brazil says, hurts the exports of Brazil's most
competitive products, including steel, orange juice, shoes and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
However, some Brazilians doubt U.S. sincerity to make good the
promise. A Brazilian diplomat said under anonymity that the offer
of removing trade barriers was "an insufficient gesture."
</P>
<P>
"We are tired of this kind of hypocrisy, because the same thing
was said in March by the U.S. secretary of commerce," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. offer came just prior to the Third Trade Minister
Meeting of the Free Trade Area of Americas (FTAA), which is to
decide the timing of negotiations to create the hemispherical free
trade zone from Alaska to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Brazil are divided over the speed of
setting up a pan-American free trade area. The United States wants
to drop all tariffs and barriers as soon as possible, while
Brazil, leading the booming subregional trade bloc of the Southern
American Common Market (Mercosur), insists on a step-by-step
integration, putting off tariff cuts to later.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from 34 countries of the Western Hemisphere are
meeting at Belo Horizonte to discuss the future free trade area,
which would contain 52 percent of the world trade.
</P>
<P>
Brazil steel and steel product exports to the United States
could increase by a third, going from the present 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars to two billion dollars, once U.S. trade barriers are
lifted.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Defense Minister Visits Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Defense Minister
Edmundo Perez Yoma arrived here today for a two-day visit to
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Perez told a joint press conference with his Argentine
counterpart, Jorge Dominguez, in the Metropolitan Airport, that
his country's relations with Argentina are "excellent," and the
understanding of the two countries on defense matters has reached
a "noticeable" level.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there is a transparency in the bilateral
relations that few Latin American countries have, adding Chile has
informed Argentina about its acquisition of planes and submarines
for its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He announced Chile has bought from France two conventional
submarines, which will be delivered by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Perez that the relations between the two
countries are excellent, Dominguez said: "We know the intentions
of Chile and we do not believe that there is an arms race in the
region."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Perez's visit is designed to show Chile's
desire for cooperation with Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have had a string of border disputes and
differences in the demarcation over Antarctic "Ice Fields" in
their southern border still exist, though a protocol signed last
December is waiting for their parliamentary rulings.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two sides, however, have been improved
recently.

<HEADLINE> US Denies Leaving Toxic Wastes in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States has denied the
fact that its troops left behind hundreds of tons of toxic wastes
when they pulled out of the Clark Air Base in the northern
Philippines in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press quoted US Embassy Press Attache Bruce Byers
as saying that it has never been ascertained that the former US
air base was the source of toxic wastes.
</P>
<P>
Byers said the U.S. government has "no legal authority" to
clean up the air base after it relinquished its authority to the
Philippine government in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"There may be toxic wastes in Clark and Subic, but these may
not have to do with the US," Byers said in a press briefing on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists insisted that the US presence was the
source of the hazardous wastes, saying some 17,000 families living
at Clark complained of gastrointestinal disorder and skin rashes.
</P>
<P>
These diseases, the environmentalists said, are believed linked
to their use of contaminated water from some wells that had been
dug up at the former U.S. air base, which has been built into an
economic zone.
</P>
<P>
They added that military facilities and operations generate
large quantities of hazardous wastes from production, testing,
cleaning, maintenance and extensive use of weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
The US withdrew troops from Clark, Subic and other four
military bases after the Philippine Senate refused the extension
of their military base agreements.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Plans Further Privatization to Ease Budget Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
said today that he is planning to speed up the privatization of
the German telecommunications flag-carrier Deutsche Telecom, and
to revalue gold reserves held by the central bank in a bid to fill
the huge gap that has emerged in the country's budget.
</P>
<P>
Waigel said that the fund-raising concept had already been
approved by lawmakers of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party Christian
Social Union (CSU).
</P>
<P>
Germany was confronted with a budget crisis Thursday when a tax
estimate group consisted of both government and independent
experts revealed that the country's federal, state and community
governments' tax revenues this year would be 18 billion German
marks (10.65 billion U.S. dollars) less than earlier estimated.
</P>
<P>
This announcement and the strong reactions afterwards from the
political parties have unleashed huge pressure on the government
to find urgent financial measures to defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Telecom privatization, which Waigel is considering to speed
up, was launched in November last year. But the government now
still holds 75 percent of its shares and pledged earlier that it
would not dispose of any of them before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By selling off part of the Telecom stake it still holds, the
government would avoid the embarrassment of having to return to
parliament to seek an increase in its public borrowings for the
year, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Forced by the little leeway left for the government to ease the
fiscal burden, Waigel Thursday also rushed to Frankfurt to consult
Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, about an revaluation of its
gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
For historical reasons, Germany's gold reserves are undervalued
at about 14 billion marks (8.3 billion dollars), which should be
57 billion marks (33.7 billion dollars) under current market value.
</P>
<P>
Economists said revaluing the gold reserves would boost the
Bundesbank's profits and consequently generate additional revenue
for the national accounts.
</P>
<P>
German media reported there are speculations that the Bonn
government might also consider to increase indirect taxes, such as
petrol tax, as an additional fund-raising measure. At least Waigel
has left that option open on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But tax hikes was strongly opposed by the Free Democratic Party
(FDP), the junior partner in Germany's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Otte Solms, Chairman of the FDP parliamentary group said
Thursday evening in Bonn that raising taxes would be the worst
option for the economy and the job market.
</P>
<P>
Observers pointed out that with less than 12 months left before
the European Union (EU) decides which state can join its planned
single currency, the Euro. Germany's current budget crisis raised
renewed doubt about its ability to make the grade for qualifying
for the Euro as a founding member on January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Introduce Multi-Purpose Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A breakthrough in credit card
technology may soon allow consumers to combine all their cards
issued by banks, shops, phone companies -- even corporate security
systems -- into a single piece of plastic.
</P>
<P>
The new system, called Multos, will be launched later this year
by a consortium of eight global groups, including the big
Australian banks and Sydney company Keycorp, the Sydney-based
Australian Financial Review reported today.
</P>
<P>
Business travelers may find the "open" high-security operating
system particularly useful, as a single Multos card could contain
electronic tickets, credit cards and stored money value in five
different currencies.
</P>
<P>
Other card holders will be able to customize their single card
into "lifestyle cards" containing a banking credit-debit card,
retail loyalty scheme, electronic purse, telephone credit card and
TV pay-per-view applications of their choice, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Card holders will be able to update, add or change applications
via the phone, automatic teller machine or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Richard Phillimore, vice-president of MasterCard's chip
business, was quoted by the paper as saying Multos will also
enable banks to fight back against the inroads made by non-bank
financiers.
</P>
<P>
MasterCard has already endorsed Multos for its 23,000 members
and more than 400 million card holders.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- International bidding for
the construction of a metropolitan transportation system in the
city of Cali, Colombia, will start from the end of June.

<P>
The first phase of the metro construction includes a
one-mile-long tunnel which will take 30 months to finish.
</P>
<P>
If the construction is approved, the Cali metro will be the
second in Colombia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ramos Rejects Early Anointment of Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos has
rejected a recommendation to announce his choice of successor
before the ruling Lakas-NUCD party holds its national convention
late this year.
</P>
<P>
Lakas members at the House of Representatives, however, warned
that if Ramos ignores the recommendation, the party might suffer a
breakup, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was made recently by a 16-member committee
set up by Ramos himself to set the criteria, procedure and
timetable for the selection of his successor.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for them to recommend me to anoint early
because the Lakas convention is still out there, they should just
wait," said the president, who was winding up a 10-day visit to
the United States, Mexico and Panama.
</P>
<P>
Ramos did not say when he would reveal his choice. In the past,
he had said he had a long list of his would-be successors and the
list was becoming "shorter" each day.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Ramos' anointment would ensure the success
of a candidate in the 1998 presidential elections since it would
translate into several millions of supporting votes.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Moldova to Further Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Victor
Ciorbea said here on Thursday that his country will further
develop economic cooperation with neighboring Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea made the remarks at a press conference after meeting
with his Moldova's counterpart Ion Ciubuc, who arrived here today
for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides agreed to promote the bilateral
trade which stood at 180 million U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Romania will provide convenience for Moldova's exports to
Europe while Moldova will help Romanian commodities into the market
of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the establishment of two free economic
zones, one near the Romanian northeastern city of Iasi in their
border area and the other on the lower reach of the Danube, a
region connecting Romania, Moldova and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of a merger of the two countries, which
have close ethnic ties, Ciubuc said "it is not suitable under the
current political situation."
</P>
<P>
Before the press conference, the two nations signed accords on
protection and immunization of crops, on cultural cooperation for
1997 and on cooperation between their justice ministries.
</P>
<P>
Ciubuc also held talks with Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu and the parliament speaker on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> 2 States Impose Ban on Victorian Apples, Pears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Two states in Australia have
banned Victorian apples and pears, heading a wave of anxiety over
Australia's first fireblight outbreak, local newspaper reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The states of Tasmania and Western Australia had banned pears,
apples and plant material from the state of Victoria in response
to the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Tens of millions of dollars worth of apple and pear production
and hundreds of rural jobs hinge on the successful containment of
the disease, which is harmless to humans, but devastating to
fruit-tree productivity.
</P>
<P>
The disease was detected in Melbourne by Chris Hale, a visiting
fireblight expert with the Agriculture Ministry of New Zealand,
the Melbourne-based newspaper the Age reported today.
</P>
<P>
The disease spread widely in New Zealand and Australia has
banned the imports of apples from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
After surveys of plants in all public parks and gardens in the
city, the disease had still been detected in only two plants in
the gardens, state Agriculture Minister Pat McNamara said.
</P>
<P>
About 35 plant experts, quarantine officials and industry
representatives met in the city yesterday to develop a strategy to
eradicate the disease.
</P>
<P>
The meeting resolved to try to eliminate the disease, which
impairs apple and pear production throughout the world, but which
remains undetected in Australia's key fruit-growing areas.

<HEADLINE> Several Hurt in Police Clash With Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Police today clashed with students
who occupied a school in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince and
hurt several people, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police fired tear gas and live bullets in the air. At least two
people were reported to have received bullet wounds, and several
others were beaten or wounded by rocks.
</P>
<P>
The Reuters news agency quoted sources in the General Hospital
as saying that five people were seriously wounded, but there were
no reports of fatalities.
</P>
<P>
The riot began when about 300 students occupied the Petion
School which had been closed since Monday after teachers walked
out in protest against pay delays.
</P>
<P>
The students threw rocks, injuring bystanders. Riot police
arrived on the scene and fired tear gas and students responded by
hurling fuel bombs, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Police broke into the school to arrest students and several
demonstrators were badly beaten and at least two shot, said
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Police withdrew but the unrest flared up as rioters rampaged
through downtown streets, setting ablaze buildings, homes and cars.
</P>
<P>
There is widespread discontent in this Caribbean nation with a
government privatization program and austerity measures promoted
by the International Monetary Fund and other foreign donors.
</P>
<P>
Grassroots organizations opposed to President Rene Preval's
policies have held a series of protest strikes and threatened to
use violence to enforce their message.
</P>
<P>
Preval took power in February 1996 after winning an election
with the backing of Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
Aristide was deposed by a coup in 1991 and restored after three
years in exile by a United States-led military invasion which
ousted the military regime.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tension Heightens in NZ Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Tension in the New Zealand
parliament has heightened between the opposition and Deputy Prime
Minister Winston Peters over the issue of he allegedly assaulting
a National backbencher more than two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place on March 5 night outside the debating
chamber, when Peters reportedly had a scuffle with John Banks, a
backbench MP of the National Party.
</P>
<P>
The parliament privileges committee ruled on Wednesday that
Peters' conduct on that night was "unbecoming" and invited him to
apologize to Parliament for the unacceptable behavior.
</P>
<P>
However, Peters reiterated this morning his determination not
to apologize after he refused to do so yesterday.
</P>
<P>
He said he never knew what he was charged with by the
committee, and likened the situation to a person charged with
forgery being convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
In his speech in parliament yesterday, Peters angrily attacked
the committee's decision.
</P>
<P>
"Had there been a fair charge formulated, and I got a fair
hearing on that, and if I was then found guilty, I would
apologize. I was not, and therefore I will not," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the committee had dismissed the allegation that
he was in contempt of parliament, and had no jurisdiction to rule
on the allegation of assault.
</P>
<P>
The allegation was made by Alliance leader Jim Anderton, who
was a witness at the scene of the scuffle.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Anderton, Peters said, "if you think I'm going to
cower in front of this House while you made false statements then
you are wrong."
</P>
<P>
He said he also intends to sue Labour deputy leader Machael
Cullen for defamation over his claim Peters had been drunk at the
time of the alleged assault. Peters has been insisting all along
that he was sober at that time.
</P>
<P>
However, the scuffle issue created by Peters, leader of the New
Zealand First party, has made his coalition partner, the National
Party, uneasy.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jim Bolger tried to distance himself yesterday
from Peters' refusal to apologize by staying away when Peters took
the defiant stand in parliament.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bolger said the prime minister was in his
office at the time of debate, busy writing speeches for National
Party conferences at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
But privately, some National MPs said they were surprised by
Peters' refusal, and it had put further pressure on the Coalition
relationship.
</P>
<P>
A recent opinion poll showed a decline in the support of the
coalition. Observers believe some improper conducts of NZ First
MPs are partly responsible for the fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador said that the seven soldiers,
who were arrested Wednesday by Peru for crossing into a disputed
border zone, were handed back to Ecuador today, putting an end to
the border incident.
</P>
<P>
Peru said a heavily armed Ecuadorean patrol was arrested on
Wednesday while planting mines six kilometers inside Peru's
territory.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's Defense Ministry issued a communique, saying the
seven soldiers were illegally arrested while carrying out normal
activities and routine patrols in the Paquisha Alto sector of the
disputed frontier.
</P>
<P>
But the head of the Ecuador's armed forces, General Paco
Moncayo, also admitted that the patrol may have strayed into the
Peruvian territory.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came as negotiators from Lima and Quito began a
second round of talks in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, on a
permanent solution to the decades-old border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The two nations had bloody clashes in the border area in
January, 1995. Dozens of soldiers were killed and hundreds injured
on both sides before a ceasefire agreement was reached in March,
1995.
</P>
<P>
Both Peru and Ecuador described the Wednesday arrest as a
border incident, saying there was no fighting between the two
armies and no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
Moncayo said the Ecuadorean authorities had ordered an
investigation, while Peru's acting Foreign Minister Jorge Gonzalez
Izquierdo said he was confident the peace dialogue would stay on
track despite the incident.

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Giant Panda on Last Legs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- She is blind and unable to eat
anything solid. Her owner is even ready to build a mausoleum and a
monument after its death.
</P>
<P>
"Dudu", at the age of 35, the world's oldest giant panda in
captivity and the most venerable age in its family, is struggling
against disease.
</P>
<P>
"She is too old to maintain good physical condition," said
keeper Chen Jun at the zoo in this capital of Central China's
Hubei Province. "She lost her eyesight due to keratitis. And
because she has lost most of her teeth, she hasn't eaten her
favorite food -- bamboo leaves -- for eight years."
</P>
<P>
"Dudu" recently refused to take porridge and milk and lost
weight rapidly. "Fortunately, she has almost recovered, thanks to
intensive treatment and care," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the most endangered species on
earth. There are only some 1,000 of them left, most of them living
in west China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
The life span of a panda is generally six to 20 years and no
panda older than 30 years had been reported before.
</P>
<P>
The female panda was captured and sent to the zoo in Chengdu,
Sichuan, in 1967. The panda, who moved to Wuhan in 1973, was once
mated but had no children.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (85-86) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (85-86) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will place names reflecting colonial rule be changed
after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: More than 150 years of British colonial rule have, in
varying degrees, left marks of such a rule in many aspects of Hong
Kong life.
</P>
<P>
This is reflected in the names of some streets, parks, buildings
and public welfare institutions, such as Victoria Harbor, Kennedy
Town and Queen's Road.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Hong Kong SAR will decide whether or not
to change such names after 1997 in accordance with the will of
Hong Kong people. The Basic Law contains no specific provisions
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will horse races continue in Hong Kong after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Of total betting money in Hong Kong's horse races, 81.9
percent is paid to winners, 7.4 percent to the Jockey Club as
commission, and the remaining 10.7 percent to the government as a
lottery tax with most of this tax being used for charitable
services.
</P>
<P>
Horse racing has become an inseparable part of the daily life
of many residents. It is difficult for outsiders to understand
Hong Kong people's fondness for horse racing. It is, therefore,
quite natural for Hong Kong residents to be concerned about its
continued existence after 1997.
</P>
<P>
There is in fact no cause for any worries in this regard. The
policy of "one country, two systems" will be applied in Hong Kong
after 1997, and the region's current social system and lifestyle
will remain unchanged for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law provides legal protection for the rights and
freedom of Hong Kong people. Horse racing will continue.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General Seeks Death Penalty in Unabomber Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
today requested the death penalty for Unabomber suspect Theodore
Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
Reno ordered prosecutors to seek the death penalty on grounds
that Kaczynski allegedly killed two men with "planning and
premeditation," lacks remorse and still presents a danger to the
lives of others.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old former mathematics professor has pleaded
innocent to federal charges in Sacramento, California, and Newark,
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kaczynski's younger brother, David, and mother,
Wanda, tipped the FBI, ending the government's unsuccessful
18-year, nationwide manhunt for the Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski's family argued to Justice officials that other
families would be reluctant to turn in relatives if death were the
result in this case.
</P>
<P>
But Reno granted prosecutors' requests to seek the death
penalty in the case.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors told federal courts in Sacramento and Newark that
death is warranted because Kaczynski intended to kill and harm
people and has little "potential for rehabilitation."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Kaczynski killed three people and injured 23
others in 16 bombings.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski was arrested by the FBI on April 3, 1996, at his
remote cabin near Lincoln, Montana.

<HEADLINE> Blair Presses on With Scottish, Welsh Assembly Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Shortly after announcing a bill to
allow for referendums on giving Scotland and Wales their own
parliaments, British Prime Minister Tony Blair showed his
determination to push through the plans today.
</P>
<P>
Labor government parliamentary business manager Ann Taylor
announced that the first discussion of the devolution to Scotland
and Wales by MPs would take place next Tuesday and Wednesday in
the House of Commons, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government plans a Scottish parliament with a limited
ability to vary taxes in Edinburgh, and a rather less powerful
Welsh Senedd (senate) in Cardiff to take decisions on local
issues.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is expected to be held in September if the bill
has completed its stages in both the Commons and the Lords by the
end of July, which would be the most radical constitutional
reforms in Scotland and Wales for 300 years.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition Conservatives are against the bill,
arguing that setting up these parliaments could finally lead to
the break-up of Britain. But the Conservatives seemed unable to
obstruct the devolution proposals because they have only 165 seats
in the lower house while the Labor occupies 419 seats.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the last Labor government also offered Scotland and
Wales their own parliaments, but the plan was dropped after both
regions showed little interest in such referendums.

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Reports Growing Gap Between Rich, Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank today reported
a widening income gap within the German society, with the rich
becoming richer and the poor even poorer.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report for May issued today, the central bank,
known as the Bundesbank, noted that while the income of the
country's wage earners and those receiving social welfare benefits
declined, the earnings from corporate activities and on capital
appreciation increased.
</P>
<P>
In total, Germany's private wealth is continuing to grow, up
nearly 300 billion marks (178 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996 to a
new record of almost 5 trillion marks (3 trillion dollars), the
Bundesbank said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany's household debts also increased last year
to 1.72 trillion marks (1.02 trillion dollars) from 1.60 trillion
marks (946 million dollars) in 1995.

<HEADLINE> US 30-Year Mortgage Declines Below 8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) reported today that the average rate
for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage remains below the level of 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Freddie Mac said that the average rate for the popular
home-lending tool for the week ending May 16 stands at 7.91
percent, down from last week's 7.94 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year average mortgage rate jumped above 8 percent for
the first time since October after the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
raised interest rates on March 25 and stayed above that mark until
the week ending May 8.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average rate for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage
also fell, dipping to 7.44 percent from 7.47 percent in the
previous week. The rate was 7.53 percent two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed is set to meet again next week to discuss monetary
policy. Analysts remain divided over whether the central bank will
tighten rates further.

<HEADLINE> Dow Surpasses 7,300 Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks posted a late
advance today, boosting the Dow Jones industrial average and other
market measures to new highs, amid conflicting economic data.
</P>
<P>
The Dow gained 47.39 points to 7,333.55, beating Monday's
record finish at 7,292.75 and surpassing the 7,300 mark for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Also setting new highs were the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
list, up 5.84 to 841.88, and the New York Stock Exchange composite
index, up 2.05 to 437.65.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.07 to 1,353.62, and the

the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 458.14
million shares as against 498.77 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices, excluding
the volatile food and energy sectors, rose 0.3 percent in April,
slightly more than expected and the largest increase since
September.
</P>
<P>
In a separate reading that indicated continued upward pressure
on employment costs, the department also reported that first-time
claims for unemployment benefits fell 31,000 last week to 319,000,
a three-week low.
</P>
<P>
But bonds rebounded later in the morning after two subsequent
reports indicated that manufacturing activity is slowing.
</P>
<P>
In one report, the Federal Reserve reported that American
industry was operating at 83.4 percent of its capacity in April,
down from 83.7 percent in March.

<HEADLINE> Mandela, Kabila Ends Talks on Zairean Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today that Zaire's embattled President Mobutu
Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila are considering his
peace plan.
</P>
<P>
"Matter are going to plan," Mandela, a major mediator of the
Zairean crisis told a press conference at the end of his
two-and-a-half hour talks with Kabila in Cape Town. "We are
confident we are making progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila told the press conference: "We shall wait until Monday
to receive another answer from the Mobutu side."
</P>
<P>
Kabila would further study the two-page Zairean peace plan
prepared by Mandela. The plan has also been made available to
Mobutu, according South African officials.
</P>
<P>
Details of the peace plan were not yet known. But South
African officials indicated that it was a proposal of
power-sharing among Kabila's rebel forces, Mobutu's followers and
other opposition parties in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Mandela canceled the second face-to-face
peace talks between Mobutu and Kabila originally scheduled today
in a South African ship off Congo's west African coast because
Kabila refused to attend, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Then Mandela sent a jet plane to Kabinda, an enclave of
Angola, to fetch Kabila to Cape Town for an urgent consultation.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's rebel forces are still engaged in a fierce fighting
with Mobutu's presidential guards in Kengo, a strategic town 200
km east of Kinshasa, capital of Zaire. But Kabila's spokesman
said the rebel troops are approaching Kinshasa from other fronts.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Falls for Ninth Day Against yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar lost all the gains

suggesting the U.S. currency has fallen enough.
</P>

The dollar ended mixed in other foreign-exchange dealings.
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell as low as 115.85 yen in intraday dealings

Traders continued to sell the dollar despite remarks by the top
officials in Japan's Finance Ministry suggesting they are now
content with the exchange-rate level.

<P>
Both Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and Vice Finance
Minister Tadashi Ogawa said the recent agreement by the Group of
