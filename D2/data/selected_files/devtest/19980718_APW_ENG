Students rally in East Timor as U.N. envoy meets Indonesian

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 300 students demanded
self-determination for East Timor at a noisy but peaceful rally
Saturday ahead of an anticipated visit to the troubled territory by
a U.N. mediator.
	   The demonstration at the University of East Timor in Dili took
place as U.N. special envoy Jamsheed Marker held talks with
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie in the Indonesian capital,
Jakarta.
	   Marker is trying to broker a peace deal for East Timor, ruled by
Portugal for hundreds of years before Indonesia invaded in 1975.
	   Since the invasion, East Timor has endured years of guerrilla
war and human rights abuses.
	   Saturday's pro-independence rally follows the commemoration on
Friday of the 22nd anniversary of East Timor becoming part of
Indonesia. The annexation is not recognized by the United Nations.
	   Before his talks with Habibie at Jakarta's presidential palace,
it remained unclear whether Marker would proceed with a planned
visit to East Timor.
	   The Indonesian government and East Timor's Nobel Peace Prize
winner Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo have warned that Marker's
presence in Dili could generate violent protests.
	   East Timor Gov. Abilio Soares has called for calm, saying that
his administration was ready to meet Marker. He has called on the
Indonesian military to take stern action if violence flares.
	   Thousands of people, mainly settlers from other parts of
Indonesia, have left East Timor in recent days fearing possible
trouble.
	   Since last month, Indonesian soldiers have killed two protesters
and there have been clashes between groups which either support or
oppose Indonesian rule.
	   At Saturday's campus rally, student protesters chanted
anti-Indonesian slogans and held up banners calling for a
referendum to be held on the future of the disputed territory.
	   ``East Timor people want self-determination. We have to decide
the fate of our homeland,'' said one protester, Theresa Carbago,
23.
	   During his trip to Indonesia, Marker has made it clear that
recent political changes in Indonesia represent a new opportunity
to solve East Timor's problems.
	   Habibie became president in May when former longtime leader
President Suharto stepped down after a wave of riots and protests
swept the country.
	   Habibie has offered to release jailed guerrilla leader Xanana
Gusmao and to grant special status to East Timor in return for
international recognition of it as an integral part of Indonesia.
	   However, he has rejected demands for a referendum on outright
independence.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for
southern Baja California Friday night as Tropical Storm Celia
picked up strength and swirled toward the area.
	   Forecasters expected winds of tropical storm force for southern
Baja California, the peninsula that juts south from the U.S. state
of California, by Saturday, the U.S. Hurricane Center reported from
Miami.
	   Late Friday night, the center of Celia was located 225 miles
(360 kilometers) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas, a beach and
fishing resort on the tip of Baja California.
	   The storm was moving northwest at about 16 mph (26 kph) and was
expected to continue at that speed and direction. If it did,
Celia's center would be about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the
tip of the peninsula on Saturday.
	   Maximum sustained winds were near 60 mph (97 kph). A tropical
storm becomes a hurricane when sustained winds exceed 73 mph (117
kph), and forecasters expected Celia to strengthen.
	   Mexico issued tropical storm warnings for the southern portion
of Baja California from the port of La Paz southward.

Third candidate enters race to become prime minister
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The race to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto heated up Saturday after a popular Cabinet member said he
will soon announce his candidacy, newspapers reported.
	   Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi will officially
announce his bid at a press conference later Saturday, press
reports said.
	   Neither Koizumi nor his staff could be reached for immediate
comment.
	   Koizumi would join Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, who have already declared
they want to become the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's next
president.
	   The LDP president, who will be chosen July 24 in balloting by
party lawmakers, is virtually sure to become prime minister because
the party controls the powerful lower house of Japan's bicameral
Parliament.
	   The party's choice could prove crucial in helping it regain the
support of voters before lower house elections, expected to be
called some time before 2000.
	   Hashimoto announced he would resign Monday after the LDP
suffered a crushing defeat in elections for the upper house of
Parliament, losing 17 seats.
	   Analysts attributed the party's defeat to voter dissatisfaction
with the way it handled the economy, which is mired in its worst
recession since World War II.
	   Headlines in major newspapers said Koizumi, 56, decided to make
a bid after securing the support of a key faction of LDP lawmakers.
	   Koizumi is younger than the 72-year-old Kajiyama, who is seen as
more knowledgeable about the economy but suffers from concerns
about his health.
	   Obuchi, 61, appears to be the favorite of most party power
brokers, but the colorless veteran lacks the broad popular appeal
of the more youthful and articulate Koizumi, press reports said.
	   Koizumi has earned a reputation for outspokenness that may hurt
him in Thursday's party vote but would probably appeal to the
broader electorate.
	   He opposed Hashimoto and other party elders last year by calling
for the privatization of parts of the postal system. Although
Koizumi lost, he received wide television coverage.
	   Koizumi may also win the support of a growing number of
discontented younger party lawmakers, who have publicly criticized
the LDP for failing to move faster to mend its ways after Sunday's
election defeat.
	   A rebellion by younger lawmakers forced the party to postpone by
three days a vote on its presidency to give candidates more time to
explain their views on policy issues.
	   But Koizumi has yet to say where he stands on the topic now
dominating Japanese politics: the economy.
	   In announcing his candidacy Friday, Obuchi said he supports a 6
trillion yen (dlrs 43 billion) cut in personal and corporate income
taxes.
	   Kajiyama, who put his name forward hours later, said he would
perform ``major surgery'' on the country's ailing banking system,
which is burdened with 87.5 trillion yen (dlrs 625 billion) in
failed or high-risk loans left over from the collapse of the
property market in the early 1990s.

Vietnam to launch fund for victims of war-era defoliant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam is launching a support fund for
victims of the defoliant Agent Orange, more than two decades after
its use by U.S. forces in the Vietnam War, the Labor newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   The paper quoted Nguyen Trong Nhan, chairman of the Vietnam Red
Cross, as saying those affected by the toxic chemical will receive
assistance from the fund by the year 2000 after a survey on Agent
Orange victims is completed next year.
	   The fund, which primarily will rely on donations from domestic
and foreign organizations and individuals, will be inaugurated next
Friday.
	   It will be managed by the Red Cross, which will provide loans
and training to victims. They include former soldiers who fought in
areas sprayed with Agent Orange by U.S. aircraft and children who
were later born with deformities.
	   Nhan said the government's strained budget might have delayed
assistance, pointing out that a laboratory test of a sample for
Agent Orange costs dlrs 3,000.
	   Prime Minister Phan Van Khai in April assigned the Ministry of
Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs to conduct a survey on the
estimated 300,000 Agent Orange victims in Vietnam.

PLO representative freed by Colombia rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)_ Colombia's largest and most powerful
group of leftist rebels has freed the country's Palestine
Liberation Organization representative three months after taking
him hostage.
	   The rebels handed over Jaime Salem, a former member of the
Palestine National Council and longtime PLO spokesman in Colombia,
to the Red Cross Friday afternoon near the town of Cumaral, about
42 miles (70 km) southwest of Bogota.
	   The 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
kidnapped Salem on April 25 in Bogota and held him in a mountain
hideout, in a case that authorities kept quiet until last month.
	   Colombian revolutionaries have increasingly turned to kidnapping
to finance a 34-year war against the state. Foreigners are favored
because they tend to fetch higher ransoms.
	   ``My message is they should think of Colombia, and not so much
the money,'' a visibly-tired Salem said in a television interview
after his release.
	   ``Colombia doesn't deserve this fate,'' he added.
	   Government officials had said Salem's family was negotiating a
ransom with the FARC, but a family member interviewed Friday on
Radionet radio said no ransom was paid.
	   On Wednesday the country's second-largest rebel group vowed to
cease kidnappings for ransom provided they can find other sources
of funding.

Immelman, Dufner in Public Links golf final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ South African Trevor Immelman and Jason Dufner,
an American, advanced to the finals of the U.S. Amateur Public
Links Championship by winning two matches apiece on Friday.
	   Immelman, 18, beat Sal Spallone, 20, of Vero Beach, Florida, 6
and 5 in the quarterfinal match Friday morning, then eliminated
Todd Rose, 20, of Fresno, California, 1-up on the 19th hole in the
semifinal match over the South Course of the Torrey Pines Golf
Course.
	   Dufner, meanwhile, beat Robert Sul, 18, of Torrance, California,
3 and 2, in the quarterfinals and Wil Collins, 19, of Rapid City,
South Dakota, 3 and 2, in the semifinals.
	   Immelman, of Somerset West, South Africa, and Dufner, of Olmsted
Falls, Ohio, will play a 36-hole final on Saturday.
	   Immelman had never trailed in the tournament until the
semifinal, when Rose birdied the par-5 sixth hole to go 1-up and
Immelman bodeyed No. 7 to fall two holes back.
	   Immelman got even after 18, forcing extra holes and Immelman
ended it on the 19th by chipping in for birdie.
	   Immelman thus qualified for his fifth national tournament
championship in 15 months.
	   ``This will be my fifth final match and I have only won one, so
I'll be real focused tomorrow.'' said Immelman, who would qualify
for next year's Masters by winning the final.
	   ``I've had that carrot dangled in front of my nose before,'' he
said. ``I just have to concentrate on each shot.''
	   Dufner said he was ``pretty excited right now. I'm hitting the
ball good and living by my opponent's mistakes. I'm excited about
being in the finals and am just going to have a good time.''

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tidal wave slammed into
a remote area of northwest Papua New Guinea, killing up to 20
people and leaving another 100 missing, emergency officials said
Saturday.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) high wave hit Friday night following
an earthquake off the coast that Australian Geological Survey
Organization said had a magnitude of 7.0.
	   Provincial disaster coordinator Peter Tavun said the wave struck
to the west of the town of Aitape in the West Sepik province.
	   He said four villages _ Sissano, Warapu, Arop and Malol _ were
``badly affected.''
	   ``It was total destruction _ most of the houses have been swept
away,'' Tavun said. ``The brief report that we have received put
the casualties at six to 20 deaths but it is unconfirmed at the
moment.''
	   Tavun said it was not known precisely how many people were
missing, but the area to the west of Aitape was heavily populated,
with at least 5,000 people. He said two deaths in Aitape had been
confirmed.
	   The wave crushed houses built of jungle materials on beaches
along the northern coast. Local residents said hundreds of houses
had been destroyed and up to 15,000 people may be affected.
	   Rob Parer, a businessman who lives near Aitape, said up to 90
percent of houses in at least four villages built on the waterfront
had been devastated by the wave.
	   ``The people have never heard of anything like it. They thought
the world had ended,'' Parer said.
	   In Canberra, Australian seismologist Kevin McCue from the
Australian Geological Survey Organization said the earthquake's
epicenter was just off the town of Aitape.
	   ``It was a shallow, major earthquake,'' he said.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 would be devastating if it
hit an urban area.

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ The University of Washington Huskies have lost
one of their twin towers.
	   Patrick Femerling, a 7-foot-1 (2.67-meter) center-forward, has
signed a contract with Berlin of the German professional league and
won't return to the Huskies for his senior season, coach Bob Bender
announced Friday.
	   Femerling, a native of Dusseldorf, Germany, averaged 5.7 points
and 6.1 rebounds per game last season. He played 26 games, starting
19.
	   He ranks third among all-time Washington players with 84 career
blocked shots.
	   Washington's other 7-footer (2.13-meter player), Todd
MacCulloch, will return next season. MacCulloch led Washington in
scoring with 18.6 points per game last season, when the Huskies
advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament for the first time
since 1984.

 &UR; Despite economic crisis, U.S. coffee chain opens in Thailand
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Starbucks, the successful American
coffee shop chain, figures that in an economic crisis folks may
need a caffeine fix more than ever.
	   So on Saturday the company opened its first outlet in Thailand,
where just about everyone is watching their spending in wake of the
worst economic downturn in modern times.
	   Officials of the Starbucks Coffee Co. said they planned to open
10 more stores in the country over the next two years. Saturday's
launch was the company's 53rd in the Asia-Pacific area.
	   ``We haven't scaled back even though the economic situation in
Asia is not so great. It's all going well for us,'' said Jane
Melvin, director of international marketing.
	   ``It's not just the thing in the cup. It's the people and the
environment that comes with it,'' said Melvin about the attraction
of a Western coffee shops.
	   With the smallest cafe latte priced at 50 baht (dlrs 1.25) _
about one third the minimum daily wage _ the Bangkok outlet is not
likely to attract the average Thai. The company hopes to cater to
those with higher incomes and Thais who have traveled abroad.
	   Starbucks' operation in Thailand is a joint venture with the
Central Group, one of the country's largest hotel and retail
chains.
	   The coffee chain, based in Seattle, Washington, has been eying
Thailand for the past three years and decided to proceed despite
the country's economic ills, said Melvin.
	   ``We expanded our operation in the late '80s in California in
the midst of a recession,'' said Melvin. ``What we found was that
coffee wasn't really affected by the downturn.''
	   Starbucks operates more than 1,600 coffee specialty retail
stores in North America and the Pacific Rim. Its first coffee shop
in Asia opened in Tokyo in November, 1996.

Indonesian president calls on military to deal with kidnapping case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Saturday called on the military to deal with allegations that
members of an elite army division abducted pro-democracy activists.
	   Speaking to reporters, Habibie expressed confidence in the legal
system of the military and said he would not intervene in the case,
despite calls from human rights groups for a full and open inquiry.
	   ``The government will leave it to the armed forces to settle the
problem,'' he said.
	   On Friday, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of former
President Suharto and the former commander of the military's crack
Kopassus group, said he was ready to take responsibility for the
kidnappings if they were proven.
	   This week military police arrested seven Kopassus soldiers
accusing them of taking the activists captive.
	   Courts-martial are expected to be convened soon.
	   Prabowo, a controversial figure within the powerful military,
said he would await the results of a military investigation of the
kidnappings, which occurred in the weeks before Suharto quit in May
after 32 years in power.
	   Some activists, who are now free, have testified to Indonesia's
National Human Rights Commission that they were abducted by masked
men, tortured and questioned about their political activities.
	   Other human rights groups say as many as 24 activists were
abducted and that at least nine remain missing.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions and have called for investigations of
Prabowo and other senior officials.
	   According to the military, the seven accused soldiers had only
been ordered to monitor the activities of several anti-government
protesters, but went beyond this and allegedly took the activists
captive.

Dissident leader fears military action before elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prominent dissident Sam Rainsy
warned Saturday that Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling political
party may be preparing military action ahead of the July 26
elections, threatening to thwart the democratic process.
	   Hun Sen, who underwent surgery at a local hospital late Friday
to remove his appendix, meanwhile was in stable condition but
scheduled to remain in the hospital for several days, according to
advisor Prak Sokhun.
	   Seen as the favorite in the elections because he controls the
electoral machinery, the country's broadcast media and the security
apparatus, Hun Sen will likely cancel all public appearances ahead
of election day, Prak Sokhun said.
	   Sam Rainsy said in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
that in recent weeks there have been reports of troop movements and
the transfer of military equipment nationwide.
	   He urged the U.N. chief to ask the government to move quickly to
address remaining problems.
	   ``As polling day approaches ... there are increasing signs that
the Cambodian People's Party led by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen
is considering aggressive action against the political opposition
and the democratic process itself,'' Sam Rainsy wrote.
	   Of troop movement, he said, ``this saber rattling may be
intended to coerce the population to vote for the ruling party out
of fear, or it may be preparation for military action. In either
case it must stop immediately if the democratic process is to
proceed.''
	   Sam Rainsy warned that the government may be hatching a plot to
discredit or arrest individuals in opposition parties, using
allegations that they are planning to take their own military
action or have links to the outlawed Khmer Rouge.
	   ``The scale of troop movement is becoming dangerously
reminiscent of conditions before the coup of July 5-6 1997,'' he
wrote, referring to Hun Sen's use of tanks, mortar and artillery to
oust Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a coup last year.
	   As many as 100 of the prince's supporters were killed by Hun
Sen's forces in the months that followed, according to human rights
workers. There have been no arrests in any of those killings.
	   Hun Sen called for new elections to try to win back aid and
legitimacy lost in his takeover, allowing opposition politicians
who were chased into exile to return to participate.
	   His key opponents at the polls will be Ranariddh, who has
returned from exile, and Sam Rainsy, a French-educated lawyer who
heads his own party.
	   Sam Rainsy also expressed concern about some 60,000 national
observers who have signed up to monitor the electoral contest, many
of whom appear to be linked to the CPP, including some soldiers.
	   The biased national observers could be used to push out
legitimate monitors, he warned.
	   Foreign observers, who are operating under a U.N. umbrella and
numbering at less than 500, will be present at only 10 percent of
the 11,000 polling stations, he said. They will spend about an hour
at each site.
	   ``The combination of these tactics opens the door to widespread
flouting of the polling station rules which is likely to result in
extensive ballot box stuffing at many stations,'' he said.
	   ``They are the ingredient of an election that it neither
transparent or credible.''

Watts has the lead, Woods has the finish
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BIRK128 of July 17 &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Brian Watts can have his lead. Tiger
Woods was just as pleased with his own finish.
	   While Watts went into the weekend as the British Open leader, it
was Woods who had the most to smile about after a birdie-birdie
finish Friday wiped away memories of an erratic round and left him
only a shot behind.
	   ``I came out smelling like a rose on those last two holes,''
Woods said.
	   On a day when the wind howled and rain drenched Royal Birkdale,
Woods struggled from his opening tee shot, only to pull himself
together to make birdie from a bunker on 17 and then salvage a 73
with a 12-foot (3.66-meter) birdie putt on the final hole.
	   ``The kid's got no quit in him,'' caddie Fluff Cowan said. ``You
know that. I know that. And best of all, he knows that.''
	   The round left Woods at 2-under-138, a shot behind Watts, a
Japanese PGA Tour regular who went out early and set the pace by
making five birdies for a 69.
	   Nick Price was tied with Woods after an eagle on the 17th helped
him to a 72, and so was 17-year-old English amateur Justin Rose,
who shot the round of his life with a 66 that also was the low
round of the day.
	   ``To play it in these circumstances is fantastic,'' said Rose,
who quit school a year ago to concentrate on golf.
	   A day after the Open began in light winds and sunshine, the
weather turned nasty for the second round. It rained much of the
morning, then the wind picked up in the afternoon.
	   By early evening the wind was gusting so hard that balls were
being blown around greens, and then the rain returned, forcing a
suspension of play for about a half hour.
	   ``I was getting blown over,'' Woods said. ``It was hard to stay
steady. Temperatures were going up and down. You really had to keep
your patience.''
	   Patience was just what Woods had as he continued to contend in a
major for the first time since he won the 1997 Masters. Unlike
previous majors, where he took big scores on holes with ill-advised
shots, he played smartly despite playing poorly.
	   ``It was just one of those days where you've got to keep patient
and hang in there because no one is really going to shoot or go
that low, and you know that,'' Woods said.
	   Besides Rose, no one did as the same course that allowed 41
players to match or break par on the first day gave up only seven
rounds under par Friday.
	   The only other player under par after two rounds was Thomas
Bjorn of Denmark, who was at 1-under 139.
	   Shots that flew steady toward soft greens in the opening round
were blown instead toward the tall meadow grass. Players discovered
that par was a good score yet again in a major.
	   John Daly would have gladly taken par on the 18th hole and been
able to play two more rounds. Instead, he took five blasts to get a
ball out of the fairway trap and ended up with a 10 for a round of
78 and an 11-over 151 total.
	   Also missing the cut was former champion Tom Lehman, who had as
many bogeys as he had pars _ nine _ for a 79.
	   Price not only made the cut, but he's playing among the leaders
for the second straight major. But he found himself blasting out of
buried lies in traps, ripping balls out of tall rough and trying to
keep the composure necessary to add this Open title to the one he
won in 1994.
	   ``I don't want to listen to any of those guys who complained
about the conditions this morning,'' said Price, who played in the
afternoon. ``There's just so many crosswinds blowing. I'm grateful
to have gotten off the course two strokes over par.''
	   Watts, the 32-year-old Oklahoman who commutes to the Japanese
PGA Tour, followed a first-round 68 with a 69 that made him the
improbable leader.
	   Watts has won 10 times in Japan since 1994 and is such a
familiar figure there that he is recognized on city streets.
	   ``I'd say I'm very well known to the over 40-year-olds,'' Watts
said. ``They will go, `Oh, Brian Watts' or say my name.''
	   Not many were saying Watts' name when going over a list of
favorites for the tournament. Even Watts didn't give himself much
of a chance after practice rounds left him feeling he couldn't make
any birdies.
	   ``Sunday, Monday and Tuesday didn't give me any belief in the
world that I could even make a birdie on this golf course,'' he
said.
	   The Open title would carry an extra benefit for Watts. It would
give him an exemption for the PGA Tour, and he could say sayonara
to Japan.

Police chief in Punjab province killed

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A senior police officer who had
arrested dozens of militant Sunni and Shiite Muslims was shot and
killed Saturday in eastern Punjab province, police said.
	   Chaudhary Ali Mohammed, the police superintendent of Faisalabad,
some 400 kilometers (240 miles) southeast of the federal capital of
Islamabad, was gunned down as he left his home, they said.
	   No one has taken responsibility for the early morning killing
outside of Faisalabad, but police officials are blaming militant
members of rival Sunni and Shiite Muslim groups.
	   Fighting between the religious rivals has left hundreds of
people dead, most of them in the eastern Punjab province. Attackers
have lobbed grenades at mosques, dragged people from vehicles and
killed them and gunned down still others.
	   Police have arrested dozens of leaders of these groups in an
attempt to curb the violence. Their activists have sworn revenge.

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 300 students demanded
self-determination for East Timor at a noisy but peaceful rally
Saturday ahead of an anticipated visit to the troubled territory by
a U.N. mediator.
	   The demonstration at the University of East Timor in Dili, the
territorial capital, took place as U.N. special envoy Jamsheed
Marker held talks with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie in the
Indonesian capital of Jakarta, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) to
the west.
	   Marker is trying to broker a peace deal for East Timor, ruled by
Portugal for hundreds of years before Indonesia invaded in 1975.
	   ``I was every encouraged by the talks. The president was very
open,'' Marker told The Associated Press after the talks. ``He and
a lot of people want to find a solution.''
	   Since the invasion, the territory's 800,000 inhabitants have
endured years of guerrilla war and human rights abuses.
	   Saturday's pro-independence rally follows the commemoration on
Friday of the 22nd anniversary of East Timor becoming part of
Indonesia. The annexation is not recognized by the United Nations.
	   Despite the upbeat nature of his talks with Habibie, it remained
unclear whether Marker would proceed with a planned visit to East
Timor.
	   The Indonesian government and East Timor's 1996 Nobel Peace
Prize winner Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo have warned that
Marker's presence in Dili could generate violent protests among
groups who either support or oppose Indonesian rule.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Marker might
postpone his visit for three to four days.
	   ``What we want him to understand that if he goes to East Timor
it could invite pro and anti-integration demonstrations. That is
what we want to avoid,'' he said.
	   Alatas, however, did not rule out the possibility of the visit
going ahead.
	   East Timor Gov. Abilio Soares has called for calm, saying that
his administration was ready to meet Marker. He has called on the
Indonesian military to take stern action if violence flares.
	   Belo has appealed to the armed forces to respect human rights.
	   ``Don't use violence and please talk to the people with a
transparent attitude,'' he said.
	   Thousands of people, mainly settlers from other parts of
Indonesia, have left East Timor in recent days fearing possible
trouble.
	   Since last month, Indonesian soldiers have killed two
protesters.
	   Two protesters were also killed during a previous visit to East
Timor by Marker in 1997.
	   At Saturday's campus rally, student protesters chanted
anti-Indonesian slogans and held up banners calling for a
referendum to be held on the future of the disputed territory.
	   ``East Timor people want self-determination. We have to decide
the fate of our homeland,'' said one protester, Theresa Carbago,
23.
	   During his trip to Indonesia, Marker has made it clear that
recent political changes in Indonesia represent a new opportunity
to solve East Timor's problems.
	   Habibie became president in May when former longtime leader
President Suharto stepped down after a wave of riots and protests

Ten more factories reported on verge of collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thousands of workers may join the
swelling ranks of Thailand's unemployed as the government warned
their factories were on the verge of collapse, newspaper reports
said Saturday.
	   An official of the Labor Welfare and Protection Department was
quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying at least 10 factories may have
to shut down unless new money flows in to relieve a severe
liquidity crunch.
	   The official, Sakchai Sakulwong, did not name the factories but
said those most vulnerable to massive lay-offs were in the textile
and automobile-parts manufacturing businesses.
	   The report comes after more than 5,000 employees of Thai Melon
Textile Company, one of the country's largest textile
manufacturers, were informed last week that the company was ceasing
production because it no longer had money to buy raw materials and
banks refused to lend it money.
	   Thailand is battling its worst economic crisis in modern times.
Wild lending sprees by banks and finance companies left many on
shaky ground and with little cash to lend to even healthy
companies.
	   More than a million Thais have lost their jobs since the crisis
began in July 1997.
	   Textiles are considered a sunset industry in Thailand because
rising wages have made production costs less competitive compared
with some other countries.
	   But even the once booming automotive industry has been badly
battered over the past year, with sales and exports plummeting.

Courier, Agassi give United States 2-0 advantage over Belgium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to focus on Van Garsse, ADDS quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Andre Agassi showed Christophe Van Garsse
that he is not the same player the young Belgian player saw in
France.
	   ``When I saw him playing in the French Open, I thought, OK,
maybe I can do something,'' Van Garsse said about Agassi, who lost
in the first round in Paris.
	   But after losing 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 to Agassi in their Davis Cup
singles match Friday, Van Garsse realized he was no match for the
American.
	   ``He's not a hundred times stronger than me, not a thousand
times, but a million times too strong for me,'' the 24-year-old Van
Garsse said. ``I couldn't imagine that somebody could play so fast
on the ball and put so much pressure on me.
	   ``It's tough to say if I played well or not, but I was really
impressed.''
	   The victory gave the United States a 2-0 advantage in the World
Group quarterfinal. The U.S. team can clinch the match today with a
doubles victory by Todd Martin and Richey Reneberg.
	   Filip Dewulf, who lost to Jim Courier in the opening singles
match at the Indianapolis Tennis Center, has been announced as
Belgium's doubles player with 17-year-old Xavier Malisse. However,
Dewulf indicated Friday he didn't expect to play. Belgium captain
Koen Gonnisen can switch his team until an hour before the match.
	   ``I know he (Dewulf) can play well, but I also know that Johan
(Van Herck) can play well,'' Gonnisen said of his doubles team.
``Xavier can play well ... I've got many possibilities. ... We have
to create a new doubles, to get started thinking about the future,
about the youth.''
	   Belgium can also think about how the tie might have been
different if it had been played on clay, rather than on the hard
surface selected by the United States.
	   ``We do not really have a serve and volley player in Belgium,''
Gonnisen said. ``We've grown up on clay. It's quite tough. Maybe,
Malisse in the future, he could play more aggressive, more typical
hard-court player.''
	   Agassi had only three break points against him and lost two as
he took sole possession of third place for Davis Cup victories by a
U.S. player, bringing his record to 26-5. He can tie the late
Arthur Ashe for second place with a victory in the reverse singles
Sunday. John McEnroe leads with 41 victories.
	   ``They mean a lot to me,'' Agassi said. ``Davis Cup has been a
big part of my career. It's something I've been very proud. ...
But, I mean, honestly it's less important to me than winning this
tie right now.
	   In the opening match, Courier beat Dewulf 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 2-6,
6-3.
	   Dewulf, who climbed past No. 48 Courier to 43rd in the world
rankings by reaching the semifinals of the Swiss Open last week,
looked lost on the hard surface.
	   ``I didn't feel really comfortable,'' said Dewulf, who had more
winners (42) that Courier (20). But, unforced errors killed his
upset hopes. He had 54 to Courier's 36.
	   ``This is just not my kind of surface. I don't feel at ease on
this surface. A lot depends on your return and serve. Those are not
my favorite strokes of my game.
	   ``I made a lot of unforced errors, especially on the service
returns at important points.''
	   The match between Courier, who has never played on a losing Cup
team in 11 previous times on the U.S. team, and Dewulf was much
closer than the score indicated. Courier had only a 123-117
advantage in points won.
	   ``Jim and Andre both got the job done. They dictated play,''
said captain Tom Gullikson, who selected the same U.S. team to face
Belgium that produced a 3-2 victory over Russia in the first round.
	   ``Andre certainly dictated the entire match basically, and
returned service unbelievably well, played his service games very
smartly, using his serve to set up his first shots,'' said
Gullikson, 11-3 as the U.S. captain.
	   The United States-Belgium winner plays Italy or Zimbabwe in the
semifinals Sept. 25-27. Italy leads that series 2-0 and would
travel to the United States if both teams advance.
	   The United States has won more Davis Cup titles (31) and more
matches (187) than any other country. It is 2-0 against Belgium,
having prevailed 4-1 in 1953 and 3-2 in 1957.
	   In other quarterfinals, Germany and Sweden split their opening
singles, while Spain leads Switzerland 2-0.
	   At Hamburg, Germany, Tommy Haas upset Jonas Bjorkman 6-3, 7-6
(7-4), 7-5 before Sweden's Thomas Enqvist evened the quarterfinal
by sweeping Nicolas Kiefer 6-3, 6-3, 7-5.
	   ``It's what we wanted from the singles,'' said Boris Becker,
head of Germany's Davis Cup team. ``It leaves everything open.''
	   At La Coruna Spain, Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja won for Spain
on clay courts. Moya, the French Open champion, beat 142nd-ranked
Ivo Heuberger 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 and Corretja downed Marc Rosset 6-1,
6-2, 6-2.
	   At Prato, Italy, Andrea Gaudenzi and Davide Sanguinetti defeated
Zimbabwe's Black brothers. Gaudenzi downed Wayne Black 6-3, 6-3,
6-4, then Sanguinetti took Byron Black 6-3, 6-3, 6-0.

Report: major crimes on decline

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Major crime in Vietnam fell in the first
six months of the year, although organized crime, juvenile offenses
and corruption cases continued to rise, the Communist Party
newspaper Nhan Dan reported Saturday.
	   Murder, robbery, child kidnapping and attacks on officials all
declined, the report quoted Police Chief Truong Huu Quoc as saying.
The drops ranged from 3 percent to 17 percent from the same period
last year.
	   Quoc credited crime-prevention efforts even as the country faces
new challenges like the Asian economic crisis, sabotage by
unspecified ``hostile forces'' and a rise in social vices such as
prostitution and drug abuse.
	   Police uncovered more than 17,000 criminal cases in the first
six months and broke up 2,765 criminal gangs, the report said.
	   Quoc said 8,721 people have been arrested on drug-related
charges in 3,687 cases, and courts have issued death sentences for
21 defendants and life imprisonment for 11 others.
	   However, organized crime, international crime, juvenile offenses
and economic crimes by civil servants are rising, he said.
	   The police chief said the moral degradation of society is
reflected in statistics that show more than 90 percent of the
murder cases stem from social causes, including 15 percent that
result from family disputes.
	   Only 6 percent of the murder cases related to robbery, he said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Singaporeans may lose
their jobs by next year as the effects of the region's economic
crisis make themselves felt on the island nation's economy, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   ``1998 could mark the beginning of the end of full employment in
Singapore,'' Lim Swee Say, deputy secretary-general of the National
Trade Union Congress, was quoted as saying in The Straits Times.
	   For years unemployment has been very low in this wealthy nation
of 3.1 million. Compared to its Southeast Asian neighbors,
Singapore has been least affected by the regional turmoil.
	   But over the past few months, reverberations of the crisis have
been increasingly felt in trade, tourism and financial sectors.
	   Now, Lim said, unemployment could reach 4 percent by the end of
the year, up from current 2.2 percent, and could even hit 5 to 7
percent next year.
	   With a work force of 1.8 million, this would mean that about
90,000 people could be jobless by the end of 1999. This would by
far exceed the recession in 1985 and 1986, when the number of
unemployed reached 20,000.
	   The projections are based on how much the economy needs to grow
in order to keep people employed at the present level and still
have jobs for people entering the work force, the report quoted Lim
as saying.
	   To keep unemployment low in Singapore, the economy would have to
grow between 2.5 and 4 percent a year. But the forecast for this
year is 0.5 to 1.5 percent.
	   Singapore government and union officials in recent days have
repeatedly warned Singaporeans that the crisis will last longer
than expected.
	   A commentary in the leading Straits Times daily said Saturday
that the crisis might mark an end to ``Singapore's underlying
philosophy ... that Singapore's social security system is that of
individual responsibility.''
	   ``It may not be time yet for something as radical as
unemployment benefits, but neither should it be considered
heretical to expect the state to do more to help families in
distress,'' said the newspaper, which often reflects the views of
the government.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen was
recovering Saturday from emergency surgery to have his appendix
removed and was expected to stay bedridden during the final week of
campaigning for parliamentary elections July 26.
	   Aides said that Hun Sen would remain hospitalized for at least
three days after Friday night's surgery and would probably spend
the run-up to the vote resting.
	   Hun Sen's chief challengers in the general elections _ Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed as co-prime minister in a bloody
coup last year, and prominent dissident Sam Rainsy _ immediately
wished him well.
	   ``I will send a personal message to him with ... my most sincere
wishes for a very, very quick recovery,'' said Ranariddh at a
lively campaign rally which drew more than 5,000 supporters in a
Phnom Penh suburb. ``We are rivals, not enemies.''
	   Hun Sen went to the Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh after
returning Friday from the southern province of Takeo, where he
spent several hours speaking to villagers and helping dig an
irrigation ditch in a rare campaign appearance.
	   ``When he returned to Phnom Penh, he felt sick and went to the
hospital for a medical checkup and doctors found out he had
appendicitis,'' said advisor Prak Sokhun.
	   Prak Sokhun said that his boss would likely have to cancel all
public appearances ahead of the election.
	   Hun Sen is favored to win because he controls the electoral
machinery, the country's broadcast media and the security
apparatus. He has spent little time campaigning.
	   Sam Rainsy warned at a campaign rally that Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party was preparing to steal the election and moving
military forces into place to crush the opposition.
	   Nonetheless, he also wished his rival a speedy recovery.
	   ``I wish him good health,'' Sam Rainsy said.

Playwright to petition court if government bans controversial

Gandhi play &QL; 
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ The author of a controversial play about
the assassin of Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi said
Saturday he would challenge in court any government order banning
his play.
	   Producers canceled the play on Friday after hundreds of
protesters battled police outside the theater and blocked people
from watching the performance in central Bombay.
	   The Hindu nationalist coalition government of Maharashtra state,
of which Bombay is the capital, is expected to decide later
Saturday on a federal government suggestion to ban the play.
	   Federal Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani asked the state
government to shut down the play after lawmakers complained that it
denigrates Gandhi, known as Mahatma _ a great soul _ and glorifies
his killer, Nathuram Godse.
	   Godse, a Hindu nationalist, was enraged by Gandhi's overtures to
Muslims after Britain divided its India colony into predominately
Hindu India and officially Islamic Pakistan. He killed Gandhi in
1948.
	   Playwright Pradeep Dalvi said he had a strong case to continue
performing the play because state censors had cleared it without
requiring any cuts.
	   ``I wrote the play because it was a challenging subject. No
light has been shed on the man who killed Gandhi for 50 years. ...
Let people be the judge,'' Dalvi told The Associated Press.
	   Producers said Gandhi and Godse figured in three scenes each in
the play. ``What can I do if people clap more for Godse than for
Gandhi?'' Dalvi said.
	   The play was first banned in 1987 by the state government when
the Congress Party ran it. Dalvi challenged the ban in court but
withdrew his petition when censors cleared the play last year after
the new right-wing BJP-Shiv Sena government came to power.
	   The producers have staged 80 shows of the play in Bombay in the
Gujarati language in the past year. Its success prompted them to
stage the play in the more popular Marathi language. That triggered
the protest.
	   Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray has criticized Gandhi in the past
and questioned his status as father of the Indian nation.

<TEXT>
	   In Arlington, Texas, Will Clark hit a three-run homer and drove
in a season-high four runs as Texas rallied to stop a five-game
losing streak.
	   The Devil Rays took a 4-3 lead into the seventh, but reliever
Jim Mecir (3-2) started the inning with walks to Rusty Greer and
Juan Gonzalez.
	   Albie Lopez came out of the bullpen to strike out Ivan
Rodriguez, but Clark sent Lopez's next pitch into the right field
seats for his 13th homer and a 6-4 lead.
	   Rangers starter Darren Oliver (5-7) allowed four runs and 10
hits over seven innings, struck out four and walked none.
 &UR; Mariners 18, Royals 5
	   In Seattle, the Seattle Mariners had a season-high 22 hits,

4-for-5 and scored four runs and Rodriguez went 4-for-6 for
Seattle, which also set a season-high in runs.
	   The Mariners' winning streak is their longest since they won six
in a row April 15-20.
	   Seattle starter Bill Swift (9-5) gave up three runs in the first
inning, but took advantage of the Mariners' offensive outburst to
get his seventh win in nine decisions.
	   Glendon Rusch (6-11) took the loss.
 &UR; Orioles 4, Angels 1
	   In Anaheim, California, Rafael Palmeiro hit his 300th career
home run, went 3-for-4 and drove in all of Baltimore's runs as the
Orioles won their season-high ninth straight game.
	   Baltimore's victory streak is its longest since winning 10
straight from June 2-12, 1993. The Orioles haven't lost since the
All-Star break, sweeping three series.
	   Doug Drabek (6-9) retired 13 consecutive batters and gave up one
run on three hits in 5 1-3 innings, striking out four and walking
one in his first victory since May 28.
	   Jason Dickson (9-7) took the loss, giving up two runs on five
hits in 6 2-3 innings. He walked five and struck out four.
 &UR; Twins 8, Athletics 7
	   In Oakland, California, Todd Walker singled home the go-ahead
run in the ninth inning as Minnesota overcame a five-run deficit to
defeat Oakland.
	   The Twins trailed 6-1 after six innings before rallying against
starter Jimmy Haynes and five relievers.
	   After scoring three runs in the eighth to tie it 6-6, Minnesota
took the lead with two runs in the ninth off Billy Taylor (3-8).
	   Hector Carrasco (2-1), the fifth of six Minnesota pitchers,
pitched one inning for the victory. Rick Aguilera gave up a run in
the ninth before finishing for his 20th save.

South Korea to free foreign convicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea may release some of 150
Asian workers jailed in its prisons as part of a sweeping amnesty
to celebrate the anniversary of the end of Japanese colonial rule,
officials said Saturday.
	   The foreigners will join South Korean convicts, whom President
Kim Dae-jung promised last month to free to mark the Aug. 15
anniversary.
	   South Korean media reported that two Pakistanis on death row
will be among those released.
	   Justice Ministry officials would not confirm whether the
Pakistanis would be included. The government was still working out
whom it will free, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The officials confirmed that next month's amnesty will include
an unspecified number of South and Southeast Asians who were
serving jail terms in South Korea for crimes after coming here as
alien workers.
	   Domestic news media said the amnesty will extend to Amir Jamil,
30, and Mian Mohamad Ajax, 37.
	   The two Pakistanis were arrested and convicted in 1992 on
charges of stabbing two fellow Pakistani workers to death in
Sungnam, a city just south of Seoul. The Supreme Court upheld their
death sentences the next year.
	   Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and the
Korean Catholic Human Rights Committee, have demanded a retrial for
the Pakistani pair, saying they could not fully defend themselves
during police investigations because of language barriers.
	   Jamil and Ajax have said they were at the scene of the crime but
it was another Pakistani that did the killing.
	   They were among tens of thousands of foreigners _ from China,
the Philippines, Bangladesh, Nepal, and other poorer neighboring
nations _ lured to South Korea by tales of higher pay.
	   The foreigners work in low tech, labor-intensive industries
abandoned by increasingly affluent South Koreans.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to lead with mediator's comments
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 300 protesters on Saturday
demanded self-determination for East Timor and a U.N. mediator said
he was ``very optimistic'' that a peaceful solution can be reached
for the troubled territory.
	   The demonstration at the University of East Timor in Dili, the
territorial capital, took place as U.N. special envoy Jamsheed
Marker held talks with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie in the
Indonesian capital of Jakarta, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) to
the west.
	   Marker is trying to broker a peace deal for East Timor, ruled by
Portugal for hundreds of years before Indonesia invaded in 1975.
	   ``I'm greatly encouraged by what the president told me,'' Marker
said after the talks.
	   At a news conference, Marker said Habibie appeared determined to
reach a settlement. The envoy praised the president's ``far-seeing
attitude'' and ``humanitarianism.''
	   ``I am very optimistic that a solution can be found,'' Marker
said.
	   Since the invasion, the territory's 800,000 inhabitants have
endured years of guerrilla war and human rights abuses.
	   Saturday's pro-independence rally follows the commemoration on
Friday of the 22nd anniversary of East Timor becoming part of
Indonesia. The annexation is not recognized by the United Nations.
	   Despite the upbeat nature of his talks with Habibie, it remained
unclear whether Marker would proceed with a planned visit to East
Timor.
	   The Indonesian government and East Timor's 1996 Nobel Peace
Prize winner Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo have warned that
Marker's presence in Dili could generate violent protests among
groups who either support or oppose Indonesian rule.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Marker might
postpone his visit for three to four days.
	   ``What we want him to understand that if he goes to East Timor
it could invite pro and anti-integration demonstrations. That is
what we want to avoid,'' he said.
	   Alatas, however, did not rule out the possibility of the visit
going ahead.
	   East Timor Gov. Abilio Soares has called for calm, saying that
his administration was ready to meet Marker. He has called on the
Indonesian military to take stern action if violence flares.
	   Thousands of people, mainly settlers from other parts of
Indonesia, have left East Timor in recent days fearing possible
trouble.
	   Since last month, Indonesian soldiers have killed two
protesters.
	   Two protesters were also killed during a previous visit to East
Timor by Marker in 1997.
	   At Saturday's campus rally, student protesters chanted
anti-Indonesian slogans and held up banners calling for a
referendum to be held on the future of the disputed territory.
	   ``East Timor people want self-determination. We have to decide
the fate of our homeland,'' said one protester, Theresa Carbago,
23.
	   Marker has made it clear that recent political changes in
Indonesia represent a new opportunity to solve East Timor's
problems.
	   Habibie became president in May when former longtime leader
President Suharto stepped down after a wave of riots and protests
swept the country.
	   Habibie has offered to release jailed guerrilla leader Xanana
Gusmao and to grant special status to East Timor in return for
international recognition of it as an integral part of Indonesia.
	   However, he has rejected demands by Portugal and separatists for
a referendum on outright independence.
	   Marker said Habibie's proposal would be discussed when the
foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal meet with U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York later this month or early
next month, when he hoped the push for a solution would move ahead.

Chinese gold output climbs in first half of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's gold output has soared this year, making
it likely the country will haul in 200 tons of the precious metal
by year's end, the official Economic Daily reported Saturday
	   Wang Dexue, head of the government's Gold Management Bureau,
told a seminar recently that gold output rose more than 28 percent
in the first five months of the year, the newspaper said.
	   Although no figure was given for the January-to-May haul, the
Economic Daily reported that the government took in more than 166
tons last year.
	   Wang attributed the higher yield to lower world market prices
for gold. Narrower profit margins crimped the black market, and
miners, smelters and people, fearful of further price drops, sold
more gold to the government as required by law, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Authorities recovered one more
body Saturday from a landslide in the southern Philippines,
bringing to three the number of people who were killed.
	   Police said at least four others still missing are believed to
have also died.
	   Heavy rain sent tons of mud down the side of a mountain on
several houses Thursday in Sergio Osmena town in Zamboanga del
Norte province.
	   Three people were immediately rescued and two bodies were
retrieved from the debris on Friday.
	   Heavy downpours have hampered the search, which was stopped
twice Saturday, until the latest victim was found past noon, said
regional police chief Dominador Resos.
	   Police also recovered a saddle, but the horse and the rider were
still missing.
	   Three motorcycle taxi passengers were also believed to be buried
in the landslide, Zamboanga del Norte police chief Ronaldo Roderos
said.

11 trapped underground, 10 feared dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Eleven men are trapped undeground in a
coal mine in southwestern Austria and 10 are feared dead, state
radio reported Saturday.
	   The men are trapped at the town of Lassing, near Liezen, about
200 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna, the report said.
	   Ten of the victims are part of a rescue team, sent down to
locate a miner trapped Friday afternoon after an earth slide. As
they were making their way down late Friday, another earth slide
sent tons of mud down on top of them. The weight of the muck
snapped the cable of the elevator some were riding, sending them
hurling into the depts.
	   The slide left a huge crater measuring about 150 meters (yards)
in diameter and 50 meters (yards) deep, the Austria Press Agency
reported. Several houses nearby were dragged into the pit.
	   The original victim was believed to be alive, even though he
remained 60 meters (yards) underground Saturday.

Opposition figures call on Indonesian leader to form reform
</HEADLINE>
coalition

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Three prominent opposition figures
want to form a reform coalition with the government to help
overcome Indonesia's massive economic and political problems, a
report said Saturday.
	   ``We call on the leaders of Indonesia, both inside and outside
the system, to formulate an agenda together for political, legal
and economic reform,'' the Jakarta Post quoted a statement from the
group as saying.
	   The group consists of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of
Indonesia's first president; Abdurrahman Wahid, who heads the
nation's largest Muslim group, and East Timor's Roman Catholic
Bishop Carlos Belo, who won the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Indonesia is facing its worst economic crisis in 30 years. The
value of the currency, the rupiah, has plummeted. Inflation is
soaring along with mass unemployment.
	   Economic hardship triggered protests and riots that shook the
country of 202 million in May. About 1,200 people were killed in
the violence, which helped forced former President Suharto to quit,
ending 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   His successor President B.J. Habibie has promised economic and

Hungry elephants rampage in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Herds of hungry elephants have gone on
the rampage on the island of Sumatra, destroying houses and crops,
Indonesian media reported Saturday.
	   About 20 elephants attacked several villages in Lampung
province, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of Jakarta, on
Wednesday night.
	   Frightened residents ran from their houses to escape, the report
said.
	   Wildlife officers said one female elephant was later found dead,
apparently from hunger.
	   Earlier another herd of about 25 elephants destroyed rice and
banana crops and damaged 88 houses and huts in six villages. A
boarding school was also damaged.
	   Environmentalists say farming and urbanization are destroying
the natural habitats of elephants and other wildlife in Indonesia.

Yeltsin begins summer vacation in the north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin took off for his annual
summer holiday Saturday, flying to a lakeside resort in the
northern Russian region of Karelia, the Kremlin press service said.
	   Before leaving, Yeltsin met with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
to discuss economic strategy and the implementation of the
government's economic austerity plan.
	   ``The prime minister reported to the president on measures that
could be taken to ensure the most comprehensive implementation of
the stabilization program,'' the press service said.
	   After the meeting, Yeltsin took off for the northern city of
Petrozavodsk, and from there was to drive to the lakeside resort of
Suiskaya Chupa.
	   The weather forecast for the first few days of Yeltsin's holiday
was not good.
	   The local meteorological center predicted downpours,
thunderstorms and low temperatures until Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said. By midweek, sunny weather and balmy temperatures
were expected, the report said.
	   The Kremlin did not say how long the president intended to be
gone. Last summer, he spent a month on vacation in Karelia and
along the Volga River.

Cambodian candidate says visit by U.N. chief could save elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Sam Rainsy saying U.N. chief visit
could turn tide, election commission says troop movements unrelated
to vote, Ranariddh rally, Hun Sen prognosis. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos PHN101-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Sam Rainsy warned
Saturday that Cambodian strongman Hun Sen is deploying troops to
influence elections set for July 26 and urged U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to make an emergency visit.
	   Hun Sen, recovering from an appendectomy Friday night, was
expected to stay bedridden for the final week of the campaign.
Aides said he would stay in the hospital until at least Monday,
followed by rest at home.
	   Sam Rainsy and the other main opposition candidate, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, whom Hun Sen deposed as co-premier in a bloody
coup a year ago, have accused Hun Sen of using violence and
intimidation and of rigging the electoral machinery to ensure his
own victory.
	   The National Election Committee, the main electoral authority
that is packed with Hun Sen supporters, claimed Saturday the troops
are being deployed for polling security.
	   But Sam Rainsy said the real reason was to intimidate voters
into thinking that Hun Sen will simply use the army to stay in
power if he loses the vote. Voters afraid of more conflict would
vote for him just to keep the peace.
	   Speaking to reporters following a campaign rally, Sam Rainsy
said that the United Nations should do more to help Cambodia have a
free and fair election and that the U.N. chief should visit ``if
possible.''
	   ``The U.N. should not let down Cambodia by allowing a fake
election to take place next week,'' said Sam Rainsy.
	   At the least, this would include sending more observers and
setting high standards to determine whether the elections are free
and fair. Sam Rainsy said that the European Union appeared ready to
rubber-stamp any result.
	   ``I think the international community should give us another
chance,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``I beg the international community not
to let us down.''
	   The United Nations deployed 20,000 peacekeepers and spent dlrs 3
billion to hold elections in Cambodia in 1993. They were the most
free in the country's history and were meant to usher in an era of
democracy after the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s, followed by
a decade of harsh military occupation by Vietnam.
	   Ranariddh's party won the polls, but Hun Sen threatened civil
war and forced his way into a co-premiership. The U.N. troops did
not stop him. Last July, Hun Sen ended the tense power-sharing
agreement by deposing Ranriddh in two days of street battles.
	   Wishing to win back international legitimacy and foreign aid,
Hun Sen allowed the prince to return from exile to contest a new
election. This time, the U.N. role is confined to observers.
	   The appendix operation will likely force Hun Sen to cancel all
public appearances next week, said an aide, Prak Sokhun. The attack
of appendicitis came after one of his rare campaign forays,
visiting villagers and helping dig a ditch in the countryside.
	   Ranariddh told a rally of 5,000 supporters that the United
States _ which will judge whether the election is free or fair
separately from the main international observer group _ will not
accept Hun Sen using the army to keep himself in power.
	   The prince said he had also received assurances that Washington
would reject any disqualification of the prince's FUNCINPEC party,
a possibility floated by Hun Sen's officials in recent days.
	   Sam Rainsy said in a letter to Annan that the government may be
hatching a plot to discredit or arrest individuals in opposition
parties and that the scale of troop movements was reminiscent of
deployments made before Hun Sen launched his forces against
Ranariddh last year.
	   The National Election Committee meanwhile said it would take
steps to weed out thousands of ineligible Cambodian observers, some
of whom are alleged to have links with Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party and the military.
	   More than 60,000 Cambodian observers have been accredited, most
from unknown organizations and without needed training or
experience, drawing criticism from the U.N. body responsible for
coordinating international observers.

11 trapped underground, 10 feared dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Ten men trying to rescue a trapped miner
were feared dead after a mudslide buried them in an underground
coal mine in southwestern Austria, state radio reported Saturday.
	   Tons of mud snapped the cable of an underground elevator in
which some of the rescuers were riding, sending them plunging into
the depths of the mine at the town of Lassing, some 200 kilometers
(120 miles) southwest of Vienna.
	   An earlier mudslide on Friday had trapped a miner about 60
meters (yards) underground. That miner was still believed to be
alive Saturday.
	   The mudslides left a crater 50 meters (yards) deep and about 150
meters (yards) in diameter, the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   Several houses nearby tumbled into the pit.

Kiriyenko raises import duties to raise cash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko Saturday ordered a
3 percent increase on all import duties to raise revenues and
support Russian industries, news agencies reported.
	   ``This is a harsh measure which will entail a rise in prices for
imported goods, but the government has been forced to take it to
increase state revenues,'' Kiriyenko said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The Economics Ministry has estimated that the measure will bring
in a billion rubles (dlrs 16 million) a year, Interfax said.
	   Raising the import duty will support Russian industry, Kiriyenko
said. ``Since we are unable to increase our exports under today's
circumstances, it is necessary to reduce our imports.'
	   Kiriyenko said the rejection by parliament of several measures
in the government's economic austerity plan this week had seriously
reduced the resources the government had expected to have at its
disposal.
	   He also said that raising import duties was one of the measures
in the government's crisis management program that the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders wanted implemented
before they start delivering dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans to
Russia.
	   Kiriyenko met with Boris Yeltsin Saturday morning to bring the
president up to date on the government's strategy on implementing
the austerity program.
	   ``The prime minister reported to the president on measures that
could be taken to ensure the most comprehensive implementation of
the stabilization program, especially in spheres where draft laws
have been rejected or not fully considered by the State Duma,'' the
Kremlin press service said.
	   The Duma, parliament's lower house, recessed for the summer
Friday without passing several key elements of the government's
economic plan.
	   Kiriyenko said that the rejected bills will be enacted by
presidential decree.

Gunmen attack government building in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Gunmen on motorcycles fired
rockets and grenades at a provincial capitol building, injuring one
person in a southern Philippine city before dawn Saturday.
	   A military spokesman said the attack came hours before special
elections were to be held in 15 nearby towns.
	   The office of the vice governor of Lanao del Sur province in
Marawi City, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Manila,
was heavily damaged. A hotel, a restaurant and several parked
vehicles also were damaged.
	   A member of the government's Commission on Election, Teresita
Flores, was at the hotel but was unhurt, said Army spokesman Capt.
Salih Indanan.
	   The blasts from at least six small rockets and grenades were
followed by automatic rifle fire, but the attack apparently was
only meant to scare not to kill, Indanan said.
	   Indanan said the gunmen fled shortly after the attack, pursued
by troops backed by armored vehicles. There were no immediate
reports of clashes between the soldiers and the gunmen.
	   The special elections are being held after authorities declared
the May 11 elections a failure. In that election, officials failed
to appear with ballots for fear of violence from rival candidates.
	   The ballots from the towns are to be counted in Marawi, where
soldiers and police have been deployed to protect the counting and
election officials.
	   Former Muslim rebel leaders are running against members of
powerful political clans, but it was not immediately clear who was
responsible for the attack, police said.

	   The Duma did pass some government bills, including a key measure
introducing an additional 5 percent sales tax, which was approved
on Thursday. But the lawmakers rejected an income tax bill and a
measure that would cut various social payments for this year.
	   Communists and other hard-liners dominating the Duma have balked
at fiscal reforms proposed by the government, saying they would
further worsen the nation's social woes.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Friday the house might hold
an emergency session next month to reconsider some of the
government's proposals.

Rwandan court convicts four people on genocide charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A Rwandan court has convicted four people
on charges of genocide and sentenced two of them to death,
state-run Rwandan radio reported Saturday.
	   The other two were sentenced to life in prison.
	   Euphrasie Kamatamu, 54, a former councillor, was convicted of
organizing the killings of minority Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, during the 1994
Hutu-government organized genocide of more than 500,000 people.
	   Kamatamu and her husband, Thomas Habyarimana, were sentenced to
death after being found guilty Friday of drawing up death lists,
distributing weapons to Hutu killing squads and manning roadblocks
so no Tutsis could escape during the 90-day slaughter.
	   The two who received life sentences were a friend of Kamatamu
and her personal guard.
	   Kamatamu was known in Kigali's Nyamirambo neighborhood as a
deeply religious Roman Catholic. Throughout the three-month killing
spree, she continued to attend mass and to wear her trademark
rosary.
	   When Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994 and stopped the
killing, she fled to neighoring Zaire (now Congo) together with 1
million defeated soldiers, government officials and ordinary
civilians, who fear retribution for the massacre.
	   In November 1996, she and her husband returned along with the
others after the Rwandan-backed rebels in eastern Zaire dismantled
the camps.
	   Kamatamu turned herself in, apparently fearing reprisals. At
first, she confessed to genocide charges but later claimed the
confession had been beaten out of her.
	   About 130,000 Rwandans are imprisoned on suspicion of taking
part in the genocide. So far, about 300 have been convicted and
sentenced, a third of them to death.
	   On April 24, authorities publicly executed the first 22 genocide
convicts, including a woman.
	   The government says it plans more executions.

Prosecutors charge Chinese dissident with fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Prosecutors have charged a veteran human rights
campaigner with fraud as part of an apparent crackdown on dissent
following U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to China, a rights
group reported Saturday.
	   Li Bifeng would be the second dissident to face criminal charges
since Clinton ended his nine-day China tour on July 3. Since then,
police have also detained at least 14 other dissidents, 11 of them
for trying to form an opposition political party.
	   The roundup is the most concerted police action against
dissidents in several years and appears to mark an end to the
tolerance the ruling Communist Party displayed over the past 18
months as it sought to improve relations with Washington.
	   Prosecutors in southwestern Mianyang city formally charged Li
with ``economic fraud'' on July 9, and he is likely to be put on
trial before the month's end, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   The charge appears to be related to Li's work selling safes for
a company, the rights group said.
	   Police took Li into custody in March, seven months after he went
into hiding for informing overseas monitoring groups about massive
labor protests in Mianyang and other cities in Sichuan.
	   Li edited an underground dissident magazine in the 1980s while
working for the Mianyang tax bureau. He was sentenced to five years
in prison in the nationwide crackdown that followed the military's
quelling of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations.
	   Another veteran activist, Fan Yiping, is due to be sentenced in
southern Guangzhou city on Tuesday for helping another dissident
flee China, the Information Center said. During a 3 1/2-hour trial
last Monday, Fan declared his innocence. He faces between two and
seven years in prison for organizing illegal flight.
	   The Information Center also reported that the whereabouts of Mao
Guoliang remained unknown Saturday, a day after police in eastern
Zhejiang province took him into custody.
	   Mao was the 11th member of the China Democracy Party to be
detained since July 10. He and five others are still being held,
and authorities may be preparing to charge them with subversion,
the Information Center said.
	   Organizers said they wanted to set up the party to challenge the
communists' political monopoly. Authorities refused their repeated
attempts to register the party.

Evacuation continues as aftershocks hit quake area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Workers were making emergency road repairs
Saturday as cave-ins continued after a major earthquake struck
southern Taiwan, killing five people and causing severe damage,
officials said.
	   The 6.2 magnitude quake on Friday triggered rock slides in
scenic Alishan, a mountainous area 300 kilometers (180 miles) south
of Taipei, that also injured 27 people.
	   Mountain highways in Nantou, southern Taiwan, were also blocked,
and workers were making repairs to evacuate about 1,000 people
stranded there, police said.
	   Officials said some 50 people stranded in a hotel in Alishan
were evacuated Friday night.
	   The China Times quoted Cheng Yin-hung as saying he and his wife
fell into a crevice one story deep in front of the hotel when the
quake struck. They were later pulled out of the rubble, both
suffering minor injuries, he said.
	   A family of three were injured when they fell into a huge crack
on the cement floor of the hotel, the report said.
	   More than 400 aftershocks had been registered since Friday's
quake, the worst to hit southern Taiwan since 1964 when 106 people
were killed.
	   Two other earthquakes, with preliminary magnitudes of 4.2 and
4.9, struck Hualien in eastern Taiwan Saturday. But weathermen said
they were unrelated to Friday's quake.
	   Renowned geologist Yeh Yung-tien predicted that Taiwan will be
hit by an earthquake of a magnitude of 7 in one or two years.
Taiwan last had an earthquake of that magnitude in 1951, when 68
people were killed, he said.
	   Kuo Kai-wen, the Central Weather Bureau's chief forecaster,
predicted quakes of magnitudes of between 5 and 6 within the next
two weeks.
	   Kuo said significant energy has accumulated underground since
southern Taiwan was struck by an earthquake of a 6.5 magnitude in
1964. Friday's earthquake had yet to release much of that energy,
he said.
	   Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the total energy released
by an earthquake, as indicated by ground motion recorded on
seismographs. An increase of one digit in the scale represents a
tenfold increase in the strength of the quake.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area.

Media watchdog demands release of Sri Lankan journalist and his
</HEADLINE>
family &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ An international journalists'
organization asked the Sri Lankan government on Saturday to specify
charges against an ethnic Tamil reporter detained along with
members of his family.
	   Detectives of the Terrorist Investigation Department picked up
Sri Gajan of the independent Virakesari newspaper at his office on
Thursday. Police also detained his brother and two aunts.
	   ``If he is detained because of articles he wrote, our
organization asks for his immediate and unconditional release,''
Robert Menard, general secretary of the Paris-based Reporters
Without Borders, said in a letter to Sri Lanka's President
Chandrika Kumaratunga.
	   Detectives told Gajan's colleagues that they suspect him of
having links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the
militant group fighting for a separate homeland for the country's
minority Tamils.
	   Gajan's brother was released after hours of questioning, but
Gajan and his aunts have been kept at a local police station.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed since Sri Lanka's civil
war began in 1983. The rebels accuse majority Sinhalese of
discriminating against Tamils in schooling and jobs.

Kiriyenko raises import duties to raise cash

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko Saturday ordered a
3 percent increase on all import duties to raise revenues and
support Russian industries, news agencies reported.
	   ``This is a harsh measure which will entail a rise in prices for
imported goods, but the government has been forced to take it to
increase state revenues,'' Kiriyenko said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The Economics Ministry has estimated that the measure will bring
in a billion rubles (dlrs 160 million) a year, Interfax said.
	   Raising the import duty will support Russian industry, Kiriyenko
said. ``Since we are unable to increase our exports under today's
circumstances, it is necessary to reduce our imports.'
	   Kiriyenko said the rejection by parliament of several measures
in the government's economic austerity plan this week had seriously
reduced the resources the government had expected to have at its
disposal.
	   He also said that raising import duties was one of the measures
in the government's crisis management program that the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders wanted implemented
before they start delivering dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans to
Russia.
	   Kiriyenko met with Boris Yeltsin Saturday morning to bring the
president up to date on the government's strategy on implementing
the austerity program.
	   ``The prime minister reported to the president on measures that
could be taken to ensure the most comprehensive implementation of
the stabilization program, especially in spheres where draft laws
have been rejected or not fully considered by the State Duma,'' the
Kremlin press service said.
	   The Duma, parliament's lower house, recessed for the summer
Friday without passing several key elements of the government's
economic plan.
	   Kiriyenko said that the rejected bills will be enacted by
presidential decree.
	   The Duma did pass some government bills, including a key measure
introducing an additional 5 percent sales tax, which was approved
on Thursday. But the lawmakers rejected an income tax bill and a
measure that would cut various social payments for this year.
	   Communists and other hard-liners dominating the Duma have balked
at fiscal reforms proposed by the government, saying they would
further worsen the nation's social woes.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Friday the house might hold
an emergency session next month to reconsider some of the
government's proposals.

	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Sweeping all before it, a
tidal wave crashed against Papua New Guinea's north coast, crushing
villages and killing at least 30 people, authorities said Saturday.
	   Hundreds more are missing, they said. The 23-foot (seven-meter)
wall of water hit Friday night without warning following an
earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off the coast that
Australian Geological Survey Organization said had a magnitude of
7.0.
	   ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless, and
there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,''
Fr. Austin Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   He said most of the dead were children who drowned.
	   Disaster authorities said the wave struck to the west of the
town of Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at least four
villages _ Sissano, Warapu, Arop and Malol.
	   The area is spotted with villages consisting of homes built on
beaches of jungle materials.
	   ``At Warapu, there is no house standing _ it's a village of
1,800 people,'' Crapp said. ``Arop, again, is 1,800 to 2,000 people
_ there's nothing standing there.
	   ``They (the two villages) are both clean sand. It's complete
devastation.''
	   A helicopter pilot who landed in Aitape on Saturday reported
seeing bodies floating among the debris in the lagoon, he said.
	   Local residents said hundreds of houses had been destroyed and
up to 15,000 people may be affected.
	   Papua New Guinea provincial disaster coordinator Peter Tavun
said homeless survivors were in desperate need of food and shelter.
	   Crapp said a helicopter was picking up injured people and
doctors had been flown in to treat them. The injured, mostly
suffering cuts and fractures, were being taken to a mission
hospital at Aitape.
	   Rob Parer, a businessman who lives near Aitape, said some
villagers who fled into the jungle after the wave struck are still
hiding there.
	   ``The people have never heard of anything like it. They thought
the world had ended,'' Parer told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   In Canberra, Australian seismologist Kevin McCue from the
Australian Geological Survey Organization said the earthquake's
epicenter was just off the town of Aitape.
	   ``It was a shallow, major earthquake,'' he said.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 would be devastating if it
hit an urban area.
	   The tidal wave consisted of three waves striking in quick
succession, Crapp said.
	   ``It would have been all over in 10 minutes,'' he said. ``In the
nighttime, in the dark, people were screaming, yelling and looking
for people.''
	   The last tidal wave in the area was in December 1930 when a
magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the Admiralty Islands, seismologist
McCue said.

Skipper Craig McMillan powers New Zealand to beat India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand skipper Craig McMillan
scored an unbeaten 50 to power New Zealand to a one wicket win over
India in the Super Max 8s cricket tournament here Saturday.
	   New Zealand has already had its first win over Pakistan on
opening day Friday, boosting their chances of making the final
Sunday.
	   McMillan faced 23 balls and hit four boundaries and two sixes.
The other major contributors were Nathan Astle (31 off 17 balls)
and Craig Spearman (22 off 15).
	   Hrishikesh Kanitkar bowled best for India with three wickets for
the loss of 31 runs in three overs.
	   Sunil Joshi, a leftarm spinner, bowling the penultimate over,
sent a shiver through the New Zealand batting by taking a wicket
with the first delivery, then conceding a run and no runs from the
next four deliveries for overall figures of one for 20.
	   New Zealand needed three runs to win off the last ball by Rohan
Gavaskar. McMillan promptly stepped in and hit a six to put the
issue beyond any doubt.
	   There are three matches being played Saturday: Australia vs.
South Africa, Pakistan vs. India and Australia vs. New Zealand.

Turkish coalition partners reach late agreement on pay hike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's governing coalition partners
avoided a potential crisis by reaching agreement Saturday about a
salary increase for civil servants, the semi-official Anatolia news
agency reported.
	   Junior coalition partner and Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
said the agreement ended a week-long dispute over this year's pay
raise for civil servants.
	   Salaries for government workers are increased regularly,
although the raises do not keep pace with inflation, which runs at
100 percent annually.
	   Ecevit said a 20-percent increase would be announced this month
and that an extra 10-percent wage hike was planned for October, the
report said.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, intent on halving Turkey's
inflation rate by the end of this year, had insisted on strict
spending limits in line with what the government has pledged to the
International Monetary Fund. He had said he can not increase wages
and salaries beyond 20 percent.
	   The Democratic Turkey Party, the third partner in Turkey's
minority government, had pushed for a 40-percent raise and had
threatened to withdraw from the government.
	   Hundreds of civil servants have staged protests over the past
week against the government's proposed 20-percent increase.
	   Turkey has been governed by fragile coalitions since 1991, and
three have collapsed since 1995.

Rebels kill seven policemen in India's northeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Suspected Bodo militants ambushed a police
patrol in India's remote northeast, raking it with automatic
weapons fire and killing all seven policemen, a senior official
said Saturday.
	   The rebels seized four rifles, one carbine and a pistol before
setting the police jeep on fire Friday night, said Alok Kumar, the
secretary responsible for internal security in Assam state.
	   The ambush took place in Kokrajhar district, 250 kilometers (155
miles) west of Gauhati, the capital of Assam.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but Kumar said the
banned National Demoratic Front of Bodoland, or NDFB, was active in
the region.
	   The Bodos are an ethnically distinct tribe comprising 11 percent
of Assam's 22 million people.
	   The NDFB has been fighting for an independent homeland outside
India for Bodo tribespeople since 1986. More than 1,000 people have
been killed in the bush war.
	   The government banned the NDFB five years ago.
	   This was the second attack in 24 hours in the area. On Thursday,
Bodo militants killed six members of a rival group in neighboring
Dhubri district, United News of India news agency said.

Talks resume between Orangemen, Catholic residents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Indirect talks resumed Saturday
between the Orange Order and residents of a Catholic neighborhood
who don't want the Protestant fraternal order marching through
their neighborhood.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said his chief of staff,
Jonathan Powell, was overseeing the contacts, in which the two
sides communicated through mediators but did not speak directly to
each other. Similar talks broke down after a few hours a week ago.
	   ``We do not expect to resolve all the issues today but hope to
make progress that can be brought forward in more meetings at a
later date,'' said Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell. ``We do
not expect this session to go beyond today.''
	   Police and soldiers, enforcing an order by Northern Ireland's
Parades Commission, prevented the Orange Order from marching down
the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast, on July 5.
	   Orangemen massed on the hillside near a rural church every night
for a week, underlining their determination to follow their
traditional parade route. The numbers of protester fell sharply
after a firebomb killed three children of a Catholic woman last
Sunday, and police moved in on Wednesday to search the fields for
weapons.
	   The Portadown Orange lodges have been allowed to maintain a
token presence near the church, although the Church of Ireland said
earlier this week that the Orangemen were no longer welcome to use
church property.

Police confiscate heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Officials seizing 91 kilograms (200
pounds) of heroin worth more than dlrs 62 million have arrested a
man holding a British passport issued in Hong Kong, police said
Saturday.
	   The Australian Federal Police, in a joint operation with the
Australian Customs Service, confiscated the drug on Friday in the
country's biggest drug seizure in four years.
	   Kwok Hung Ng, 33, from the Sydney suburb of Lidcombe, was in
custody after appearing at Central Local Court on Saturday on drug
charges.
	   Police said the heroin was concealed in a shipment of kitchen
equipment that arrived in a container from Xiamen, China, on July 7
and was delivered to a Sydney address.

Government to cancel warning for Taiwanese visitors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - The government announced Saturday that it has
decided to abolish warnings to Taiwanese visitors not to engage in
``embarrassing'' activities in Hong Kong following an outcry from
the tourist industry.
	   The warning tells visitors that they cannot display Taiwanese
flags or emblems or engage in activities that could embarrass Hong
Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule last year.
	   China considers Taiwan a renegade province and bans direct
travel between the mainland and that island. Taiwanese planning to
visit China have to transit through Hong Kong.
	   Beginning on Monday, Taiwanese visiting Hong Kong en route to
mainland China will no longer have their travel documents stamped
with the warning, the Immigration Department said.
	   Both Taiwanese and Hong Kong tourism officials have described
the warning as offensive.
	   In a move to boost tourism to Hong Kong, the government last
month granted visa-free entry to Taiwanese for seven days.
	   More than one million Taiwanese visit Hong Kong annually.

Disasters kill 1,500 in China this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Natural disasters have killed 1,500 people, 1,000
of them in worse-than-usual seasonal flooding, in China this year,
the official China Daily reported Saturday.
	   Floods, earthquakes, landslides and bitter cold have destroyed
more than 3 million houses, damaged 20 million hectares (49 million
acres) and caused 142 billion yuan (dlrs 17 billion) in economic
losses, the newspaper said, citing the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
	   The agency, which handles natural disasters, resettled 4.6
million people, more than half the 8 million disaster victims, the
newspaper said.
	   This year's disasters have been ``unexpectedly severe,''
especially the flooding, the newspaper quoted ministry disaster
relief official Sun Shaocheng as saying. He blamed the disasters on
the disruptive El Nino weather phenomenon.
	   Torrential rains have inundated much of southern China since
early June. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River are facing
their second flood peak this month, China Daily said in a separate
report.

Russian miners partially lift rail blockade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking coal miners in Siberia partially lifted
their blockade of the Trans-Siberian railway Saturday and allowed
some freight trains to deliver their goods, a news agency reported.
	   Protesters in the mining towns of Anzhero-Sudzhensk and Yurga
let four trains with cargos of perishable foods pass through the
blockade on their way to Tomsk, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Pickets blocking the rails near the mining town of Osinki
allowed trains carrying ore to take their loads to treatment
plants, the report said.
	   A spokesman for the West Siberian Railroad told ITAR-Tass that
the miners realized their 15-day-old blockade was paralyzing the
economy of the region, and they decided to ease their protest.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev, acting on orders from
President Boris Yeltsin, was to meet with the miners on Monday, the
news agency said.
	   The miners are demanding Yeltsin's resignation, an overhaul of
the economy and the immediate payment of salaries that have gone
unpaid for up to six months.
	   Sysuyev, who helped resolve a similar rail blockade in May, had
said previously that the federal government would not talk with
miners until they got off the tracks.

Khmer Rouge blamed for attack on election workers; two killed

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The remnants of the Khmer Rouge have
attacked election workers, killing two people, wounding five and
making good on threats to try to disrupt the July 26 parliamentary
elections, officials said Saturday.
	   The attack Friday was the most dramatic blow struck by the
guerrillas since they attacked an ethnic Vietnamese fishing
village, killing 23 people, in April after government troops
overran their last stronghold in northern Cambodia and long-time
leader Pol Pot died of a purported heart attack.
	   Im Suorsdei, spokesman of the National Election Committee
overseeing the elections, told a news conference that a helicopter
had ferried election and civic education materials Friday to Anlong
Veng, the fallen Khmer Rouge stronghold now in government hands.
	   They headed in a convoy to a communal election office in
Trapeang Prasat, 16 kilometers (10 miles) east of Anlong Veng, and
came under fire. Among the injured was an election commission
official for Siem Reap province.
	   Maj. Gen. Chea Mann said that about five guerrillas attacked a
tractor carrying the officials with automatic weapons, then fled.
He dismissed reports that as many as five people were killed. The
two dead were identified as security people
	   ``It is Khmer Rouge under the command of Ta Mok from along the
border,'' Chea Mann said.
	   Thousands of Khmer Rouge guerrillas at Anlong Veng defected to
the government earlier this year and have been receiving voter
education for what will likely be their first election.
	   But die-hard guerrillas who have refused to surrender, led by
long-time Pol Pot lieutenants Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan,
have vowed to disrupt the elections, which they consider a charade
orchestrated by their chief enemy, strongman Hun Sen.
	   The guerrillas, believed to number a few hundred, had reportedly
been bottled up near the rugged border with Thailand. Government
officials said this week that there was no hurry to catch them and
it would be better to let the leaders die of old age.
	   ``It is very sad news for us,'' Im Suorsdei said. ``We planned
to send material and officials based on the local information
provided to us.''
	   The decision whether to continue the electoral process in the
area will depend on the election committee in the northern province
of Siem Reap, Im Suorsdei said, but he was ``optimistic.''
	   The shipment included ballot sheets, boxes, voting booths and
other election related materials.
	   On Thursday, a senior military officer in Thailand, which keeps
a close watch on the Khmer Rouge, said that fresh mines laid in the
area to visitors. It was uncertain whether journalists would be
allowed to cross the border from Thailand to cover the July 26
voting.
	   In 1993, the Khmer Rouge threatened to disrupt U.N.-sponsored
elections that were protected by 20,000 peacekeepers. They failed
but massacred scores of ethnic Vietnamese.
	   Over the past two years, the vast majority of the Khmer Rouge
have made peace with the government. Ta Mok deposed Pol Pot in a
bloody internal power struggle last year.
	   The Maoist-inspired revolutionaries caused the deaths of as many
as 2 million Cambodians when they ruled between 1975 and 1979. They
were toppled by an invasion from Vietnam, Cambodia's traditional
enemy, which imposed a decade of harsh military rule.
	   Hun Sen, who assumed power during the Vietnamese occupation and
has retained it with threats or use of force ever since, has been
accused of using violence and intimidation of opposition supporters
to ensure victory.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With two Thai elephants lending a
helping trunk, workers at an American car rental company washed
cars Saturday to raise funds for Bangkok's slum children.
	   The two trained jumbos were a big attraction as Bangkok drivers
dished out a total of 28,000 baht (dlrs 682) during the three-hour
charity car wash.
	   The money will go to projects run by the Rev. Joseph H. Maier,
an American Catholic priest who has worked among Bangkok's slum
dwellers for nearly three decades.
	   The elephants sprayed water through their trunks, while
employees of the Budget Car and Truck Rental used more conventional
methods to clean vehicles.
	   Free food and drinks were served to slum children and customers
while clowns added to the festive atmosphere.
	   Maier, 59, of Longview, Washington, has lived in Thailand since
1967 and provides educational help for 4,800 children from 32
Bangkok slums. Other projects help prostitutes, AIDS victims and
drug addicts.
	   The outspoken priest has frequently criticized Thais for not
supporting charitable causes, including his own. Most of his
funding comes from foreign sources.
	   Allan Davidson, general manager of Budget's Thailand operation,
said the car wash would encourage others to contribute to
charities.
	   ``It is sort of fun that we all come here to wash cars, but this
leads us to have more understanding of the problems confronting
Thai children and what we can do to help,'' Davidson said.

Eritrean president meets Moi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki met
Saturday with his Kenyan counterpart, Daniel arap Moi, in what
appeared to be the latest attempt to mediate the two-month border
conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
	   The private Kenya Television Network said Isaias met Moi at his
official State House residence.
	   The Presidential Press Service was not immediately able to
confirm the meeting or what was discussed.
	   On July 13, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi spent three
hours with Moi discussing the situation between the two countries
in the Horn of Africa that were formerly close.
	   On Thursday, Kenyan Foreign Minister Boyana Godana said Kenya's
strategy ``is to see in what way we can level the area of
disagreement'' between Ethiopia and Eritrea because ``the conflict
is definitely dangerous for the sub-region.''
	   The conflict has reached a stalemate after heavy fighting in
early June left hundreds dead on both sides.
	   The United States and Rwanda initially presented a four-point
proposal for peace talks that included Eritrean withdrawal from
contested areas it had occupied after May 6.
	   Eritrea balked at the precondition, claiming it was only on
territory rightfully within its boundaries.
	   Four nations from the Organization of African Unity also made
apparent fruitless attempts to get both countries to sit down to
talks.

At least 70 dead after tidal wave hits Papua New Guinea coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with death estimate at 70 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Sweeping all before it, a
tidal wave crashed against Papua New Guinea's north coast, killing
at least 70 people and crushing villages, the country's National
Disaster Center said.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off
the coast that Australian Geological Survey Organization said had a
magnitude of 7.0.
	   The disaster center said late Saturday that hundreds are missing
and thousands are without food and shelter.
	   ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless and
there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,''
Fr. Austin Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   He said most of the dead were children who drowned.
	   Disaster authorities said the wave struck to the west of the
town of Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at least four
villages _ Sissano, Warapu, Arop and Malol.
	   The area is spotted with villages consisting of homes built on
beaches of jungle materials.
	   ``At Warapu, there is no house standing _ it's a village of
1,800 people,'' Crapp said. ``Arop, again, is 1,800 to 2,000 people
_ there's nothing standing there.
	   ``They (the two villages) are both clean sand. It's complete
devastation.''
	   A helicopter pilot who landed in Aitape on Saturday reported
seeing bodies floating among the debris in the lagoon, he said.
	   Papua New Guinea provincial disaster coordinator Peter Tavun
said homeless survivors were in desperate need of food and shelter.
	   Crapp said a helicopter was picking up injured people and
doctors had been flown in to treat them. The injured, mostly
suffering cuts and fractures, were being taken to a mission
hospital at Aitape.
	   Rob Parer, a businessman who lives near Aitape, said some
villagers who fled into the jungle after the wave struck are still
hiding there.
	   ``The people have never heard of anything like it. They thought
the world had ended,'' Parer told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   In Canberra, Australian seismologist Kevin McCue from the
Australian Geological Survey Organization said the earthquake's
epicenter was just off the town of Aitape.
	   ``It was a shallow, major earthquake,'' he said.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 is devastating if it hits
an urban area.
	   The last tidal wave in the area had been in December 1930 when a
magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the Admiralty Islands, McCue said.

Intense fighting erupts on border, further inland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting raged Friday on Kosovo's
border with Albania, with Serb forces shelling villages lying on a
suspected gun-running route for ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
Albanian border guards reported many dead and wounded.
	   Further inland, separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas seeking to
tear Kosovo province away from Serbia were reported launching their
own attack on Serb security forces controlling a mostly Albanian
town.
	   While the Serb assault seemed aimed at further disrupting arms
smuggling routes into Kosovo, the attack by the Kosovo Liberation
Army _ estimated to control up to 40 percent of the province _
appeared to be trying to grab more territory inland.
	   Reporting on the border fighting, Albanian border police
spokesmen said that some of the shells fired in Kosovo were landing
and exploding up to half a kilometer (hundreds of yards) within
Albanian territory.
	   Spokesman Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which
controls the border police, said border guards had seen many killed
and wounded by the shelling of the Padesh village area, He said
guards could see dead bodies lying on the group on the Kosovo side
but offered no casualty counts.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack in their villages. It is also used by the Kosovo Liberation
Army to smuggle guns and ammunition from Northern Albania into
Kosovo.
	   After a brief lull, fighting in the Padesh region resumed after
daybreak. Bizhga said that at least five wounded KLA members had
crossed into Albania to escape the shelling.
	   The KLA assault was centered on Orahovac, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of the province where
ethnic Albanians form a 90-percent majority.
	   Reporting on the fighting, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Information Center could not say whether Serb police controlling
the mostly ethnic-Albanian town of 20,000 might have been forced to
cede some ground.
	   Serbia is the largest of the two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia and dominates the Yugoslav federation. The Yugoslav _
and Serbian _ five-month crackdown on the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army has triggered a backlash in Kosovo not only against
the government but also against Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, whose commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the
bloodshed or win self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected in March but
never authorized by the Serbian government.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   In a statement to the province's Albanian-language media on
Friday, the KLA declared its opposition to the Kosovo assembly,
saying that by convening it, the Albanian leadership was
``minimizing the KLA's struggle for liberation.''
	   Like the KLA, Rugova also supports independence but his
opposition to violence has won him international support.

Takanohana remains unbeaten to clinch tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Takanohana
defeated Hawaiian-born Musashimaru Saturday to keep his record
perfect and secure the title in the Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   With one day left in the 15-day tournament, ozeki (champion)
Musashimaru lost his balance charging at Takanohana, and the
yokozuna easily slapped him down.
	   Musashimaru, who needed to win to keep his tournament hopes
alive, slipped to 11-3, while Takanohana improved to 14-0.
	   The triumph marked a return to form for Takanohana, who clinched
his first championship in five tournaments.
	   Hawaiian-born yokozuna Akebono defeated newly promoted yokozuna
Wakanohana, leaving both wrestlers at 10-4.
	   After the two initially collided, the smaller Wakanohana ran
around the ring trying to avoid Akebono's thrusts, but Akebono
eventually caught up with him and pushed him out.
	   In the day's longest bout, ninth-ranked maegashira Kotonowaka
(11-3) defeated ozeki Takanonami, who took his fifth loss against
nine wins.
	   After being locked motionless for about a minute, the wrestlers
both attempted arm throws which sent them tumbling to the ground at
about the same time.
	   The judges ruled that Takanonami's hand hit the dirt first and
awarded the bout to Kotonowaka.
	   No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, won
by default to improve to 9-5 after No. 7 maegashira Tosanoumi
pulled out of the tournament with an injured ankle.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, also from
Mongolia, was pushed out by veteran maegashira Terao. Kyokutenho
was at 3-11, while Terao improved to 4-10.
	   In the highest junior division of makushita, 27th-ranked
Wakaazuma, or Yoshinobu Kuroda of Brazil, pushed out Futatsukuni to
improve to 4-3.
	   No. 16-ranked Kaishinzan (4-3), or American Henry Armstrong
Miller, shoved out Shimanoryu.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshiandesu, or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez,
lost to Tamarikido, and fell to 4-3.
	   No. 2 ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
pushed out Hokutohikari for his sixth win against one loss.
	   In Sandanme, No. 65-ranked Azumakaze (4-3), or Brazilian Tussato
Giuliano Kotinda, beat Kyunankai. No. 17 Kyokutenzan (4-3), or
Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, lost to Fujihana.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Anti-riot policemen prepare for trouble in Lagos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Hundreds of heavily-armed anti-riot
policemen were braced Saturday for possible violence as the family
of the late opposition leader Moshood Abiola began a day of prayer
services at the family's Lagos estate and business headquarters.
	   Police units were deployed throughout Nigeria's commercial
capital of Lagos, including at a race track where Abiola's family
had initially planned to hold the services.
	   The venue was changed Friday after police forbid the use of the
track, fearing renewed violence by large crowds.
	   Other security forces patroled outside Abiola family's palacial
home and business offices where the prayers went ahead.
	   There was initially no sign of trouble Saturday morning and many
streets were filled with people going about their usual weekend
business.
	   Many Muslims traditionally hold prayers seven days after someone
is buried. The city's public markets remained closed Saturday in
honor of Abiola.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993's annulled presidential
elections, was imprisoned in 1994 after declaring himself
president.
	   His death July 7 triggered several days of rioting in Lagos and
a number of other Nigerian cities, killing dozens of people and
leaving many homes and vehicles destroyed.
	   Dozens of people, including more than 30 teens and pre-teens,
were arrested.
	   Nigerian authorities, as well as a team of independent
pathologists, say Abiola apparently died of a heart attack. One
group involved in the latter autopsy, the U.S.-based Physicians for
Human Rights, said he did not receive proper medical care for his
heart condition during his imprisonment.
	   Some members of Abiola's family, and many of his supporters, say
he was poisoned.
	   Since taking over from the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha who
died of heart failure in early June, Abubakar has released dozens
of political prisoners and promised democratic reforms.
	   After meeting late Friday in Nigeria's capital of Abuja with
Organization of African Unity secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim,
Abubakar said he was convinced all Nigerians were in favor of a
return to democracy.
	   The regime was committed to providing ``opportunities to all to
contribute to the efforts at finding solutions to the country's
problems,'' Abubakar added.
	   Nigeria has been ruled for all but 10 of the 38 years since
independence from former colonial power Britain by successive
military governments.

Intense fighting erupts on border, further inland

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting raged Saturday on Kosovo's
border with Albania, with Serb forces shelling villages lying on a
suspected gun-running route for ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
Albanian border guards reported many dead and wounded.
	   Further inland, separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas seeking to
tear Kosovo province away from Serbia were reported launching their
own attack on Serb security forces controlling a mostly Albanian
town.
	   While the Serb assault seemed aimed at further disrupting arms
smuggling routes into Kosovo, the attack by the Kosovo Liberation
Army _ estimated to control up to 40 percent of the province _
appeared to be trying to grab more territory inland.
	   Reporting on the border fighting, Albanian border police
spokesmen said that some of the shells fired in Kosovo were landing
and exploding up to half a kilometer (hundreds of yards) within
Albanian territory.
	   Spokesman Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which
controls the border police, said border guards had seen many killed
and wounded by the shelling of the Padesh village area, He said
guards could see dead bodies lying on the group on the Kosovo side
but offered no casualty counts.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack in their villages. It is also used by the Kosovo Liberation
Army to smuggle guns and ammunition from Northern Albania into
Kosovo.
	   After a brief lull, fighting in the Padesh region resumed after
daybreak. Bizhga said that at least five wounded KLA members had
crossed into Albania to escape the shelling.
	   The KLA assault was centered on Orahovac, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of the province where
ethnic Albanians form a 90-percent majority.
	   Reporting on the fighting, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo

the government but also against Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, whose commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the
bloodshed or win self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA.
	   A mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe was meeting with Rugova Saturday in its attempts to find a
negotiated end to the violence.

Aiding Sudanese war victims turns trading post into major relief

<TEXT>
	   LOKICHOKIO, Kenya (AP) _ Aiding victims of the 15-year war in
southern Sudan has transformed this barren trading post in
northwestern Kenya into one of the United Nations' largest relief
bases in the world.
	   For nine years, it has served as a staging ground for planes
that have delivered tons of food and medical supplies to frightened
and hungry Sudanese.
	   But the benefits of the ambitious relief effort haven't spilled
over into the streets of this dusty, sun-scorched town 15 miles (25
kilometers) southeast of the Sudanese border.
	   ``Even the money hasn't reached us,'' said Father John, a local
Roman Catholic priest, pointing to Lokichokio's crumbling
mud-walled buildings, with their rusty tin roofs.
	   The priest's voice was suddenly lost in the roar of a C-130
transport plane, one of 18 chartered by the U.N. World Food Program
to make food drops in southern Sudan, where up to 2.6 million
people face starvation brought on by war and drought.
	   Forty-two private relief agencies, along with WFP and UNICEF,
operate out of Lokichokio, or Loki as it's known among aid workers.
Of these, 39 are under the auspices of Operation Lifeline Sudan, a
9-year-old U.N. organization.
	   It took the deaths in 1988 of an estimated 250,000 Sudanese in a
war-induced famine to draw the legion of aid agencies to
Lokichokio. Now, the United Nations spends dlrs 3.2 million a year
to maintain the Loki base.
	   Armed with laptops, clipboards and walkie-talkies, relief
workers at Loki calculate how much aid will be needed on the other
side of the border, where 360 to 400 co-workers distribute the aid.
With this information, U.N and other agencies solicit funds from
donors.
	   Often, the aid groups' requests are not met and their delivery
plans lag. What's more, food often falls into the wrong hands.
	   ``We know some Sudanese distributing food on our behalf have
ostracized some people,'' WFP field coordinator Claude Jibidar
said. ``It is a problem we have to deal with.''
	   Recently, between 160 and 200 metric tons of food have been
airlifted from Loki into southern Sudan each day. Meanwhile,
predominantly Christian, African and animist southerners continue
fighting for autonomy from the Muslim and Arabized north.
	   Since 1983, an estimated 1.5 million people have died in the
fighting and accompanying famines.
	   Life for the some 200 aid workers based at Loki follows a
routine. Meals are catered and the accommodations are comfortable,
though modest. There is little to do but sleep, eat and work, in
temperatures that routinely exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38
degrees Celsius).
	   WFP coordinator American Jason Matus is blunt: ``There is no
quality of life here.''
	   It's hardly better for Lokichokio's longtime residents.
	   The local Samburu people, pastoralists who receive meager relief
food from the Kenya government, have nothing to sell to the aid
agencies, which receive their supplies from Nairobi by truck.
	   ``These people are not happy to see all this food going to
Sudan, when they themselves have little to eat,'' Father John said.
``But they understand it is not meant for them.''
	   With little education, only a few Samburus have been employed by
the aid agencies. Even then, they are the most menial jobs.

Iraqi tankers too expensive to keep, Kuwait says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait says it wants to sell five Iraqi tankers in
its custody since the 1991 Gulf War because the rusty ships could
sink any time, and maintaining them has become too costly.
	   Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah said Kuwait has
spent dlrs 18.4 million until the end of June 1997 on maintaining
the tankers and does not want to pour in more money, the official
Kuwait News Agency said Friday.
	   Sheik Sabah made the remarks in a letter sent Friday to the U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The explanation was in response to a
letter by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad al-Sahhaf to Annan
earlier this month asking him to stop Kuwait from selling the
vessels as scrap metal.
	   Iraq says it wants the ships back and is prepared to take legal
action against buyers.
	   Al-Sahhaf had told Annan that four of the tankers, the
Al-Muthanna, Al-Qadisiyah, Hittin and Tariq ibn Ziyad, were in good
condition, while the Al-Faw was damaged.
	   But Sheik Sabah was quoted as saying that four of the ships were
damaged and one was in good condition. He said Kuwait has the
U.N.'s permission to sell the tankers.
	   KUNA quoted Sheik Sabah as saying that during its seven-month
occupation of Kuwait, Iraq had placed these tankers in Kuwait's
territorial waters ``in order to spill oil in the sea and pollute
the marine environment,''
	   He said it would have been better for Iraq to abide by Security
Council resolutions including returning Kuwaiti property than to
``accuse Kuwait of illegal activities concerning these tankers.''
	   A U.S.-led coalition fought the Gulf War that liberated Kuwait
in February 1991.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A decade after 28-year-old British tourist
Julie Ward was slain in a Kenyan game park, Attorney General Amos
Wako said Saturday there was enough circumstantial evidence to
arraign a suspect on murder charges and stage a second trial.
	   Wako, who was flanked by John Ward, the young woman's father,
said Simon ole Makalla, a former senior game warden in the Maasai
Mara reserve where Ward was murdered, would appear in court Monday
to face murder charges.
	   Ward's mutilated and charred remains were discovered in the
reserve on the Tanzanian border Sept. 13, 1988. Officials first
claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild animals.
	   Two park rangers were subsequently arrested and tried for her
murder, but they were found innocent of all charges in June 1992.
Justice Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police for conducting a
flawed investigation.
	   Three assessors told the court they believed there were three
principal suspects in the murder, and Makalla was one of them.
	   Assessor John Leparakuo told the court it was his ``strong
opinion'' that Makalla and David Nchoko and Gerald Karori ``knew
more than what they told us in the court proceedings.''
	   On March 2, 1996, Wako agreed that new information about the
killing made another ``fair and objective'' investigation
necessary.
	   Many questions remainded to be answered, he said, ``with regard
to the role of David Nchoko, Gerald Karori and Simon Makalla.''
	   Ward, a wealthy hotelier from Bury St. Edmonds, England, has
carried on a 10-year campaign to find his daughter's killers and
have them brought to justice.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A trapped miner and 11 men trying to
rescue him were feared dead after a mudslide buried them in an
underground talc mine, state radio reported Saturday.
	   Tons of mud snapped the cable of an underground elevator in
which some of the rescuers were riding, sending them plunging into
the depths of the mine at the town of Lassing, some 200 kilometers
(120 miles) southwest of Vienna. The others in the 11-member rescue
team were already on the bottom of the pit when the mudslide hit.
	   An earlier mudslide on Friday had trapped a miner about 60
meters (yards) underground. Hopes that he was still alive faded
Saturday, after a camera introduced through a narrow opening dug by
rescue crews revealed the area he was thought to be in flooded with
water.
	   The mudslides left a crater 50 meters (yards) deep and about 150
meters (yards) in diameter, the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   Several houses nearby tumbled into the pit.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting raged Saturday on Kosovo's
border with Albania, with Serb forces shelling villages along a
suspected gun-running route for ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
Albanian border guards reported many dead and wounded.
	   Further inland, ethnic Albanian guerrillas seeking to tear
Kosovo province away from Serbia were reported launching their own

	   While the Serb assault seemed aimed at disrupting arms smuggling
routes into Kosovo, the attack by the Kosovo Liberation Army _
estimated to control as much as 40 percent of the Serbian province
_ appeared to be trying to grab more territory in the interior.
	   Serbia is the largest of the two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia. A five-month crackdown on the KLA by Yugoslav and
Serbian forces has triggered a backlash in Kosovo not only against
the government but also against ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, whose commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the
bloodshed or win self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA.

	   Spokesman Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which
controls the border police, said guards had seen many people killed
and wounded in shelling of the Padesh village area, Guards could
see dead bodies lying on the Kosovo side but offered no casualty
counts, he said.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 refugees who
fled in June from Kosovo across the border into Albania to escape a
Serb attack on their villages. The Kosovo Liberation Army also uses
the area to smuggle guns and ammunition from Northern Albania into
Kosovo.
	   The KLA assault centered on Orahovac, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of the province where ethnic
Albanians form a 90-percent majority.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center could not say
whether Serb police controlling the mostly ethnic-Albanian town of
20,000 might have been forced to cede some ground.
	   A mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe was meeting with Rugova on Saturday in an effort to find a
negotiated end to the violence.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, which was elected in
March but never authorized by the Serbian government.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   In a statement to the province's Albanian-language media on
Friday, the KLA declared its opposition to the Kosovo assembly,
saying that by convening it, the Albanian leadership was
``minimizing the KLA's struggle for liberation.''

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Two Croatian truck drivers are in
custody after Hungarian customs officers on the border with Romania
found heroin worth millions of dollars hidden in their textile
shipment, officials said Saturday.
	   The 113.2 kilograms (249 pounds) of the drug is worth over 2.5
million dollars, national customs office spokesman Jenoe Sipos
said.
	   The truck was on its way from Turkey to Croatia and tried to
enter Hungary Friday at Nagylak, 250 kilometers (160 miles)

EU delegation in Iran to revive dialogue broken off last year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hoping to hasten a thaw in relations with
Iran, senior EU officials arrived Saturday for talks aimed at
restarting a dialogue that was suspended last year when a German
court accused Tehran of murdering dissidents in Berlin.
	   The EU indicated it was keen to normalize ties with Iran
following the May 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami, a
moderate cleric who has been trying to temper Iran's hard-line
foreign and domestic policies.
	   The visit by officials from the foreign ministries of Britain,
Austria and Germany was aimed at refining topics for more detailed
future talks between the European Union and Iran, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   IRNA said the officials representing the past, present and
future holders of the EU's rotating presidency were scheduled to
meet later Saturday with Morteza Sarmadi, Iran's deputy foreign
minister for Euro-American affairs.
	   The talks will center on economic cooperation, drug trafficking
and ways of resolving regional conflicts in Afghanistan, the
Balkans and elsewhere, IRNA said.
	   The officials, led by the secretary general of the Austrian
foreign ministry, Albert Rohan, hoped also to raise touchier topics
like terrorism and human rights.
	   ``If they want to clean the slate for bilateral ties, they have
to abandon rhetorics on human rights, development of nuclear
weapons and terrorism,'' the English-language Tehran Times said.
	   The EU broke off a five-year-old ``critical dialogue'' with Iran
last year following accusations by a German court that Iranian
leaders ordered the killings of Kurdish-Iranian dissidents in
Berlin five years ago.
	   The EU drive for better ties stems partly from an interest in
doing business with Iran's oil and natural gas industries, which
American companies are barred from entering due to sanctions
imposed by the United States.
	   The EU received a boost last month when U.S. President Bill
Clinton vetoed a bill seeking to punish any country that invested
more than dlrs 20 million annually in Iran's oil and gas sectors.
	   Earlier this month, Iran whetted European business appetites
further by seeking financial backing for oil ventures worth a
whopping dlrs 8 billion.
	   One sticking point amid the strengthening relations has been
Tehran's 1989 death sentence against Salman Rushdie. The Iranians
continue to insist that the Indian-born British writer must be
killed for insulting Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''

Third candidate enters race to become prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Koizumi's news conference
 &UR; AP Photos planned
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A maverick Cabinet minister, popular with the
younger wing of the ruling party, announced his candidacy Saturday
to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, making the
contest a three-way race.
	   Like his more senior rivals, 59-year-old Health and Welfare
Minister Junichiro Koizumi promised to boost Japan's ailing economy
by slashing corporate and income taxes.
	   Koizumi also vowed to privatize the postal ministry within 10
years _ a controversial plan that, in the past, has earned him a
reputation as a rebel in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or
LDP.
	   ``I am honored that so many LDP members who are worried about
the nation and the party have supported me,'' Koizumi told
reporters.
	   Koizumi also proposed to cut the number of government employees
in half within a decade.
	   Koizumi joined Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, who announced their
presidential bids Friday.
	   The Liberal Democratic president, who will be chosen July 24 in
balloting by party lawmakers, is virtually sure to become prime
minister because the party controls the powerful lower house of
Parliament.
	   Koizumi's image as a loose cannon may hurt him in the party vote
but may appeal to voters, who are looking for a younger man of
action to bring about change.
	   The party's choice of a president is crucial in helping it
regain the support of voters before lower house elections, which
must be called by 2000.
	   Hashimoto announced he would resign Monday after his party
suffered a crushing defeat in elections for the upper house of
Parliament, losing 17 seats.
	   Analysts attributed the party's defeat to voter dissatisfaction
with the way it handled the economy, which is mired in its worst
recession since World War II.
	   Kajiyama, 72, has recently pushed more aggressively for economic
reforms, but some have voiced concerns about his health because of
his age.
	   Obuchi, 61, appears to be the favorite of party power brokers,
but the colorless veteran lacks broad popular appeal.
	   In announcing his candidacy Friday, Obuchi said he supports a 6
trillion yen (dlrs 43 billion) cut in personal and corporate income
taxes.
	   Kajiyama said he would perform ``major surgery'' on the
country's ailing banking system, which is burdened with 87.5
trillion yen (dlrs 625 billion) in failed or high-risk loans left
over from the collapse of the property market in the early 1990s.
	   Koizumi may win the support of a growing number of discontented
younger party lawmakers, who have publicly criticized the LDP for
failing to move faster to mend its ways after Sunday's election
defeat.
	   A rebellion by younger lawmakers forced the party to postpone by
three days a vote on its presidency to give candidates more time to
explain their views.
	   Koizumi received wide media coverage last year opposing
Hashimoto and other party elders last year in calling for postal
privatization.
	   The issue is particularly touchy for the LDP because post
masters wield enormous influence in rural Japan, where most of the
party's most faithful bastions are located.
	   The postal system manages the lion's share of Japan's mammoth
personal savings.

Iran: Trial of Israeli businessman politically motivated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The trial of an Israeli businessman found
guilty of selling chemical weapons to Iran was a politically
motivated ``spectacle,'' the government said Saturday.
	   Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mahmoud Mohammadi, said
Israel mounted the trial to portray Iran as a country trying to
acquire chemical weapons even though Iran has been lobbying against
them.
	   ``The aim of this politicized judicial trickery by Israel was
... a consequence of Israeli concerns that Iran was pursuing a
policy against the use of chemical weapons,'' Mohammadi was quoted
as saying by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   He accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
pressuring the trial judge and defense lawyers, revealing ``the
main Israeli objectives in holding this spectacle of a trial.''
	   Nahum Manbar, a former Israeli paratrooper, was sentenced
Thursday to 16 years in jail for selling chemical weapons materials
to Iran. He was convicted of treason in a closed trial last month.
	   Manbar's lawyers are trying to prove that Netanyahu and his
government intervened in the case. Netanyahu has vehemently denied
the allegations.

Rwandan court convicts four people on genocide charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A Rwandan court has convicted four people
on charges of genocide and sentenced two of them to death,
state-run Rwandan radio reported Saturday. The other two were
sentenced to life in prison.
	   Euphrasie Kamatamu, 54, a former councilor, was convicted of
organizing the killings of minority Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, during the 1994
Hutu-government organized genocide of more than 500,000 people.
	   Kamatamu and her husband, Thomas Habyarimana, were sentenced to
death after being found guilty Friday of drawing up death lists,
distributing weapons to Hutu killing squads and manning roadblocks
so no Tutsis could escape during the 90-day slaughter.
	   The two who received life sentences were a friend of Kamatamu
and her personal guard.
	   Kamatamu was known in Kigali's Nyamirambo neighborhood as a
deeply religious Roman Catholic. Throughout the three-month killing
spree, she continued to attend Mass and to wear her trademark
rosary.
	   When Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994 and stopped the
killing, she fled to neighboring Zaire, now Congo, together with 1
million defeated soldiers, government officials and ordinary
civilians.
	   In November 1996, she and her husband returned to Rwanda along
with hundreds of thousands of others, after the Rwandan-backed
rebels in eastern Zaire dismantled the camps.
	   Kamatamu turned herself in, apparently fearing reprisal. At
first, she confessed to genocide charges but later claimed the
confession had been beaten out of her.
	   About 130,000 Rwandans are imprisoned on suspicion of taking
part in the genocide. So far, about 300 have been convicted and
sentenced, a third of them to death.
	   On April 24, authorities publicly executed the first 22 genocide
convicts, including a woman.
	   The government says it plans more executions.

China launches European satellite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China successfully launched a European-made
telecommunications satellite aboard a Chinese rocket Saturday, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The Long March 3B rocket blasted off from the Xichang Satellite
Launch Center in southwestern Sichuan province at 5:20 p.m. (0920
GMT) and the satellite was placed into orbit a short time later,
Xinhua said.
	   Sinosat-1 will serve China's budding financial industry and
Shanghai's booming information network, the official China Daily
reported Saturday. It is the third of four planned launches to
boost telecommunications services in China.
	   The satellite's builder, Aerospatiale of France, will be
responsible for monitoring and controlling the satellite once in
orbit, Xinhua said.
	   Sinosat-1 is the first European-made satellite ever launched by
China. The Long March 3B is an improved version of an earlier
rocket that blew up after taking off Feb. 15, 1996, carrying an
American-made satellite.
	   U.S. prosecutors and Congress are investigating whether American
satellite companies, in investigating the explosion, improperly
passed on sensitive information that may have helped China improve
its military capabilities. China's Foreign Ministry denied the
allegations Wednesday.

North Korea threatens to restart nuclear program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea reiterated its threat
Saturday to restart its nuclear facilities suspected of atomic bomb
development.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency accused the
United States of failing to fulfill its obligations under a 1994
agreement in which Washington pledged to help the communist state
acquire two light-water nuclear reactors to replace its
plutonium-producing models.
	   Washington also promised to provide 500,000-ton annual
replacement fuel oil shipments until the first reactor comes on
line by 2003.
	   But reactor construction and fuel deliveries were running months
behind schedule because of difficulty in raising funds.
	   ``If the agreement is left without any real meaning and the
project is delayed, we cannot but reconsider the building of our
own nuclear power industry,'' KCNA said.
	   In the 1994 deal, North Korea froze operation and construction
at five nuclear-related facilities.
	   Since last month, however, U.S. officials have said North Korea
might be looking for an excuse to back out of the agreement.
Pyongyang has recently done maintenance work on its closed nuclear
plants.
	   Building two light-water reactors is expected to cost between
dlrs 4 billion and dlrs 5 billion. But South Korea, the United
States, Japan and other contributors have yet to agree on how to
share the cost.
	   South Korea, a major financier, was hit by a severe financial
crisis and wants to reduce its share.
	   Earlier this month, the Clinton administration said it has
procured 210,000 of 500,000 tons of heavy oil promised to North
Korea this year, but it had no money to buy the rest.
	   It asked Congress for new funds and wanted other nations to
contribute some of the total dlrs 50 million annual cost.
	   On Wednesday, the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, said inspectors have yet to verify ``the accuracy
and completeness'' of North Korea's initial declaration of nuclear
facilities and amount of nuclear material it held.

Intense fighting erupts on border, further inland

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting raged Saturday on Kosovo's
border with Albania, with Serb forces shelling villages lying on a
suspected gun-running route for ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
Albanian border guards reported many dead and wounded.
	   Further inland, separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas seeking to
tear Kosovo province away from Serbia were reported launching their
own attack on Serb security forces controlling a mostly Albanian
town.
	   While the Serb assault seemed aimed at further disrupting arms
smuggling routes into Kosovo, the attack by the Kosovo Liberation
Army _ estimated to control up to 40 percent of the province _
appeared to be trying to grab more territory inland.
	   Reporting on the border fighting, Albanian border police
spokesmen said that some of the shells fired in Kosovo were landing
and exploding up to half a kilometer (hundreds of yards) within
Albanian territory.
	   Spokesman Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which
controls the border police, said border guards had seen many killed
and wounded by the shelling of the Padesh village area, He said
guards could see dead bodies lying on the group on the Kosovo side
but offered no casualty counts.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack in their villages. It is also used by the Kosovo Liberation
Army to smuggle guns and ammunition from Northern Albania into
Kosovo.
	   After a brief lull, fighting in the Padesh region resumed after
daybreak. Bizhga said that at least five wounded KLA members had
crossed into Albania to escape the shelling.
	   In Pristina, British Embassy officials said they were searching
for a British aid workers feared missing in western Kosovo _
possibly in the border area.
	   Sally Becker, known as the Angel of Mostar for her humanitarian
efforts in that Bosnian city during the war, was reported missing
Thursday, said the officials.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A trapped miner and 11 men trying to
rescue him were feared dead after a mudslide buried them in an
underground talc mine in southwestern Austria, state radio reported
Saturday.
	   Tons of mud snapped the cable of an underground elevator in
which some of the rescuers were riding, sending them plunging into
the depths of the mine at the town of Lassing, some 200 kilometers
(120 miles) southwest of Vienna.
	   The others in the 11-member rescue team were already on the
bottom of the pit when the mudslide hit.
	   An earlier mudslide on Friday had trapped a miner about 60
meters (yards) underground. Hopes that he was still alive faded
Saturday, after a camera inserted through a narrow opening revealed
that water had flooded the area where he was thought to be trapped.
	   The mudslides left a crater 50 meters (yards) deep and about 150
meters (yards) in diameter, the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   Several houses nearby tumbled into the pit.

Cardinal Sin blasts return of ``plunderers''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Roman Catholic archbishop of
Manila, Jaime Cardinal Sin, denounced on Saturday the return of
``former plunderers,'' referring to close associates of the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   It was the first time that the outspoken prelate has commented
on the emerging political and economic rehabilitation under the
administration of President Joseph Estrada of the Marcos allies who
were ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in February 1986
	   Sin, who played a key role in the revolt, did not name anyone
but was clearly alluding to business tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.,
one of the most powerful figures during the Marcos regime.
	   Cojuangco was recently re-elected chairman of San Miguel Corp.,
the Philippines' largest food and beverage conglomerate.
	   ``I am worried about the ease that accompanies our dealing with
the former plunderers of the nation,'' Sin said in a statement.
``Has our nation become so poor in spiritual and moral values that
we want people of doubtful character to take positions of
leadership?''
	   Cojuangco fled the country with the Marcos family and was booted
out of San Miguel after the government seized his shares on
suspicion that they were acquired illegally.
	   Cojuangco returned a few years later and fought to regain his
shares until a court ruled last April that he could vote on his 20
percent stake in San Miguel. The government still holds another 27
percent stake he had previously controlled.
	   He lost in his bid for the presidency in 1992 and helped finance
the presidential bid of Estrada in the May 11 polls. He is now also
chairman of Estrada's Struggle of the Filipino Masses party.
	   Critics say Lucio Tan, another tycoon closely associated with
Marcos who reportedly backed Estrada, also could benefit from the
Estrada administration.
	   Tan, who controls troubled Philippine Airlines and has interests
in banking, tobacco and beer, allegedly owes the government 26.5
billion (dlrs 646 million) in taxes. He would benefit from the tax
amnesty program being proposed by the Estrada government.
	   Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, has warned that the return
of Marcos' associates could scare off foreign investors worried
about unfair competition with ``crony capitalists.''
	   Sin said many of his friends in the church and the business
sector have expressed ``their apprehension about what is going on
in the country.''
	   ``It is too soon to judge,'' said Sin, who had opposed Estrada's
candidacy. ``However, I believe it is not too early to remind one
another that values are values and we need to safeguard them.
	   ``There are higher values than friendship. Truth, justice and
integrity are values that should rule supreme,'' he said.

Assad visit: little comment, but more symbolism

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Although Syrian President Hafez Assad didn't make
many public statements during his visit to France, his mere
presence was statement enough for the leader of a country long
diplomatically isolated.
	   The sight of Assad standing next to a smiling President Jacques
Chirac, who spoke of ``very positive'' talks between the two,
seemed to reflect how Syria's image has improved in recent months,
as the deadlock persists in the Arab-Israeli negotiations mediated
by the United States.
	   For Chirac, the meeting was a clear indication of how much
France still wants to play a role in Mideast peacemaking _ and sees
Syria as a good partner.
	   ``We know very well that there won't be peace in the region
without the active participation of Syria,'' Chirac said Friday,
after their second meeting in two days.
	   ``Consequently, we want to combine our efforts, France and
Syria, to attain our objective.''
	   He was referring to the goal of Mideast peace, but it's also
clear that France wants to be a player in the process, and a
counterweight to the United States.
	   Assad, too, seeks a partnership with another country to balance
Israel's strong alliance with Washington.
	   Syria is one of the Arab world's more isolated countries. Its
good relations with Iran's Islamic government have alienated Iraq
and Gulf nations while its support for radical Palestinian groups
makes others uncomfortable. The United States accuses Syria of
sponsoring international terrorism.
	   But some Arab nations have begun listening to Syria's
long-standing call to isolate Israel, both economically and
politically. They have expressed admiration, too, for Assad's
refusal to negotiate with Israel unless it returns the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
	   It has been 22 years since Assad visited France, and he has been
to the West only a couple of times in the past decade. So the
symbolism of his being received in the elegant Elysee palace and
feted by a band of the Republican Guard, with their gilded helmets
and long red plumes, was considerable.
	   France has special leverage with Syria, partly because the Arab
nation was once a French-mandated territory, from 1920-1946.
	   But there is an uncomfortable issue between the two nations: the
whereabouts of Alois Brunner, one of the world's most-wanted Nazi
war criminals, long believed to be hiding out in Syria.
	   Assad told Chirac on Friday that ``to his knowledge,'' Brunner
is not in Syria, the French president's spokeswoman said.
	   Brunner, who once was commandant of the squalid French transit
camp at Drancy, is the subject of a French judicial investigation.
Chirac asked that Syria finally respond officially to the French
investigation, and Assad said he would ``examine the issue,'' said
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
	   In public, Assad made few comments during his trip, the official
part of which ended Friday afternoon. There was no joint news
conference.
	   Assad left France on Saturday about noon (1000 GMT), the French
Foreign Ministry said.

Intense fighting erupts on border, further inland

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting raged Saturday on Kosovo's
border with Albania, with Serb forces shelling villages lying on a
suspected gun-running route for ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
Albanian border guards reported many dead and wounded.
	   Further inland, separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas seeking to
tear Kosovo province away from Serbia were reported launching their
own attack on Serb security forces controlling a mostly Albanian
town.
	   While the Serb assault seemed aimed at further disrupting arms
smuggling routes into Kosovo, the attack by the Kosovo Liberation
Army _ estimated to control up to 40 percent of the province _
appeared to be trying to grab more territory inland.
	   Reporting on the border fighting, Albanian border police
spokesmen said that some of the shells fired in Kosovo were landing
and exploding up to half a kilometer (hundreds of yards) within
Albanian territory.
	   Spokesman Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which
controls the border police, said border guards had seen many killed
and wounded by the shelling of the Padesh village area, He said
guards could see dead bodies lying on the group on the Kosovo side
but offered no casualty counts.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack in their villages. It is also used by the Kosovo Liberation
Army to smuggle guns and ammunition from Northern Albania into
Kosovo.
	   After a brief lull, fighting in the Padesh region resumed after
daybreak. Bizhga said that at least five wounded KLA members had
crossed into Albania to escape the shelling.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said at least one
person was reported killed Friday in the village of Zun, apparently
near the border fighting.
	   In Pristina, British Embassy officials said they were searching
for a British aid worker feared missing in western Kosovo _
possibly in the border area.
	   Sally Becker, known as the Angel of Mostar for her humanitarian
efforts in that Bosnian city during the war, was reported missing
Thursday, said the officials.
	   The KLA assault was centered on Orahovac, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of the province where
ethnic Albanians form a 90-percent majority.
	   Reporting on the fighting, the Kosovo Information Center could
not say whether Serb police controlling the mostly ethnic-Albanian
town of 20,000 might have been forced to cede some ground.
	   Serbia is the largest of the two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia and dominates the Yugoslav federation. The Yugoslav _
and Serbian _ five-month crackdown on the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army has triggered a backlash in Kosovo not only against
the government but also against Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, whose commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the
bloodshed or win self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA.
	   A mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe was meeting with Rugova Saturday in its attempts to find a
negotiated end to the violence.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected in March but
never authorized by the Serbian government.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   In a statement to the province's Albanian-language media on
Friday, the KLA declared its opposition to the Kosovo assembly,
saying that by convening it, the Albanian leadership was
``minimizing the KLA's struggle for liberation.''

Gunmen try to attack mourners inside church in South Africa

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ After a night punctuated by
gunfire that claimed more victims, this eastern town looked like a
war zone Saturday as mourners pepared to bury 11 people who were
killed in earlier attacks.
	   Soldiers fired flares into the night sky, attempting to
illuminate townships around Richmond where the nighttime killings
have occurred. Few of the township shacks have electricity.
	   After sunset Friday, gunmen tried to force their way into a
church mission where hundreds of mourners were holding a vigil for
11 people shot dead in the past week. A firefight erupted as
security forces drove the assailants back. A passerby was killed.
The retreating gunmen also shot to death a family of four,
including two children, a kilometer (half-mile) away, authorities
said.
	   After daybreak, army troops and police patrolled the dirt roads
around Richmond and a police spotter plane circled overhead.
Mourners gathered to bury the 11 victims of earlier violence whose
coffins were covered with flowers in the church building. A banner
of the ruling African National Congress was draped across a wall
behind the coffins. Most of the victims were ANC supporters.
	   Thirty people have been killed in the past two weeks in Richmond
and the surrounding townships, which lie in rolling green hills of
KwaZulu-Natal province.
	   The province has a bloody history that government leaders fear
is reviving. Some 10,000 people were killed there in violence
between supporters of rival black political parties in the decade
encompassing the final years of apartheid and the runup to the 1994
elections.
	   Apartheid-era security forces fomented the violence by arming
some of the killers. President Nelson Mandela raised the specter of
police involvement in the latest killings when he denounced
``sinister'' elements in the security forces who ``are attempting
to take us back to the apartheid days.''
	   The new round of killings began after Sifiso Nkabinde was
expelled as local ANC chairman because he allegedly was an informer
for the apartheid-era security forces. Nkabinde earlier this year
was acquitted of charges that he killed 16 people.
	   He is now the national secretary of the United Democratic
Movement, a new party that will contest the 1999 elections. He has
denied being behind the killings.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A decade after 28-year-old British tourist
Julie Ward was slain in a Kenyan game park, Attorney General Amos
Wako said Saturday there was enough circumstantial evidence to
arraign a suspect on murder charges and stage a second trial.
	   Wako, who was flanked by John Ward, the young woman's father,
said Simon ole Makala, a former senior game warden in the Maasai
Mara reserve where Ward was murdered, would appear in court Monday
to face murder charges.
	   ``There's certainly nothing pleasant about a murder, even in
catching the people who may have done it,'' Ward told Associated
Press Television.
	   ``So, there's no elation, it's just a certain satisfaction that
we are at the end of the road as far as the investigation is
concerned.''
	   Ward's mutilated and charred remains were discovered in the
reserve on the Tanzanian border Sept. 13, 1988. Officials first
claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild animals.
	   Two park rangers were subsequently arrested and tried for her
murder, but they were found innocent of all charges in June 1992.
Justice Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police for conducting a
flawed investigation.
	   Three assessors told the court they believed there were three
principal suspects in the murder, and Makalla was one of them.
	   Assessor John Leparakuo told the court it was his ``strong
opinion'' that Makalla and David Nchoko and Gerald Karori ``knew
more than what they told us in the court proceedings.''
	   On March 2, 1996, Wako agreed that new information about the
killing made another ``fair and objective'' investigation
necessary.
	   Many questions remainded to be answered, he said, ``with regard
to the role of David Nchoko, Gerald Karori and Simon Makalla.''
	   Ward, a wealthy hotelier from Bury St. Edmonds, England, has
carried on a 10-year campaign to find his daughter's killers and
have them brought to justice.

Russians queue up to pay respects to last czar

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Hundreds of Russians lined up at
the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in a pouring rain Saturday to pay
their last respects to Czar Nicholas II and his family.
	   The czar's remains were buried Friday in the small St. Catherine
chapel inside the cathedral. The cathedral and chapel were opened
to the public Saturday.
	   White lilies and roses were heaped at the entrance to the
chapel, and inside multi-colored flowers lay on the burial vault as
visitors lit candles in memory of the imperial family, killed by
the Bolsheviks in 1918.
	   ``It's a sign of respect,'' said Vladimir Nadezhdin, a doctor
who made the pilgrimage from the Yaroslavl region. ``These sort of
things happen only once in a lifetime.''
	   However, he said he was not proud of the czar.
	   ``He paid for his own sins, he should not have abdicated,''
Nadezhdin said. ``If he had not done that he would not have been
murdered and his family would have lived.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin, speaking at the memorial service
Friday, said, ``guilty are those who committed this heinous crime,
and those who have been justifying it for decades.''
	   Alvina Utkin, an engineer visiting the chapel, agreed with the
president.
	   ``We are guilty, and so are our forefathers,'' she said. ``Maybe
now Russia will enter a new phase now.''
	   Ilya Shvetz, a 16-year-old music student also expressed remorse
over the killing the czar, his wife and three daughters.
	   ``Our parents were in some way guilty,'' he said. ``I feel
guilty that we allowed him to be shot, and I think I should pay my
respects to them all.''
	   The burial came 80 years to the day after Nicholas II, his
family and four attendants were killed in the city of Ekaterinburg.
	   Two bodies have never been found _ those of the heir to the
throne, Alexei, and his sister Maria.
	   Katya Kotov, a 10-year-old, came to the cathedral with her
father after watching the burial ceremony on television.
	   ``I'm glad they have found a place of peace at last,'' he said.
``I hope everything will turn out well, and they find Maria and
Alexei.''

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Khmer Rouge have made a
murderous return to Cambodian politics, attacking a convoy of
election workers with automatic weapons and killing two people in
an effort to disrupt parliamentary elections July 26, officials
said Saturday.
	   The guerrilla movement had been considered all but crushed and
unable to carry out threats to sow election terror following the
fall of their last stronghold to government troops in April.
	   At that time, their longtime leader Pol Pot died. Despite the
new attack, however, they are unlikely to have much impact on the
balloting.
	   About five guerrillas opened fire on the election officials
Friday as their convoy traveled between Anlong Veng, the captured
Khmer Rouge base, and Trapeang Prasat, about 16 kilometers (10
miles) east, regional military chief Maj. Gen. Chea Mann said.
	   They were carrying election materials to former Khmer Rouge
fighters who have defected to the government and are now receiving
instructions on how to participate in what is likely their first
election.
	   The dead men were identified as security officers. Among those
wounded was an election commission official for the northern
province of Siem Reap.
	   ``It is Khmer Rouge under the command of Ta Mok from along the
border,'' Chea Mann said. ``They are trying to disrupt the
elections.''
	   Ta Mok, a one-legged general known as ``The Butcher'' for his
revolutionary brutality, seized control from Pol Pot last year in a
bloody power struggle. He is believed to control only a few hundred
guerrillas along the rugged border with Thailand.
	   The Khmer Rouge has almost disappeared due to mass defections
over the past two years. In 1993, they still numbered more than
10,000 fighters but were unable to wreak promised havoc on
elections organized by the United Nations under the protection of
20,000 peacekeepers.
	   The Maoist-inspired movement caused the deaths of as many as 2
million Cambodians between 1975 and 1979. They were toppled by an
invasion by Vietnam, Cambodia's historic enemy. A decade of harsh
military occupation followed.
	   Hun Sen, who came to power under the Vietnamese, has been widely
criticized during the campaign for using violence, including
murder, and intimidation against the opposition to ensure his own
victory.
	   On Saturday, prominent opposition leader Sam Rainsy warned that
Hun Sen was deploying troops to frighten people into voting for him
and said that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan should make an
emergency visit ``if possible'' to show support for free and fair
elections. The United Nations is supplying only election observers.
	   Sam Rainsy told reporters that Hun Sen would either try to
disqualify the opposition or simply call out the army to retain
power if he loses.
	   ``The U.N. should not let down Cambodia by allowing a fake
election to take place next week,'' said Sam Rainsy. ``I beg the
international community not to let us down.''
	   At the least, the United Nations should send more observers and
set high standards to determine whether the elections are free and
fair. Sam Rainsy said that the European Union, by contrast,
appeared ready to rubber-stamp any result.
	   Hun Sen was recovering from an appendectomy and was expected to
stay bedridden for the campaign's final week. The appendicitis
struck after a rare campaign appearance Friday where he helped
villagers dig an irrigation ditch.
	   Hun Sen deposed the other main opposition candidate, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, as co-premier in a bloody coup last year.
Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party had won the 1993 elections,
but Hun Sen threatened civil war if not given a joint premiership.
	   Diplomatic pressure and the need to restore international
legitimacy and foreign aid led Hun Sen to call the new elections.
	   Ranariddh told 5,000 supporters that the United States _ which
will judge whether the election is free or fair separately from the
main international observer group _ will not accept Hun Sen using
the army to keep himself in power.
	   The National Election Committee, the main election authority
which critics say is packed with Hun Sen supporters, said it would
take steps to weed out thousands of ineligible Cambodian observers,
some alleged to have links with Hun Sen's party and the military.

	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Sweeping all before it, a
tsunami crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast, killing at
least 70 people and crushing villages, the National Disaster Center
said. The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night
without warning following an earthquake about 12 miles (30
kilometers) off the coast that Australian Geological Survey
Organization said had a magnitude of 7.0. The disaster center said
late Saturday that hundreds were missing and thousands were without
food and shelter. Disaster authorities said the wave struck to the
west of the town of Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at
least four villages. The area is spotted with communities
consisting of beach-side homes built of jungle materials. (PAPUA

	   PARIS (AP) _ Although Syrian President Hafez Assad didn't make
many public statements during his visit to France, his presence was
statement enough for the leader of a country long diplomatically
isolated. The sight of Assad standing next to a smiling President
Jacques Chirac, who spoke of ``very positive'' talks between the
two, reflected how Syria's image has improved in recent months, as
the deadlock persists in the Arab-Israeli negotiations mediated by
the United States. For Chirac, the meeting was a clear indication
of how much France still wants to play a role in Mideast
peacemaking _ and sees Syria as a good partner. Assad, too, seeks a
partnership with another country to balance Israel's strong
alliance with Washington. (FRANCE-SYRIA)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A maverick Cabinet minister popular with the
younger wing of Japan's ruling party announced his candidacy
Saturday to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
making the contest a three-way race. Like his more senior rivals,
Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi promised to boost
Japan's ailing economy by slashing corporate and income taxes.
Koizumi also vowed to privatize the postal ministry within 10 years
_ a controversial plan that has earned him a reputation as a rebel
in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Koizumi also proposed to
cut the number of government employees in half within a decade.
Koizumi joined Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, who announced their
presidential bids Friday. (JAPAN-POLITICS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting raged Saturday on Kosovo's
border with Albania, with Serb forces shelling villages lying on a
suspected gun-running route for ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
Albanian border guards reported many dead and wounded. Farther
inland, separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas seeking to tear
Kosovo province away from Serbia were reported launching their own
attack on Serb security forces controlling a mostly Albanian town.
While the Serb assault seemed aimed at further disrupting arms
smuggling routes into Kosovo, the attack by the Kosovo Liberation
Army, estimated to control up to 40 percent of the province,
appeared to be trying to grab more territory inland.

	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ After a night punctuated by
gunfire that claimed more victims, the South African town of
Richmond looked like a war zone Saturday as mourners prepared to
bury 11 people killed in earlier attacks. Soldiers fired flares
into the night sky, attempting to illuminate townships around
Richmond where the nighttime killings have occurred. Few of the
township shacks have electricity. After sunset Friday, gunmen tried
to force their way into a church mission where hundreds of mourners
were holding a vigil for the people shot dead in the past week. A
firefight erupted as security forces drove the assailants back. A
passerby was killed. The retreating gunmen also shot to death a
family of four, including two children, a kilometer (half-mile)
away, authorities said. After daybreak, army troops and police
patrolled the dirt roads around Richmond and a police spotter plane
circled overhead. (SOUTH AFRICA-POLITICAL VIOLENCE)

American parishioners help clean up quake-damaged church in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Some 80 Americans, including military
personnel from the Incirlik base, joined forces Saturday to clean
up a Roman Catholic church damaged during a strong quake that
rocked southern Turkey last month.
	   ``I was an effort of faith,'' said Father Felice Suriano, the
parish priest of St. Paul's church in Adana.
	   The 6.3 magnitude quake that hit Turkey on June 27 killed 144
people and injured over 1,500 in and around Adana, which is 490
kilometers (300 miles) south of Ankara, the capital.
	   Several cracks opened in the walls of St. Paul's and large
concrete blocks fell from the ceiling, said Suriano, an Italian who
has lived in Turkey for 34 years.
	   The Americans, many of them from the Incirlik base used by U.S.
and British jets to patrol a no-fly zone over northern Iraq,
cleared rubble from inside the church.
	   ``All the chuch pews were brought outside and washed, all the
cupboards were cleaned up,'' said parishoner Rita Salmon, a native
of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
	   Suriano said he expected restoration work to begin in about two
weeks.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting raged Saturday on Kosovo's
border with Albania, with Serb forces shelling villages on a
suspected gun-running route for ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
Albanian border guards reported many dead and wounded.
	   Deeper into the province, separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas
seeking to tear Kosovo away from Serbia were reportedly launching
their own attack on Serb security forces controlling a mostly
ethnic Albanian town.
	   While the Serb assault seemed aimed at further disrupting arms
smuggling routes into Kosovo, the attack by the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is estimated to control up to 40 percent of the
province, appeared to be an attempt to grab more territory.
	   Reporting on the border fighting, Albanian border police
spokesmen said that some of the shells fired in Kosovo were landing
and exploding up to half a kilometer (hundreds of yards) inside
Albanian territory.
	   Spokesman Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which
controls the border police, said border guards had seen many people
who had been killed and wounded by the shelling of the area around
the village of Padesh. He said guards could see dead bodies on the
Kosovo side but offered no casualty counts.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack on their villages. It is also used by the KLA to smuggle
guns and ammunition from northern Albania into Kosovo.
	   After a lull, fighting in the Padesh region resumed after
daybreak. Bizhga said that at least five wounded KLA members had
crossed into Albania to escape the shelling.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said at least one
person was reported killed Friday in the village of Zun, near the
border battle.
	   In Pristina, British Embassy officials said they were searching
for a British aid worker feared missing in western Kosovo, possibly
in the border area.
	   Sally Becker, known as the Angel of Mostar for her humanitarian
efforts in that Bosnian city during the war, was reported missing
Thursday, said the officials.
	   The KLA assault was centered on Orahovac, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of the province where
ethnic Albanians form a 90-percent majority.
	   Reporting on the fighting, the Kosovo Information Center could
not say whether Serb police controlling the mostly ethnic-Albanian
town of 20,000 might have been forced to cede some ground.
	   Serbia is the largest of the two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia and dominates the Yugoslav federation. The Yugoslav, and
Serbian, five-month crackdown on the secessionist KLA has triggered
a backlash in Kosovo not only against the government but also
against Kosovo ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose
commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the bloodshed or win
self-rule. The result has been converts to the KLA.
	   A mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe was meeting with Rugova on Saturday in its attempts to end
the violence.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected in March but
never approved by the Serbian government.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters where the session had taken
place.
	   In a statement to the province's Albanian-language media on
Friday, the KLA declared its opposition to the Kosovo assembly,
saying that by convening it, the Albanian leadership was
``minimizing the KLA's struggle for liberation.''

Bromine vapor leaks at chemical plant in central Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOSLAR, Germany (AP) _ Bromine vapor leaked at a chemical plant
in central Germany, slightly injuring 29 people, police said
Saturday.
	   An unknown amount of the vapor leaked during the late morning
Friday in Goslar, 70 kilometers (40 miles) southeast of Hanover.
The factory grounds were sealed and local residents warned of the
toxic cloud, police said.
	   Bromine, a chemical used in dyes, photography and motor fuel,
irritates the eyes and nasal passages.
	   More of the chemical leaked during repair work until the problem
was brought under control overnight, police said.
	   Two local residents were among the 29 people slightly injured,
most of them with irritated eyes. One of the injured remained
hospitalized Saturday; the others were treated and released.

At least 70 dead after tsunami hits Papua New Guinea coast

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Huge sea waves set off by
an earthquake crashed against Papua New Guinea's north coast,
killing at least 70 people and crushing villages, the country's
National Disaster Center said.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water, called tsunami, hit
Friday night without warning just after an earthquake about 12
miles (30 kilometers) off the coast. The Australian Geological
Survey Organization said it had a preliminary magnitude of 7.0.
	   The disaster center said late Saturday that hundreds are missing
and thousands are without food and shelter.
	   ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless and
there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,''
Fr. Austin Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   He said most of the dead were children who drowned.
	   Disaster authorities said the seismic sea wave struck to the
west of the town of Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at
least four villages _ Sissano, Warapu, Arop and Malol.
	   The area is spotted with villages consisting of homes built on
beaches of jungle materials.
	   ``At Warapu, there is no house standing _ it's a village of
1,800 people,'' Crapp said. ``Arop, again, is 1,800 to 2,000 people
_ there's nothing standing there.
	   ``They (the two villages) are both clean sand. It's complete
devastation.''
	   A helicopter pilot who landed in Aitape on Saturday reported
seeing bodies floating among the debris in the lagoon, he said.
	   Papua New Guinea provincial disaster coordinator Peter Tavun
said homeless survivors were in desperate need of food and shelter.
	   Crapp said a helicopter was picking up injured people and
doctors had been flown in to treat them. The injured, mostly
suffering cuts and fractures, were being taken to a mission
hospital at Aitape.
	   Rob Parer, a businessman who lives near Aitape, said some
villagers who fled into the jungle after the tsunami struck are
still hiding there.
	   ``The people have never heard of anything like it. They thought
the world had ended,'' Parer told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   In Canberra, Australian seismologist Kevin McCue from the
Australian Geological Survey Organization said the earthquake's
epicenter was just off the town of Aitape.
	   ``It was a shallow, major earthquake,'' he said.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 is devastating if it hits
an urban area. The last tsunami in the area had been in December
1930 when a magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the Admiralty Islands,
McCue said.
	   Meanwhile, Australia said Saturday it will provide transport for
relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal
Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft now in Papua New
Guinea on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief
supplies.
	   ``We will also transport a mobile hospital and associated
Australian Defense Force medical personnel to the disaster area to
provide urgent medical assistance to injured victims,'' Downer said
in a statement.

Eritrean president meets Moi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Moi's office &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki met
Saturday with his Kenyan counterpart, Daniel arap Moi, in what
appeared to be the latest attempt to mediate the two-month border
conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
	   A statement from Moi's office said the talks, which the Kenyan
leader characterized as ``very useful,'' centered on the
territorial conflict between the two countries.#
	   Kenya shares its northern border with Ethiopia.
	   ``President Moi noted that the problem should have been
contained and resolved without being internationalized,'' the
statement said.
	   Moi plans to continue to continue his mediation ``with a view to
reaching a resolution as soon as possible,'' his office said.
	   On July 13, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi spent three
hours with Moi discussing the situation between the two countries
in the Horn of Africa that were formerly close.
	   On Thursday, Kenyan Foreign Minister Boyana Godana said Kenya's
strategy ``is to see in what way we can level the area of
disagreement'' between Ethiopia and Eritrea because ``the conflict
is definitely dangerous for the sub-region.''
	   The conflict has reached a stalemate after heavy fighting in
early June left hundreds dead on both sides.
	   The United States and Rwanda initially presented a four-point
proposal for peace talks that included Eritrean withdrawal from
contested areas it had occupied after May 6.
	   Eritrea balked at the precondition, claiming it was only on
territory rightfully within its boundaries.
	   Four nations from the Organization of African Unity also made
apparent fruitless attempts to get both countries to sit down to
talks.

<TEXT>
	   CORREZE, France (AP) _ Festina riders who were kicked out of the
Tour de France will be allowed to participate in Saturday's time
trial unofficially, the race's director said.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, who made the announcement Friday evening
that the Festina team was excluded from the Tour after the director
of the team, Bruno Roussel, admitted a practice of supplying
illegal drugs with medical supervision to improve performances, met
with Festina officials Saturday morning.
	   The Tour de France tried to recover Saturday from the shock that
was a bombshell to the race and the cycling world.
	   The Festina team was ranked No. 1 in the world according to the
International cycling Union and were leading the Tour de France. It
also had two of the individual favorites, Richard Virenque and Alex
Zuelle, the current world champion.
	   Virenque, second and third in the Tour the last two years,
threatened legal action to pursue racing.
	   Leblanc said he will allow the Festina riders to participate in
the 58-kilometer (36-mile) time trial from Meyrignac-L'Eglise to
Correze in south-central France but their times will not be
considered in the standings.
	   The first of the riders for Festina scheduled to participate,
Armin Meier of Switzerland, said he would not compete.
	   ``If the others persist in the intention to race the time trial,
it is evident that the judges will let them go, but their time will
not count since they are considered, as of now, out of the race,''
Leblanc said.
	   Other members of the nine-rider Festina the team included
Laurent Brochard, and two other members of the team who won stages
last year, Neil Stephens and Didier Rous.
	   In Lille on Friday, Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were
placed under investigation for importing prohibited substances and
other counts connected to the drug scandal.
	   The two joined Willy Voet, a Festina team trainer jailed July 9
after customs officers found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   Virenque had won the top climber award of the Tour the last four
years with Voet as his personal trainer.
	   A statement by Roussel through his lawyer said the Festina
management, doctors, masseurs and cyclists were involved in the
scheme to supply riders with drugs.
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves under conditions
that could be bad for their health.''
	   A rider denied the charges.
	   ``I never took any EPO or any other prohibited products. I only
took products for recuperation, '' said Pascal Herve, a member of
he Festina team in Varetz, where the team was staying Friday night.
	   EPO, among the drugs found in Voet's car, is a substance that
aids the transport of oxygen within the blood stream and is
difficult to detect.
	   After Saturday's time trial, two more weeks of the race remain
before it ends in Paris Aug. 2. The remaining racers hit the
Pyrenees on Tuesday then cross southern France before getting to
the Alps a week from Sunday.
	   Last year, Jan Ullrich of Germany won by more than nine minutes
over Virenque and beat him by more than three minutes in a time
trial.

Sri Lankan human rights officials to question soldier about mass
</HEADLINE>
grave &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The state-appointed Human Rights
Commission will question a convicted soldier as a first step toward
unearthing a mass grave where nearly 400 ethnic Tamils were
believed to have been buried by the military, an official said
Saturday.
	   The officials were to meet Cpl. Dewage Somaratne on Monday.
Somaratne is one of five soldiers and a policeman who were
sentenced to death two weeks ago for raping and murdering a
teen-age Tamil student and later killing her mother, brother and a
neighbor.
	   Somaratne told the court that they merely buried the victims and
could show authorities the grave of nearly 400 Tamil civilians
killed by government forces.
	   Commission officials were consulting the attorney general on how
to proceed with exhuming the bodies since the police and army were
allegedly involved in the killings, a commission official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Tamil political parties have been demanding that the grave be
located and dug up.
	   The government admits that 500 Tamil civilians disappeared in
the northern Jaffna Peninsula after the military seized the Tamil
heartland in May 1996.
	   Tamil politicians and human rights groups say many civilians
went missing after they were arrested by government forces hunting
for Tamil guerrillas fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils.
	   Tamils have cited abuse and arrogance by government soldiers as
one of the causes of Tamil discontent with majority Sinhalese.
Militant Tamils are fighting for an independent Tamil homeland.
More than 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since
1983.
	   The country's oldest human rights group on Saturday urged
President Chandrika Kumaratunga to appoint a special commission to
investigate the disappearance of Tamils in the northeastern war
zones.
	   ``The failure to investigate reported disappearances after the
security forces took control of the peninsula is a matter of grave
concern that can no longer be overlooked,'' said the Civil Rights
Movement of Sri Lanka in a statement.
	   There was no immediate response from the government.

Winds howl at Royal Birkdale

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Suddenly, par is looking pretty good
at the British Open.
	   Howling winds returned to Royal Birkdale Saturday, sending
scores soaring in the third round. The leaders, meanwhile, waited
anxiously to have their turn on a course proving to be as complete
a test of links golf as there is.
	   A day after players battled to keep their games under control in
high winds and driving rain, the third round opened under dark
skies and even stronger gusts off the Irish Sea.
	   The first player off, England's Andrew Clapp, shot 81, while
Billy Mayfair parred the first hole only to make bogeys on each of
the next six.
	   Midway leader Brian Watts and English amateur Justin Rose were
to tee off in the last group; Tiger Woods and Nick Price were to
play in the group before them.
	   While Watts went into the weekend as the British Open leader, it
was Woods who had the most to smile about after a birdie-birdie
finish Friday wiped away memories of an erratic round and left him
only a shot behind.
	   ``I came out smelling like a rose on those last two holes,''
Woods said.
	   On a day when weather conditions were at their worst, Woods
struggled from his opening tee shot, only to pull himself together
to make birdie from a bunker on 17 and then salvage a 73 with a
12-foot (3.7-meter) birdie putt on the final hole.
	   ``The kid's got no quit in him,'' caddie Fluff Cowan said. ``You
know that. I know that. And best of all, he knows that.''
	   The round left Woods at 2-under-138, a shot behind Watts, a
Japanese PGA Tour regular who went out early and set the pace by
making five birdies for a 69.
	   Nick Price was tied with Woods after an eagle on the 17th helped
him to a 72, and so was 17-year-old English amateur Justin Rose,
who shot the round of his life with a 66 that also was the low
round of the day.
	   ``To play it in these circumstances is fantastic,'' said Rose,
who quit school a year ago to concentrate on golf.
	   A day after the Open began in light winds and sunshine, the
weather turned nasty for the second round. It rained much of the
morning, then the wind picked up in the afternoon.
	   By early evening the wind was gusting so hard that balls were
being blown around greens, and then the rain returned, forcing a
suspension of play for about a half hour.
	   ``I was getting blown over,'' Woods said. ``It was hard to stay
steady. Temperatures were going up and down. You really had to keep
your patience.''
	   Patience was just what Woods had as he continued to contend in a
major for the first time since he won the 1997 Masters. Unlike
previous majors, where he took big scores on holes with ill-advised
shots, he played smartly despite playing poorly.
	   ``It was just one of those days where you've got to keep patient
and hang in there because no one is really going to shoot or go
that low, and you know that,'' Woods said.
	   Besides Rose, no one did as the same course that allowed 41
players to match or break par on the first day gave up only seven
rounds under par Friday.
	   The only other player under par after two rounds was Thomas
Bjorn of Denmark, who was at 1-under 139.
	   Shots that flew steady toward soft greens in the opening round
were blown instead toward the tall meadow grass. Players discovered
that par was a good score yet again in a major.
	   John Daly would have gladly taken par on the 18th hole and been
able to play two more rounds. Instead, he took five blasts to get a
ball out of the fairway trap and ended up with a 10 for a round of
78 and an 11-over 151 total.
	   Also missing the cut was former champion Tom Lehman, who had as
many bogeys as he had pars _ nine _ for a 79.
	   Price not only made the cut, but he's playing among the leaders
for the second straight major. But he found himself blasting out of
buried lies in traps, ripping balls out of tall rough and trying to
keep the composure necessary to add this Open title to the one he
won in 1994.
	   ``I don't want to listen to any of those guys who complained
about the conditions this morning,'' said Price, who played in the
afternoon. ``There's just so many crosswinds blowing. I'm grateful
to have gotten off the course two strokes over par.''
	   Watts, the 32-year-old Oklahoman who commutes to the Japanese
PGA Tour, followed a first-round 68 with a 69 that made him the
improbable leader.
	   Watts has won 10 times in Japan since 1994 and is such a
familiar figure there that he is recognized on city streets.
	   ``I'd say I'm very well known to the over 40-year-olds,'' Watts
said. ``They will go, `Oh, Brian Watts' or say my name.''
	   Not many were saying Watts' name when going over a list of
favorites for the tournament. Even Watts didn't give himself much
of a chance after practice rounds left him feeling he couldn't make
any birdies.
	   ``Sunday, Monday and Tuesday didn't give me any belief in the
world that I could even make a birdie on this golf course,'' he
said.
	   The Open title would carry an extra benefit for Watts. It would
give him an exemption for the PGA Tour, and he could say sayonara
to Japan.

South Africa edges Australia in Tri Nations test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ South Africa won its 10th consecutive
rugby union test match Saturday, edging Australia 14-13 in a Tri
Nations encounter at Subiaco Oval.
	   The scores were level at 8-8 at halftime and Australia had a
chance to grab the lead with just over 15 minutes remaining. But
last week's Bledisloe Cup hero Matt Burke missed an easy penalty
from 24 meters out.
	   Australia scored two tries and South Africa one, but Burke was
only able to convert one of five penalty attempts. Burke scored all
of Australia's points last Saturday in the Wallabies' 24-16 win
over New Zealand.
	   A 52-meter penalty goal by Burke after the halftime siren gave
the Wallabies the halftime 8-8 draw. Winger Ben Tune gave Australia
a 5-0 lead with a second-minute try, but a penalty goal to Percy
Montgomery and Joost Van Der Westhuizen's 21st test try gave the
visitors the lead until Burke's long kick.
	   Halfback Van Der Westhuizen took the Springboks into the lead in
the 26th minute when he took a quick tap from a penalty a meter
from the line to scoot through between the Australian defense.
	   The Wallaby defense was in some confusion when referee Colin
Hawke played advantage and recalled the penalty after Australia had
cleared the ball.
	   Van Der Westhuizen took advantage of the Wallabies' napping
defense to score the try and give the Springboks an 8-5 lead.
	   With his first touch of the ball, Tune, cleared to play only six
hours before kickoff, proved he had overcome his knee injury when
he dashed over.
	   The Wallabies regained possession from their kickoff to start
the match and two minutes later, halfback George Gregan took the
ball from a maul, sent it to five-eighth Stephen Larkham, who spun
it wide to Tune who had space to run around his opposite Pieter
Rossouw.
	   Burke, who became Australia's most capped fullback in his 26th
test Saturday, missed the conversion.
	   The ninth-minute penalty goal to fullback Montgomery bridged the
gap to 5-3 and Van Der Westhuizen crossed after 20 threatening
minutes.
	   Joe Roff saved a certain try when he intercepted a Henry
Honiball pass with Stefan Terblanche unmarked outside him and
Chester Williams was pushed into touch one meter out as he took on
the defense.
	   Only a desperate ankle tap prevented Roff converting his
intercept into an Australian try.
	   Early rain had made the ground and ball greasy with both teams
making several handling errors. But the rain could not be blamed
for many fundamental Australian mistakes, including losing five of
their lineout throws.
	   Scores:
	   SOUTH AFRICA 14 (Joost Van Der Westhuizen try, Percy Montgomery
3 penalties) def. AUSTRALIA 13 (Ben Tune, George Gregan tries, Matt
Burke penalty) at Subiaco Oval. (djp)

	   CORREZE, France (AP) _ Festina riders who were kicked out of the
Tour de France will be allowed to participate in Saturday's time
trial unofficially, the race's director said.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, who made the announcement Friday evening
that the Festina team was excluded from the Tour after the director
of the team, Bruno Roussel, admitted a practice of supplying
illegal drugs with medical supervision to improve performances, met
with Festina officials Saturday morning.
	   The Tour de France tried to recover Saturday from the shock that
was a bombshell to the race and the cycling world.
	   The Festina team was ranked No. 1 in the world according to the
International cycling Union and were leading the Tour de France. It
also had two of the individual favorites, Richard Virenque and Alex

Intense fighting erupts on border, further inland

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with shelling ending, details on Orahovac fighting;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces on Saturday shelled
villages on the border with Albania lying on a suspected
gun-running route for separatist Kosovo guerrillas. Albanian border
guards reported many dead and wounded.
	   Away from the border, ethnic Albanian fighters seeking to tear
Kosovo province away from Serbia were reported launching their own
attack on Serb security forces controlling a mostly Albanian town.
	   While the Serb assault seemed aimed at further disrupting arms
smuggling routes into Kosovo, the attack by the Kosovo Liberation
Army _ estimated to control up to 40 percent of the province _
appeared to be trying to grab more territory inland.
	   Before ending Saturday afternoon, the border artillery barrage
sent some of the shells landing and exploding up to half a
kilometer (hundreds of yards) inside Albanian territory, spokesmen
for Albania's border police said.
	   Spokesman Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which
controls the border police, said border guards had seen many killed
and wounded by the shelling of the Padesh village area, He said
guards could see dead bodies lying on the group on the Kosovo side
but offered no casualty counts.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack in their villages. It is also believed used by the Kosovo
Liberation Army to smuggle guns and ammunition from northern
Albania into Kosovo.
	   The fighting in the Padesh region began late Friday, ebbed
overnight, then resumed after daybreak before ending. Bizhga said
that 14 wounded KLA members had crossed into Albania to escape the
shelling.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said at least one
person was reported killed Friday in the village of Zun, apparently
near the border fighting.
	   In Pristina, British Embassy officials said they were searching
for a British aid worker feared missing in western Kosovo _
possibly in the border area.
	   Sally Becker, known as the Angel of Mostar for her humanitarian
efforts in that Bosnian city during the war, was reported missing
Thursday, said the officials. She heads a small humanitarian
organization called Operation Angel.
	   As the Serb border shelling ceased, the KLA assault in Kosovo's
interior appeared to grow in ferocity. It was centered on Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of
the province where ethnic Albanians form a 90-percent majority.
	   Reporting on the fighting, the Kosovo Information Center could
not say whether Serb police controlling the mostly ethnic-Albanian
town of 20,000 might have been forced to cede some ground.
	   But the Serbian Media Center in Pristina described the Orahovac
fighting as a ``dramatic'' KLA assault ``from several directions''
that sent civilians of both nationalities streaming from the area.
It said more than 40 Serb civilians had been kidnapped by Albanian
fighters. Telephone lines went dead Saturday morning, it said.

Pakistan: Everything, including test ban treaty, on the table with
</HEADLINE>
U.S. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Everything, including the
comprehensive test ban treaty, will be on the table when Pakistani
leaders meet senior U.S. officials next week in Islamabad, a
foreign ministry spokesman said Saturday.
	   ''We don't have a rigid position ... there are no
inflexibilities,'' Tariq Altaf said at a weekly briefing. ''We have
an open mind. That is how we will enter into negotiations and talks
... with the United States.''
	   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott arrives in
Pakistan on Tuesday from India. It will be Talbott's first visit to
Pakistan since it conducted six underground nuclear tests in a
tit-for-tat response to its neighbor and rival India, which
exploded five nuclear devices.
	   The tests resulted in immediate economic sanctions on both
countries. For Pakistan, whose fragile economy is more dependent on
foreign loans than neighboring India, the sanctions have been
devastating.
	   Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said previously that Pakistan may
have to consider a moratorium on its debt repayment if sanctions
stop loans from international lending institutions like the
International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
	   Economic sanctions, their impact, Pakistan's security concerns
and U.S. demands _ all this will be on the negotiation table when
Talbott meets Pakistani leaders, Altaf said.
	   Analysts here believe the American delegation will press
Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in exchange for
a waiver of sanctions.
	   While Altaf said signing the CTBT is an option, Pakistan won't
take it if it compromises its security.
	   ''We will not be painted into a corner. We will retain our
options,'' he said. ''For example, what do we do if today we sign
the test ban treaty and tomorrow India conducts another test?''
	   Pakistan will try to explain its security concerns to the U.S.
delegation.
	   ''Our concerns are security driven ... genuine concerns,
everything is linked with peace and security of the region,'' said
Altaf. ''Because of the overwhelming preponderance of conventional
superiority which India enjoys ... for us it is of critical
importance to have a credible deterrence.''
	   In the last 51 years, Pakistan and India have fought three wars.
Pakistan has lost all three.
	   Two of the wars have been over the disputed Himalayan state of
Kashmir. After exploding its nuclear devices, India's Hindu
nationalist government made provocative statements concerning
Kashmir that were interpreted by Pakistan as threats of military
force.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub has said that he feared
another conflagration on the Asian subcontinent could escalate into
a nuclear confrontation.
	   Talbott made an emergency visit to Pakistan in May to try to
convince Islamabad not to follow India by conducting underground
nuclear tests of its own.
	   At that time, Pakistan said it was waiting to gauge the world
reaction to India's nuclear tests before deciding whether or not to
conduct its own. In an address to the nation following its own
underground tests, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif accused
the industrialized world of offering a lackluster response which
only served to embolden India and endanger Pakistan.
	   ''We have acted in self defense,'' said Altaf. ``We were forced
to act. Our hand was forced.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting raged Saturday on Kosovo's
border with Albania, where Serb forces shelled villages on a
suspected gun-running route for ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
Albanian border guards reported many dead and wounded.
	   Away from the border, ethnic Albanian fighters seeking to tear
the province of Kosovo away from Serbia were reportedly launching
their own attack on Serb security forces controlling a mostly
ethnic Albanian town.
	   While the Serb assault seemed aimed at further disrupting arms
smuggling routes into Kosovo, the attack by the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is estimated to control up to 40 percent of the
province, appeared to be an attempt to grab more territory.
	   Before ending Saturday afternoon, the border artillery barrage
sent some as far as half a kilometer (hundreds of yards) inside
Albanian territory, spokesmen for Albania's border police said.
	   Spokesman Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which
controls the border police, said border guards had seen many killed
and wounded by the shelling of the area around the village of
Padesh. He said guards could see dead bodies on the Kosovo side but
offered no casualty counts.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack on their villages. It is also believed used by the KLA to
smuggle guns and ammunition from northern Albania into Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   The fighting in the Padesh region began late Friday, ebbed
overnight, then resumed after daybreak. Bizhga said that 14 wounded
KLA members had crossed into Albania to escape the shelling.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said at least one
person was reported killed Friday in the village of Zun, near the
border fighting.
	   In Pristina, British Embassy officials said they were searching
for a British aid worker feared missing in western Kosovo, possibly
in the border area.
	   Sally Becker, known as the Angel of Mostar for her humanitarian
efforts in that Bosnian city during the war, was reported missing
Thursday, said the officials. She heads a small humanitarian
organization called Operation Angel.
	   As the Serb border shelling ceased, the KLA assault in Kosovo's
interior appeared to grow in ferocity. It was centered on Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of
the province.
	   Reporting on the fighting, the Kosovo Information Center could
not say whether Serb police controlling the mostly ethnic-Albanian
town of 20,000 might have been forced to cede some ground.
	   But the Serbian Media Center in Pristina described the Orahovac
fighting as a ``dramatic'' KLA assault ``from several directions''
that sent civilians streaming from the area. It said more than 40
Serb civilians had been kidnapped by ethnic Albanian fighters.
Telephone lines went dead Saturday morning, it said.

Vogts to remain coach of national team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German coach Berti Vogts, whose team
lost in the quarterfinals of the World Cup, will remain in charge
of the national side, the German soccer federation said Saturday.
	   There have been growing calls for Vogts to step down following
Germany's ouster by Croatia, which crushed the three-time World Cup
champion 3-0.
	   Vogts, who took over the team in 1990, after Germany won its
last World Cup title, guided the team to the European championship
in 1996. But Germany now has been eliminated in World Cup
quarterfinals twice in a row, something that has never happened
before.
	   Soccer writers, coaches and other experts have been critical of
Vogts' choice of aging players and the team's workmanlike, dull
performances in France.
	   But after a six-hour emergency meeting with Vogts and other top
soccer officials in a Stuttgart hotel, the soccer federation (DFB)
issued a statement saying Vogts will remain in the job.
	   ``Berti Vogts remains solely responsible for the sports side,''
he statement said.
	   The federation rejected outside suggestions that Vogts should be
helped by a team of consultants consisting of former German stars.
But the federation said a team of experts will study ways of
improving work with young players.
	   The statement quoted Vogts as saying he was planning no radical
moves.
	   ``We are facing a difficult situation,'' Vogts was quoted as
saying. ``But I see good prospects to bring our flag ship, the
national team, on a good course again.''
	   ``I am striving for a healthy balance between young and old
players. I will talk with all players who may be thinking of ending
their careers. And I will talk with Stefan Effenberg.''
	   Effenberg, a gifted midfielder who will play for Bayern Munich
next season, was kicked off the national team by Vogts during the
1994 World Cup in the United States for showing an obscene gesture
to German fans.
	   Some experts have been saying that Germany's World Cup team
lacked precisely the kind of leadership Effenberg provides on the
field.
	   Vogts' promise to reconsider Effenberg's return to the national
team is a major concession by the 51-year-old coach, who had
earlier stated that Effenberg would never play for him again.
	   Effenberg repeatedly has said that he would be ready to play
again in the national team.
	   At Vogts' urging, the DFB said it would pay special attention to
developing junior players and creating a pool of talents that could
later become internationals.
	   DFB President Egidius Braun, who also has come under fire, said
he will run for another three-year term in October.

Chechen guards free prisoners from cells
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prison guards freed a group of long-term prisoners
from their cells in the Chechen capital Grozny, then fled with the
escapees, news reports said Saturday.
	   The guards handed cell keys to the the prisoners, all serving
long terms or sentenced to death, telling them ``power is changing
in the republic,'' Security Minister Aslanbek Arsayev said on
television Friday night after the escape, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, 32 prisoners were let go. Russian
television put the number at 23. It said 14 had been recaptured by
Saturday.
	   Arsayev said the prisoners being held in the Grozny detention
center of the capital, Grozny, had been sentenced to death or long
prison terms for murder, kidnapping and other high crimes.
	   Arsayev said the release was timed to coincide with fighting
earlier this week between security forces and a radical religious
sect in the city of Gudermes and to destabilize the republic.
	   He gave no explanation of why the guards decided to free the
prisoners or how many guards were involved in their release.
	   Arsayev said the clashes in Gudermes, in which seven people were
killed, were ``a carefully planned action of foreign special
services.''
	   On Friday, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov extended a state of
emergency to give security forces time to complete operations
against a wave of violent crime and kidnapping.
	   The state of emergency, imposed by Maskhadov on June 23, was to
have expired Friday. He extended it for 10 days.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tulpar Atgeriyev told the Interfax news
agency that the extra time was needed to allow security forces to
round up of ``groups engaging in kidnapping, illicit oil business
and other serious crimes.''
	   Chechnya remains a center of violent crime and frequent
kidnappings despite the end of its independence war against Russia
two years ago.

German candidate names second outsider to potential cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's main challenger
has chosen a second political outsider for his potential cabinet,
this time to fill a new slot of culture coordinator.
	   Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, who is leading Kohl in
opinion polls, already has tapped a businessman without party
affiliation to be his economics minister if the party wins the
Sept. 27 national election.
	   Now, Schroeder has chosen publisher and former journalist
Michael Naumann to be the chancellor's chief culture aide, party
spokesman Lars Kuehn said Saturday. Kuehn was confirming a report
to appear Monday but released in advance by Der Spiegel magazine.
	   Naumann, currently chief of Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt Inc.
in New York, is to by the government's chief lobbyist for cultural
affairs and is to coordinate the 1.3 billion marks (720 million)
that the federal government spends annually on culture.
	   Schroeder does not intend to spend new money on the position.
	   If elected, Schroeder would do away with the chancellor's chief
aide for security and intelligence. Bernd Schmidbauer, who
currently holds the position, coordinates spy activities of the
federal Bundesnachrichtendienst spy agency and the military.

Vandals deface medieval , art works in Viterbo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Vandals wielding red spray paint rampaged through
the interiors of two medieval churches in the town of Viterbo,
defacing precious, 500-year-old paintings and frescoes, news
reports said Saturday.
	   The attacks on San Giovanni in Zoccoli and Santa Maria della
Verita came Friday afternoon, the reports said.
	   The vandals sprayed an array of symbols across walls, including
the communist hammer-and-sickle and the anarchist symbol. They also
scrawled the name of an anarchist, Maria Soledad, who committed
suicide last week in Turin.
	   Among the damaged treasures was a priceless polyptych depicting
the Madonna and child painted in 1441 by Balleta (Francesco
D'Antonio Zacchi), the reports said.
	   Some of the defaced paintings were on wood, which experts said
would make restoration especially difficult to restore.
	   The identity of the vandals was not clear. They painted symbols
associated with ``squatters,'' youthful Italian anarchists. But the
local squatters group denied any responsibility for the attacks.
	   During the 13th century, Viterbo rivaled Rome as a residence of
popes. Five were elected there, and four died there. The medieval
town is well preserved and draws thousands of visitors every year.
	   San Giovanni in Zoccoli dates back to the 11th century and Santa
Maria della Verita dates back to the 12th century.
	   Viterbo is about 100 km (60 miles) northwest of Rome.

Festina team expelled from Tour after director admits doping

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Festina riders not participating in time trial.

<TEXT>
	   CORREZE, France (AP) _ Festina riders who were kicked out of the
Tour de France will not race in Saturday's time trial after first
being allowed in unofficially, Tour officials said.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, who made the announcement Friday evening
that the Festina team was excluded from the Tour after the director
of the team, Bruno Roussel, admitted a practice of supplying
illegal drugs with medical supervision to improve performances, met
with Festina officials Saturday morning.
	   Leblanc said he would allow the Festina riders to participate in
the 58-kilometer (36-mile) time trial from Meyrignac-L'Eglise to
Correze in south-central France but their times will not be
considered in the standings.
	   Later, Festina riders met with LeBlanc near the circuit after
the race started and decided not to participate in the race,
according to Tour de France press spokesman John Lelangue.
	   The Tour de France tried to recover Saturday from the shock that
was a bombshell to the race and the cycling world.
	   The Festina team was ranked No. 1 in the world according to the
International cycling Union and were leading the Tour de France. It
also had two of the individual favorites, Richard Virenque and Alex
Zuelle.
	   Virenque, second and third in the Tour the last two years,
threatened legal action to pursue racing after first hearing of the
ban.
	   ``If the others persist in the intention to race the time trial,
it is evident that the judges will let them go, but their time will
not count since they are considered, as of now, out of the race,''
Leblanc said early Saturday.
	   Later, after the meeting, Festina riders decided not to race.
	   Other members of the nine-rider Festina the team included
Laurent Brochard, the current world champion, and two other members
of the team who won stages last year, Neil Stephens and Didier
Rous.
	   In Lille on Friday, Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were
placed under investigation for importing prohibited substances and
other counts connected to the drug scandal.
	   The two joined Willy Voet, a Festina team trainer jailed July 9
after customs officers found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   Virenque had won the top climber award of the Tour the last four
years with Voet as his personal trainer.
	   A statement by Roussel through his lawyer said the Festina
management, doctors, masseurs and cyclists were involved in the
scheme to supply riders with drugs.
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves under conditions
that could be bad for their health.''
	   A rider denied the charges.
	   ``I never took any EPO or any other prohibited products. I only
took products for recuperation, '' said Pascal Herve, a member of
he Festina team in Varetz, where the team was staying Friday night.
	   EPO, among the drugs found in Voet's car, is a substance that
aids the transport of oxygen within the blood stream and is
difficult to detect.
	   After Saturday's time trial, two more weeks of the race remain
before it ends in Paris Aug. 2. The remaining racers hit the
Pyrenees on Tuesday then cross southern France before getting to
the Alps a week from Sunday.
	   Last year, Jan Ullrich of Germany won by more than nine minutes
over Virenque and beat him by more than three minutes in a time
trial.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Foreign businessmen invited by Iranian
companies will be given three-day visas at Tehran's Mehrabad
airport, the the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday.
	   It quoted housing and urban development minister, Ali Abdol
Alizadeh, as saying the Cabinet will soon implement the plan aimed
at promoting business and trade.
	   IRNA gave no details.

	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Oman's crude oil exports declined 1 percent
to 126.2 million barrels in the first five months of 1998 from
127.7 million barrels in the same period a year earlier, the
official Oman News Agency reported Saturday.
	   Oman's oil output in the period increased 2.9 percent to 138.1
million barrels from 134.2 million barrels a year earlier, the
agency said.
	   However, the output rise is unlikely to continue since Oman has
committed to cut 50,000 barrels a day along with other OPEC and
non-OPEC producers to trim production in effort to boost sagging
oil prices.
	   Oman's output after the voluntary cutback that began July 1 is
estimated at 865,000 barrels per day.
	   The figures showed Thailand topped the list of Omani crude
importers with 35.2 million barrels in the first five months of the
year, up 28 percent from 27.5 million barrels in the same period a
year earlier.
	   Japan ranked second among importers of Omani crude with 28.7
million barrels, down 17.2 percent from 34.7 million barrels a year
earlier, while China ranked third with imports of 24.1 million
barrels in the Jan-May period, down 30.3 percent from 34.6 million
barrels in the same period of 1997.
	   Other Asian importers of the Omani crude were South Korea with
23.3 million barrels and the Philippines with 6.8 million barrels
in the same period.
	   The agency said the average price of Omani crude oil in the
January-May period was dlrs 12.32 a barrel, 37.2 percent lower than
dlrs 19.62 a year earlier.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The state minister for administrative
reform has submitted an urgent law proposal to punish importers of
computers and electronic appliances that are not year-2000
compliant, newspapers reported Saturday.
	   The proposal, which was presented by Minister Bishara Merhej to
Justice Minister Bahij Tabbara on Friday asks that violators be
sentenced to a minimum of six months jail with hard labor with a
five million Lebanese pounds (dlrs 3,300) fine.
	   Most computers and electronic devices in use now are programmed
to read the last two digits of any year between 1900 and 1999.
Incapable of reading all four numbers in 2000, the computers will
treat the year as 1900, causing malfunctions in power supply,
banking, aviation, and telecommunications. The problem is called
the millennium bug.
	   Failure to deal with the problem would cause ``major damage'' to
the country, Merhej said in the proposal.
	   The draft bill must be approved by Lebanon's Cabinet and
Parliament before it becomes a law.
	   Lebanon's Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh in May issued a
statement urging all banks and financial institutions to draw up a
plan to deal with the millennium bug. The statement told banks that
the computers must be reprogrammed and tested by June of next year.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait Finance House has posted 50.24 million
dinars (dlrs 164.18 million) in net profits in the first half of
this year, up 28 percent from the same period in 1997, Al-Watan
daily reported Saturday.
	   KFH is Kuwait's only Islamic banking institution. Although it is
not registered as a bank, it offers all banking services and is
listed in the banking sector of the Kuwait Stock Exchange.
	   The newspaper quoted an KFH statement as saying the profits were
a result of improved services. Two months ago, KFH announced it has
reprogrammed its computers to deal with the millennium bug,
becoming one of the first banking institutions in the area to do
so.
	   KFH has a paid-up capital of 53.8 million dinars (dlrs 175.81
million).
	   Islamic banking is based on profit-sharing rather than interest.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Arab Bank, the largest banking
institution in the kingdom, has posted a 20.59 percent profit
during the first six months of 1998, Abdul-Majid Shouman, the bank
chairman, said Saturday.
	   He said the gross profit amounted to dlrs 163 million before
taxes paid, which is an increase of dlrs 27.83 million over the
profits in the same period in 1997.
	   Shouman attributed the rise in profit ``to the organized
dealings, and well-planned expansion in banking system, and
investments.''
	   He said the net profit after taxes amounted to dlrs 125.72
million, a 15.8 percent increase over last year.
	   The bank's total assets amounted to dlrs 22.91 billion until end
of June 1998, against dlrs 21.11 billion in June 1997, an increase
of 8.48 percent, he said.
	   The bank has doubled its paid capital last March from dlrs 62
million to dlrs 124 million.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles dined
with friends at an exclusive club Friday, on the eve of her 51st
birthday.
	   The meal with 10 friends was to celebrate the birthday of the
host, travel company boss Geoffrey Kent, a polo-playing friend of
the prince, according to a spokesman for Charles, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   According to the Daily Mail, the prince and Mrs Parker Bowles
arrived separately, but left together at 10.30pm.

Bowles returned to her home in Wiltshire, the paper said. The

Skipper Craig McMillan powers New Zealand to beat India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS results of two other matches in final 5 grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand skipper Craig McMillan
scored an unbeaten 50 to power New Zealand to a one wicket win over
India in the Super Max 8s cricket tournament here Saturday.
	   New Zealand has already had its first win over Pakistan on
opening day Friday, boosting their chances of making the final
Sunday.
	   McMillan faced 23 balls and hit four boundaries and two sixes.
The other major contributors were Nathan Astle (31 off 17 balls)
and Craig Spearman (22 off 15).
	   Hrishikesh Kanitkar bowled best for India with three wickets for
the loss of 31 runs in three overs.
	   Sunil Joshi, a leftarm spinner, bowling the penultimate over,
sent a shiver through the New Zealand batting by taking a wicket
with the first delivery, then conceding a run and no runs from the
next four deliveries for overall figures of one for 20.
	   New Zealand needed three runs to win off the last ball by Rohan
Gavaskar. McMillan promptly stepped in and hit a six to put the
issue beyond any doubt.
	   India beat Pakistan by four runs in a rain-affected match.
	   India batted the full 14 overs and Pakistan completed 11 overs.
(To obtain a result under such circumstances, both teams must
complete a minimum of seven overs.)
	   In the Indian innings, Nayan Mongia scored 37 runs off 24 balls
with one four.
	   Shahid Afridi was Pakistan's best batsman with 37 off 18 balls.
	   The final match of the day between Australia and New Zealand was
abandoned due to rain as a draw with each team getting a point.

Anti-riot policemen prepare for trouble in Lagos

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Hundreds of anti-riot policemen were
braced for possible violence Saturday as the family of the
opposition leader Moshood Abiola began a day of prayer services at
the family's Lagos estate and business offices.
	   Police units were deployed throughout Nigeria's commercial
capital of Lagos, including a race track where Abiola's family had
initially planned to hold the services.
	   The venue was changed Friday after police forbade use of the
track, fearing renewed violence by large crowds.
	   Other security forces patrolled outside the family's palatial
home and business offices where the prayers began. About 5,000
people, including a variety of Muslim and Christian religious
leaders and pro-democracy activists, attended the largest of the
two ceremonies at the family's business offices _ formerly used as
a political campaign headquarters by Abiola _ in the city.
	   There was no sign of trouble Saturday morning and many streets
were filled with people going about their usual weekend business.
	   Many Muslims traditionally hold prayers seven days after someone
is buried. The city's public markets remained closed Saturday in
honor of Abiola.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993's annulled presidential
elections, was imprisoned in 1994 after declaring himself
president.
	   His death July 7 triggered several days of rioting in Lagos and
a number of other cities, killing dozens of people and leaving many
homes and vehicles destroyed.
	   Dozens of people, including more than 30 teens and pre-teens,
were arrested.
	   Nigerian authorities, as well as a team of independent
pathologists, say Abiola apparently died of a heart attack. One
group involved in an independent autopsy, the U.S.-based Physicians
for Human Rights, said he did not receive proper medical care for
his heart condition during his imprisonment.
	   Some members of Abiola's family, and many of his supporters, say
he was poisoned.
	   Since taking over from dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died of
heart failure in early June, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar has released
dozens of political prisoners and promised democratic reforms.
	   After meeting late Friday in Nigeria's capital of Abuja with
Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim,
Abubakar said he was convinced that all Nigerians favored a return
to democracy.
	   The regime was committed to providing ``opportunities to all to
contribute to the efforts at finding solutions to the country's
problems,'' Abubakar added.
	   Nigeria has been ruled for all but 10 of the 38 years since
independence from Britain by successive military governments.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Suddenly, par is looking pretty good
at the British Open.
	   Howling winds returned to Royal Birkdale on Saturday, sending
scores soaring in the third round. Brian Watts, Tiger Woods and the
other leaders, meanwhile, waited anxiously to take their turn on a
course proving to be as complete a test of links golf as there is.
	   Among the early casualties was defending champion Justin
Leonard, who shot an 82 that included three double bogeys. One of
those came on the 480-yard (440-meter) par-4 sixth, where few
players were able to reach the green in two and only 11 pars were
made among the first 48 players.
	   ``I'm going to go home, watch TV and laugh at the guys
playing,'' said Leonard, 18 over after three rounds. ``If I hadn't
putted well, I might have shot 90.''
	   A day after the world's best battled to keep their games under
control in high winds and driving rain, the third round opened
under dark skies and even stronger gusts off the Irish Sea.
	   ``Par doesn't mean anything here,'' said Curtis Strange, who
shot a 4-over 74 Saturday.
	   With pants and shirts flapping in the wind, players struggled to
stay steady over their balls. The wind swirled through the sand
dunes in all directions and speeds, making club selection nearly
impossible at times.
	   The first player off, England's Andrew Clapp, shot 81, while
Billy Mayfair parred the first hole only to make bogeys on each of
the next six. Five of the first 10 golfers couldn't break 80.
	   Midway leader Watts and English amateur Justin Rose were to tee
off in the last group; Woods and Nick Price were to play in the
group before them.

Festina bombshell front-page news in France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The banning of the Festina team from the Tour de
France cycling race dominated French newspapers on Saturday.
	   ``The leaders of Festina confessed everything,'' trumpeted a
headline in the daily Le Parisien. ``Nine days of torment,'' said
another.
	   After France's triumphant victory in the World Cup, the doping
scandal that has disrupted the Tour de France has become the
nation's number one story.
	   ``Doping: Festina pays for everybody'' screamed the front-page
of the tabloid France-Soir, calling the ban on Festina a ``bomb.''
	   ``It's huge,'' said L'Equipe, France's main sports daily, which
devoted seven pages to the doping saga.
	   ``Festina banned,'' said the Liberation daily.
	   France's radio and TV stations had major coverage of the fate of
Festina, with many speculating the team was made a scapegoat for a
practice that may be widespread on the Tour de France.

Afghani tribal elders meet in Germany to discuss civil war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Tribal leaders from throughout Afghanistan
assembled Sunday in Bonn for the first such meeting of its kind in
20 years, to try to find ways to end their country's civil war.
	   The Committee for Peace and National Unity is meeting through
Tuesday to draft peace proposals and try to pave the way for a
similar assembly of elders in Afghanistan, meeting coordinator
Hamid Sidig said.
	   The committee of 135 local leaders, which includes Muslims and
Hindus, has limited influence in Afghanistan because it is not
supported by the Taliban, the Muslim group that controls about 85
percent of the country.
	   Sidig said the group would discuss whether to appeal to the
international community for an arms embargo against Afghanistan's
combatants.
	   Sidig said it has been 20 years since the last such assembly of
tribal leaders.

	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Huge sea waves set off by
an earthquake crashed against Papua New Guinea's north coast,
killing at least 70 people and crushing villages, the country's
National Disaster Center said.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water, called tsunami, hit
Friday night without warning just after an earthquake about 12
miles (30 kilometers) off the coast. The Australian Geological
Survey Organization said it had a preliminary magnitude of 7.0.
	   The disaster center said late Saturday that hundreds are missing
and thousands are without food and shelter.
	   ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless and
there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,''
Fr. Austin Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   He said most of the dead were children who drowned.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
located about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of Australia's
northeast tip.

South Africa edges Australia in Tri Nations test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: recasts, adds quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ South Africa won its 10th consecutive
rugby union test match Saturday, edging Australia 14-13 in a Tri
Nations encounter at Subiaco Oval.
	   The scores were level at 8-8 at halftime and Australia had a
chance to grab the lead with just over 15 minutes remaining. But
last week's Bledisloe Cup hero Matt Burke missed an easy penalty
from 24 meters out.
	   Australia scored two tries and South Africa one, but Burke was
only able to convert one of five penalty attempts. Burke scored all
of Australia's points last Saturday in the Wallabies' 24-16 win
over New Zealand.
	   A 52-meter penalty goal by Burke after the halftime siren gave
the Wallabies the halftime 8-8 draw. Winger Ben Tune gave Australia
a 5-0 lead with a second-minute try, but a penalty goal to Percy
Montgomery and Joost Van Der Westhuizen's 21st test try gave the
visitors the lead until Burke's long kick.
	   Halfback Van Der Westhuizen took the Springboks into the lead in
the 26th minute when he took a quick tap from a penalty a meter
from the line to scoot through between the Australian defense.
	   In the final minutes of the match, inside center Tim Horan
called for a field goal when the Ausralians were awarded a scrum 20
meters out, but South African pressure at the back of the scrum
snuffed out any chance.
	   Australian coach Rod Macqueen criticized the Wallabies' huge
error rate.
	   ``We are a much better team than that, we showed it in
patches,'' Macqueen said. ``We probably did the hard things well
and the easy things badly. We just can't make that many mistakes
and expect to win test matches.''
	   Macqueen said when van der Westhuizen scored his try, there was
actually two balls on the field when the penalty was awarded,
adding to his players' confusion.
	   ``That was a little bit of a mishap from the referee but we're
certainly not using that as an excuse. We know we made too many
mistakes.''
	   Springbok coach Nick Mallett said his players were subdued after
the win, aware they had three more matches in the series.
	   Mallet also had sympathy for Burke.
	   ``It wasn't a convincing win, we'd be fooling ourselves if we
thought that,'' Mallett said.
	   ``It's funny how rugby is. They've been talking about Matt
Burke, brilliant and record scorer and suddenly today the poor guy
has one in front of the poles that probably lost them the match.
	   ``Overall, we had more control of the game. It wasn't a pretty
game but you take any win you can.''
	   The Wallabies regained possession from their kickoff to start
the match and two minutes later, halfback George Gregan took the
ball from a maul, sent it to five-eighth Stephen Larkham, who spun
it wide to Tune who had space to run around his opposite Pieter
Rossouw.
	   Early rain made the ground and ball greasy with both teams
making several handling errors. But the rain could not be blamed
for many fundamental Australian mistakes, including losing five of
their lineout throws.
	   Scores:
	   SOUTH AFRICA 14 (Joost Van Der Westhuizen try, Percy Montgomery
3 penalties) def. AUSTRALIA 13 (Ben Tune, George Gregan tries, Matt
Burke penalty) at Subiaco Oval. (djp)

Russia says Soviet-era accord with Iran on Caspian remains valid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A Soviet-Iranian agreement on the Caspian
Sea is not affected by a recent Russian-Kazakstan accord, the
official Iranian news agency quoted a Russian deputy minister as
saying here Saturday.
	   Iran has been pressing for a new demarcation of borders on the
Caspian ever since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, creating new
countries with shores on the sea.
	   There are now five states along the Caspian, whose seabed has
promising resources of oil and gas.
	   In talks with his Iranian counterpart on Saturday, Deputy
Russian Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov said that the Soviet-era
agreements with Iran on the borders on the Caspian would remain
``valid until a new legal regime for the sea is completed,'' the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Earlier this month the presidents of Russia and Kazakstan signed
an accord that divided the northern part of the Caspian between
their states.
	   Of the five nations bordering the Caspian, Kazakstan, Azerbaijan
and Turkmenistan want the sea to be divided into national sectors
as they have resources of oil near their shores.
	   But Russia and Iran, which have little or no oil near their
coasts, want the sea's resources to be shared by all.

Senior Indian scientist says India should sign a nuclear test ban
</HEADLINE>
treaty &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A senior scientist responsible for India's
first nuclear test in 1974 said on Saturday that India should sign
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty once the terms are clearly
defined.
	   ``We should sign the CTBT, but nations must sit together and
define how the treaty will actually operate,'' Raja Ramanna, a
member of the Atomic Energy Commission, told a gathering of
businessmen in India's financial capital. ``All countries should
agree not to test anything to do with weapons of a nuclear nature
underground or on submarines.''
	   After the tests in May, India reiterated that it would sign the
test ban treaty under certain conditions. India has all along
refused to sign the treaty, saying it favors developed nations that
already have nuclear weapons.
	   ``The treaty must be fully defined. If it goes beyond our
sovereignty, there is a limit to what we will sign,'' Ramanna said.
	   He said all countries should pledge against first use of nuclear
weapons, which would be first step toward ending nuclear
proliferation.
	   Fears of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent were triggered
when Pakistan responded to India's tests by exploding its own
nuclear devices.
	   Ramanna said the development of low yield bombs had great
implication for India's defense.
	   He said that according to estimates of the nuclear tests of the
Department of Atomic Energy, the yield of the thermonuclear or
hydrogen bomb on May 11 was 45 kilotons, a fission explosion was 15
kilotons and the next test was 0.2 kilotons. He said the yields for
the May 13 tests were 0.5 kilotons and 0.3 kilotons.
	   Ramanna was critical of the American and Indian media for
speculating on the yield and added that the U.S. Geological Survey
had estimated a yield of 30 to 60 kilotons from data collected from
123 seismic stations.
	   He reiterated India's position that the tests were necessary as
a nuclear deterrent because of security threats from neighboring
China and Pakistan, with which it has fought four wars.

Fighters beat Kintetsu 7-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nigel Wilson and Jerry Brooks both hit homeruns
Saturday as the Pacific League frontrunning Nippon Ham Fighters
routed the Kintetsu BlueWave 7-1 at Osaka Dome.
	   Wilson, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, blasted a solo shot
in the second inning to start off the scoring for the Fighters.
	   In the third, Brooks smashed a three-run roundtripper to give
Nippon Ham a 5-0 early lead.
	   Fighters hurler Hiroshi Shibakusa went the distance giving up
six hits and one run to improve to 6-5.
	   Wilson now has 17 homeruns for the season, while Brooks, who has
played with the Florida Marlins, has 21.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, the Daiei Hawks rapped out nine hits and
smashed three homeruns to defeat the Orix BlueWave 7-1.
	   Hawks infielder Koichiro Yoshinaga hit a two-run homerun to
break a 1-1 tie in the third.
	   Orix slugger Harvey Jerome Pulliam Jr., formerly with the
Colorado Rockies, hit his 13th homer of the season in the eighth.
	   At Chiba, Kazumi Sonokawa pitched nine full innings, striking
out seven and allowing nine hits, to lead the Lotte Marines to a
7-1 win over the Seibu Lions.
	   In the Central League, the league-leading Yokohama BayStars
rapped out 15 hits on their way to thrashing the Hiroshima Carp
10-2 at Yokohama Stadium.
	   Yokohama infielder Robert Rose, formerly with the California
Angels, batted in a run in the fifth.
	   At Tokyo Dome, the Yomiuri Giants snapped their losing streak at
three with an extra-innings 4-3 win over the Yakult Swallows.
	   Infielder Daisuke Motoki batted in the winning run in the bottom
of the 10th.
	   Pitcher Balvino Galvez struck out nine to notch his eighth win
against six losses.
	   At Koshien Stadium, rookie pitcher Kenshin Kawakami gave up one
run over nine innings to lead the Chunichi Dragons to a 7-1 victory
over the Hanshin Tigers.

Critical Swedish judge to step down from Rwanda tribunal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Lennart Aspegren, one of six judges at
the international tribunal set up to try those responsible for the
1994 Rwanda genocide, is stepping down, a Swedish newspaper said
Saturday.
	   Aspegren, a 67-year-old Swede, cited mismanagement and
incompetent leadership at the tribunal based in Arusha, northern
Tanzania. Recently the chief lawyer Fredrik Harhof of Denmark
resigned.
	   Two independent reviews have voiced similar criticism.
	   UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan fired the former administrative
head of the tribunal in February 1997, but Aspegren was not too
impressed by his successor, Agwu Okali of Nigeria.
	   ``All the incompetent people his predecessor hired are still
here. Those who accept bribes and embezzled money are promoted.
Those who voice criticism are formally cautioned. That is why I am
stepping down early,'' Aspegren was quoted as saying by the
Stockholm-daily Svenska Dagbladet.
	   He plans to leave the tribunal at the end of the year, six
months before his contract ends. The tribunal was set up to try
those guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity, murder and
torture in the 90-day slaughter in Rwanda.
	   An estimated 500,000 people, most of them minority Tutsis, were
killed in the extremist Hutu-government orchestrated genocide.
	   Aspegren was also critical about working conditions.
	   ``We don't even have a reference library of the kind available
in a small local court house. We don't even have dictionaries. I
brought my own French dictionaries I used at school in the 1940s,''
he said.
	   ``Of the 500 employees, some 20 are lawyers, 10-15 are involved
with the trials. The UN has not understood what a court is,''
Aspegren said.
	   Earlier this week, the U.N. Security Council gave Kofi Annan
until Aug. 4 to propose suitable candidates for a new third chamber
at the tribunal, aimed at speeding up the trials.
	   Annan has so far only managed to name five of the 18 candidates.
	   ``We lack telephones, newspapers, are completely cut off. We
don't even have a website on the Internet so that people can follow
our work. Of all useless departments, the information department is
the worst,'' Aspregren said.
	   ``Nothing of our efforts is passed on to the people of Rwanda.
They don't know we exist. The information department even tries to
prevent us judges from meeting reporters.''
	   Aspegren and several other judges are also concerned about how
the 35 suspects and defendants detained in Arusha are treated. The
suspects are allowed to see each other and use a computer to
produce brochures which they can distribute to their supporters.
They even have access to a telephone and can free of charge call
supporters all over the world, Aspegren noted.

Critical Swedish judge to step down from Rwanda tribunal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Lennart Aspegren, one of six judges at
the international tribunal set up to try those responsible for the
1994 Rwanda genocide, is stepping down, a Swedish newspaper said
Saturday.
	   Aspegren, a 67-year-old Swede, cited mismanagement and
incompetent leadership at the tribunal based in Arusha, northern
Tanzania. Recently the chief lawyer Fredrik Harhof of Denmark
resigned.
	   Two independent reviews have voiced similar criticism.
	   UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan fired the former administrative
head of the tribunal in February 1997, but Aspegren was not too
impressed by his successor, Agwu Okali of Nigeria.
	   ``All the incompetent people his predecessor hired are still
here. Those who accept bribes and embezzled money are promoted.
Those who voice criticism are formally cautioned. That is why I am
stepping down early,'' Aspegren was quoted as saying by the
Stockholm-daily Svenska Dagbladet.
	   He plans to leave the tribunal at the end of the year, six
months before his contract ends. The tribunal was set up to try
those guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity, murder and
torture in the 90-day slaughter in Rwanda.
	   An estimated 500,000 people, most of them minority Tutsis, were
killed in the extremist Hutu-government orchestrated genocide.
	   Aspegren was also critical about working conditions.
	   ``We don't even have a reference library of the kind available
in a small local court house. We don't even have dictionaries. I
brought my own French dictionaries I used at school in the 1940s,''
he said.
	   ``Of the 500 employees, some 20 are lawyers, 10-15 are involved
with the trials. The UN has not understood what a court is,''
Aspegren said.
	   Earlier this week, the U.N. Security Council gave Kofi Annan
until Aug. 4 to propose suitable candidates for a new third chamber
at the tribunal, aimed at speeding up the trials.
	   Annan has so far only managed to name five of the 18 candidates.
	   ``We lack telephones, newspapers, are completely cut off. We
don't even have a website on the Internet so that people can follow
our work. Of all useless departments, the information department is
the worst,'' Aspregren said.
	   ``Nothing of our efforts is passed on to the people of Rwanda.
They don't know we exist. The information department even tries to
prevent us judges from meeting reporters.''
	   Aspegren and several other judges are also concerned about how
the 35 suspects and defendants detained in Arusha are treated. The
suspects are allowed to see each other and use a computer to
produce brochures which they can distribute to their supporters.
They even have access to a telephone and can free of charge call
supporters all over the world, Aspegren noted.

Playwright to petition court if government bans Gandhi play

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ The author of a play about the man who
assassinated Indian independence leader Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
said on Saturday that he will challenge in court any government
order banning his play.
	   Producers canceled the play on Friday after hundreds of
protesters battled with police outside the theater and blocked
people from watching the performance in Bombay.
	   The Hindu nationalist coalition government of Maharashtra state,
of which Bombay is the capital, was expected to take a decision
later Saturday on the federal government's suggestion that it ban
the play, ``Gandhi or Godse.''
	   Federal Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani asked the state
government to shut down the play after lawmakers in parliament
complained that the play denigrates Gandhi, known as the Mahatma,
or great soul, and glorifies his killer, Nathuram Godse.
	   Godse, a Hindu nationalist, was enraged by Gandhi's overtures to
Muslims after the partition of Britain's Indian empire into
predominately Hindu India and officially Islamic Pakistan. He
killed Gandhi in 1948 while the latter was on his way to a prayer
meeting in New Delhi.
	   Playwright Pradeep Dalvi argued that he had a strong case since
the play was cleared by state censors without any cuts.
	   ``I wrote the play because it was a challenging subject. No
light has been shed on the man who killed Gandhi for 50 years ...
Let people be the judge,'' Dalvi said in an interview.
	   Producers said Gandhi and Godse figured in three scenes each in
the play. ``What can I do if people clap more for Godse than for
Gandhi?'' said Dalvi.
	   Dalvi had challenged in court a ban imposed in 1987 by the
then-state government run by the Congress Party. He withdrew his
petition after censors cleared the play last year when the
right-wing BJP-Shiv Sena government came to power.
	   The producers have staged 80 performances of the play in Bombay
and Gujarat in the Gujarati language in the past year. The success
of the play prompted producers to stage it in the more
widely-understood Marathi language. That triggered the protest.
	   The Gujarati-language version will be staged in Bombay next
week. Producer Jaisukh Raorane said the government decision on the
Marathi language play would not affect his production.
	   ``My version does not have the anger that I've heard is in the
Marathi play. Here Godse is a little more subdued and is upset by
the thought of killing Gandhi, although he knows he must kill
him,'' said Raorane.
	   The play was advertised in local papers with teasers like,
``Whose life was a greater sacrifice to the nation? You decide.''
	   More than 60 percent of Bombay's 10 million people understand
Marathi.

Festina team expelled from Tour after director admits doping

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Festina riders saying they will leave
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CORREZE, France (AP) _ A tearful Richard Virenque, the star of
the troubled Festina team that was kicked out of the Tour de
France, said he and his teammates will leave the Tour Saturday.
	   ``It's better we stop the Tour now,'' Virenque said Saturday.
``From a justice point of view, we could participate but we decided
not to continue.''
	   ``In this story the people who are guilty are in jail. We are
just witnesses,'' Virenque said. ``For sport, for the Tour and for
cycling we will leave the Tour.''
	   Festina riders were thrown will not race in Saturday's time
trial, the seventh stage of the three-week long race that began
July 11 in Ireland and will ned Aug. 2.
	   The director of the Tour de France Jean-Marie Leblanc made the
announcement Friday evening that the Festina team was excluded from
the Tour after the director of the team, Bruno Roussel, admitted a
practice of supplying illegal drugs with medical supervision to
improve performances.
	   Leblanc said he would allow the Festina riders to participate in
the 58-kilometer (36-mile) time trial from Meyrignac-L'Eglise to
Correze in south-central France but their times will not be
considered in the standings.
	   d No. 1 in the world according to the International cycling
Union and were leading the Tour de France. It also had two of the
individual favorites, in Virenque and Alex Zuelle.
	   Virenque, second and third in the Tour the last two years,
threatened legal action to pursue racing after first hearing of the
ban.
	   But he was the team spokesman to say they are pulling out.
	   ``I don't know what the Tour will do without Festina. Festina
has given a lot to the Tour. And today we are excluded for the
image of the race, not for any positive controls,'' Virenque said.
	   ``The Tour is great, it's the best. And we will be here next
year,'' Virenque said because stopping in tears and walking away.
	   Other members of the nine-rider Festina the team included
Laurent Brochard, the current world champion, and two other members
of the team who won stages last year, Neil Stephens and Didier
Rous.
	   In Lille on Friday, Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were
placed under investigation for importing prohibited substances and
other counts connected to the drug scandal.
	   The two joined Willy Voet, a Festina team trainer jailed July 9
after customs officers found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   Virenque had won the top climber award of the Tour the last four
years with Voet as his personal trainer.
	   A statement by Roussel through his lawyer said the Festina
management, doctors, masseurs and cyclists were involved in the
scheme to supply riders with drugs.
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves under conditions
that could be bad for their health.''
	   A rider denied the charges.
	   ``I never took any EPO or any other prohibited products. I only
took products for recuperation, '' said Pascal Herve, a member of
he Festina team in Varetz, where the team was staying Friday night.
	   EPO, among the drugs found in Voet's car, is a substance that
aids the transport of oxygen within the blood stream and is
difficult to detect.
	   After Saturday's time trial, two more weeks of the race remain
before it ends in Paris Aug. 2. The remaining racers hit the
Pyrenees on Tuesday then cross southern France before getting to
the Alps a week from Sunday.
	   Last year, Jan Ullrich of Germany won by more than nine minutes
over Virenque and beat him by more than three minutes in a time
trial.

Lesbian and gay appeal as Lambeth Conference starts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ A group of lesbian and gay Christians
appealed for ``a healthy debate'' on their place in the church as
the Anglican Communion opened its once-a-decade Lambeth Conference
Saturday.
	   More than 700 bishops from national churches affiliated with the
Church of England were attending the conference, the main forum for
consultation among Anglicans.
	   The business of the conference begins Monday, with only a dinner
and a welcome from Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey on
Saturday's agenda.
	   Relations with other churches and Third World debt will also be
debated at the conference, which ends Aug. 8. The Lambeth
Conference can adopt resolutions but has no authority to impose its
will on the national churches.
	   A book of open letters urging a reconsideration of traditional
teaching on homosexuality in the church was released Saturday by
The Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement.
	   ``We need a healthy debate on the presence of lesbian and gays
in the church and we are trying to get the issue on to the agenda
at the conference,'' said Richard Kirker, general secretary of the
movement.
	   ``As part of this around 20 lesbian and gay people will be
making a presentation to a group of 50 bishops and will tell them
their own personal stories.
	   ``Perhaps by the time of the next conference in 2008 the
majority of bishops will be much more supportive than they are
now.''
	   Anglicans are sharply divided on the issue. Some bishops have
ordained openly gay people, others believe they should be barred
from the ministry.
	   Carey has urged more study.
	   ``I said ... last year that I see no justification from
scripture, nor from the entire Christian tradition, for a break
away from what we've inherited: sexuality expressed in marriage,
and celibacy outside marriage,'' Carey said in an interview
published Friday in Church Times, an English weekly.
	   He added: ``We need to listen to the experience of homosexuals
today ... I hope a motion might call upon me to create a commission
to look at the whole area of sexuality, not just homosexuality.''
	   Christina Sumners, a curate at Holy Trinity and St. Mary's in
Guildford, England, edited the book entitled ``Lesbian and Gay
Christians Called to Full Humanity: Letters to the Lambeth
Bishops.''
	   ``The bishops should recognize that lesbians and gays are full
members of the church, not the second-class citizens that they are
treated as now,'' she said.

Palestinians: no renegotiation of U.S. pullback terms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ On the eve of the first top-level
contact in months between Palestinians and Israelis, the chief
Palestinian negotiator said Saturday his side would go only ``to
listen,'' not to re-negotiate a U.S. pullback plan.
	   The meeting, being held at the urging of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, was to take place Sunday in Tel Aviv between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Yitzhak
Mordechai, the Israeli defense minister.
	   ``Our agenda is to listen to what Mr. Mordechai tells us, and
the Palestinian delegation has been told that it is unacceptable to
renegotiate the U.S. initiative,'' said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, referring to an American initiative for an
Israeli pullback from the West Bank.
	   ``We just don't want to be blamed for not going, and that's why
we're going,'' he said. ``Albright told us that the Israelis have
ideas.''
	   The United States has urged the sides to hold two or three
meetings within a week to try to resolve their differences over the
Israeli troop withdrawal and procedures for amending the
Palestinian national covenant.
	   The United States has proposed, as part of a broader peace
initiative, that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that the PLO Executive Committee annul parts of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``The U.S. initiative is made up of American ideas. It is void
of any Palestinian ideas,'' said Erekat. ``The Palestinians will
not accept that the initiative's separate elements be revisited.''
	   ``The meeting tomorrow will be to tell the Israelis that we will
not back down one inch from the least of the minimum that we
accepted in the U.S. initiative,'' said Palestinian Planning
Minister Nabil Shaath.
	   ``If the Israelis don't accept the U.S. initiative tomorrow, we
will go to our American friends with a very clear message: `We have
accepted the minimum, the minimum is not attainable _ you take the
next step,''' Shaath said.
	   Erekat said that a top Palestinian security official would
attend the meeting between Abbas and Mordechai.
	   The Israeli media speculated that Mordechai planned to suggest
setting up joint Palestinian-Israeli committees to discuss
redeployment, the PLO charter and security issues. The committees
would conclude their work within a week.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli media reports said the head of Israel's
opposition Labor Party, Ehud Barak, had urged the Palestinians at a
meeting on Friday to go into Sunday's session with an open mind.
Barak met with Abbas and two other top Palestinian officials.
	   ``We explained that Israel must accept the American initiative
if we are to get out of the current crisis,'' said Palestinian
official Hasan Asfour, who attended the meeting.
	   On Saturday, the Jordanian foreign minister, Jawad Anani, met
with Arafat in Ramallah to review the latest developments in the
peace process ahead of Anani's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.
	   ``The current situation is sensitive and the region will witness
changes on the different tracks,'' said Anani, who also serves as
deputy prime minister. He refused to go into detail, but implied he
was referring to separate talks involving Syria and Lebanon.
	   Palestinian officials, meanwhile, announced that a meeting of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference's committee on
Jerusalem, headed by Morocco's King Hassan II, would be held July
29 in Rabat, Morocco.
	   The foreign ministers of 16 Arab and Islamic countries will
attend, and Arafat will represent the Palestinians, according to
Shaath.
	   Shaath said the impetus for that meeting including stepped-up
Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes, Jewish settlement
activity in and around Jerusalem, and the government's recent move
to expand Jerusalem municipal services to outlying areas.
	   Shaath said that the meeting could clear the path for a
full-fledged Arab summit, which the Palestinians for months have
been asking the Arab states to convene.

Report: Siemens plans to get out of memory chip business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Siemens plans to get out of the memory
chip-making business following major losses in its semiconductor
division, according to a newsmagazine report Saturday.
	   The plans include shutting down or selling five factories
employing more than 1,000 workers, Der Spiegel magazine said in an
advance of a report to appear in Monday's edition.
	   Siemens chief Heinrich von Pierer said Thursday that a sharp
drop in chip prices was partly to blame for lower-than-expected
earnings this year for the electrical engineering giant. He said
the company was considering selling off loss-making units.
	   Siemens said it expected a loss of more than 1 billion marks
(dlrs 560 million) in its semiconductor business during the fiscal
year that ends Sept. 31, compared with net profit of 109 million
marks (dlrs 61 million) the previous year.

Afghani tribal elders meet in Germany to discuss civil war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS day in lead to Saturday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Tribal leaders from throughout Afghanistan
assembled Saturday in Bonn for the first such meeting of its kind
in 20 years, to try to find ways to end their country's civil war.
	   The Committee for Peace and National Unity is meeting through
Tuesday to draft peace proposals and try to pave the way for a
similar assembly of elders in Afghanistan, meeting coordinator
Hamid Sidig said.
	   The committee of 135 local leaders, which includes Muslims and
Hindus, has limited influence in Afghanistan because it is not
supported by the Taliban, the Muslim group that controls about 85
percent of the country.
	   Sidig said the group would discuss whether to appeal to the
international community for an arms embargo against Afghanistan's
combatants.
	   Sidig said it has been 20 years since the last such assembly of
tribal leaders.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ On the eve of the first top-level
contact in months between Palestinians and Israelis, the chief
Palestinian negotiator said Saturday his side would go only ``to
listen,'' not to re-negotiate a U.S. pullback plan.
	   The meeting, being held at the urging of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, was to take place Sunday in Tel Aviv between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Yitzhak
Mordechai, the Israeli defense minister.
	   ``Our agenda is to listen to what Mr. Mordechai tells us, and
the Palestinian delegation has been told that it is unacceptable to
renegotiate the U.S. initiative,'' said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, referring to an American initiative for an
Israeli pullback from the West Bank.
	   ``We just don't want to be blamed for not going, and that's why
we're going,'' he said. ``Albright told us that the Israelis have
ideas.''
	   The United States has urged the sides to hold two or three
meetings within a week to try to resolve their differences over the
Israeli troop withdrawal and procedures for amending the
Palestinian national covenant.
	   The United States has proposed, as part of a broader peace
initiative, that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that the PLO Executive Committee annul parts of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``The U.S. initiative is made up of American ideas. It is void
of any Palestinian ideas,'' said Erekat. ``The Palestinians will
not accept that the initiative's separate elements be revisited.''
	   ``The meeting tomorrow will be to tell the Israelis that we will
not back down one inch from the least of the minimum that we
accepted in the U.S. initiative,'' said Palestinian Planning
Minister Nabil Shaath.
	   ``If the Israelis don't accept the U.S. initiative tomorrow, we
will go to our American friends with a very clear message: `We have
accepted the minimum, the minimum is not attainable _ you take the
next step,''' Shaath said.
	   Erekat said that a top Palestinian security official would
attend the meeting between Abbas and Mordechai.
	   The Israeli media speculated that Mordechai planned to suggest
setting up joint Palestinian-Israeli committees to discuss
redeployment, the PLO charter and security issues. The committees
would conclude their work within a week.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli media reports said the head of Israel's
opposition Labor Party, Ehud Barak, had urged the Palestinians at a
meeting on Friday to go into Sunday's session with an open mind.
Barak met with Abbas and two other top Palestinian officials.
	   ``We explained that Israel must accept the American initiative
if we are to get out of the current crisis,'' said Palestinian
official Hasan Asfour, who attended the meeting.
	   On Saturday, the Jordanian foreign minister, Jawad Anani, met
with Arafat in Ramallah to review the latest developments in the
peace process ahead of Anani's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.
	   ``The current situation is sensitive and the region will witness
changes on the different tracks,'' said Anani, who also serves as
deputy prime minister. He refused to go into detail, but implied he
was referring to separate talks involving Syria and Lebanon.
	   Palestinian officials, meanwhile, announced that a meeting of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference's committee on
Jerusalem, headed by Morocco's King Hassan II, would be held July
29 in Rabat, Morocco.
	   The foreign ministers of 16 Arab and Islamic countries will
attend, and Arafat will represent the Palestinians, according to
Shaath.
	   Shaath said the impetus for that meeting including stepped-up
Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes, Jewish settlement
activity in and around Jerusalem, and the government's recent move
to expand Jerusalem municipal services to outlying areas.
	   Shaath said that the meeting could clear the path for a
full-fledged Arab summit, which the Palestinians for months have
been asking the Arab states to convene.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Suddenly, par is looking pretty good
at the British Open.
	   Howling winds returned to Royal Birkdale Saturday, sending
scores soaring in the third round. Brian Watts, Tiger Woods and the
other leaders, meanwhile, waited anxiously to take their turn on a
course proving to be as complete a test of links golf as there is.
	   Among the early casualties was defending champion Justin
Leonard, who shot an 82 that included three double bogeys. One of
those came on the 480-yard (440 meters) par-4 sixth, where few
players were able to reach the green in two and only 11 pars were
made among the first 48 players.
	   ``I'm going to go home, watch TV and laugh at the guys
playing,'' said Leonard, 18 over after three rounds. ``If I hadn't
putted well, I might have shot 90.''
	   A day after the world's best battled to keep their games under
control in high winds and driving rain, the third round opened
under dark skies and even stronger gusts off the Irish Sea.
	   ``Par doesn't mean anything here,'' said Curtis Strange, who
shot a 4-over 74 Saturday.
	   With pants and shirts flapping in the wind, players struggled to
stay steady over their balls. The wind swirled through the sand
dunes in all directions and speeds, making club selection nearly
impossible at times.
	   The first player off, England's Andrew Clapp, shot 81, while
Billy Mayfair parred the first hole only to make bogeys on each of
the next six. Five of the first 10 golfers couldn't break 80.
	   Midway leader Watts and English amateur Justin Rose teed off in
the last group; Woods and Nick Price teed off just before them.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Secessionist guerrillas advanced on
a central Kosovo town Saturday in what ethnic Albanian sources
described as their largest offensive in almost five months of
combat against Serb security forces.
	   Farther southwest, intense Serb shelling of a border area was
reported to have left an unspecified number of people dead and
wounded and briefly sent 80 panicked residents into a deadly
minefield.
	   Serb-Albanian fighting was also reported at another border
region, west of Decani. The Serbian Media Center said as many as
1,000 armed people had tried to cross from Albania. Most were
driven back, but about 200 who made it into Kosovo were battling
border troops, aided by guerrillas already in the area.
	   The guerrilla offensive at the central Kosovo town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of of
Serbia's Kosovo province, seemed aimed at expanding the estimated
30-40 percent of territory held by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Serb shelling in the region of Padesh village on the
Albanian border was an attempt to further disrupt the guerrillas'
gun-smuggling network.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack on their villages. It is also believed used by the KLA to
smuggle guns and ammunition from northern Albania into Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 and demand
independence from Serbia.
	   The Padesh shelling, which started late Friday, ebbed overnight,
flared after daybreak Saturday and ended by afternoon. Albanian
border guards reported seeing the bodies of dead and wounded
victims but gave no casualty count, said Artan Bizhga of the
Albanian interior ministry, which controls the border police.
	   He said 19 wounded KLA members crossed into Albania to escape
the intense barrage. And Albania's state TV said that 80 others _
apparently civilians _ had strayed into a deadly border minefield
in their headlong rush to flee the violence. They were later
evacuated by Albanian border troops, said state TV.
	   The wounded guerrillas were helicoptered to Tirana, Albania's
capital for medical treatment. Some wore military uniforms with KLA
insignia. Reporters in Tirana said most were blood spattered, but
in most cases their wounds appeared relatively minor.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said that during
the most intense period of shelling, two Serb mortar rounds had
landed inside Albanian territory.
	   ``These dangerous incidents (could) have very dangerous
consequences,'' said Cano, hinting at the danger of a possible
Albanian military response to such violations of the country's
territorial sovereignty.
	   He said a protest had been lodged _ and a meeting demanded _
with authorities of Yugoslavia, dominated by Serbia.
	   None of the reports could be verified independently. But both
Serb and Kosovo Albanian sources spoke of intense fighting at
Orahovac. with the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center
calling the guerrilla assault there the largest since smoldering
ethnic hostilities flared into open warfare in February.
	   The center said the KLA offensive wrested at least one kilometer
(more than 1/2 mile) of hilly terrain from Serb control and may
have entered Orahovac, a town of 20,000.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center described the fighting as a
``dramatic'' KLA assault ``from several directions'' that sent
civilians streaming from the area.
	   It said more than 40 Serb civilians had been kidnapped by ethnic
Albanian fighters. Telephone lines to Orahovac, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southwest of Pristina, went dead Saturday morning.
	   In Pristina, British Embassy officials said a British aid worker
earlier feared missing was located in the southwestern town of
Djakovica, where she had been detained by Yugoslav military.
	   British officials said Sally Becker, known as the Angel of
Mostar for her humanitarian efforts in that Bosnian city during the
war, was accused of illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav border
while attempting to assist Kosovo refugees. She heads a small
humanitarian organization called Operation Angel.
	   The Yugoslav _ and Serbian _ five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash in
Kosovo not only against the government but also against Kosovo
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose commitment to nonviolence has
failed to end the bloodshed or win self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA.
	   A mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe was meeting with Rugova Saturday in its attempts to find a
negotiated end to the violence.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A trapped miner and 10 men trying to
rescue him were feared dead after a mudslide buried them in an
underground talc mine, state radio reported Saturday.
	   Tons of mud snapped the cable of an underground elevator in
which some of the rescuers were riding, sending them plunging into
the depths of the mine at the town of Lassing, some 200 kilometers
(120 miles) southwest of Vienna. The others in the 10-member rescue
team were already on the bottom of the pit when the mudslide hit.
	   Officials had earlier feared 11 rescue team members were
underground but later said one of the team had not gone with the
others.
	   An earlier mudslide on Friday had trapped a miner about 60
meters (yards) underground. Hopes that he was still alive faded
Saturday, after a camera introduced through a narrow opening dug by
rescue crews revealed the area he was thought to be in flooded with
water.
	   The mudslides left a crater 50 meters (yards) deep and about 150
meters (yards) in diameter, the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   Several houses nearby tumbled into the pit.

Magazine: Soviets arrested Hitler's relatives as conspirators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ The Soviet Union arrested five relatives
of Adolf Hitler in Austria at the end of World War II and
apparently forced them to make far-fetched confessions that they
helped the dictator, a newsmagazine said.
	   In an advance of a report to appear in Monday's edition, Der
Spiegel magazine said it had uncovered the confessions in KGB
archives in Moscow.
	   Hitler's cousin Eduard Schmidt confessed to being ``guilty, as a
relative of Adolf Hitler, of having approved his plans against the
Soviet Union.'' Schmidt had not seen Hitler since 1907, Spiegel
said.
	   Schmidt and four other relatives who made similar confessions
during the Soviet occupation of Austria died in Soviet custody.
Another Hitler relative, Johann Schmidt, survived his prison term
and returned to Austria in 1955, Spiegel said.

Festina expelled from Tour after director admits doping practice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further Virenque quotes; Edits to conform &QR;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CORREZE, France (AP) _ A tearful Richard Virenque, the star of
the troubled Festina team that was kicked out of the Tour de France
said Saturday that he and his teammates will leave the Tour.
	   ``Today we have taken the decision, all the team, all the
riders, to pull out of the Tour by the pressures on us from all
sides,'' Virenque said. ``At the request of the Tour de France we
have to leave the Tour.''
	   ``It's better we stop the Tour now,'' Virenque said. ``From a
judicial point of view, we could participate but we decided not to
continue.''
	   Festina riders will not race in Saturday's time trial, the
seventh stage of the three-week long race that began July 11 in
Ireland and will end Aug. 2.
	   The director of the Tour de France Jean-Marie Leblanc made the
announcement Friday evening that the Festina team was excluded from
the Tour after the director of the team, Bruno Roussel, admitted a
practice of supplying illegal drugs with medical supervision to
improve performances.
	   Leblanc said he would allow the Festina riders to participate in
the 58-kilometer (36-mile) time trial from Meysman John Lelangue.
	   The Tour de France tried to recover Saturday from the shock that
was a bombshell to the race.
	   The Festina team was leading the Tour de France and also had two
of the individual favorites, in Virenque and Alex Zuelle.
	   Virenque, second and third in the Tour the last two years,
threatened legal action to pursue racing after first hearing of the
ban but then backed down.
	   ``I don't know what the Tour will do without Festina. Festina
has given a lot to the Tour. And today we are excluded for the
image of the race, not for any positive controls,'' Virenque said.
	   ``The Tour is great, it's the best. And we will be here next
year,'' Virenque said. He then broke into tears and walked away.
	   Other members of the nine-rider Festina thus.
	   In Lille on Friday, Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were
placed under investigation for importing prohibited substances and
other counts connected to the drug scandal.
	   The two joined Willy Voet, a Festina team trainer jailed July 9
after customs officers found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   Virenque had won the top climber award of the Tour the last four
years with Voet as his personal trainer.
	   A statement by Roussel through his lawyer said the Festina
management, doctors, masseurs and cyclists were involved in the
cheme to supply riders with drugs.
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves un prohibited
products. I only took products for recuperation, '' said Pascal
Herve, a member of he Festina team in Varetz, where the team was
staying Friday night.
	   EPO, among the drugs found in Voet's car, is a substance that
aids the transport of oxygen within the blood stream and is
difficult to detect.
	   After Saturday's time trial, two more weeks of the race remain
before it ends in Paris Aug. 2. The remaining racers hit the
Pyrenees on Tuesday then cross southern France before getting to
the Alps a week from Sunday.
	   Last year, Jan Ullrich of Germany won by more than nine minutes
over Virenque and beat him by more than three minutes in a time

Felix Magath resigns as coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ Felix Magath Saturday resigned as
coach of FC Nuremberg, which he had guided into the Bundesliga for
the coming season.
	   The former German national team player had been expected to sign
a new contract this week after agreeing verbally to an extension in
June.
	   ``Because of the lack of confidence from the club president, I
see no possibility of continuing to work here,'' said Magath, 44.
	   Magath and team president Michael Roth reportedly clashed over
how money would be spent on paying off the club's debts and the
coach's demands for new players.

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ The push for a negotiated solution in
East Timor gained momentum Saturday as a U.N. envoy met the
Indonesian president to discuss the long-running dispute over the
territory.
	   After the meeting in Jakarta, U.N. mediator Jamsheed Marker said
he was ``very optimistic'' that a peaceful solution can be reached
after two decades of guerrilla war and human rights abuses.
	   In Dili, the capital of the former Portuguese colony, East
Timor's Nobel peace laureate echoed the U.N. envoy's upbeat tone as
more than 300 protesters rallied for self-determination.
	   ``We are now in the reform era. Little by little, we hope that
everyone has an open mind,'' said Bishop Carlos Belo, who won the
Nobel prize in 1996 for his efforts to bring peace to his troubled
homeland.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has pledged democratic reform
since his authoritarian predecessor, Suharto, stepped down in May,
and is also pressing for a solution to the bitter conflict in East
Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, but many of the
territory's 800,000 inhabitants fervently wish for a vote on
independence and deeply resent Indonesian control.
	   Marker is trying to broker a peace deal for East Timor, ruled by
Portugal for hundreds of years before Indonesia sent in troops and
annexed the territory in 1976.
	   At a news conference after the talks, Marker said Habibie
appeared determined to reach a settlement. The envoy praised the
president's ``far-seeing attitude'' and ``humanitarianism.''
	   The pro-independence rally at the University of East Timor on
Saturday followed the commemoration a day earlier of the 22nd
anniversary of East Timor becoming part of Indonesia. The
annexation is not recognized by the United Nations.
	   Marker had planned to visit East Timor during a weeklong trip to
Indonesia, but details of his itinerary there were not made public.
	   The Indonesian government and Belo have warned that Marker's
presence in Dili could generate violent protests among groups who
either support or oppose Indonesian rule.
	   Thousands of people, mainly settlers from other parts of
Indonesia, have left East Timor in recent days, fearing fresh
violence and complaining of intimidation from indigenous residents.
	   Since last month, Indonesian soldiers have killed two
pro-independence protesters. Two demonstrators were shot and killed
during Marker's last visit to East Timor in 1997.
	   At Saturday's campus rally, student protesters chanted
anti-Indonesian slogans and held up banners calling for a
referendum on the future of the disputed territory.
	   ``We have to decide the fate of our homeland,'' said one
protester, Theresa Carbago, 23.
	   Marker has made it clear that recent political changes in
Indonesia represent a new opportunity to solve East Timor's
problems. Suharto quit after a wave of riots and protests sparked
by Asia's economic woes swept the country.
	   Habibie has offered to release jailed guerrilla leader Xanana
Gusmao and grant special status to East Timor in return for
international recognition of it as an integral part of Indonesia.
	   However, he has rejected demands by Portugal and separatists for
a referendum on outright independence.
	   Marker said Habibie's proposal would be discussed when the
foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal meet with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New York later this month or early
in August.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Secessionist guerrillas advanced on
a central Kosovo town Saturday in what ethnic Albanian sources
described as their largest offensive in almost five months of
combat against Serb security forces.
	   Farther southwest, intense Serb shelling of a border area with
Albania was reported to have left an unspecified number of people
dead and wounded and briefly sent 80 panicked residents into a
deadly minefield.
	   Serb-ethnic Albanian fighting was also reported at another
border region, west of Decani. The Serbian Media Center said as
many as 1,000 armed people had tried to cross from Albania. Most
were driven back, but about 200 who made it into Kosovo were
battling border troops, aided by guerrillas already in the area.
	   The guerrilla offensive on the central Kosovo town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of of
Serbia's Kosovo province, seemed aimed at expanding the 30 percent
to 40 percent of the province now held by the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   The Serb shelling in the region of Padesh village on the
Albanian border was an attempt to further disrupt the guerrillas'
gun-smuggling network.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack on their villages. It is also believed to be used by the KLA
to smuggle guns and ammunition from northern Albania into Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 and many are
demanding independence from Serbia.
	   The Padesh shelling, which started late Friday, ended by
afternoon. Albanian border guards reported seeing the bodies of
dead and wounded victims but gave no casualty count, said Artan
Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which controls the border
police.
	   He said 19 wounded KLA members crossed into Albania to escape
the barrage. And Albania's state TV said that 80 others, apparently
civilians, had strayed into a deadly border minefield in their
headlong rush to flee the violence. They were later evacuated by
Albanian border troops, said state TV.
	   The wounded guerrillas were helicoptered to Tirana, Albania's
capital, for medical treatment. Some wore military uniforms with
KLA insignia. Reporters in Tirana said most were blood spattered,
but in most cases their wounds appeared relatively minor.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said that during
the most intense shelling, two Serb mortar rounds landed inside
Albanian territory.
	   ``These dangerous incidents (could) have very dangerous
consequences,'' said Cano, hinting at the danger of a possible
Albanian military response to such violations of its territorial
sovereignty.
	   He said a protest had been lodged _ and a meeting demanded _
with authorities of Yugoslavia, which is dominated by Serbia.
	   None of the reports could be verified independently. But both
Serb and Kosovo Albanian sources spoke of intense fighting at
Orahovac, with the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center
calling the guerrilla assault there the largest since smoldering
ethnic hostilities flared into open warfare in February.
	   The center said the KLA offensive wrested at least one kilometer
(more than 1/2 mile) of hilly terrain from Serb control and the
guerrillas may have entered Orahovac, a town of 20,000.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center described the fighting as a
``dramatic'' KLA assault ``from several directions'' that sent
civilians streaming from the area.
	   It said more than 40 Serb civilians had been kidnapped by ethnic
Albanian fighters. Telephone lines to Orahovac, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southwest of Pristina, went dead Saturday morning.
	   In Pristina, British Embassy officials said a British aid worker
earlier feared missing was located in the southwestern town of
Djakovica, where she had been detained by Yugoslav military.
	   British officials said Sally Becker, known as the Angel of
Mostar for her humanitarian efforts in that Bosnian city during the
war, was accused of illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav border
while attempting to assist Kosovo refugees. She heads a small
humanitarian organization called Operation Angel.
	   The Yugoslav five-month crackdown on the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army has triggered a backlash in Kosovo not only against
the government but also against Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, whose commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the
bloodshed or win self-rule. The result has been converts to the
KLA.
	   A mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe was meeting with Rugova Saturday in its attempts to end to
the violence.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A trapped miner and 10 men trying to
rescue him were feared dead after a mudslide buried them in an
underground talc mine, Austrian state radio reported Saturday.
	   Tons of mud snapped the cable of an underground elevator in
which some of the rescuers were riding Friday, sending them
plunging into the depths of the mine in the town of Lassing, some
200 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna. The others in the
10-member rescue team were already on the bottom of the pit when
the mudslide hit.
	   Officials had feared that 11 rescue team members were
underground but later said one of the team had not gone with the
others.
	   An earlier mudslide the same day trapped a miner about 60 meters
(yards) underground. Hopes that he was still alive faded Saturday
after a camera introduced through a narrow opening dug by rescue
crews revealed the area where he was thought to be flooded with
water.
	   The mudslides left a crater 50 meters (yards) deep and about 150
meters (yards) in diameter, the Austria Press Agency reported.
Several houses tumbled into the pit.

Churn up that patriotic fever again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Cue the national anthems. Unfurl the flags. Get
those patriotic juices flowing one more time. The Goodwill Games,
the world's third international sports event in five months, get
under way on Sunday.
	   After the Winter Olympics in Japan and the World Cup in France,
New York plays host to Ted Turner's games for the next 15 days,
continuing an impressive workout for the passports of world class
athletes.
	   Turner invented these games following the tit-for-tat Olympic
boycotts by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1980 and 1984
as a paean for peace. Now, the Goodwill Games are still around,
while the Soviet Union is not.
	   This adventure has not been cheap. The Goodwill Games have been
swimming in red ink right from the start. The first three editions
in Moscow, Seattle, and St. Petersburg, Russia, lost dlrs 26
million, dlrs 44 million and dlrs 39 million respectively.
	   Ticket sales for this year's events have been sluggish at best.
Days before the opening events, organizers had sold about one-third
of the 600,000 available tickets.
	   Turner is hardly disturbed by that.
	   ``You don't evaluate everything on whether you make a profit or
not,'' the billionaire said. ``There are other ways of valuing
things. Teachers don't make a lot of money but they make a
contribution.''
	   So, the games are his contribution, and in the absence of a Cold
War cause, they come equipped with their own designated charities _
The Boys and Girls Club of America and UNICEF International.
	   The magic number for this event is 15 _ 1,500 athletes competing
in 15 sports in 15 days. That represents a streamlining of the
games, down from the more than 3,000 athletes that participated in
the first Goodwill event in 1986.
	   The stage this time is New York City and suburban Long Island,
and Turner knows that could pose something of a problem.
	   ``This is the first time in the history of New York that there
is a world class sporting event of this magnitude here,'' he said.
``The biggest negative is that New York is so large. The event
could get lost here.''
	   The basketball, boxing and wrestling competitions will take
place at Madison Square Garden. Most of the other action _ track,
swimming and diving, figure skating, gymnastics, women's soccer and
water polo _ is set for the Nassau County Coliseum and surrounding
facilities on Long Island.
	   Organizers have trucked tons of sand into Central Park's Wollman
Rink for beach volleyball. The triathlon will follow an intriguing
course from Battery Park to Central Park.
	   The setting is impressive, but the athletes are the show.
	   From the start, the games went after and got some big names.
Olympic 200- and 400-meter champion Michael Johnson appears on the
event's posters, and the track events include Dan O'Brien and
Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Sprinters like Marion Jones, Ato Boldon,
Donovan Bailey and Maurice Greene give those races marquee quality.
	   Michelle Kwan, Todd Eldredge and Michael Weiss headline the
figure skating. Double gold medalist swimmer Alexander Popov is
here, and Dominique Dawes and Dominique Moceanu from the gold medal
gymnastics team are entered. Cuba's boxing team includes Olympic
gold winners Felix Savon, Ariel Hernandez and Maikro Romero.
	   Still, there are gaps in this shadow Olympics.
	   Johnson, citing injuries that have limited his preparation, will
compete only in the 400, skipping the 200 and the double that he
achieved at Atlanta in 1996.
	   Gwen Torrence, the world's top-ranked women's 100-meter runner
in 1994 and 1995, will miss the event because of an injured left
leg.
	   The anticipated swimming showdown between longtime rivals Popov
and Gary Hall fell through when Hall withdrew after being suspended
following a positive test for marijuana.
	   Amy Van Dyken, who won four gold medals at the 1996 Olympics, is
also missing after surgery to repair torn cartilage in her right
shoulder.
	   America's wrestling team will have just two returning medalists
from last year's world championships _ 138-pound silver winner Cary
Kolat of Lockhaven, Pennsylvania, and 187-pound gold winner Les
Gutches of Corvallis, Oregon.
	   The individual events format is finals-only with no qualifying
rounds. And Turner has spiced the competition with dlrs 5 million
in prize money and performance incentives that pay up to dlrs
100,000 for world records.
	   From the start, there was some concern that these games were an
exercise in duplication, that the real competition was in the
Olympics. Turner has always battled that perception and has tried
to separate these games with their own slogan: ``Where the world's
best prove it.''
	   That part starts Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's bruising battle for a new leader gained
momentum Saturday after a renegade Cabinet minister joined two
veteran politicians in the contest to replace resigning Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Just two days ago, backroom maneuvering by ruling Liberal
Democratic Party elders had made Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi seem
a shoo-in for party president, a post that effectively guarantees
the premiership.
	   But an explosion of protest against politics-as-usual from young
lawmakers and the entry of a newcomer into the race threw the
consensus-building process into turmoil.
	   Fifty-nine-year-old Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro
Koizumi is promising big tax cuts to boost the economy and a
radical streamlining of government.
	   Koizumi differed little from his rivals on immediate steps to
boost the economy, pledging to clean up the banking system and
issue deficit-covering bonds for economic stimulus measures.
	   But the outspoken lawmaker's candidacy _ joining Obuchi, 61, and
former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama _ promises to shake
up the leadership race by bringing raucous debate to what is
normally a staid, predictable procedure.
	   In announcing his candidacy, Koizumi attacked the very way his
party has been going about the business of governing for decades.
	   ``I want to create a situation in which the people of this
country can really lead the government through politics,'' he said.
	   He also promised to cut the government work force by half in 10
years and reduce the size of both chambers of Parliament.
	   Koizumi is considered a maverick for his controversial espousal
of privatizing the postal ministry, and his assertive style and
fresh ideas make him popular with the younger wing of the ruling
party.
	   The Liberal Democratic president, who will be chosen July 24 in
balloting by party lawmakers, is certain to become prime minister
because the party controls the powerful lower house of Parliament.
	   Hashimoto announced he would resign Monday after his party
suffered a crushing defeat in elections for the upper house of
Parliament, losing 17 seats.
	   Analysts attributed the party's defeat to voter dissatisfaction
with the way it handled the economy, which is mired in its worst
recession since World War II.
	   Kajiyama, 72, has recently pushed more aggressively for economic
reforms, but some have voiced concerns about his health because of
his age.
	   Obuchi appears to be the favorite of party power brokers, but
the colorless veteran lacks broad popular appeal.
	   Obuchi said he supports a 6 trillion yen (dlrs 43 billion) cut
in personal and corporate income taxes.
	   Kajiyama said he would perform ``major surgery'' on the
country's ailing banking system, which is burdened with 87.5
trillion yen (dlrs 625 billion) in failed or high-risk loans.
	   Koizumi received wide media coverage last year opposing
Hashimoto and other party elders last year in calling for postal
privatization.
	   His relative youth and his staunch belief in postal
privatization are almost certain to hurt his chances of winning.
	   The privatization issue is particularly touchy for the LDP
because post masters wield enormous influence in rural Japan, where
the party's most faithful bastions are located.
	   The postal system manages the lion's share of Japan's mammoth
personal savings.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Suddenly, par is looking pretty good
at the British Open.
	   Howling winds returned to Royal Birkdale Saturday, sending
scores soaring in the third round. Front-runners Brian Watts, Tiger
Woods and Nick Price each had at least one bogey through the first
four holes and no birdies.
	   Seventeen-year-old English amateur Justin Rose, who entered the
day one stroke behind leader Watts, bogeyed the first two holes on
a course proving to be as complete a test of links golf as there
is.
	   Thomas Bjorn used a birdie on No. 5 to pull into a tie for the
lead with Watts at 2 under.
	   Among the early casualties was defending champion Justin
Leonard, who shot an 82 that included three double bogeys. One of
those came on the 480-yard (438-meter) par-4 sixth, where few
players were able to reach the green in two and only 11 pars were
made among the first 48 players.
	   ``I'm going to go home, watch TV and laugh at the guys
playing,'' said Leonard, 18 over after three rounds. ``If I hadn't
putted well, I might have shot 90.''
	   A day after the world's best battled to keep their games under
control in high winds and driving rain, the third round opened
under dark skies and even stronger gusts off the Irish Sea.
	   ``Par doesn't mean anything here,'' said Curtis Strange, who
shot a 4-over 74 Saturday.
	   With pants and shirts flapping in the wind, players struggled to
stay steady over their balls. The wind swirled through the sand
dunes in all directions and speeds, making club selection nearly
impossible at times.
	   The first player off, England's Andrew Clapp, shot 81, while
Billy Mayfair parred the first hole only to make bogeys on each of
the next six. Five of the first 10 golfers couldn't break 80.

Report: Siemens plans to get out of memory chip business

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Siemens plans to get out of the memory
chip-making business following major losses in its semiconductor
division, according to a newsmagazine report Saturday.
	   The plans include shutting down or selling five factories
employing more than 1,000 workers, Der Spiegel magazine said in an
advance of a report to appear in Monday's edition.
	   Siemens chief Heinrich von Pierer said Thursday that a sharp
drop in chip prices was partly to blame for lower-than-expected
earnings this year for the electrical engineering giant. He said
the company was considering selling off loss-making units.
	   Siemens said it expected a loss of more than 1 billion marks
(dlrs 560 million) in its semiconductor business during the fiscal
year that runs through September, compared with net profit of 109
million marks (dlrs 61 million) the previous year.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ He's 4 1/2 years younger than Tiger
Woods, his favorite group is the Spice Girls and he has been
playing golf ever since he could walk.
	   And boy, can Justin Rose play.
	   The English amateur, a scratch golfer at just 14, shot a 4-under
66 on Friday in the second round of his first British Open.
	   That matched the best amateur score ever in the tournament _
Woods also tied it in 1996 _ and left him near the top of the
leaderboard.
	   It also had the young Englishman talking about turning pro
before his 18th birthday in two weeks.
	   ``I'm being tempted into it at the moment,'' he said. ``I
haven't made my final decision as of yet. I was going to use this
week as a guide. Now I think I could be well tempted.''
	   He got off to a shaky start Saturday, however, bogeying the
first two holes before settling down with two holes at even par. He
was two strokes behind leader Brian Watts in the early going of the
third round.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A decade after 28-year-old British tourist
Julie Ward was slain in a Kenyan game park, Attorney General Amos
Wako said Saturday there was enough circumstantial evidence to
arraign a suspect on murder charges and stage a second trial.
	   Wako, who was flanked by John Ward, the young woman's father,
said Simon ole Makala, a former senior game warden in the Maasai
Mara reserve where Ward was murdered, would appear in court Monday
to face murder charges.
	   ``There's certainly nothing pleasant about a murder, even in
catching the people who may have done it,'' Ward told Associated
Press Television.
	   ``So, there's no elation, it's just a certain satisfaction that
we are at the end of the road as far as the investigation is
concerned.''
	   Ward's mutilated and charred remains were discovered in the
reserve on the Tanzanian border Sept. 13, 1988. Officials first
claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild animals.
	   Two park rangers were subsequently arrested and tried for her
murder, but they were found innocent of all charges in June 1992.
Justice Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police for conducting a
flawed investigation.
	   Three assessors told the court they believed there were three
principal suspects in the murder, and Makalla was one of them.
	   Assessor John Leparakuo told the court it was his ``strong
opinion'' that Makalla and David Nchoko and Gerald Karori ``knew
more than what they told us in the court proceedings.''
	   On March 2, 1996, Wako agreed that new information about the
killing made another ``fair and objective'' investigation
necessary.
	   Many questions remainded to be answered, he said, ``with regard
to the role of David Nchoko, Gerald Karori and Simon Makalla.''
	   Ward, a wealthy hotelier from Bury St. Edmunds, England, has
carried on a 10-year campaign to find his daughter's killers and
have them brought to justice.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Indirect talks resumed Saturday
between the Orange Order and residents of a Catholic neighborhood
who don't want the Protestant fraternal order marching through
their neighborhood.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said his chief of staff,
Jonathan Powell, was overseeing the contacts, in which the two
sides communicated through mediators but did not speak directly to
each other. Similar talks broke down after a few hours a week ago.
	   ``We do not expect to resolve all the issues today but hope to
make progress that can be brought forward in more meetings at a
later date,'' said Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell. ``We do
not expect this session to go beyond today.''
	   Breandan MacCionnaith, leader of the residents' association,
said the talks had been constructive.
	   ``We have had a couple of very good sessions this morning,'' he
said in an interview with BBC radio. ``We will come back as often
as it takes.''

 &UR; Mandela weds Graca Machel on Saturday
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous, adds details from scene &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela
married his long-time sweetheart Graca Machel on Saturday, the
president's 80th birthday.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki announced that Mandela and Machel,
the widow of Mozambican President Samora Machel, were married in a
civil ceremony at the president's house in the posh Johannesburg
suburb of Houghton.
	   The marriage took place despite repeated denials by the
president's aides and family members that the ceremony was
scheduled for Saturday as reported in The Star, a Johannesburg
daily.
	   Mbeki made the announcement in Pretoria, saying that the couple
had been married by the chief magistrate of Johannesburg.
	   The marriage is the third for Mandela and the second for Machel.
	   A Johannesburg radio station, Radio 702, reported that the
marriage took place mid-afternoon.
	   The service was attended by Mbeki, several Cabinet ministers and
relatives of the couple.
	   A large crowd gathered outside Mandela's home Saturday afternoon
waiting for a glimpse of the newlyweds. Press photographers jostled
for position while a large group of women sang songs for the
president and his new wife.
	   The Star reported on Thursday that the president would get
married on his birthday Saturday and that the marriage likely would
be announced at a banquet for Mandela Sunday night.
	   Presidential aides and family members immediately denied there
were any plans for a wedding. On Friday, the president's office
issued an appeal to the media to stop reporting ``false rumors''
that Mandela would marry Saturday.
	   Mandela and Mrs. Machel went public with their relationship last
year.
	   Mrs. Machel, one of the most influential people in Mozambique,
is a lawyer and international campaigner for children's rights. The
couple met in 1990, shortly after Mandela was released from prison.
	   For some time, Mandela has insisted that she be treated as a
first lady during foreign state visits.
	   They previously denied rumors they planned to wed, even after
Archbishop Desmond Tutu publicly but light-heartedly chastised
them, saying they were setting a bad example for young people.
	   The president has earlier declared his willingness to marry, but
indicated that the reluctance came from Mrs. Machel.
	   She has admitted her reluctance in previous interviews, but did
not preclude the possibility.
	   Mandela married first in 1944, but the marriage to Evelyn ended
in divorce in 1957 after quarrels over his long nights of political
involvement. He had four children from his first marriage, however,
two of them died.
	   Mandela's second marriage to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 1958
survived his 27 years in prison but ended in divorce in 1996. They
had two daughters before Mandela was sent to prison.

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ The author of a play about the man who
assassinated Indian independence leader Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
said on Saturday that he will challenge in court any government
order banning his play.
	   Producers canceled the play on Friday after hundreds of
protesters battled with police outside the theater and blocked
people from watching the performance in Bombay.
	   The Hindu nationalist coalition government of Maharashtra state,
of which Bombay is the capital, banned the play Saturday night on a
suggestion made by the federal government.
	   ``In view of the law and order situation there is a ban on any
staging of the play,'' said Chief Minister Manohar Joshi, the
highest elected official in the state.
	   Federal Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani asked the state
government to shut down the play after lawmakers in parliament
complained that the play denigrates Gandhi, known as the Mahatma,
or great soul, and glorifies his killer, Nathuram Godse.
	   Godse, a Hindu nationalist, was enraged by Gandhi's overtures to
Muslims after the partition of Britain's Indian empire into
predominately Hindu India and officially Islamic Pakistan. He
killed Gandhi in 1948 while the latter was on his way to a prayer
meeting in New Delhi.
	   Playwright Pradeep Dalvi argued that he had a strong case since
the play was cleared by state censors without any cuts.
	   ``I wrote the play because it was a challenging subject. No
light has been shed on the man who killed Gandhi for 50 years ...
Let people be the judge,'' Dalvi said in an interview.
	   Producers said Gandhi and Godse figured in three scenes each in
the play. ``What can I do if people clap more for Godse than for
Gandhi?'' said Dalvi.
	   Dalvi had challenged in court a ban imposed in 1987 by the
then-state government run by the Congress Party. He withdrew his
petition after censors cleared the play last year when the
right-wing BJP-Shiv Sena government came to power.
	   The producers have staged 80 performances of the play in Bombay
and Gujarat in the Gujarati language in the past year. The success
of the play prompted producers to stage it in the more
widely-understood Marathi language. That triggered the protest.
	   The Gujarati-language version will be staged in Bombay next
week. Producer Jaisukh Raorane said the government decision on the
Marathi language play would not affect his production.
	   ``My version does not have the anger that I've heard is in the
Marathi play. Here Godse is a little more subdued and is upset by
the thought of killing Gandhi, although he knows he must kill
him,'' said Raorane.
	   The play was advertised in local papers with teasers like,
``Whose life was a greater sacrifice to the nation? You decide.''
	   More than 60 percent of Bombay's 10 million people understand
Marathi. About 10 percent of the people speak Gujarati. The play in
Gujarati has had 83 shows so far in Bombay and the neighboring
state of Gujarat. The Gujarati version has not been banned and it
was not clear if the government planned to ban it.

France wants to create continental stock exchange
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France intends to create an international stock
exchange to rival a new joint exchange recently announced by
Germany and Britain, the head of the French stock market said.
	   The planned stock exchange would include other continental
European markets and could be linked to the powerful New York Stock
exhange, Jean-Francois Theodore, the head of the French stock
exchange, said in an interview published Saturday in Le Figaro.
	   The July 7th announcement that long-time rivals London and
Frankfurt, which are the biggest stock markets in Europe, were
joining forces infuriated France, which felt left out of the deal.
	   Theodore said that a multipolar European network had to be
created in order to compete with the new London-Frankfurt financial
axis.
	   He specifically mentioned Milan, Brussels, Madrid and Paris as
potential partners in the planned stock exchange.

Handicapped children reported bound to their beds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Mentally and physically handicapped
children in a hospital ward are bound to their beds to save on
personnel to care for them, a news report said Saturday. But the
director of the ward denied wrongdoing.
	   The report by the Mediafax news agency followed a visit Friday
to the hospital ward in Braila, 175 kilometers (about 110 miles)
east of Bucharest by a representative of the European Commission
for Human Rights and an official of Romania's Child Protection
Department.
	   The official, Cristian Tabacaru, said the Health Ministry cannot
provide the money needed for enough personnel to properly look
after all the ward's 46 children, according to Mediafax.
	   But Dr. Stefan Bobocescu, in charge of the ward, said the
inspection led to misinterpretation of ``normal measures.''
	   In a telephone interview, he said some children must be bound to
prevent them from hurting themselves as they kick and beat walls or
metal beds.
	   The European Commission representative, Toni Oller, had not
offered an opinion by Saturday.
	   The issue of alleged mistreatment of children in state care is
particularly sensitive in Romania, where thousands of orphans were
found to be living in deplorable conditions after the forced end of
communist rule in 1989. Their care has improved markedly since
then.

Guerrillas advance, Serbs shell border region

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Secessionist guerrillas advanced on
a central Kosovo town Saturday in what ethnic Albanian sources
described as their largest offensive in almost five months of
combat against Serb security forces.
	   Farther southwest, intense Serb shelling of a border area was
reported to have left an unspecified number of people dead and
wounded and briefly sent 80 panicked residents into a deadly
minefield.
	   Serb-Albanian fighting was also reported at another border
region, west of Decani. The Serbian Media Center said as many as
1,000 armed people had tried to cross from Albania. Most were
driven back, but about 200 who made it into Kosovo were battling
border troops, aided by guerrillas already in the area.
	   The guerrilla offensive at the central Kosovo town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of of
Serbia's Kosovo province, seemed aimed at expanding the estimated
30-40 percent of territory held by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Serb shelling in the region of Padesh village on the
Albanian border was an attempt to further disrupt the guerrillas'
gun-smuggling network.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack on their villages. It is also believed used by the KLA to
smuggle guns and ammunition from northern Albania into Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 and demand
independence from Serbia.
	   The Padesh shelling, which started late Friday, ebbed overnight,
flared after daybreak Saturday and ended by afternoon. Albanian
border guards reported seeing the bodies of dead and wounded
victims but gave no casualty count, said Artan Bizhga of the
Albanian interior ministry, which controls the border police.
	   He said 19 wounded KLA members crossed into Albania to escape
the intense barrage. And Albania's state TV said that 80 others _
apparently civilians _ had strayed into a deadly border minefield
in their headlong rush to flee the violence. They were later
evacuated by Albanian border troops, said state TV.
	   The wounded guerrillas were helicoptered to Tirana, Albania's
capital for medical treatment. Some wore military uniforms with KLA
insignia. Reporters in Tirana said most were blood spattered, but
in most cases their wounds appeared relatively minor.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said that during
the most intense period of shelling, two Serb mortar rounds had
landed inside Albanian territory.
	   ``These dangerous incidents (could) have very dangerous
consequences,'' said Cano, hinting at the danger of a possible
Albanian military response to such violations of the country's
territorial sovereignty.
	   He said a protest had been lodged _ and a meeting demanded _
with authorities of Yugoslavia, dominated by Serbia.
	   None of the reports could be verified independently. But both
Serb and Kosovo Albanian sources spoke of intense fighting at
Orahovac. with the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center
calling the guerrilla assault there the largest since smoldering
ethnic hostilities flared into open warfare in February.
	   The center said the KLA offensive wrested at least one kilometer
(more than 1/2 mile) of hilly terrain from Serb control and may
have entered Orahovac, a town of 20,000.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center described the fighting as a
``dramatic'' KLA assault ``from several directions'' that sent
civilians streaming from the area.
	   It said more than 40 Serb civilians had been kidnapped by ethnic
Albanian fighters. Telephone lines to Orahovac, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southwest of Pristina, went dead Saturday morning.
	   In Pristina, British Embassy officials said a British aid worker
earlier feared missing was located in the southwestern town of
Djakovica, where she had been detained by Yugoslav military.
	   British officials said Sally Becker, known as the Angel of
Mostar for her humanitarian efforts in that Bosnian city during the
war, was accused of illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav border
while attempting to assist Kosovo refugees. She heads a small
humanitarian organization called Operation Angel.
	   It appeared that authorities were building a case against her.
Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said she was in contact
with ``terrorists'' in Albania and in posession of a video tape
``undoubtedly ... meant to present a distorted situation of
Kosovo.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Secessionist guerrillas advanced on
a central Kosovo town Saturday in what ethnic Albanian sources
described as their largest offensive in almost five months of
combat against Serb security forces.
	   Farther southwest, intense Serb shelling of a border area with
Albania was reported to have left an unspecified number of people
dead and wounded and briefly sent 80 panicked residents into a
deadly minefield.
	   Serb-ethnic Albanian fighting was also reported at another
border region, west of Decani. The Serbian Media Center said as
many as 1,000 armed people had tried to cross from Albania. Most
were driven back, but about 200 who made it into Kosovo were
battling border troops, aided by guerrillas already in the area.
	   The guerrilla offensive on the central Kosovo town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, capital of of
Serbia's Kosovo province, seemed aimed at expanding the 30 percent
to 40 percent of the province now held by the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   The Serb shelling in the region of Padesh village on the
Albanian border was an attempt to further disrupt the guerrillas'
gun-smuggling network.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack on their villages. It is also believed to be used by the KLA
to smuggle guns and ammunition from northern Albania into Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 and many are
demanding independence from Serbia.
	   The Padesh shelling, which started late Friday, ended by
afternoon. Albanian border guards reported seeing the bodies of
dead and wounded victims but gave no casualty count, said Artan
Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which controls the border
police.
	   He said 19 wounded KLA members crossed into Albania to escape
the barrage. And Albania's state TV said that 80 others, apparently
civilians, had strayed into a deadly border minefield in their
headlong rush to flee the violence. They were later evacuated by
Albanian border troops, said state TV.
	   The wounded guerrillas were helicoptered to Tirana, Albania's
capital, for medical treatment. Some wore military uniforms with
KLA insignia. Reporters in Tirana said most were blood spattered,
but in most cases their wounds appeared relatively minor.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said that during
the most intense shelling, two Serb mortar rounds landed inside
Albanian territory.
	   ``These dangerous incidents (could) have very dangerous
consequences,'' said Cano, hinting at the danger of a possible
Albanian military response to such violations of its territorial
sovereignty.
	   He said a protest had been lodged _ and a meeting demanded _

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Tropical storm Celia moved away from the Baja
California coast Saturday and headed out into the Pacific,
prompting Mexican authorities to lift a tropical storm warning for
the southern part of the peninsula.
	   The storm will continue to travel northwest and weaken, the
National Hurricane Center in Miami predicted.
	   Mexico's National Meteorological Service predicted that Celia
may continue to cause strong to moderate rains and heavy waves in
six Mexican Pacific coast states, and recommended that boaters
exercise caution.
	   The storm was about 150 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Cabo
San Lucas in Baja California, moving northwest and out to sea at
about 17 mph (27 kph) Saturday.
	   The Hurricane Center predicted that the storm will stay on that
track and weaken Sunday and Monday as it moves over cooler waters.
Winds from Celia appeared to extend only about 105 miles (170
kilometers) from the storm's center, as opposed to earlier
estimates of 140 miles (225 kilometers).

 &UR; Mandela weds Graca Machel on Saturday
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details on wedding, adds Mrs. Machel's age &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela
married his long-time sweetheart Graca Machel on Saturday, the
president's 80th birthday.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki announced that Mandela and Machel,
52, the widow of Mozambican President Samora Machel, were married
in a civil ceremony at the president's house in the posh
Johannesburg suburb of Houghton.
	   The marriage took place despite repeated denials by the
president's aides
	   and family members that the ceremony was scheduled for Saturday
as reported in The Star, a Johannesburg daily.
	   Mbeki said Mandela informed him of the wedding plans about two
months ago.
	   ``I think they just decided it would be a good thing to do on
his birthday,'' he said.
	   Mbeki made the announcement in Pretoria, saying that the couple
had been married by the chief magistrate of Johannesburg.
	   The South African News Agency said that there was also a
religious ceremony conducted by presiding Methodist Church Bishop
Mvuve Dandala, who was assisted by Archbishop Desmond Tutu; Sheik
M. Mohammed, the president of the Muslim Judicial Council; and a
representive of the Hindu faith.
	   The couple were blessed on Friday afternoon by Chief Rabbi Cyril
Harris, said SAPA.
	   The marriage is the third for Mandela and the second for Machel.
	   The mid-afternoon service was attended by Mbeki, several Cabinet
ministers and relatives of the couple.
	   Mbeki said Mrs. Machel would continue to use her own name
because of work she had to do in Mozambique.
	   ``The president his wife will continue to live in the way they
are now. So, she will not be moving out of Mozambique. They will be
commuting as they have for some months now,'' Mbeki said.
	   A large crowd gathered outside Mandela's home Saturday afternoon
waiting for a glimpse of the newlyweds. Press photographers jostled
for position while a large group of women sang songs for the
president and his new wife.
	   The Star reported on Thursday that the president would get
married on his
	   birthday Saturday and that the marriage likely would be
announced at a banquet for Mandela Sunday night.
	   Presidential aides and family members immediately denied there
were any plans for a wedding. On Friday, the president's office
issued an appeal to the media to stop reporting ``false rumors''
that Mandela would marry Saturday.
	   Mandela and Mrs. Machel went public with their relationship last
year.
	   Mrs. Machel, one of the most influential people in Mozambique,
is a lawyer and international campaigner for children's rights. The
couple met in 1990, shortly after Mandela was released from prison.
	   For some time, Mandela has insisted that she be treated as a
first lady during foreign state visits.
	   They previously denied rumors they planned to wed, even after
Archbishop Desmond Tutu publicly but light-heartedly chastised
them, saying they were setting a bad example for young people.
	   The president has earlier declared his willingness to marry, but
indicated that the reluctance came from Mrs. Machel.
	   She has admitted her reluctance in previous interviews, but did
not preclude the possibility.
	   Mandela married first in 1944, but the marriage to Evelyn ended
in divorce in 1957 after quarrels over his long nights of political
involvement. He had four children from his first marriage, however,
two of them died.
	   Mandela's second marriage to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 1958
survived his 27 years in prison but ended in divorce in 1996. They
had two daughters before Mandela was sent to prison.

<TEXT>
	   A CORUNA, Spain (AP) _ Marc Rosset and Lorenzo Manta put
Switzerland back into its Davis Cup World Group quarterfinal
against Spain on Saturday, beating Julian Alonso and Javier Sanchez
Vicario in a five-set doubles marathon.
	   With Spain leading Switzerland 2-1, a place in the semifinals
against either Germany or defending champion Sweden depends on the
return singles matches due Sunday.
	   Alonso and Sanchez Vicario started off well in the 3 hours and
seven minute game, winning the first set against the Swiss duo 6-3.
	   But Rosset and Manta came back to take the second and third sets
6-3, 6-4 and after losing the fourth set on a tie break, the Swiss
pair blistered through to victory with a 6-2 fifth set win.
	   Spain's loss puts the home side's stars Carlos Moya, the World
No. 4, and Alex Corretja, ranked No. 7, back in the spotlight, two
days after they each sailed through to straight set wins in their
respective singles matches.
	   If reigning French Open Champion Moya fails to beat 1992 Olympic
champion Rosset in Sunday's first game, the final result will
depend on Corretja following game against Ivo Heuberger.

Ullich regains overall lead after Festina expelled from Tour
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ullrich winning time trial and taking lead; AMS
planned &QR;

 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CORREZE, France (AP) _ Defending champion Jan Ullrich of Germany
won Saturday's time trial to take the overall lead yet the race was
still shocked by the developments that pushed his main rival out of
the race.
	   Ullrich won the 58-kilometer (36-mile) time trial by more than a
minute over a pair of Americans, Tyler Hamilton and Bobby Julich.
	   Jacques Chirac, the French president, was at the finish to
congratulate Ullrich, who was timed in 1 hour, 15 minutes, 25
seconds for the distance.
	   Overall Ullrich regained the yellow jersey, emblematic of the
overall lead by a minute 18 seconds over Bo Hailton, who rides for
the U.S. Postal team, was fifth overall, 1:30 behind just after
Laurent Jalabert of France, 1:24 back of Ullrich.
	   Yet Ullrich's victory was overshadowed by the events that took
the runner-up from last year, Richard Virenque of France, and his
Festina team out of the race.
	   Last year, Ullrich won by more than nine minutes over Virenque
and beat him by more than three minutes in a time trial.
	   Saturday, a tearful Virenque said his team decided to follow the
Tour's request to leave the race after the doping scandal that
found three Festina officials under police investigation.
	   ``It's better we stop the Tour now,'' Virenque said. ``From a
judicial point of view, we could participate but we decided not to
continue.''
	   The director of the Tour de France Jean-Ma performances.
	   Leblanc said he would have allowed the Festina riders to
participate time trial from Meyrignac-L'Eglise to Correze in
south-central France but their times would not be considered in the
standings.
	   Later, Festina riders met with Leblanc near the circuit after
the race started and decided not to participate in the race.
	   The Festina team was leading the Tour de France and also had two
of the individual favorites, in Virenque and Alex Zuelle.
	   Virenque, second and third in the Tour the last two years,
threatened legal action to pursue racing after first hearing of the
ban but then backed down.
	   ``I don't know what the Tour will do without Festina. Festina
has given a lot to the Tour. And today we are excluded for the
image of the race, not for any posorld champion, and two other
members of the team who won stages last year, Neil Stephens and
Didier Rous.
	   In Lille on Friday, Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were
placed under investigation for importing prohibited substances and
other counts connected to the drug scandal.
	   The two joined Willy Voet, a Festina team trainer jailed July 9
after customs officers found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   Virenque had won the top climber award of the Tour the last four
years with Voet as his personal trainer.
	   A statement by Roussel through his lawyer said the Festina
management, doctors, masseurs and cyclists were involved in the
cheme to supply riders with drugs.
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves under conditions
that could be bad for their health.''
	   EPO, among the drugs found in Voet's car, is a substance that
aids the transport of oxygen within the blood stream and is
difficult to detect.
	   After Saturday's time trial, two more weeks of the race remain
before it ends in Paris Aug. 2. The remaining racers hit the
Pyrenees on Tuesday then cross southern France before getting to
the Alps a week from Sunday.

Islamic women's rights activist kidnapped in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MERSIN, Turkey (AP) _ An Islamic women's rights activist has
been kidnapped in this southern Turkish city, police said Saturday.
	   Konca Kuris, who represented Turkey in a number of international
gatherings of Muslim women, was kidnapped overnight Thursday in her
home in Mersin, 500 kilometers (300 miles) south of Ankara.
	   Three armed men, thought to be members of an illegal radical
Islamic group, abducted her, her son Yahya Kuris said, according to
Hurriyet newspaper.
	   He said Kuris, 37, was once close to the outlawed Hezbollah, but
had broken with them over their use of violence. She has since
received many threats, he said.
	   A police officer in Mersin, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that Kuris was missing and said police were searching for
her. He declined to discuss suspects.
	   Kuris has been described as an ``Islamic feminist'' because of
her calls for greater participation of women in Muslim rituals. She
fought for the right for women to pray along with men.
	   According to the common interpretation of the Koran, women
cannot pray in the same area as men and or participate in weekly
Friday prayers.

US on sidelines as treaty on war crimes tribunal signed

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Saturday hailed
a treaty creating the world's first international war crimes
tribunal as a ``giant step forward'' and appealed to a reluctant
United States to join the pact.
	   Annan spoke at a signing ceremony for the historic treaty, which
won overwhelming approval Friday night after nearly five weeks of
talks and years of preliminary negotiations.
	   ``It's a great hope and a giant step forward in the rule of law
that a few years ago nobody would have thought possible,'' Annan
said.
	   The new court will be a permanent tribunal for what the treaty
calls ``the most serious crimes of international concern'':
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression.
	   The idea was born half a century ago with the Nuremberg
tribunals that tried Nazi war criminals. It languished during the
Cold War, then was reborn with the ad hoc tribunals set up a few
years ago for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
	   Ironically, the United States _ a moving force behind these
earlier tribunals _ fought hard to limit the reach of the new
court.
	   Failing to curb the court to its satisfaction, the United States
was one of only seven nations voting against the treaty; 120
countries, including most of America's best allies, voted for it.
	   Humanitarian and human rights groups lobbied hard for the court
and they praised the final treaty, although many had hoped for even
broader jurisdiction.
	   ``No doubt many of us would have liked a court vested with even
more powers,'' Annan acknowledged. ``But we must not minimize the
breakthrough of this achievement.''
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday urged
governments to ratify the treaty. It goes into effect once 60 have
ratified it.
	   ``The road ahead of us is still long and war criminals must be
swiftly and relentlessly prosecuted so that the law has a deterrent
effect for the benefit of all those whom they would otherwise
massacre, loot, rape and torture,'' it said.
	   Among the first to sign the treaty at Saturday's ceremony was
France. The United States delegation did not attend the ceremony.
	   Like the United States, France went into the talks seeking to
protect its troops abroad from politically motivated prosecutions
and at first it seemed France would be a powerful ally for the U.S.
in its bid to limit the court.
	   But France, unlike the United States, ended up happy with the
numerous safeguards built into the pact.
	   U.S. negotiators wanted more than safeguards; they wanted a
loophole for Americans. Despite weeks of hardball diplomacy, they
failed to persuade others that the Pol Pots of the world wouldn't
use the loophole, too.
	   The question now is what the United States will do. It has
repeatedly warned that the court would have a tough time without
U.S. money and muscle and some fear it will try and discourage
countries from ratifying the treaty.
	   ``I hope the U.S. and other countries will come aboard,'' Annan
said. ``I hope the U.S. position is not final. I regret we couldn't
bridge all the differences.''

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ On Friday, Justin Leonard thought he'd
missed the cut. On Saturday, the defending British Open champion
probably wished he had.
	   Only his sense of humor wasn't blown away by the gale-force
winds off the Irish Sea. His score of 12-over 82 belonged to a
weekend player, but the polite applause at No. 18 was for a
wind-beaten champion.
	   ``I'm going to go home, watch TV and laugh at the guys
playing,'' the 26-year-old Texan said. ``If I hadn't putted well, I
might have shot 90.''
	   He took his first of three double bogeys at No. 2, punished by
the wind and his honesty.
	   As he prepared to hit out of a bunker, a gust moved the ball
about a quarter of an inch. He called over a rules official and
took a one-stroke penalty.
	   ``I was in a hazard, so you never actually ground the club,'' he
said. ``But I was digging in, and that's regarded as addressing the
ball.''
	   He picked up another double bogey on No. 6, the 480-yard
(438-meter) par 4 considered the most difficult hole on the course.
	   On the 408-yard (373-meter) 11th, he was still shy of the green
after beating two drivers upwind. ``Then I tried to be clever and I
hit my 9-iron approach too hard.''
	   Then he missed a bogey putt from 3 1/2 feet (1 meter). ``I was
going to be clever and play the wind again, but it broke about 8
inches (20 centimeters) and didn't even come close to going in.''
	   Leonard's tearful, modest acceptance speech a year ago captured
Britain's heart. On Friday, he nearly choked up when it seemed his
6-over par would miss the cut.
	   ``This is probably the toughest pill I have had to swallow in my
career,'' he said, learning later he'd made the cut by a stroke.
	   Known as a methodical man who makes lists of lists, Leonard was
looking for a laugh Saturday when he slipped to 18-over par after
three rounds.
	   ``I looked up and saw 18'' on a board, he said, pausing to set
up the punch line. ``I was just hoping that was a cumulative score.
I had lost track.''
	   ``I was ticked off for a little bit. But I was thinking about
the rest of the year. This is way out of my control now. I'm not
going to let it ruin this day and this week and the rest of the
year.''
	   Asked whether he would return to the British Open, with its
winds, sand hills and elephant grass, Leonard said:
	   ``Absolutely. ... If I live to be 65, I'll be here every year.''
	   He just hopes the rest are nothing like '98.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ With reverence and relief,
hundreds of Russians paid tribute Saturday to the country's last
czar, visiting the crypt where he was buried the day before _ the
80th anniversary of his murder.
	   President Boris Yeltsin led Friday's burial service, issuing a
call for atonement that resonated with many who filed past the
small side chapel and placed flowers on the new grave.
	   ``We are guilty, and so are our forefathers,'' said Alvina
Utkin, a 56-year-old engineer. ``Maybe Russia will enter a new
phase now.''
	   The burial culminated a painful public debate over the murders
of Nicholas II, his family and entourage, who were gunned down by
revolutionaries a year after he abdicated his throne.
	   In recent weeks, the czar and his family came to be symbols of
all those who suffered during the Bolshevik Revolution, and the
ceremonies were seen as a way to help close the rift between
Russia's past and present.
	   But the national confrontation with history is not yet over, and
Russia's relief at finally burying the czar is tempered by the
apprehension that more such debates await _ especially the question
of whether to bury Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin.
	   The revolution, long glorified in Soviet propaganda, is still
held sacred by many Russians. For them, asking forgiveness for the
sins of Bolshevism means letting go of the only form of patriotism
they know.
	   ``We must not lie to ourselves, explaining this senseless
cruelty with political goals,'' Yeltsin said during the service.
``We all bear responsibility for the historical memory of the
nation.''
	   The president tried to set an example, saying ``I bow my head
before the victims of this merciless slaying.''
	   Many say such repentance is necessary if Russia is to find a new
sense of nationhood. Indeed, seven years after the collapse of the
Soviet Union, Russia's national identity is so fragile that
lawmakers have yet to agree on a new anthem and national flag.
	   Nicholas Romanov, head of the Romanov Family Association, said
Romanov descendants hope to help Russia make the transition.
	   ``The Russian people and we Russians who live abroad, we should
not carry this weight any longer,'' he told a news conference
Saturday. ``We have to move on.''
	   But moving on means confronting new issues, especially the
explosive question of what to do with Lenin's mummified body, still
enshrined in a mausoleum on Red Square and still a site of
political pilgrimage.
	   ``Our duty is to take the next step and bury the body of the
`leader of the proletariat','' Dmitry Ayatskov, governor of the
central Saratov region told the ITAR-Tass news agency Saturday.
``We must, finally, fulfill our final duty towards him.''
	   But for the moment, Russians are still coming to terms with the
past week's events.
	   The daily Komsomolskaya Pravda criticized Yeltsin for not going
further in his remarks and acknowledging his own political sins _
especially his role in the 1977 decision to raze the house where
the czar was murdered.
	   Other newspapers were complimentary. Izvestia praised Yeltsin's
appearance as ``one of the most important moves of his life,''
while Moskovsky Komsomolets criticized the bishops and few Romanov
descendants who boycotted the ceremony.
	   ``This time, like 80 years ago, the emperor has been betrayed by
many _ the Noble Assembly and the bishops of the Russian Orthodox
Church,'' the paper wrote. ``But nevertheless, the ceremony has
taken place and this event marks the end of the century.''

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ With reverence and relief,
hundreds of Russians paid tribute Saturday to the country's last
czar, visiting the crypt where he was buried the day before _ the
80th anniversary of his murder.
	   President Boris Yeltsin led Friday's burial service, issuing a
call for atonement that resonated with many who filed past the
small side chapel and placed flowers on the new grave.
	   ``We are guilty, and so are our forefathers,'' said Alvina
Utkin, a 56-year-old engineer. ``Maybe Russia will enter a new
phase now.''
	   The burial culminated a painful public debate over the murders
of Nicholas II, his family and entourage, who were gunned down by
revolutionaries a year after he abdicated his throne.
	   In recent weeks, the czar and his family came to be symbols of
all those who suffered during the Bolshevik Revolution, and the
ceremonies were seen as a way to help close the rift between
Russia's past and present.
	   But the national confrontation with history is not yet over, and
Russia's relief at finally burying the czar is tempered by the
apprehension that more such debates await _ especially the question
of whether to bury Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin.
	   The revolution, long glorified in Soviet propaganda, is still
held sacred by many Russians. For them, asking forgiveness for the
sins of Bolshevism means letting go of the only form of patriotism
they know.
	   ``We must not lie to ourselves, explaining this senseless
cruelty with political goals,'' Yeltsin said during the service.
``We all bear responsibility for the historical memory of the
nation.''
	   The president tried to set an example, saying ``I bow my head
before the victims of this merciless slaying.''
	   Many say such repentance is necessary if Russia is to find a new
sense of nationhood. Indeed, seven years after the collapse of the
Soviet Union, Russia's national identity is so fragile that
lawmakers have yet to agree on a new anthem and national flag.
	   Nicholas Romanov, head of the Romanov Family Association, said
Romanov descendants hope to help Russia make the transition.
	   ``The Russian people and we Russians who live abroad, we should
not carry this weight any longer,'' he told a news conference
Saturday. ``We have to move on.''
	   But moving on means confronting new issues, especially the
explosive question of what to do with Lenin's mummified body, still
enshrined in a mausoleum on Red Square and still a site of
political pilgrimage.
	   ``Our duty is to take the next step and bury the body of the
`leader of the proletariat','' Dmitry Ayatskov, governor of the
central Saratov region told the ITAR-Tass news agency Saturday.
``We must, finally, fulfill our final duty towards him.''
	   But for the moment, Russians are still coming to terms with the
past week's events.
	   The daily Komsomolskaya Pravda criticized Yeltsin for not going
further in his remarks and acknowledging his own political sins _
especially his role in the 1977 decision to raze the house where
the czar was murdered.
	   Other newspapers were complimentary. Izvestia praised Yeltsin's
appearance as ``one of the most important moves of his life,''
while Moskovsky Komsomolets criticized the bishops and few Romanov
descendants who boycotted the ceremony.
	   ``This time, like 80 years ago, the emperor has been betrayed by
many _ the Noble Assembly and the bishops of the Russian Orthodox
Church,'' the paper wrote. ``But nevertheless, the ceremony has
taken place and this event marks the end of the century.''

	   CORREZE, France (AP) - A quick look at Saturday's stage of the
85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE: An individual time trial from Meyriganc-L'Eglise to
Correze, 58 kilometers (36 miles)
	   WINNER: Defending champion Jan Ullrich of Germany, by more than
a minute over a pair of Americans, Tyler Hamilton of the U.S.
Postal team and Bobby Julich of the French Cofidis team.
	   YELLOW JERSEY: Ullrich regained the yellow jersey he had to give
up following the prologue. He has more than a minute advantage of
Bo Hambuerg of Denmark and Julich with France's Laurent Jalabert in
fourth and Hamilton in fifth.
	   HOW THE OTHERS FARED: Stuart O'Grady of Australia, who had the
yellow jersey for three days, dropped to 8th overall by coming in
more than three minutes behind Ullrich on the day.
	   The 1996 winner, Bjarne Riis of Denmark and Ullrich's teammate
on the Telekom team, was 20th, 3:51 back with another telekom
rider, Jens Heppner of Germany 10th. Sprinter Erik Zabel faded to
58th overall, almost six minutes behind.
	   TOUR TIDBIT: Jan Ullrich went into the lead last year in the
Pyrenees and stayed in first the final 12 days without being
threatened. There are two weeks left in this year's race.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``The Tour is great, it's the best. And we
will be here next year,'' Festina team star Richard Virenque said.

Kuchma hopes for IMF loan approval
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma voiced hope
Saturday that an IMF mission expected in Ukraine next week would
recommend the long-awaited release of a dlrs 2.5 billion loan for
the republic.
	   ``I am convinced that everything will be all right,'' Kuchma
said.
	   The International Monetary Fund mission will arrive in Ukraine
July 23 to continue negotiations over the loan. Kuchma and his
aides say it might be the final trip by an IMF delegation before it
recommends that the fund's board of directors approve the loan.
	   ``The IMF mission is traveling to Ukraine in good spirits, with
the wish to complete consideration of the program ... and approve
it,'' said Kuchma.
	   The IMF's approval of the loan would signal resumption of the
fund's aid to Ukraine, which was suspended this spring due to
stalled economic reforms and excessive state spending in the former
Soviet republic.
	   Ukraine is facing a mounting financial crisis because of the
need to repay huge domestic and foreign debts and a downfall in
budget revenues, and so is desperate for the IMF loan. The
government says the release of the loan would also help attract
foreign investors.
	   One obstacle might be created by parliament, dominated by
Communists and other leftists. The new Verkhovna Rada, elected late
in March, has yet to approve the revised 1998 budget draft, which
slashes spending in accordance with IMF conditions for the release
of the loan.
	   Kuchma has repeatedly called on parliament to do so, and he
reiterated his call on Saturday during a visit to renovation sites
in the capital Kiev, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kuchma also said the World Bank, which has suspended cooperation
with the former Soviet republic in line with the IMF, has promised
to release more than dlrs 1 billion in credits following ``the very
first telephone call from the IMF'' on loan approval.
	   ``These credits are exactly those are necessary for us,'' Kuchma
said.

Jordan Press Association rejects the new law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Jordan Press Association rejected the
government's proposed amendment to the press laws Saturday, saying
such legislation would ``destroy'' press freedom.
	   In a statement issued after a meeting of its executive council,
the association, which represents all Jordanian journalists, said
the amendment contradicted article 15 of the constitution, which
guarantees press freedom.
	   ``The government's reasons for issuing the law are very weak and
not logical. It restricts freedoms instead of develop them. A
reading of the text reveals that the government aims to dominate
the press and deprive it of independence,'' the statement said.
	   The association appealed to the national assembly to reject the
amendment as it would ``destroy press and public freedom in
Jordan,'' the statement added.
	   The government says the flexible provisions of the existing
press laws have led to a freewheeling media that has violated the
ethics of professional journalism.
	   Officials say the is aimed at Jordan's 22 weekly tabloids, which
are largely affiliated with hard-line groups opposed to King
Hussein's pro-Western style and the 1994 Jordan-Israel peace
treaty.
	   The amendment would restrict reporting of the armed forces, the
king and other officials. It would also ban reports that are likely
to lead to public demonstrations as well as reports on police
investigations and current trials.
	   Under the law, the state could fine journalists, foreign as well
as local, or suspend their press credentials.
	   In June, legislators said the amendment would restrict press
freedom and referred it to a parliamentary special committee. The
panel is currently holding hearings on the bill.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Suddenly, par is looking pretty good
at the British Open.
	   Howling winds returned to Royal Birkdale Saturday, sending
scores soaring in the third round. Tiger Woods gave back six
strokes to par through 11 holes, while second-round leader Brian
Watts made three bogeys on the front nine but was still a stroke
ahead of the field at even par.
	   English teen-age sensation Justin Rose, who entered the day one
stroke behind Watts, bogeyed the first two holes on a course
proving to be as complete a test of links golf as there is. But,
urged on by the cheers of his countrymen, he steadied himself with
seven straight pars before making another bogey on the 10th hole.
	   By the time the leaders teed off, winds had subsided somewhat.
But that didn't stop scores from rising.
	   When the final group made the turn, no one was under par for the
tournament and birdies were extremely rare. Thomas Bjorn and Jesper
Parnevik moved into contention at 1 over, but the next closer
challenger was Jim Furyk at 3 over.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ He's 4 1/2 years younger than Tiger
Woods, his favorite group is the Spice Girls and he has been
playing golf ever since he could walk.
	   And boy, can Justin Rose play.
	   The English amateur, a scratch golfer at just 14, took a share
of the lead Saturday at his first British Open, a day after
shooting a 4-under 66.
	   That matched the best amateur score ever in the tournament;
Woods also tied it in 1996. It also had Rose talking about turning
pro before his 18th birthday in two weeks.
	   ``I'm being tempted into it at the moment,'' he said. ``I
haven't made my final decision as of yet. I was going to use this
week as a guide. Now I think I could be well tempted.''
	   In spite of dropping three shots over the first 11 holes, he
moved into a share of the lead Saturday when Brian Watts _ the
leader after two rounds _ dropped four shots over the first 11.

Jordan Press Association rejects the new law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS dropped word graf 6, no pickup

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Jordan Press Association rejected the
government's proposed amendment to the press laws Saturday, saying
such legislation would ``destroy'' press freedom.
	   In a statement issued after a meeting of its executive council,
the association, which represents all Jordanian journalists, said
the amendment contradicted article 15 of the constitution, which
guarantees press freedom.
	   ``The government's reasons for issuing the law are very weak and
not logical. It restricts freedoms instead of develop them. A
reading of the text reveals that the government aims to dominate
the press and deprive it of independence,'' the statement said.
	   The association appealed to the national assembly to reject the
amendment as it would ``destroy press and public freedom in
Jordan,'' the statement added.
	   The government says the flexible provisions of the existing
press laws have led to a freewheeling media that has violated the
ethics of professional journalism.
	   Officials say the bill is aimed at Jordan's 22 weekly tabloids,
which are largely affiliated with hard-line groups opposed to King
Hussein's pro-Western style and the 1994 Jordan-Israel peace
treaty.
	   The amendment would restrict reporting of the armed forces, the
king and other officials. It would also ban reports that are likely
to lead to public demonstrations as well as reports on police
investigations and current trials.
	   Under the law, the state could fine journalists, foreign as well
as local, or suspend their press credentials.
	   In June, legislators said the amendment would restrict press
freedom and referred it to a parliamentary special committee. The
panel is currently holding hearings on the bill.

 &UR; Fear stalks South African town as politics turns deadly &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos available
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ One by one the coffins sank slowly
into the parched cemetary earth as 11 supporters of the ruling
African National Congress were laid to rest Saturday.
	   Screaming and weeping, women grasped at the ornate wooden boxes,
as if trying to snatch their loved ones back from the grave. Male
friends and relatives stood silently by as a priest uttered a Zulu
prayer that echoed over the hills.
	   In the past two weeks, 30 people have died in political fighting
in this rural town nestled among rolling green hills in
KwaZulu-Natal province, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) southeast
of Johannesburg.
	   No one knows who is behind the deaths, but political observers
say they could herald a nationwide tide of terror as the country
heads to general elections next year.
	   The latest to die were killed Friday night, when unknown gunmen
attacked a service held for the 11 buried Saturday. One man was
killed in the assault, but the attackers butchered a family of four
as they fled, including a young boy and baby girl.
	   Though recent years have seen a sharp fall in the levels of
political violence, memories in KwaZulu-Natal are still fresh from
a decade of killing in the run-up to 1994 all-race elections that
ended white rule. Then at least 10,000 died in fighting between the
ANC and the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party.
	   Some fear 1999 could see a rebirth of conflict.
	   ``There are maniacs on all sides who are itching to have a go at
each other,'' said Tom Lodge, professor of political science at
Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg.
	   In Richmond, people blame the murders on a feud between the ANC
and a new opposition party, the United Democratic Movement, which
is a focus for disaffected ANC supporters.
	   A central figure is local UDM leader Sifiso Nkabinde, an ex-ANC
member kicked out for allegedly spying for apartheid police.
Violence in Richmond has soared since he returned to the area after
being aquitted in April on charges of killing 16 people.
	   Nkabinde denies involvement, blaming ANC leaders for inflaming
passions by branding him a traitor and claiming they fear his
popularity.
	   ``The ANC must be prepared to swallow their pride and realize
that the only way to solve this is through negotiations,'' he told
The Associated Press. ``They must realize human beings are not just
ANC members.''
	   So far, attempts at talks have failed, but the crisis has
brought top politicians to the area, including President Nelson
Mandela who blamed ``rotten elements'' in the police for inciting
the murders.
	   There have been persistant allegations that the killing is
organized by a
	   shadowy ``third force'' of policemen hankering after apartheid
who want to destabilize the country's first black-led government.
	   To combat this, 240 police from outside the area have been
brought in and several top Richmond officers were transferred
elsewhere.
	   However, Richmond police insist politicians cause the trouble.
They blame a failure to make any arrests on intimidation of
ordinary people by their leaders.
	   ``Witnesses are very reluctant to cooperate with the police due
to the political problems,'' said Superintendent Henry Budhram, a
spokesman for the town's beleaguered police station.
	   Though no proof of police collaboration has been produced in
Richmond, apartheid-era security forces did supply Inkatha with
weapons in the 1980s when it fought the ANC.
	   Lodge believes ``agent provocateurs'' may still play a role, but
blamed fighting over political power as the root cause.
	   ``In some areas politics is fought at the level of territory,
not ideas,'' he said.
	   Lodge's academic theory becomes concrete fact on the dusty
streets of Richmond and its surrounding townships.
	   Driving an armored police van down Magoda Road in the shantytown
of Ndaleni, Sgt. Sibusiso Zondi said the ramshackle huts to the
left of the street lie on UDM turf, while shacks on the right are
ANC ground.
	   Though it is mid-day, the usual bustle of township life has
vanished. Houses on the edge of the road are abandoned, their empty
window holes staring blankly out of crumbling walls.
	   ``This is the frontier,'' Zondi says sadly. ``All the people on
the side of the road just left as soon fighting started.''
	   For Richmond's citizens, the violence dominates their lives.
	   Juggy Parshotam has closed the doors of his Bhavic Tavern since
July 3, when gunmen burst in and slaughtered eight people watching
a World Cup soccer match.
	   The blood stains are gone, but bullet holes still scar the
walls. Parshotam says he may never reopen.
	   ``It was terrible, terrible. I had never seen anything like that
in my life,'' he said. ``People have so much fear they don't even
walk at night.''

Anti-riot policemen prepare for trouble in Lagos

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Hundreds of anti-riot policemen were
braced for possible violence Saturday as the family of the
opposition leader Moshood Abiola held a day of prayer services at
the family's Lagos estate and business offices.
	   Policemen armed with automatic weapons and teargas patrolled on
foot and in armored vehicles throughout Nigeria's commercial
capital of Lagos, including a race track where Abiola's family had
initially planned to hold the services.
	   Police helicopters hovered low overhead although there was no
sign of the rioting that surged for several days after Abiola's
death July 7, killing dozens of people and leaving many homes and
vehicles destroyed.
	   Large numbers of demonstrators, including more than 30 teens and
pre-teens, were arrested during the rioting which subsided last
week.
	   As Saturday's religious ceremonies went ahead, many streets in
Lagos were filled with people going about their usual weekend
business although the city's public markets remained closed in
honor of Abiola.
	   The venue for the prayers had been changed Friday after police
forbade use of the track, fearing an upsurge of violence by large
crowds of grieving supporters.
	   Other security forces patrolled outside the family's palatial
home and business offices where the prayers were held. More than
5,000 people, including a group of Muslim and Christian religious
leaders and pro-democracy activists, attended the largest of the
two ceremonies at the family's business offices _ formerly used as
a political campaign headquarters by Abiola _ in the city.
	   Muslim cleric Jamiu Ekunga, who led the ceremonies, paid tribute
to Abiola as a ``martyr of democracy'' whose death had highlighted
the pro-democracy cause to all ``Africans at home and in
diaspora.''
	   Many Muslims traditionally hold prayers seven days after someone
is buried.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993's annulled presidential
elections, was imprisoned in 1994 after declaring himself
president.

Schnyder breezes, Schett battles into Palermo final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ Top seed Patty Schnyder breezed into the
final of the WTA Palermo Grand Prix Saturday with a 6-3, 6-1 win
over Miriam Oremans.
	   Schnyder, who has dropped just one set all week at the dlrs
107,500 clay court event, needed 58 minutes to oust Oremans, the
sixth seed.
	   Sunday's final pits Schnyder against No. 4 seed Barbara Schett.
The Austrian advanced Saturday by outlasting Barbara Rittner, 4-6,
6-4, 6-4, in the other semifinal.
	   A victory over Schett would give Schnyder a tour-high five
season titles. The Swiss 19-year-old, currently ranked 11th in the
world, had never won a WTA tourney before 1998.

Tour de France tries to recover from doping scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FOR AMs, wraps up day's events
 &UR; BY SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Oress Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CORREZE, France (AP) - The Tour de France tried to recover from
a doping scandal that has three members of a cycling team under
police investigation, the top team kicked out of the race and the
rest of the world examining the sport.
	   The drug scandal that started last week has sent shock waves
through cycling, sport and France.
	   Jan Ullrich attempted to return the Tour to normalcy by
regaining the leader's yellow jersey on Saturday and looks in good
shape to hold it the rest of the way.
	   Ullrich won the 58-kilometer (36-mile) time trial by more than a
minute over a pair of Americans, Tyler Hamilton and Bobby Julich.
	   Jacques Chirac, the French president, was at the finish to
congratulate Ullrich, who was timed in 1 hour, 15 minutes, 25
seconds for the distance.
	   Overall Ullrich leads by a minute 18 seconds over Bo Hamburger
of Denmark. Julich, who races for the French team Cofidis, is third
in the same time as Hamburger.
	   Yet Ullrich's victory was overshadowed by the events that took
the runner-up from last year.
	   The riders of the Festina team, led by its star Richard
Virenque, withdrew from the race Saturday at the request of the
Tour de France.
	   ``It's better we stop the Tour now,'' Virenque said. ``From a
judicial point of view, we could participate but we decided not to
continue.''
	   ``I don't know what the Tour will do without Festina. Festina
has given a lot to the Tour. And today we are excluded for the
image of the race, not for any positive controls,'' Virenque said.
	   Tour officials decided to throw the top-ranked team out of the
three week race Friday after after the director of the team, Bruno
Roussel, admitted a practice of supplying illegal drugs with
medical supervision to improve performances.
	   Roussel, team doctor Erik Ryckaert and team masseur Wily Voet
were under police custody in Lille after Voet was jailed July 9
after customs officials found a stash of performance-enhacing drugs
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were placed under
investigation for importing prohibited substances and other counts.
	   Chirac, who celebrated with France's World Cup champions less
than a week ago, was affected by the doping scandal.
	   Chirac called for the ``eradication of (doping) networks'' and
that those who are behind them should be punished.
	   ``We don't have the right to play with the health of young
sportsmen who get caught up in doping,'' he said. ``Doping is above
all dishonesty. It is cheating and as such must be condemned and
punished in the strongest way.''
	   After Roussel admitted he was supplying drugs to the team, the
Tour decided to throw the team out, although none had failed a drug
test.
	   ``The Tour is great, it's the best. And we will be here next
year,'' Virenque said before breaking into tears and leaving.
	   Virenque was the only rider within 10 minutes of Ullrich at the
end of last year's Tour and was the best climber. Marco Pantani of
Italy was third, more than 14 minutes behind and is currently more
than 5 minutes behind, losing more than four minutes in the time
trial.
	   For a change, it was a pair of Americans chasing Ullrich at the
time trial.
	   ``It's a dream. It's geat for American cycling,'' Julich said.
``It's about time.''
	   After the retirement of three-time Tour winner Greg LeMond and
the Lance Armstrong recovering from cancer after winning the 1993
world title and two Tour stages, U.S. cycling needed a boost.
	   It also came from Hamilton, who was battling stomach problems
the first week.

out,'' Hamilton said.

Tour de France tries to recover from doping scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FOR AMs, wraps up day's events
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix typos &HT;    

<TEXT>
	    &UR; BY SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   CORREZE, France (AP) - The Tour de France tried to recover from
a doping scandal that has three members of a cycling team under
police investigation, the top team kicked out of the race and the
rest of the world examining the sport.
	   The drug scandal that started last week has sent shock waves
through cycling, sport and France.
	   Jan Ullrich attempted to return the Tour to normalcy by
regaining the leader's yellow jersey on Saturday and looks in good
shape to hold it the rest of the way.
	   Ullrich won the 58-kilometer (36-mile) time trial by more than a
minute over a pair of Americans, Tyler Hamilton and Bobby Julich.
	   Jacques Chirac, the French president, was at the finish to
congratulate Ullrich, who was timed in 1 hour, 15 minutes, 25
seconds for the distance.
	   Overall Ullrich leads by a minute 18 seconds over Bo Hamburger
of Denmark. Julich, who races for the French team Cofidis, is third
in the same time as Hamburger.
	   Yet Ullrich's victory was overshadowed by the events that took
the runner-up from last year.
	   The riders of the Festina team, led by its star Richard
Virenque, . ``From a judicial point of view, we could participate
but we decided not to continue.''
	   ``I don't know what the Tour will do without Festina. Festina
has given a lot to the Tour. And today we are excluded for the
image of the race, not for any positive controls,'' Virenque said.
	   Tour officials decided to throw the top-ranked team out of the
three week race Friday after after the director of the team, Bruno
Roussel, admitted a practice of supplying illegal drugs with
medical supervision to improve performances.
	   Roussel, team doctor Erik Ryckaert and team masseur Wily Voet
were under police custody in Lille after Voet was jailed July 9
after customs officials found a stash of performance-enhacing drugs
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were placed under inve for
importing prohibited substances and other counts.
	   Chirac, who celebrated with France's World Cup champions less
than a week ago, was affected by the doping scandal.
	   Chirac called for the ``eradication of (doping) networks'' and
that those who are behind them should be punished.
	   ``We don't have the right to play with the health of young
sportsmen who get caught up in doping,'' he said. ``Doping is above
all dishonesty. It is cheating and as such must be condemned and
punished in the strongest way.''
	   After Roussel admitted he was supplying drugs to the team, the
Tour decided to throw the team out, although none had failed a drug
test.
	   ``The Tour is great, it's the best. And we will be here next
year,'' Virenque said before breaking into tears and leavingyear's
Tour and was the best climber. Marco Pantani of Italy was third,
more than 14 minutes behind and is currently more than 5 minutes
behind, losing more than four minutes in the time trial.
	   For a change, it was a pair of Americans chasing Ullrich at the
time trial.
	   ``It's a dream. It's geat for American cycling,'' Julich said.
``It's about time.''
	   After the retirement of three-time Tour winner Greg LeMond and
the Lance Armstrong recovering from cancer after winning the 1993
world title and two Tour stages, U.S. cycling needed a boost.
	   It also came from Hamilton, who was battling stomach problems
the first week.
	   ``I felt strong. I just rode steady the whole way and it worked
out,'' Hamilton said.
	   He was 69th in the Tour last year as the entire U.S. Postal team
finished the race.
	   Hamilton, who rides for the U.S. Postal team, is now fifth
overall, 1:30 behind just after Laurent Jalabert of France, 1:24
back of Ullrich.

Jordan says King Hussein is recovering from fever in US clinic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's King Hussein is recovering well
from the fever for which he was admitted to a U.S. hospital, his
private physician said Saturday.
	   ``King Hussein now enjoys good health,'' Gen. Samir Faraj said
in a statement broadcast on Jordanian television.
	   The king left Jordan on Tuesday for the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., telling the state-run television he had been
suffering from spells of high fever three times a day.
	   ``He is still under observation and the doctors have been able
to control the fever,'' Faraj said.
	   Jordanian doctors said early this week they thought the king's
illness was a recurrence of a bout of bacteria that attacked his
lymphatic glands in October.
	   Last year Hussein, 62, suffered fever, fatigue and weight loss.
He recovered with treatment proscribed after tests at the Mayo
Clinic.
	   The king underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney in the same hospital in 1992.

US on sidelines as treaty on war crimes tribunal signed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: adds that treaty remains open for signatures until year 2000 &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Saturday hailed
a treaty creating the world's first international war crimes
tribunal as a ``giant step forward'' and appealed to a reluctant
United States to join the pact.
	   Annan spoke at a signing ceremony for the historic treaty, which
won overwhelming approval Friday night after nearly five weeks of
talks and years of preliminary negotiations.
	   ``It's a great hope and a giant step forward in the rule of law
that a few years ago nobody would have thought possible,'' Annan
said.
	   The new court will be a permanent tribunal for what the treaty
calls ``the most serious crimes of international concern'':
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression.
	   The idea was born half a century ago with the Nuremberg
tribunals that tried Nazi war criminals. It languished during the
Cold War, then was reborn with the ad hoc tribunals set up a few
years ago for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
	   Ironically, the United States _ a moving force behind these
earlier tribunals _ fought hard to limit the reach of the new
court.
	   Failing to curb the court to its satisfaction, the United States
was one of only seven nations voting against the treaty; 120
countries, including most of America's best allies, voted for it.
	   Humanitarian and human rights groups lobbied hard for the court
and they praised the final treaty, although many had hoped for even
broader jurisdiction.
	   ``No doubt many of us would have liked a court vested with even
more powers,'' Annan acknowledged. ``But we must not minimize the
breakthrough of this achievement.''
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday urged
governments to ratify the treaty. It goes into effect once 60 have
ratified it.
	   ``The road ahead of us is still long and war criminals must be
swiftly and relentlessly prosecuted so that the law has a deterrent
effect for the benefit of all those whom they would otherwise
massacre, loot, rape and torture,'' it said.
	   Among the first to sign the treaty at Saturday's ceremony was
France. The United States delegation did not attend the ceremony.
	   Like the United States, France went into the talks seeking to
protect its troops abroad from politically motivated prosecutions
and at first it seemed France would be a powerful ally for the U.S.
in its bid to limit the court.
	   But France, unlike the United States, ended up happy with the
numerous safeguards built into the pact.
	   U.S. negotiators wanted more than safeguards; they wanted a
loophole for Americans. Despite weeks of hardball diplomacy, they
failed to persuade others that the Pol Pots of the world wouldn't
use the loophole, too.
	   The question now is what the United States will do. It has
repeatedly warned that the court would have a tough time without
U.S. money and muscle and some fear it will try and discourage
countries from ratifying the treaty.
	   ``I hope the U.S. and other countries will come aboard,'' Annan
said. ``I hope the U.S. position is not final. I regret we couldn't
bridge all the differences.''
	   Some nations signed the treaty at Saturday's ceremony, others
will sign later. The treaty remains open for signature until the
year 2000.

St. Kitts and Nevis plans first hanging in 13 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAWUD BYRON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ The Caribbean nation of
St. Kitts and Nevis plans to hang a convicted murderer on Monday,
joining a regional backlash against international pressure to ban
the death penalty.
	   The hanging of David Wilson, 28, for the 1994 murder of a hotel
night watchman will be the twin-island country's first execution in
13 years. Officials confirmed Saturday that Governor-General
Cuthbert Sebastian had signed the required execution notice.
	   St. Kitts and Nevis, along with other former British colonies,
has come under increasing pressure from British courts and human
rights groups to stop executions.
	   Caribbean nations say the death penalty is needed as a deterrent
to crime caused by drug traffic through the region.
	   Many are now rebelling by putting deadlines on convicts' appeals
to international tribunals and creating a local replacement for the
British Privy Council, the supreme court for most former colonies.
	   Wilson and another man, Clement Thomas, were convicted in 1996
of beating night watchman Kenneth Herbert to death at Ottley's
Plantation Inn on St. Kitts. Police said they fled with the inn's
safe.
	   The last execution in St. Kitts was in 1985, when officials
hanged Simeon Ible for the murder of a pregnant woman.
	   Trinidad and Tobago, which along with Jamaica and Guyana has led
the drive to break with the Privy Council, was to have hanged a
murderer on Tuesday. Last-minute court motions postponed the
execution.
	   Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Jamaica hope to open
the first regional supreme court next year.

Body discovered in sea to be identified within two days, say Irish
</HEADLINE>
police

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish police said Saturday that the body
of a man found in the sea off the southwest coast of Wales will be
identified within the next two days.
	   A French trawler, Anyvidig, discovered the body 30 miles
southwest of Milford Haven port on Friday and landed it later in
Dunmore East in southeast Ireland. Media reports have speculated
whether the body is that of veteran French yachtsman Eric Tabarly,
66, who was declared dead June 14 after falling overboard near
southwest Wales.
	   Police said that the remains were in bad condition, but contact
had been made with French authorities in an attempt to identify the
body through dental records.
	   In Dublin, a police spokesman said reports that the body was
Tabarly's were ``speculation.''
	   ``The body has not been formerly identified yet,'' the
spokesman, speaking on terms of customary anonymity, said.
	   Tabarly became internationally famous after a series of
victories in lone ocean racing events in the 1960s and 1970s. Born
in Nantes, he became a naval officer before making his name as a
yachtsman.

Saturday under a large rock in a remote area of the Pyrenees

Ultra-Orthodox Jews clash with police over opening of restaurant on
</HEADLINE>
Sabbath &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews clashed with
police Saturday in downtown Jerusalem, angered by the opening of a
new restaurant doing business on the Sabbath.
	   The demonstrators, who want places of entertainment and business
closed on the Jewish day of rest, shouted ``Shabbes'' (Sabbath),
overturned trash cans and threw stones at police, slightly injuring
a policeman in the face. Some of the demonstrators called the
police ``Nazis.''
	   The crowd of about 200 briefly blocked the street surrounding
the non _ kosher French restaurant but was driven back by police.
Five demonstrators were arrested as they were hurling rocks off a
nearby rooftop, police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   The restaurant is located in a secular part of town, but borders
several ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods.
	   The Jewish Sabbath lasts from sundown Friday to sundown
Saturday. Orthodox Jews, who account for about 30 percent of
Jerusalem's Jewish population, consider doing business on the
Sabbath a desecration of the day of rest.
	   All kosher restaurants and a great majority of non _ kosher
restaurants in Jerusalem are closed on the Sabbath.

Kiriyenko raises import duties to raise cash

alcohol decree. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Frustrated by parliamentary resistance, Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko ordered higher import taxes Saturday in
an effort to raise new revenue and win Russia a hefty new
International Monetary Fund loan.
	   ``Unfortunately, the parliament didn't pass all the necessary
measures,'' Kiriyenko said on a visit to the city of Oryol, south
of Moscow. ``That means that we'll have to solve some of our
problems ... by decree.''
	   The State Duma, parliament's lower house, recessed for the
summer Friday without passing several key elements of the
government's economic plan. The IMF has said they will not release
the new loan money until a complete austerity plan is in place,
especially new taxes.
	   Kiriyenko ordered a 3 percent increase in all import duties,
which the government estimates will bring in another billion rubles
(dlrs 160 million).
	   ``This is a harsh measure which will entail a rise in prices for
imported goods,'' Kiriyenko said. ``But the government has been
forced to take it to increase state revenues.''
	   Raising import duties was one of the measures in the
government's crisis management program that the IMF and other
lenders wanted implemented before they start delivering dlrs 17.1
billion in new loans to Russia.
	   In addition, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree Saturday to
consolidate the government's holdings and control over the alcohol
industry, whose taxes make a significant contribution to the
federal budget.
	   Kiriyenko met with Yeltsin on Saturday to bring the president up
to date on the government's austerity program before Yeltsin headed
off on his summer vacation.
	   The Duma did pass some of the government's bills, including a
key measure introducing an additional 5 percent sales tax, which
was approved on Thursday. But the lawmakers rejected an income tax
bill and a measure that would cut various social welfare payments
for this year.
	   Communists and other hard-liners dominate the Duma and have
balked at the government's spending cuts, saying they would further
worsen the nation's social woes.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Friday the house might hold
an emergency session next month to reconsider some of the
government's proposals.
	   Kiriyenko, who was named prime minister in a government shakeup
in March, said Saturday that more new Cabinet appointments may be
imminent, but he gave no details, according to the Interfax news
agency.

Polish parliament approves province consolidation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The lower house of parliament approved
legislation Saturday to consolidate Poland's 49 provinces into 16
new ones as part of an administrative reform.
	   The Sejm voted 326-45 for the measure, one of many in a package
of legislation aimed at doing away with the communist-era
administration and shifting power to local governments.
	   The decentralization, which would take effect Jan. 1, has broad
support. But the number of provinces proved a sticking point.
	   An initial government plan for 12 new provinces drew protests
from residents of cities that would lose their status as provincial
capitals. President Aleksander Kwasniewski vetoed another version
proposing 15 provinces, saying that it contradicted the wishes of
local communities.
	   The Solidarity-led coalition and the opposition agreed on 16
provinces as a compromise during the past week. Kwasniewski has
said he would respect the compromise.

Tendulkar hits 125 to lead team to victory despite Chanderpaul's
</HEADLINE>
unbeaten 127 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sachin Tendulkar struck 125 runs off 114 balls
against a high-quality bowling attack Saturday to guide a Rest of
the World team to a six-wicket triumph over the MCC in an all-star
game.
	   In match at Lord's to commemorate the 150-year anniversary of
the birth of cricket great W.G. Grace and also raise money for the
Princess Diana memoral fund, the Indian batting star hit 15 fours
and four sixes as his team easily passed the MCC's total of 261 for
four with 6 1/2 overs to spare.
	   West Indian lefthander Shivnarine Chanderpaul top-scored in the
match with an unbeaten 127 for the MCC and shared a third wicket
stand of 147 with India's Mohammed Azharuddin who contributed 61.
	   After the MCC's Javagal Srinath and Allan Donald had removed
Sanath Jayasuriya and Saeed Anwar to restrict Tendulkar's team to
54 for two, the little Indian star teamed up with Sri Lanka's
Aravinda de Silva in a third wicket stand of 177 to turn the match
his team's way.
	   Tendulkar hit Pakistani slow left-armer Aamir Sohail for three
sixes before he was bowled by Indian test colleague Anil Kumble
with his team on 231. De Silva hit 82 before Australian paceman
Glenn McGrath caught him off his own bowling.

Bjorkman and Kulti carry Sweden to 2-1 lead against Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti
Saturday won a hard-fought doubles match that lifted Sweden's
defending champions to a 2-1 lead against Germany in their Davis
Cup tie.
	   Bjorkman and Kulti, 6-0 in Davis Cup play the past two years,
had to fight a boisterous German crowd and beat back several
challenges before edging Boris Becker and David Prinosil, 4-6, 7-6
(7-5), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
	   ``This was a very important win, because now the pressure is on
the Germans,'' said Kulti. ``It was a hard match for us, which I
expected.''
	   The Swedes rallied to win both tie breaks and fended off
numerous break chances from the Germans, mostly against Kulti's
serve in the quarterfinal matchup.
	   Becker and Prinosil had 10 break chances, but converted only
two.
	   ``We had our chances, but we didn't use them,'' said Becker.
	   Bjorkman, the world's fourth-ranked doubles player, started
slowly, but began to dominate the match with crisp volleys and
strong returns.
	   The Swedes finally gained the decisive break at 5-4 in the final
set, then clinched the match in three hours, four minutes when
Prinosil's volley missed.
	   ``I wasn't sure we would win til the last, because you don't
what will happen with Boris Becker _ he's a fantastic player,''
said Swedish captain Carl-Axel Hageskog.
	   But Becker, who led Germany to Davis Cup titles in 1988 and
1989, hit three double faults in the tie breaks as his team let 4-3
leads slip away.
	   Germany sends their inexperienced duo of Tommy Haas and Nicolas
Kiefer in Sunday's reverse singles against Sweden, looking for its
seventh title.
	   Haas, ranked 39th, had stunned world No. 9 Bjorkman in straight
sets Friday as Germany took a 1-0 lead. But Enqvist gained the
split by also downing Kiefer in three sets.
	   Haas is now 3-0 in Davis Cup singles and was unbeaten when
Germany won the World Team Cup early this year.
	   ``If I always played like I play in team competition, I would
long ago have made the Top 10,'' said Haas.
	   Bjorkman and Kiefer were unbeaten in Davis Cup play last year as
Sweden won the title, humiliating the United States 5-0 in the
final.

EU holds first talks with Iran since last year's suspension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with meeting's end, CHANGES
overline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The first talks in more than a year between
the European Union and Iran ended Saturday with both sides
declining to comment on how they went.
	   An 11-person EU delegation, led by the secretary-general of the
Austrian Foreign Ministry, Albert Rohan, met for two hours with an
Iranian team at the Foreign Ministry.
	   It was the first high-level talks between the two sides since
the EU suspended its dialogue with Tehran in April 1997, when a
German court accused Iranian leaders of involvement in the
assassination of four dissidents in Berlin in 1992.
	   The EU team, which included senior diplomats from Britain and
Germany as well as Austria, representing the past, future and
present holders of the union's rotating presidency, was scheduled
to meet again with the Iranians on Sunday.
	   At the start of the talks, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Morteza Sarmadi called for a fresh beginning to remove the ``misuse
of the negotiations by certain EU officials to pressure Iran,''
Iranian television reported.
	   ``Previous talks were biased and directed in a way that only
European interests were taken into consideration,'' the broadcast
quoted Sarmadi as saying.
	   The two sides were expected to discuss economic cooperation,
drug trafficking and ways to resolve regional conflicts in
Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Caspian Sea region, the Gulf and the
Balkans.
	   But the EU officials reportedly intend to raise touchier topics
such as Iran's perceived support for terrorism, its record on human
rights, and its attempts to acquire nuclear weapons.
	   An Iranian newspaper said Tehran expected the talks to go beyond
such matters.
	   ``If they want to clean the slate for bilateral ties, they have
to abandon rhetoric on human rights, development of nuclear weapons
and terrorism,'' the Tehran Times said.
	   The EU indicated that it was keen to normalize ties following
the May 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate
cleric who has been trying to temper Iran's hard-line foreign and
domestic policies.
	   Part of the EU drive for better relations is due to the
commercial prospects of Iran's oil and gas resources. U.S.
companies are banned from investing in Iran by sanctions imposed by
Washington.
	   EU companies received a boost last month when U.S. President
Bill Clinton vetoed a bill that sought to punish any country that
invested more than dlrs 20 million annually in Iran's oil and gas
sectors.
	   Earlier this month, Iran whetted European business appetites
further by seeking financial backing for oil ventures worth a
whopping dlrs 8 billion.
	   One stumbling point to improved EU-Iran relations is Tehran's
1989 death sentence against the British author, Salman Rushdie.
	   The Iranians refuse to rescind the death sentence imposed for
what they regard as blasphemy in Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic
Verses.''

Jordan says King Hussein is recovering from fever in US clinic

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's King Hussein is recovering well
from the fever for which he was admitted to a U.S. hospital, his
private physician said Saturday.
	   ``King Hussein now enjoys good health,'' Gen. Samir Faraj said
in a statement broadcast on Jordanian television.
	   The king left Jordan on Tuesday for the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota, telling the state-run television he had been
suffering from spells of high fever three times a day.
	   ``He is still under observation and the doctors have been able
to control the fever,'' Faraj said.
	   Jordanian doctors said early this week they thought the king's
illness was a recurrence of a bout of bacteria that attacked his
lymphatic glands in October.
	   Last year Hussein, 62, suffered fever, fatigue and weight loss.
He recovered with treatment prescribed after tests at the Mayo
Clinic.
	   The king underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney in the same hospital in 1992.

Australia beats England by 35 runs to clinch series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOVE, England (AP) _ Australia's women clinched a one-day series
triumph over England Saturday when a 35-run victory at Hove earned
the visitor a 3-0 overall lead with two matches to play.
	   A third-wicket partnership of 119 between Joanne Broadbent, who
scored 70, and Karen Rolton (67), was the main feature of
Australia's 237 for four although Melanie Jones and Bronwyn Calver
then hit 55 off 31 balls.
	   Although 18-year-old Charlotte Edwards hit 74 in England's
reply, the home team managed only 202 for nine before the overs ran
out.
	   The two teams play again at Southampton Sunday and complete the
series at Lord's, the home of cricket, on Tuesday.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ He's 4 1/2 years younger than Tiger
Woods, his favorite group is the Spice Girls and he has been
playing golf ever since he could walk.
	   And boy, can Justin Rose play.
	   The English amateur, a scratch golfer at just 14, had a share of
the lead for a while Saturday at his first British Open. But he
finished the third round at 3 over, three strokes behind leader
Brian Watts.
	   Rose's 4-under 66 on Friday matched the best amateur score ever
in the tournament. And his performance had him talking about
turning pro before his 18th birthday in two weeks.
	   ``I'm being tempted into it at the moment,'' he said. ``I
haven't made my final decision as of yet. I was going to use this
week as a guide. Now I think I could be well tempted.''

Donatella Versace makes the Cut in Haute Couture Opening
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - As haute couture winter 98-99 shows began Saturday,
Donatella Versace rated a big round of applause for her debut as
chief designer, following in brother Gianni Versace's footsteps.
	   The famed designer for stars like Madonna, Liz Hurley and others
was murdered a year ago outside his Miami home. The big question
was who could keep up the energy.
	   But his younger sister, who worked with her brother since she
was a teen-ager, has imbibed his messages of provocative,
outrageous fashions, and innovative techniques, as well.
	   Showing at the Ritz just like her brother, Donatella was
applauded by her other brother, Santo - always the business manager
but looking almost spookily more like his brother than ever.
	   Sex and glitz were always big selling points for the house, and
Donatella with the workshop have mastered the finer points of
just-tight-enough dresses and short suits in shiny, or
tweedy-feathery new fabrics that got cat-calls throughout the show.
	   Always form-fitting, and then some, the clingy little suits
looked great on Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and other beauties. Some
dresses were strapless with standout tops or hems.
	   Fabrics were the latest, with ostrich feathers stuffed into
nubbly white tweeds, many effects with copper threads that almost
translated into cotton-candy weaves, and shimmery mermaid looks.
	   The message was ``modern'' with synthesized electronic music by
Frederic Sanchez, and the moment was never boring.
	   Especially when you saw a model sashaying out in a red
satiny-synthetic micro-mini with matching boots and spurts of
feathers here and there.
	   The strange silhouette of tiny elastic skirt or nearly-bare
derriere behind a beautiful long apron-front in an evening dress is
witty, one must admit. But at least you won't rumple the back skirt
in these oddities.
	   Knock 'em dead evening sheaths included the rhinestone maidens,
all a-glitter with occasional ``holes'' here and there, or
geometric effects to look like computer pixels.
	   Come-hither mermaid looks, wrapped chiffon sheaths with wiry
embroidery, sizzling hot tops and pants gave it all that
incomparable Versace pizazz.
	   ``Loved it,'' said Dolores Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie
Chaplin, with her sister Ema. ``We like that sexy thing,'' said
Ema. Both sisters, lean and tall as models, looked right for the
part of Versace slinks.
	   Another haute couture debut was for Ocimar Versolato's own
house.
	   It was suave mambo music from Versolato's native Brazil for this
talented 37-year old, whose models moved through the sunny
courtyard of his new premises on the Place Vendome.
	   From a boxy white wool crepe jacket with mirror-embroidered
straight skirt to the knee, through the soft long gray evening
gowns with jet-like mirror sequins around the generous cut-outs
over body-stockings, or beautifully draped dresses with bare backs,
the clothes were clean, clever and modern.
	   ``I enjoyed wearing them very much,'' said blond New York model
Maggie Rizer after the show.
	   The subtle and very beautiful clothes also included great bias
cutting, touches of plexiglass over light taffeta, white quilted
chiffon, an occasional Japanese reference in an obi-style inset
belt or a ribbon effect down the back.
	   With all these details and much more, it was a show of
deliciously light new fabrics from taffeta, to silks woven or
embroidered with paper, and icy winter shades of silvery white,
gray, and touches of deep ruby or ebony iridescence in taffetas.
	   It all looked new, modern and yet quite romantic.Versolato has
shown his own ready-to-wear here with middling effects, and a
year-long stint with Lanvin was not a success.
	   This first-time haute couture show and Versolato's company is
now sponsored by a chic compatriot from Brazil, Anna Luisa de
Queiroz, who said ``I am thrilled that he's expressing his real
talent.''
	   Versolato beamed as well. ``I'm looking toward the future,'' he
said, ``since couture needs to look ahead now. I made no conscious
references to the past.''

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Exchanging diamond-studded
gold rings and a lingering kiss, President Nelson Mandela capped
his 80th birthday Saturday by marrying Graca Machel, the widow of a
Mozambican president and black liberation leader.
	   Just hours after the president's press aides denied the marriage
would happen _ saying Mandela would quietly celebrate his birthday
at home _ Mandela wed Machel.
	   ``It was a very beautiful ceremony,'' said Mandela's spokeswoman
Priscilla Naidoo.
	   Relatives and close friends, including fellow Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Desmond Tutu, were present as the couple were wed by
Methodist Bishop Mvuve Dandala.
	   The wedding unites a towering figure _ a man widely respected
for emerging with a spirit of forgiveness from 27 years'
imprisonment for fighting apartheids _ with a woman who has gained
respect for her work on children's issues for the United Nations.
Machel, 56, is the widow of Mozambique President Samora Machel who
died in a 1986 plane crash.
	   But far from a political marriage, it is obviously one of true
love. The years seem to melt from Mandela's creased face and his
eyes light up as he describes the relationship.
	   ``Late in my life, I am blooming like a flower because of the
love and support she has given me,'' Mandela told a television
interviewer this year.
	   Machel, whose cherubic face glows with contentment when at
Mandela's side, was wed in a cream-and-gold long skirt with
matching top. Mandela wore a black-and-gold sport shirt, Naidoo
said.
	   Mandela was reportedly sending a small herd of cattle to
Machel's family in Mozambique in traditional African bride payment.
	   Mirroring a spirit of multi-cultural diversity Mandela has
fostered in South Africa, the Jewish, Hindu and Muslim communities
also gave their blessings to the marriage.
	   Tutu, a retired Anglican archbishop who had chided Mandela for
setting a bad example for the nation's youth by carrying on a
relationship with Machel outside marriage, helped officiate. A
magistrate was also present.
	   As word of the marriage spread, a crowd of blacks and whites
gathered outside Mandela's home in a quiet, leafy Johannesburg
suburb, hoping for a glimpse of the newlyweds.
	   Mike Sterne, a white chemical engineer, had brought his three
sons to mark Mandela's birthday, not knowing _ like the rest of
South Africa _ that he was being married inside.
	   ``He's a figure of history _ it's something they'll remember all
their lives,'' Sterne said.
	   A dozen black women sang ``Viva Mandela'' and danced a shuffle
on the sidewalk. One declared: ``It's a big day. It's wonderful!''
	   The celebration would have been much bigger if South Africans
had only known beforehand.
	   A Mandela spokesman admitted an elaborate scheme was set up to
throw the press off track. Journalists had staked out Mandela's
home in the morning. But in the afternoon, a message on pagers
journalists commonly carry said Deputy President Thabo Mbeki would
announce a development ``of national importance'' in Pretoria, 65
kilometers (40 miles away) at 3 p.m.
	   About the time reporters hopped into cars and zoomed toward the
capital, the wedding began. The press conference was then
rescheduled for 4:30, when Mbeki _ who attended the wedding _ drove
to Pretoria and announced it had occurred.
	   ``We wanted to keep the wedding private and as quiet as
possible, so that's why we did it,'' spokesman Parks Mankahlana
said in a telephone interview.
	   Mankahlana didn't seem concerned the action may damage Mandela's
press office's credibility, saying: ``Those who don't want to
believe me in the future can do so.''
	   The marriage is the third for Mandela and the second for Machel.
	   Machel had expressed reluctance to complicate her relationship
with Mandela by marrying him. For some time, Mandela has said she
should be treated as a first lady during foreign state visits.
	   The couple met in 1990, shortly after Mandela was released from
prison.
	   Mandela divorced his second wife, Winnie, in 1996 on grounds she
had been unfaithful. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela remains a member of
the ANC's ruling committee but has been at odds with other party
leaders after she publicly criticized the ANC for its policies.
	   Mandela first married in 1944, the marriage to Evelyn ended in
divorce in 1957 after quarrels over his long nights of political
involvement. He had four children from his first marriage. Two of
them died.
	   Mandela and Madikizela-Mandela had two daughters.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to clarify meeting is between high level officials,
 &UR; Palestinians: no renegotiation of U.S. pullback terms

 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ On the eve of the first contact in
months between high level Palestinians and Israelis, the chief
Palestinian negotiator said Saturday his side would go only ``to
listen,'' not to re-negotiate a U.S. pullback plan.
	   The meeting, being held at the urging of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, was to take place Sunday in Tel Aviv between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Yitzhak
Mordechai, the Israeli defense minister.
	   ``Our agenda is to listen to what Mr. Mordechai tells us, and
the Palestinian delegation has been told that it is unacceptable to
renegotiate the U.S. initiative,'' said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, referring to an American initiative for an
Israeli pullback from the West Bank.
	   ``We just don't want to be blamed for not going, and that's why
we're going,'' he said. ``Albright told us that the Israelis have
ideas.''
	   The United States has urged the sides to hold two or three
meetings within a week to try to resolve their differences over the
Israeli troop withdrawal and procedures for amending the
Palestinian national covenant.
	   The United States has proposed, as part of a broader peace
initiative, that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that the PLO Executive Committee annul parts of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``The U.S. initiative is made up of American ideas. It is void
of any Palestinian ideas,'' said Erekat. ``The Palestinians will
not accept that the initiative's separate elements be revisited.''
	   ``The meeting tomorrow will be to tell the Israelis that we will
not back down one inch from the least of the minimum that we
accepted in the U.S. initiative,'' said Palestinian Planning
Minister Nabil Shaath.
	   ``If the Israelis don't accept the U.S. initiative tomorrow, we
will go to our American friends with a very clear message: `We have
accepted the minimum, the minimum is not attainable _ you take the
next step,''' Shaath said.
	   Erekat said that a top Palestinian security official would
attend the meeting between Abbas and Mordechai.
	   The Israeli media speculated that Mordechai planned to suggest
setting up joint Palestinian-Israeli committees to discuss
redeployment, the PLO charter and security issues. The committees
would conclude their work within a week.
	   Meanwhile, in the tense West Bank town of Hebron, Palestinians
clashed Saturday with Israeli soldiers. Two Palestinian youths were
detained after throwing rocks at Jewish settlers, Israeli police
said.
	   Israeli media reports said the head of Israel's opposition Labor
Party, Ehud Barak, had urged the Palestinians at a meeting on
Friday to go into Sunday's session with an open mind. Barak met
with Abbas and two other top Palestinian officials.
	   ``We explained that Israel must accept the American initiative
if we are to get out of the current crisis,'' said Palestinian
official Hasan Asfour, who attended the meeting.
	   On Saturday, the Jordanian foreign minister, Jawad Anani, met
with Arafat in Ramallah to review the latest developments in the
peace process ahead of Anani's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.
	   ``The current situation is sensitive and the region will witness
changes on the different tracks,'' said Anani, who also serves as
deputy prime minister. He refused to go into detail, but implied he
was referring to separate talks involving Syria and Lebanon.
	   Palestinian officials, meanwhile, announced that a meeting of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference's committee on
Jerusalem, headed by Morocco's King Hassan II, would be held July
29 in Rabat, Morocco.
	   The foreign ministers of 16 Arab and Islamic countries will
attend, and Arafat will represent the Palestinians, according to
Shaath.
	   Shaath said the impetus for that meeting including stepped-up
Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes, Jewish settlement
activity in and around Jerusalem, and the government's recent move
to expand Jerusalem municipal services to outlying areas.
	   Shaath said that the meeting could clear the path for a
full-fledged Arab summit, which the Palestinians for months have
been asking the Arab states to convene.

Gaudenzi, Nargiso beat Blacks to put Italy in semis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRATO, Italy (AP) _ Andrea Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso beat
brothers Byron and Wayne Black of Zimbabwe in four sets Saturday to
put Italy into the Davis Cup semifinals for the third straight
year.
	   The Italian duo started slowly on the red clay in this town near
Florence, but eventually took control of the doubles encounter and
triumphed 1-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-3 in a little under three hours.
	   ``Fortunately, Andrea and I were able to calmly work our way
back into the match. We beat a strong pair,'' Nargiso said.
	   The doubles win added to Italy's two straight-set singles
victories from Friday to give the hosts an insurmountable 3-0 lead
in the best-of-five quarterfinal and rendered Sunday's reverse
singles a formality.
	   In September, Italy will meet the winner of the quarterfinal
between the United States and Belgium.
	   The Blacks dominated the first set. But Gaudenzi, the weaker of
the two Italians in doubles play, picked up his game.
	   Gaudenzi and Nargiso repeatedly exchanged laughs and playful
back-slaps during the match.
	   ``We had a lot of fun, we joked around out there,'' Gaudenzi
said. ``We feel less tension when we kid around. We played very
well against two great players.''
	   On Friday, Gaudenzi, ranked 35th by the ATP, beat Wayne Black
6-3, 6-3, 6-4, while Davide Sanguinetti, a Wimbledon
quarterfinalist, defeated Byron, 6-3, 6-3, 6-0.
	   ``Andrea was tired after yesterday so we really wanted to win
today,'' Nargiso said. ``It could have been tough tomorrow.''
	   The Black brothers had lifted Zimbabwe past favored Australia
playing on grass, but had a difficult time on the slower clay here.

Georgian investigators say robbery was motive for U.N. killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Georgian police believe a U.N. worker was killed
by someone who wanted to rob her, a Russian news agency said
Saturday.
	   The U.N. worker, Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, 31, was shot at
point-blank range Tuesday at the entrance to her apartment in the
Georgian capital of Tbilisi.
	   ``We are inclined to believe that Maria Wewiorska was murdered
for robbery,'' Revaz Zarandiya, a spokesman for Georgia's
prosecutor general, told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Investigators have determined that she was hit by four bullets
from a Makarov handgun, he said. No suspects have yet been
arrested.
	   The U.N. Security Council has condemned the killing.
	   U.N. officials said Wewiorska had recently moved to Tbilisi and
was working as a secretary for the head of the U.N. mission in
Georgia.
	   The U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea
province of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province
in a 1992-93 war.

Thousands march to protest closure of radical Basque paper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ Thousands marched through this
northern city Saturday demanding the reopening of a radical Basque
newspaper shut down last week for allegedly acting as a front for
the armed separatist group ETA.
	   Police estimated that between 13 and 15 thousand people
participated in the demonstration against last week's closure of
the newspaper Egin and an affiliated radio station.
	   Organizers claimed up to 75,000 people marched in silence to
protest a crackdown on free speech in the troubled northern region,
the national news agency EFE reported.
	   National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon ordered the closure of the
two radical news outlets last Wednesday as part of his probe into
ETA's fundraising network. Eleven current of former board members
of Orian S.A. _ the parent company of both media _ were arrested in
the operation that included pre-dawn police raids.
	   ``Give the Basque Country a voice, Reopen Egin'' read a banner
at the head of the march which was also peppered with the symbols
of Basque nationalism, EFE reported.
	   Also Sunday members of the governing Popular Party of Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar and Spain's main opposition Socialist
Party reiterated their support for Garzon's actions, stressing that
the issue was Egin's alleged links to ETA rather than the opinions
it published.
	   ``They (ETA and Egin) are part of the same Mafia'' said Carlos
Iturgaiz, the head of the Popular Party in the Basque region.
	   As well as allegedly being linked to ETA's fundraising
activities, ETA activists reportedly communicated with each other
in code through Egin's classifieds section.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its
campaign for independence.
	   Egin regularly published statements by ETA and its claims for
attacks.
	   The 11 detainees were due to declare before Garzon on Sunday,
national radio reported.

Body discovered in sea to be identified on Monday, say Irish police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Irish police officer saying post mortem will be
conducted Monday, CORRECTS style of French trawler graf 2

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish police said Saturday that a post
mortem will be carried out Monday morning on the body of a man
found in the sea off the southwest coast of Wales.
	   A French trawler, An Yvidig, discovered the body in its nests 30
miles (50 kms) southwest of Milford Haven port on Friday and landed
it later in Dunmore East in southeast Ireland. Media reports have
speculated whether the body is that of veteran French yachtsman
Eric Tabarly, 66, who was declared dead June 14 after falling
overboard from his yacht off the coast of southwest Wales.
	   ``We are awaiting the result of a post mortem to be held
Monday,'' said Timothy Sheehan, the police officer based at Dunmore
East who has been coordinating the investigation.
	   Sheehan said that dental records belonging to Tabarly were
expected to arrive in Ireland from France on Saturday night,
although he said he had made no direct contact with Tabarly's
family.
	   The body was taken to Waterford Regional Hospital Friday night,
Patricia Sullivan, assistant matron, said.
	   In Dublin, a police spokesman said reports that the body was
Tabarly's were ``speculation.''
	   ``The body has not been formerly identified yet,'' the
spokesman, speaking on terms of customary anonymity, said.
	   Tabarly became internationally famous after a series of
victories in lone ocean racing events in the 1960s and 1970s. Born
in Nantes, he became a naval officer before making his name as a
yachtsman.
	   A spokesman for the French Embassy in Dublin declined to
comment.

Court rejects damages claim for homosexual assault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A police inspector who alleged he was
sexually assaulted by former President Canaan Banana lost a civil
suit claiming damages, court officials said.
	   Jefta Dube, serving a 10-year prison term for the murder of a
police colleague who taunted him as ``Banana's wife,'' sought
200,000 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 11,000) for mental stress and loss
of dignity, according to a ruling of the High Court in Harare.
	   Dube said he was repeatedlu sexually assaulted by Banana when he
served as an aide to the titular head of state between 1984 and
1986.
	   In a summary of the ruling released by officials Friday, the
High Court said too much time had elapsed between the alleged
assaults and Dube's murder of a colleague in 1996.
	   Officials said the full judgment will be made available next
week.
	   At his murder trial last year, Dube received a reduced jail term
on grounds he acted with diminished responsibility while suffering
from stress-related illness caused by the assaults.
	   But in the civil damages suit, the High Court upheld Banana's
denial of any liability ten years after the alleged assaults.
	   In June, a criminal trial began for Banana, 62, a Methodist
minister, professor of theology and former diplomatic. He is being
tried on 11 criminal charges of homosexual assault and sodomy.
	   Banana pleaded innocent to charges carrying a possible two-year
prison term.
	   Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe, where the government
banned a gay rights exhibit at Zimbabwe's annual book fair in 1996
and President Robert Mugabe described same-sex partners as ``lower
than pigs and dogs.''
	   Disclosures of Banana's predatory homosexuality have deeply
embarrassed Mugabe, who has repeatedly insisted homosexuality is
foreign to African culture and was brought to the continent from
the West.

Guerrillas advance, Serbs shell border region

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of major KLA advance; army statement on
border fighting, claims of 30 militants killed; other details;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army said it killed 30
militants in a border clash Saturday. Elsewhere, secessionists
advanced on a Kosovo town, in what ethnic Albanian sources
described as their largest offensive in almost five months of
combat.
	   The guerrilla offensive at the central Kosovo town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, seemed aimed
at expanding the estimated 30-40 percent of territory held by the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Reporting the 30 dead, a Yugoslav army statement said some 1,000
``terrorists'' had tried to cross from Albania into Kosovo, west of
Decani town. The attack was foiled and about 30 guerrillas were
``liquidated,'' said the statement.
	   In another border clash, Yugoslav forces shelled the region of
Padesh village on the Albanian border in an attempt to further
disrupt the guerrillas' gun-smuggling network into Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, which makes up most of present-day Yugoslavia.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack on their villages. It is also believed used by the KLA to
smuggle guns and ammunition from northern Albania into Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 and demand
independence from Serbia.
	   The Padesh shelling ended by afternoon. Albanian border guards
reported seeing the bodies of dead and wounded victims but gave no
casualty count, said Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior
ministry, which controls the border police.
	   He said 19 wounded KLA members crossed into Albania to escape
the intense barrage. And Albania's state TV said that 80 others _
apparently civilians _ had strayed into a deadly border minefield
in their headlong rush to flee the violence. They were later
evacuated by Albanian border troops, said state TV.
	   The wounded guerrillas were helicoptered to Tirana, Albania's
capital for medical treatment. Some wore military uniforms with KLA
	   insignia. Reporters in Tirana said most were blood spattered,
but in most cases their wounds appeared relatively minor.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said that during
	   the most intense period of shelling, two Serb mortar rounds had
landed inside Albanian territory.
	   ``These dangerous incidents (could) have very dangerous
consequences,'' said Cano, hinting at the danger of a possible
Albanian military response to such violations of the country's
territorial sovereignty.
	   He said a protest had been lodged _ and a meeting demanded _
with Yugoslav authorities.
	   The Yugoslav army denied violating Albania's border.
	   None of the reports could be verified independently. But both
Serb and Kosovo Albanian sources spoke of intense fighting at
Orahovac. with the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center
calling the guerrilla assault there the largest since smoldering
ethnic hostilities flared into open warfare in February.
	   The center said the KLA offensive wrested at least one kilometer
(more than 1/2 mile) of hilly terrain from Serb control and may
have entered Orahovac, a town of 20,000.
	   A Pristina-based local journalist, who asked for anonymity, said
upon returning from the Orahovac fighting that the much of the town
had fallen to the KLA. The militants took 20 policemen into custody
and held off police reinforcements attempting to breach their
lines.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center described the fighting as a
``dramatic'' KLA assault ``from several directions'' that sent
civilians streaming from the area.
	   It said more than 40 Serb civilians had been kidnapped by ethnic
Albanian fighters. Telephone lines to Orahovac, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southwest of Pristina, went dead Saturday morning.
	   In Pristina, British Embassy officials said a British aid worker
earlier feared missing was located in the southwestern town of
Djakovica, where she had been detained by Yugoslav military.
	   British officials said Sally Becker, known as the Angel of
Mostar for her humanitarian efforts in that Bosnian city during the
	   war, was accused of illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav
border while attempting to assist Kosovo refugees. She heads a
small humanitarian organization called Operation Angel.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said she was in
contact with ``terrorists'' in Albania and in posession of a video
tape ``undoubtedly ... meant to present a distorted situation of
Kosovo.''
	   The Yugoslav _ and Serbian _ five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash in
Kosovo not only against the government but also against Kosovo
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose commitment to nonviolence has
	   failed to end the bloodshed or win self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA.

British navy captain hails his ships' visit to Syria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LATAKIA, Syria (AP) _ The current visit of two Royal Navy ships
will build confidence between Britain and Syria, the vessels'
commander said Saturday.
	   The frigate HMS Marlborough and the auxiliary ship RFA Fort
Victoria docked in the Mediterranean port of Latakia on Friday in
the presence of the commander of the Syrian Navy, Maj. Gen. Wael
Nasser.
	   The visit marks the first contact between the two states' armed
forces since Britain broke diplomatic relations with Syria over an
attempt to blow up an Israeli airliner flying from London in 1986.
Britain restored diplomatic relations with Syria in 1991.
	   Captain James Miller told reporters that the four-day visit was
``very significant for building up relationships and friendship.''
	   Miller gave Nasser and Latakia Governor Nawaf Aboud al-Fares an
1859 map of the port of Latakia.
	   Sailors from the two navies are expected to conduct diving
exercises and witness a replenishment demonstration by RFA Fort
Victoria.

Palestinians: no renegotiation of U.S. pullback terms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to clarify meeting is between high level officials,
UPDATES with clashes in Hebron &QL; 
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ On the eve of the first contact in
months between high level Palestinians and Israelis, the chief
Palestinian negotiator said Saturday that his side would
``listen,'' not re-negotiate a U.S. pullback plan.
	   The meeting, being held at the urging of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, is scheduled for Sunday in Tel Aviv between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Yitzhak
Mordechai, the Israeli defense minister.
	   ``Our agenda is to listen to what Mr. Mordechai tells us, and
the Palestinian delegation has been told that it is unacceptable to
renegotiate the U.S. initiative,'' chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said. ``We just don't want to be blamed for not going,
and that's why we're going. Albright told us that the Israelis have
ideas.''
	   The United States has urged the sides to hold two or three
meetings within a week to try to resolve their differences over the
Israeli troop withdrawal and procedures for amending the
Palestinian national covenant.
	   The United States has proposed, as part of a broader peace
initiative, that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that the PLO Executive Committee annul parts of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``The U.S. initiative is made up of American ideas. It is void
of any Palestinian ideas,'' said Erekat.
	   The Israeli media speculated Mordechai planned to suggest
setting up joint Palestinian-Israeli committees to discuss
redeployment, the PLO charter and security issues. The committees
would conclude their work within a week.
	   ``If the Israelis don't accept the U.S. initiative tomorrow, we
will go to our American friends with a very clear message: `We have
accepted the minimum, the minimum is not attainable. You take the
next step,''' Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said.
	   Meanwhile, in the tense West Bank town of Hebron, Palestinians
clashed Saturday with Israeli soldiers. Two Palestinian youths were
detained after throwing rocks at Jewish settlers, Israeli police
said.
	   On Saturday, the Jordanian foreign minister, Jawad Anani, met
with Arafat in Ramallah to review the latest developments in the
peace process ahead of Anani's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.
	   ``The current situation is sensitive and the region will witness
changes on the different tracks,'' said Anani, who also serves as
deputy prime minister. He refused to go into detail, but implied he
was referring to separate talks involving Syria and Lebanon.
	   Palestinian officials, meantime, announced that a meeting of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference's committee on Jerusalem,
headed by Morocco's King Hassan II, would be held July 29 in Rabat,
Morocco.
	   The foreign ministers of 16 Arab and Islamic countries will
attend, and Arafat will represent the Palestinians, according to
Shaath.
	   Shaath said the impetus for that meeting including stepped-up
Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes, Jewish settlement
activity in and around Jerusalem, and the government's recent move
to expand Jerusalem municipal services to outlying areas.
	   Shaath said that the meeting could clear the path for a
full-fledged Arab summit, which the Palestinians for months have
been asking the Arab states to convene.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Exchanging diamond-studded
gold rings and a lingering kiss, President Nelson Mandela capped
his 80th birthday Saturday by marrying Graca Machel, the widow of a
Mozambican president and black liberation leader.
	   Just hours after the president's press aides denied the marriage
would happen _ saying Mandela would quietly celebrate his birthday
at home _ Mandela wed Machel.
	   ``It was a very beautiful ceremony,'' said Mandela's spokeswoman
Priscilla Naidoo.
	   Relatives and close friends, including fellow Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Desmond Tutu, were present as the couple were wed by
Methodist Bishop Mvuve Dandala.
	   The wedding unites a towering figure _ a man widely respected
for emerging with a spirit of forgiveness from 27 years'
imprisonment for fighting apartheids _ with a woman who has gained
respect for her work on children's issues for the United Nations.
Machel, 56, is the widow of Mozambique President Samora Machel who
died in a 1986 plane crash.
	   But far from a political marriage, it is obviously one of true
love. The years seem to melt from Mandela's creased face and his
eyes light up as he describes the relationship.
	   ``Late in my life, I am blooming like a flower because of the
love and support she has given me,'' Mandela told a television
interviewer this year.
	   Machel, whose cherubic face glows with contentment when at
Mandela's side, was wed in a cream-and-gold long skirt with
matching top. Mandela wore a black-and-gold sport shirt, Naidoo
said.
	   Mandela was reportedly sending a small herd of cattle to
Machel's family in Mozambique in traditional African bride payment.
	   Mirroring a spirit of multi-cultural diversity Mandela has
fostered in South Africa, the Jewish, Hindu and Muslim communities
also gave their blessings to the marriage.
	   Tutu, a retired Anglican archbishop who had chided Mandela for
setting a bad example for the nation's youth by carrying on a
relationship with Machel outside marriage, helped officiate. A
magistrate was also present.
	   As word of the marriage spread, a crowd of blacks and whites
gathered outside Mandela's home in a quiet, leafy Johannesburg
suburb, hoping for a glimpse of the newlyweds.
	   Mike Sterne, a white chemical engineer, had brought his three
sons to mark Mandela's birthday, not knowing _ like the rest of
South Africa _ that he was being married inside.
	   ``He's a figure of history _ it's something they'll remember all
their lives,'' Sterne said.
	   A dozen black women sang ``Viva Mandela'' and danced a shuffle
on the sidewalk. One declared: ``It's a big day. It's wonderful!''
	   The celebration would have been much bigger if South Africans
had only known beforehand.
	   A Mandela spokesman admitted an elaborate scheme was set up to
throw the press off track. Journalists had staked out Mandela's
home in the morning. But in the afternoon, the government told
journalists Deputy President Thabo Mbeki would announce a
development ``of national importance'' in Pretoria, 65 kilometers
(40 miles away) at 3 p.m.
	   About the time reporters hopped into cars and zoomed toward the
capital, the wedding began. The press conference was then
rescheduled for 4:30, when Mbeki _ who attended the wedding _ drove
to Pretoria and announced it had occurred.
	   ``We wanted to keep the wedding private and as quiet as
possible, so that's why we did it,'' spokesman Parks Mankahlana
said in a telephone interview.
	   Mankahlana didn't seem concerned the action may damage Mandela's
press office's credibility, saying: ``Those who don't want to
believe me in the future can do so.''
	   The marriage is the third for Mandela and the second for Machel.
	   The couple met in 1990, shortly after Mandela was released from
prison.
	   Machel had expressed reluctance to complicate her relationship
with Mandela by marrying him. For some time, Mandela has said she
should be treated as a first lady during foreign state visits.
	   Suspicions linger about the plane crash that killed Machel's
first husband. Amid allegations the apartheid government was behind
it, Mandela has vowed to uncover the truth about what happened, and
it's the subject of an inquiry by the government's truth and
Reconciliation Commission.
	   Mandela divorced his second wife, Winnie, in 1996 on grounds she
had been unfaithful. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela remains a member of
the ANC's ruling committee but has been at odds with other party
leaders after she publicly criticized the ANC for its policies.
	   Mandela first married in 1944, the marriage to Evelyn ended in
divorce in 1957 after quarrels over his long nights of political
involvement. He had four children from his first marriage. Two of
them died.
	   Mandela and Madikizela-Mandela had two daughters.

Palestinians: no renegotiation of U.S. pullback terms

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ On the eve of the first contact in
months between high level Palestinians and Israelis, the chief
Palestinian negotiator said Saturday his side would go only ``to
listen,'' not to re-negotiate a U.S. pullback plan.
	   The meeting, being held at the urging of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, was to take place Sunday in Tel Aviv between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Yitzhak
Mordechai, the Israeli defense minister.
	   ``Our agenda is to listen to what Mr. Mordechai tells us, and
the Palestinian delegation has been told that it is unacceptable to
renegotiate the U.S. initiative,'' said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, referring to an American initiative for an
Israeli pullback from the West Bank.
	   ``We just don't want to be blamed for not going, and that's why
we're going,'' he said. ``Albright told us that the Israelis have
ideas.''
	   The United States has urged the sides to hold two or three
meetings within a week to try to resolve their differences over the
Israeli troop withdrawal and procedures for amending the
Palestinian national covenant.
	   The United States has proposed, as part of a broader peace
initiative, that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that the PLO Executive Committee annul parts of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``The U.S. initiative is made up of American ideas. It is void
of any Palestinian ideas,'' said Erekat. ``The Palestinians will
not accept that the initiative's separate elements be revisited.''
	   ``The meeting tomorrow will be to tell the Israelis that we will
not back down one inch from the least of the minimum that we
accepted in the U.S. initiative,'' said Palestinian Planning
Minister Nabil Shaath.
	   ``If the Israelis don't accept the U.S. initiative tomorrow, we
will go to our American friends with a very clear message: `We have
accepted the minimum, the minimum is not attainable _ you take the
next step,''' Shaath said.
	   Erekat said that a top Palestinian security official would
attend the meeting between Abbas and Mordechai.
	   The Israeli media speculated that Mordechai planned to suggest
setting up joint Palestinian-Israeli committees to discuss
redeployment, the PLO charter and security issues. The committees
would conclude their work within a week.
	   Meanwhile, in the tense West Bank town of Hebron, Palestinians
clashed Saturday with Israeli soldiers, and two Palestinian youths
were detained after throwing rocks at Jewish settlers, Israeli
police said. In another incident in Hebron, an Israeli soldier was
slightly wounded when hit by a fire bomb thrown at his patrol, the
Army reported.
	   Israeli media reports said the head of Israel's opposition Labor
Party, Ehud Barak, had urged the Palestinians at a meeting on
Friday to go into Sunday's session with an open mind. Barak met
with Abbas and two other top Palestinian officials.
	   ``We explained that Israel must accept the American initiative
if we are to get out of the current crisis,'' said Palestinian
official Hasan Asfour, who attended the meeting.
	   On Saturday, the Jordanian foreign minister, Jawad Anani, met
with Arafat in Ramallah to review the latest developments in the
peace process ahead of Anani's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.
	   ``The current situation is sensitive and the region will witness
changes on the different tracks,'' said Anani, who also serves as
deputy prime minister. He refused to go into detail, but implied he
was referring to separate talks involving Syria and Lebanon.
	   Palestinian officials, meanwhile, announced that a meeting of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference's committee on
Jerusalem, headed by Morocco's King Hassan II, would be held July
29 in Rabat, Morocco.
	   The foreign ministers of 16 Arab and Islamic countries will
attend, and Arafat will represent the Palestinians, according to
Shaath.
	   Shaath said the impetus for that meeting including stepped-up
Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes, Jewish settlement
activity in and around Jerusalem, and the government's recent move
to expand Jerusalem municipal services to outlying areas.
	   Shaath said that the meeting could clear the path for a
full-fledged Arab summit, which the Palestinians for months have
been asking the Arab states to convene.

Franchitti keeps Zanardi from first 1998 pole
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Alex Zanardi can't do anything he wants on the
race track.
	   The Italian driver, who has been doing everything right of late,
could not hold off Dario Franchitti on Saturday in the battle for
the Toronto Molson-Indy pole position.
	   It was the second straight Toronto pole and the second this
season, for the 25-year-old Scot, and it left Zanardi a little
frustrated and a lot motivated.
	   ``Today, I wanted really badly to win the pole,'' he said.
``This guy took it from me. Tomorrow, I'm going to get up and try
to win that race. There's always a target in front of you.''
	   He was not able to improve on the 105.480 mph (169.75 kph) lap
that took the provisional pole on Friday.
	   But Zanardi, who has yet to win a pole this season in 11 tries,
can take consolation in the fact that he will start alongside
Franchitti on the front row Sunday when he begins his effort to win
a record fourth consecutive CART FedEx Championship Series race.
	   Franchitti was the man of the hour Saturday, despite spending
the final minutes of qualifying sitting helplessly in a runoff area
as Zanardi and Michael Andretti took their final shots at the top
position.
	   Franchitti, whose fast lap of 105.558 (169.87 kph) on the
1.721-mile (2.77-kilometer) temporary road came with about 12
minutes remaining in the 30-minute session, said, ``I felt
something and I was having trouble getting the car slowed down
without losing it. I pulled into the runoff area and told my guys,
`There's something wrong with the brakes. Then I looked back and
saw this big hole in the tire.''
	   The youngster was anxious to find out if he had held onto the
pole. For some reason, he wasn't getting answers on the radio from
his crew, so he got out of the car and began asking the crowd.
	   ``They said I was on the pole and everybody stood up and clapped
for me. It was a very special feeling,'' Franchitti said.
	   The next moment of truth for Franchitti will be the start of the
95-lap race.
	   Last year, after winning his first pole, Franchitti didn't even
lead to the first turn. He was hit from behind by Bobby Rahal, who
started third in that race. Franchitti wound up 26th.
	   ``I'd like to kind of make amends for what happened last year,''
he said. ``To get my first pole and go out in the first corner was
very disappointing.''
	   Asked what he would do Sunday to avoid that kind of disaster,
Franchitti smiled and said, ``Start faster, brake later and speak
very nicely to Michael.''
	   Andretti, a five-time Toronto winner, held onto third place by
improving to 105.461 (169.72 kph). But the fast lap could have been
even faster.
	   ``I could have had pole, but I messed up,'' Andretti said. ``I
had a very good lap going until the last three corners. The first
of those corners kind of sets you up for the other two, and I
totally messed it up. That cost me two tenths of a second,
according to our computer. I guess I was just trying too hard.''
	   That two tenths would have given Andretti the pole. Franchitti's
fast lap was timed at 58.694 seconds, while Andretti's quick lap
was 58.748.
	   Zanardi, too, said he could have had the pole if not for
circumstances.
	   ``I wasted all my good laps on my second set of tires in
traffic,'' Zanardi said. ``There were people out there that got in
the way because they were slow or they were slowing down to make
another lap and didn't want you out front of them. Sometimes, that
just happens to you.''
	   Actually, the best job in qualifying Saturday was probably
turned in by Zanardi's teammate, Jimmy Vasser, who leaped from 16th
on Friday's grid to sixth, just behind Gil de Ferran and Christian
Fittipaldi.

Watts holding steady in fierce winds of British Open

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ The raging winds of Royal Birkdale
beat up everybody at the British Open. At the end of the third
round, Brian Watts was the only one still on his feet.
	   On a day when none of the world's best players could break par,
Watts managed to salvage a 3-over 73 that left him alone in the
lead, the only player at even-par 210 going into the final round.
	   And if cruel conditions that sent Nick Price to an 82 and Tiger
Woods to a 77 on Saturday weren't enough to make Watts crack, he'll
face an additional test on Sunday _ the pressure of winning his
first major championship.
	   ``I've never been in the last group of any major championship,
much less the Open,'' said the 32-year-old Watts, whose game was
groomed in the strong winds of Texas and Oklahoma.
	   ``I felt a lot of pressure from the get-go, ever since
yesterday, actually,'' he said. ``I think I handled it pretty well.
Obviously, it's going to be tough again tomorrow.''
	   Those trying to chase him down _ or hope that Watts passes them
going the other direction _ are two guys who have been there
before.
	   At two strokes back were Masters champion Mark O'Meara, who
finished third at Birkdale in 1991, and Jesper Parnevik, the Open
runner-up in 1994 and last year at Royal Troon.
	   Parnevik made a 6-footer (2-meter) for bogey on No. 18 for a
2-over 72. ``This was all I asked for today, another chance,'' he
said.
	   Also at 212 was Jim Furyk, who closed with 11 pars and a birdie
for a 72, putting him in contention for the first time in a major.
	   O'Meara, trying to become the first player since Nick Faldo in
1990 to win the Masters and the British Open in the same year,
played the tough back nine in 2 under for a 72.
	   His biggest break came on No. 6, when he presumed his ball was
lost. Spectators found it at the last minute, but then a fan put
the ball in his pocket. O'Meara was given a free drop and left with
a bogey.
	   ``I like my position,'' O'Meara said. ``You've got to have a lot
of patience out there.''
	   Right behind at 213 is Justin Rose, the 17-year-old English
amateur who may have been the only one who managed a smile during a
torturous third round.
	   Carried along by cheers of ``Go on, Justin'' by Brits who leaned
over the ropes to pat him on the back, Rose was tied for the lead
at even-par through nine holes until his errant tee shots finally
caught up with him.
	   ``I just felt tremendous,'' said Rose, who doesn't look likes he
needs to shave yet. ``It was amazing how many people knew my name.
Obviously, I felt great. But I wasn't uncomfortable with the
situation.''
	   Neither was Watts, who earns his keep on the Japanese tour.
	   Starting the day at 3 under, he finally lost his lead with
back-to-back bogeys starting on No. 6, but never lost his
composure. He birdied the 498-yard (455-meter) 13th hole, a par 4
that plays downwind, with an approach that stopped 2 feet (1 1/2
meters) behind the cup, then got back to even-par with a two-putt
birdie on the par-5 17th.
	   ``I can't say I enjoy playing in situations with these winds,''
he said. ``I'm just trying to handle the conditions.''
	   The average score was 77.5 and some of them were shocking.
Defending champion Justin Leonard stretched out his arms and smiled
when a 12-foot (3 1/2-meter) par putt fell on the 18th hole for an
82.
	   ``I'm going to go home and watch TV, and laugh at the guys
playing,'' Leonard said.
	   The last time a score over par won the British Open was in 1986,
when Sandy Lyle had a 2-over 282 at Royal St. George. That almost
certainly will be the case on Sunday unless the wind relents.
	   ``You're upset because your score is so high, but you're happy
it's over _ the suffering is over,'' Woods said.
	   With white caps dancing across the Irish Sea and the flagsticks
whipping so hard it was a wonder they stayed in the hole, only
Costantino Rocca came close to breaking par, until his 20-foot
birdie putt stopped an inch short on No. 18. He and Katsuyoshi
Tomori were the only players to match par at 70.
	   Curtis Strange finished his round of 74 and was headed toward
the broadcast booth when he was stopped by Butch Harmon, Woods'
coach.
	   ``There's a bunch of guys who would love to have that score
today,'' Harmon told him.
	   He was right, and Woods was one of them.
	   In contention for the first time since winning the Masters in
1997, Woods lipped out a 70-foot (21-meter) birdie putt and then
missed a 5-footer (1 1/2-meter) for birdie on the third hole that
would have put him in the lead.
	   He proceeded to bogey the next two holes, then took a double
bogey on No. 6 and began his procession down the leaderboard.
	   He finished at 215, along with John Huston (73), Brad Faxon (74)
and Denmark's Thomas Bjorn (76).
	   He wasn't alone. Davis Love III shot a 77 and was at 217. Fred
Couples hacked his way to a double bogey on the first hole with
Prince Andrew watching and shot a 7-over 41 on the front. He closed
with a birdie for a 78 and was at 218.
	   Tom Kite, who won the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in 1992 in
conditions just as bad, wasn't up to the task Saturday. He shot a
79 and was in a large group at 220 that included Nick Faldo, Lee
Westwood and Ernie Els.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Exchanging diamond-studded
gold rings and a lingering kiss, President Nelson Mandela capped
his 80th birthday Saturday by marrying Graca Machel, the widow of a
Mozambican president and black liberation leader.
	   Just hours after the president's press aides denied the marriage
would happen _ saying Mandela would quietly celebrate his birthday
at home _ Mandela wed Machel.
	   ``It was a very beautiful ceremony,'' said Mandela's spokeswoman
Priscilla Naidoo.
	   Relatives and close friends, including fellow Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Desmond Tutu, were present as the couple were wed by
Methodist Bishop Mvuve Dandala.
	   The wedding unites a towering figure _ a man widely respected
for emerging with a spirit of forgiveness from 27 years'
imprisonment for fighting apartheids _ with a woman who has gained
respect for her work on children's issues for the United Nations.
Machel, 56, is the widow of Mozambique President Samora Machel who
died in a 1986 plane crash.
	   But far from a political marriage, it is obviously one of true
love. The years seem to melt from Mandela's creased face and his
eyes light up as he describes the relationship.
	   ``Late in my life, I am blooming like a flower because of the
love and support she has given me,'' Mandela told a television
interviewer this year.
	   Machel, whose cherubic face glows with contentment when at
Mandela's side, was wed in a cream-and-gold long skirt with
matching top. Mandela wore a black-and-gold sport shirt, Naidoo
said.
	   Mandela was reportedly sending a small herd of cattle to
Machel's family in Mozambique in traditional African bride payment.
	   Mirroring a spirit of multi-cultural diversity Mandela has
fostered in South Africa, the Jewish, Hindu and Muslim communities
also gave their blessings to the marriage.
	   Tutu, a retired Anglican archbishop who had chided Mandela for
setting a bad example for the nation's youth by carrying on a
relationship with Machel outside marriage, helped officiate. A
magistrate was also present.
	   As word of the marriage spread, a crowd of blacks and whites
gathered outside Mandela's home in a quiet, leafy Johannesburg
suburb, hoping for a glimpse of the newlyweds.
	   Mike Sterne, a white chemical engineer, had brought his three
sons to mark Mandela's birthday, not knowing _ like the rest of
South Africa _ that he was being married inside.
	   ``He's a figure of history _ it's something they'll remember all
their lives,'' Sterne said.
	   A dozen black women sang ``Viva Mandela'' and danced a shuffle
on the sidewalk. One declared: ``It's a big day. It's wonderful!''
	   The celebration would have been much bigger if South Africans
had only known beforehand.
	   A Mandela spokesman admitted an elaborate scheme was set up to
throw the press off track. Journalists had staked out Mandela's
home in the morning. But in the afternoon, the government told
journalists Deputy President Thabo Mbeki would announce a
development ``of national importance'' in Pretoria, 65 kilometers
(40 miles away) at 3 p.m.
	   About the time reporters hopped into cars and zoomed toward the
capital, the wedding began. The press conference was then
rescheduled for 4:30, when Mbeki _ who attended the wedding _ drove
to Pretoria and announced it had occurred.
	   ``We wanted to keep the wedding private and as quiet as
possible, so that's why we did it,'' spokesman Parks Mankahlana
said in a telephone interview.
	   Mankahlana didn't seem concerned the action may damage Mandela's
press office's credibility, saying: ``Those who don't want to
believe me in the future can do so.''
	   The marriage is the third for Mandela and the second for Machel.
	   The couple met in 1990, shortly after Mandela was released from
prison.
	   Machel had expressed reluctance to complicate her relationship
with Mandela by marrying him. For some time, Mandela has said she
should be treated as a first lady during foreign state visits.
	   Suspicions linger about the plane crash that killed Machel's
first husband. Amid allegations the apartheid government was behind
it, Mandela has vowed to uncover the truth about what happened, and
it's the subject of an inquiry by the government's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission.
	   Mandela divorced his second wife, Winnie, in 1996 on grounds she
had been unfaithful. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela remains a member of
the African National Congress' executive committee but has been at
odds with other leaders of the ruling party after she publicly
criticized the ANC for its policies.
	   Mandela first married in 1944, the marriage to Evelyn ended in
divorce in 1957 after quarrels over his long nights of political
involvement. He had four children from his first marriage. Two of
them died.
	   Mandela and Madikizela-Mandela had two daughters.

Iraq says it does not fear U.S. covert operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Saturday that any U.S. attempt to
topple President Saddam Hussein would be fruitless.
	   The United States ``will only reap frustration, humiliation,
disgrace and isolation,'' a spokesman for the Ministry of Culture
and Information told the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   U.S. officials confirmed Friday a report in The Wall Street
Journal that the White House was seeking Congressional approval to
mount covert operations against Saddam.
	   However, the Clinton administration sidestepped comment on the
report.
	   ``I don't comment on intelligence operations; I don't comment on
covert operations,'' White House spokesman Mike McCurry said
Friday. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Cohen told
reporters ``I wouldn't comment on any report pertaining to
intelligence matters.''
	   The Iraqi agency said the dissidents with whom the
administration was dealing were ``dwarfs and lackeys'' whose main
aim was to collect U.S. dollars.
	   ``Contacts with these dwarfs will prompt the sons of Iraq ... to
be more patriotic and to rally behind the national and courageous
leader, Saddam Hussein,'' the agency said.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Fiorentina striker and national
team member Edmundo has been ordered to pay a hefty indemnity for
the vehicular death of a young woman, the Brazilian media reported
Saturday.
	   Judge Ivan Cury order the soccer star to pay dlrs 521,000 to
Carmine and Vera Perota, the parents of Alessandra Perrota. The
20-year-old university student died in 1995 after the jeep in which
she was riding collided with Edmundo's pickup truck and crashed
into a pole killing her and two others.
	   Edmundo, known here as ``the animal'' for his hot temper, was
saved by the truck's air bag but received 10 stitches in his
forehead. Four witnesses said Friday that he was going at least 60
mph (95 kph) in a 40 mph zone (65 kph).
	   ``Edmundo hit the steering wheel with his hands and said `let's
run,' Deborah Ferreira, who rode in the pickup, told the court.
	   In court, Edmundo denied he was drunk at the time of the
accident, saying he had only two glasses of beer. But testimony
from witnesses at the nightclub where the soccer player had gone
prior to the accident say he had consumed a large amount of
alcohol.
	   On July 31, Edmundo has another court date. He has been charged
with three counts of manslaughter.

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ The raging winds of Royal Birkdale
beat up everybody at the British Open. At the end of the third
round, Brian Watts was the only one still on his feet.
	   On a day when none of the world's best players could break par,
Watts managed to salvage a 3-over 73 that left him alone in the
lead, the only player at even-par 210 going into the final round.
	   And if cruel conditions that sent Nick Price to an 82 and Tiger
Woods to a 77 on Saturday weren't enough to make Watts crack, he'll
face an additional test on Sunday _ the pressure of winning his
first major championship.
	   ``I've never been in the last group of any major championship,
much less the Open,'' said the 32-year-old Watts, whose game was
groomed in the strong winds of Texas and Oklahoma.
	   ``I felt a lot of pressure from the get-go, ever since
yesterday, actually,'' he said. ``I think I handled it pretty well.
Obviously, it's going to be tough again tomorrow.''
	   Those trying to chase him down _ or hope that Watts passes them
going the other direction _ are two guys who have been there
before.
	   At two strokes back were Masters champion Mark O'Meara, who
finished third at Birkdale in 1991, and Jesper Parnevik, the Open
runner-up in 1994 and last year at Royal Troon.
	   Parnevik made a 6-footer (2-meter) for bogey on No. 18 for a
2-over 72. ``This was all I asked for today, another chance,'' he
said.
	   Also at 212 was Jim Furyk, who closed with 11 pars and a birdie
for a 72, putting him in contention for the first time in a major.
	   O'Meara, trying to become the first player since Nick Faldo in
1990 to win the Masters and the British Open in the same year,
played the tough back nine in 2 under for a 72.
	   His biggest break came on No. 6, when he presumed his ball was
lost. Spectators found it at the last minute, but then a fan put
the ball in his pocket. O'Meara was given a free drop and left with
a bogey.
	   ``I like my position,'' O'Meara said. ``You've got to have a lot
of patience out there.''
	   Right behind at 213 is Justin Rose, the 17-year-old English
amateur who may have been the only one who managed a smile during a
torturous third round.
	   Carried along by cheers of ``Go on, Justin'' by Brits who leaned
over the ropes to pat him on the back, Rose was tied for the lead
at even-par through nine holes until his errant tee shots finally
caught up with him.
	   ``I just felt tremendous,'' said Rose, who doesn't look likes he
needs to shave yet. ``It was amazing how many people knew my name.
Obviously, I felt great. But I wasn't uncomfortable with the
situation.''
	   Neither was Watts, who earns his keep on the Japanese tour.
	   Starting the day at 3 under, he finally lost his lead with
back-to-back bogeys starting on No. 6, but never lost his
composure. He birdied the 498-yard (455-meter) 13th hole, a par 4
that plays downwind, with an approach that stopped 2 feet (1 1/2
meters) behind the cup, then got back to even-par with a two-putt
birdie on the par-5 17th.
	   ``I can't say I enjoy playing in situations with these winds,''
he said. ``I'm just trying to handle the conditions.''
	   The average score was 77.5 and some of them were shocking.
Defending champion Justin Leonard stretched out his arms and smiled
when a 12-foot (3 1/2-meter) par putt fell on the 18th hole for an
82.
	   ``I'm going to go home and watch TV, and laugh at the guys
playing,'' Leonard said.
	   The last time a score over par won the British Open was in 1985,
when Sandy Lyle had a 2-over 282 at Royal St. George. That almost
certainly will be the case on Sunday unless the wind relents.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Tropical storm Celia moved away from the Baja
California coast Saturday and headed out into the Pacific,
prompting Mexican authorities to lift a tropical storm warning for
the southern part of the peninsula.
	   The storm will continue to travel out to sea and weaken, the
National Hurricane Center in Miami predicted, while noting that
``rough seas and gusty winds are likely to persist over adjacent
marine areas for the next day or two.''
	   Celia's winds weakened to about 50 mph (80 kph) by Saturday,
about 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of Cabo San Lucas, Baja
California, moving in a generally western direction at about 14 mph
(22 kph).
	   Mexico's National Meteorological Service predicted Celia may
continue to cause strong to moderate rains and heavy waves in six
Mexican Pacific coast states, and recommended boaters exercise
caution.
	   The Hurricane Center predicted the storm will stay on that track
and weaken Sunday and Monday as it moves over cooler waters. Winds
from Celia appeared to extend only about 105 miles (169 kilometers)
from the storm's center, as opposed to earlier estimates of 140
miles (225 kilometers).

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The streets are dark, because snipers
have shot out most of the street lights. Inside the houses, people
cringe with each burst of gunfire.
	   This is Liaqatabad, a poor neighborhood in central Karachi
caught in a relentless war between rival factions of the same
refugee group.
	   The combatants are members of the Mohajir Qami Movement, which
represents Muslims who moved to Pakistan from predominantly Hindu
India after the British colonialists pulled out in 1947.
	   Millions of the immigrants _ known as Mohajirs, or refugees _
settled in Sindh Province, whose capital is Karachi, Pakistan's
biggest city. They have long charged the national government
ignores their needs and discriminates against them in favor of
indigenous ethnic groups.
	   Frustrated by a lack of progress, militant Mohajirs turned to
violence to press demands for equal access to government jobs and
places at universities and other state schools. They soon built up
an arsenal of heavy weapons that often are better than those of
Karachi's police force.
	   Several years ago the militants split over power and political
goals. Rivals began to openly clash, taking over entire
neighborhoods of Karachi, a sweltering city of 14 million people.
	   Young gunmen took up positions on rooftops, shooting at
policemen, residents and rivals alike. Liaqatabad turned into one
of the worst battle zones, one so dangerous even the police are
afraid to enter.
	   Gunmen roaming eastern neighborhoods killed three people
Saturday, set vehicles on fire and shut down shops, according to
witnesses and police.

Hoch heckled at British Open; tournament's no breeze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Scott Hoch doesn't like the British
Open _ and Britons apparently don't like Scott Hoch.
	   Fans heckled him mercilessly when he was out on the course
during the first two rounds at Royal Birkdale. They didn't get
another chance to boo him in the third round Saturday: He missed
the cut.
	   ``I have never tried to make myself the most popular guy in the
world, but I still do not believe anyone should be subjected to
what I had to go through out there,'' said Hoch, who lives in
Orlando, Florida.
	   Hoch played the Open only because his equipment sponsor, Yonex,
forced him to. He once called hallowed St. Andrews the ``worst mess
I've ever seen.''
	   And on the eve of this year's Open, he cracked, ``The tradition
of this tournament doesn't mean anything to me compared to the
States.''
	   The British fans didn't appreciate the comments.
	   ``At times what they said was pretty upsetting,'' he said,
citing examples: ``Hoch, like the weather now? Hoch, we don't want
you.''
	   ``It was unpleasant,'' he said. ``It's not a football game, you
know.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOST AND FOUND: Mark O'Meara, three strokes back going into the
final round, got a big break Saturday.
	   O'Meara hit his second shot on the 6th into tall rough and when
he couldn't find it, he walked back up the fairway to hit another
and take his penalty.
	   Moments later, a fan pointed to the ground to show he'd found
it. O'Meara, thinking the five-minute limit to search for the ball
had expired, told the man to pick it up and keep it.
	   He did. Seconds later, O'Meara's caddie indicated only three
minutes had elapsed. So O'Meara returned to where the ball landed
and was given a free drop under the ``outside agency'' rule.
	   The drop fell on top of the trampled grass instead of under it.
He holed out with a bogey 5, saving a sure double bogey.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HAPPY BIRTHDAY, NICK: Three-time Open champion Nick Faldo turned
41 Saturday, but his game wasn't up to par on his birthday. He shot
a 5-over 75 to go to 10 over.
	   ``Some of the spectators tried to sing happy birthday to me, but
I would have shot the cat if it sang as much out of tune as that,''
he said.
	   Faldo said 3 over might win this year's Open. ``Playing in these
conditions gives you some kind of perverse gratification,'' he
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   IT'S NO BREEZE: Winds off the Irish Sea reached a gale-force 35
mph (55 kph) on Saturday. The final round Sunday will be buffeted
by lighter winds with a chance of light rain and temperatures
around 65.
	   Asked if he'd played in stronger winds, England's Lee Westwood
snapped: ``In Iceland, and in the Scottish Open two years ago.''
	   Westwood, who's won seven tournaments in nine months, had an
8-over 78 Saturday.
	   ``That was almost unplayable,'' he said. ``The only chance I
have is if it blows even stronger Sunday and makes it Mickey Mouse
golf with drives going 150 yards (140 meters).''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHIP SHOTS: Scotland's Andrew Coltart, who grew up playing in
miserable wet, windy weather, admitted the gusts at Royal Birkdale
were getting to him. ``I'm gutted,'' he said. ``In this wind, it's
impossible to know where the ball's going.'' ... First round
co-leader John Huston, who credits his improved play to sleeping on
a magnet-laced mattress, slipped from a 65 to a second-round 77. A
case of ``metal fatigue,'' The Mirror tabloid called it. ... The
understatement of the tournament came from Ken Rose after his
17-year-old son Justin breezed to a 4-under 66 in the second round.
``I think there will be options for him to turn professional once
he gets this tournament out of the way.'' ... Justin Rose is three
stokes off the lead and British bookmakers have his odds of winning
the claret jug at 14-1 _ down from 500-1. ... The last time the
Open was won with even par was Greg Norman's 280 in 1986 at
Turnberry.

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Venezuela led Haiti 2-1 Saturday
after winning the doubles match on the second day of the Group II
American Zone Davis Cup semifinals.
	   In four sets, 6-3, 6-4, 4-6 and 6-4, Venezuela's number one
player Jimy Szymansk and number two player Kepler Orellana teamed
up to beat Haiti's number one player Ronald Agenor and Haiti's
number two player Betrand Madsen.
	   Haiti has never won a doubles match in the ten years it has
competed for the Davis Cup.
	   Haiti and Venezuela were even after Friday singles matches, when
Agenor defeated Orellana and Szymanski bested Madsen. The
competition took place at the Bellevue Circle, a private tennis
club in the capital.
	   In the final singles matches Sunday, Agenor will face Szymanksi
and Madsen will play Orellana.
	   The winner of the best-of-five series will face either Peru or
Uruguay Sept. 25-27 for the right to play in Group I.

	    &UR; Quotable: ``I think I'm going to turn this score in and get my
handicap rating changed'' _ Justin Leonard after shooting an 82.
	    &UR; What's Par For This Course?: 77.5, if you take the average
score shot on a day when not one of the 81 players in the field
broke par.
	    &UR; Weatherwhipped: Another day of fighting the winds coming off
the Irish Sea left players frustrated. Winds gusted to 35 mph (55
kph), making club selection difficult and pushing balls into the
thick rough lining fairways and greens.
	    &UR; Cool Amateur: Justin Rose, all of 17, played in the last group
and shot a respectable 75. Rose was greeted with loud ovations from
his countrymen at every green as he played in the last group with
Watts.
	    &UR; Shot of the day: Rose's 3-wood out of the left rough went 235
yards (215 meters) on the sixth hole and rolled to within 20 feet
(6 meters) of the pin. Rose's par on the hole was one of only 21
among 81 players.
	    &UR; Bad Start: Fred Couples and Mark O'Meara played together and
started the day even par. By the time they got done hitting the
ball around the first hole, they were both 2-over. O'Meara
recovered to shoot 72, while Couples had 78.
	    &UR; Key Statistic: 23 players shot 80 or higher.
	    &UR; Key Pairings (Sunday): Brian Watts and Jesper Parnevik. Mark
O'Meara and Jim Furyk.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Sebastian Keitel of Chile won the men's
200 meters Saturday in the Ibero-American Games, to add to his
100-meter gold claimed Friday, clocking a time of 20.16 seconds.
	   Argentina's Carlos Gats crossed the finishing line next, 0.21
seconds behind, and Brazilian Edson Ribeiro came in third the same
amount behind again.
	   Lucrecia Jardim of Portugal took the women's 200 meters. She
timed 23.22, ahead of Allem Liliana of Mexico and Julia Duforty of
Cuba.
	   Mexican Alejandro Cardenas won the men's 400 meters with 45.04,
while teammate Ana Guevara seized the women's 400 meters in 50.65
seconds.
	   Portugal's Luis Feiteira took the men's, and Carla Sacramento
took the women's, 1,500 meters. Feiteria timed 3 minutes, 40.63
seconds and Sacramento four minutes, 17.43 seconds.
	   Spaniard Luisa Larraga won the women's 10,000 meters in
32:49.80, setting a new record for the Ibero-American Games.
	   Yamile Aldama of Cuba was a clear winner in the women's triple
jump with 14.07 meters, 49 centimeters ahead of second-placed
Spaniard Carlota Castrejana.
	   Cuban Erik Balte was disqualified in the men's 110-meter
hurdles, handing first place to Spaniard Francisco Lopez who passed
the finish line second, in a time of 13.95.
	   Other winners included Spaniard Montxu Miranda in the men's pole
vault with 5.60 meters; Spaniard Maria del Mar Martinez in the
women's high jump with 1.83 meters; and Cuban Alberto Sanchez in
the men's hammer, setting a new Ibero-American record at 76.18
meters.
	   Saturday was reportedly the hottest day of the year in Portugal,
with temperatures rising to 40 C (104 F) at Lisbon's University
Stadium.
	   Some 23 countries are officially taking part in the three-day
meeting which ends Sunday.

A hole called names you wouldn't repeat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Golf-British Open &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM LITKE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Royal Birkdale is that rare British
Open venue where the holes don't have names.
	   After watching No. 6 eat up the world's best golfers Saturday,
it's easy to understand why: Most of the names they used couldn't
be repeated.
	   In fact, the kindest thing anybody had to say about the par-4,
480-yard (438-meter) hole was that it really should be a par 5.
	   Long-hitting Englishman Lee Westwood hit driver off the tee,
driver from the fairway and still came up 20 yards (18 meters)
short. He made bogey. So did defending champion Justin Leonard, who
hit driver on his first AND third shots _ sandwiched between them
was a bunker shot.
	   ``I think I'm going to turn this score in and get my handicap
rating changed,'' Leonard said after shooting 82.
	   That won't be necessary for No. 6.
	   The dogleg right, its corner protected by a bunker 260 yards
(237 meters) off the tee, was ranked the No. 1 handicap hole for
the second day in a row. With a 35-mph (55-kph) wind smacking
players in the face as they stood on the tee Saturday, it played to
a staggering stroke average of 4.889.
	   Fifty of the 81 players in the field made bogey there, including
third-round leader Brian Watts, who was at even-par.
	   So did Jesper Parnevik and Mark O'Meara, two of the three
players who were in second, two strokes behind Watts. And the third
player in the group at 2-over par, Jim Furyk, made double bogey
there, which put him in another, less exclusive group. He was one
of 10 players to make double bogey or worse there.
	   And it wasn't hard to find consensus on what caused all that
aggravation.
	   ``I hit two good wood shots and I was 50 yards (45 meters)
short,'' Philip Walton said. ``Nobody can reach it with two shots _
except maybe Tiger Woods. And even he would have to hit two of the
best shots of his career.''
	   On Saturday, Woods almost did. He's been the only player so far
bold enough and long enough to fly the tee ball over the bunker
guarding the right corner of the dogleg.
	   He took that route again Saturday, but then watched helplessly
as the same wind he had defied carried his long-iron second shot
into the hay on a mound guarding the left-side entrance into the
green.
	   From there, Woods hacked a sand wedge out 25 feet (7 1/2 meters)
onto the fringe and knocked his first putt 15 feet (4 1/2 meters)
past the hole. He wound up making double bogey.
	   If he had a name for the hole he kept it to himself.

Brisbane, Australia next stop for Goodwill Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Goodwill Games are going global, moving
outside the United States and Russia for the first time with the
2001 games heading for Brisbane, Australia.
	   Ted Turner, founder of the event, made the announcement
Saturday, hours before the opening of the games in New York City.
	   Turner said he saw no problem in attracting world class athletes
back to Australia less than a year after the 2000 Olympics are held
in Sydney.
	   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``They'll have so much fun in Sydney
that a lot of them will just stay and be there 11 months later.''
	   Brisbane beat out about a half dozen other cities including
Shanghai and Rio de Janeiro to host the games. Previous Goodwill
Games have been held in Moscow (1986), Seattle (1990) and St.
Petersburg, Russia (1994). All have lost money, a total of dlrs 109
million in 12 years. The New York games, which open Sunday, have
sold about half of the 600,000 available tickets. Turner said he
was happy with that figure.
	   ``We knew this was going to be the right place to be,'' he said.
``We're at 300,000 tickets sold. That's half the tickets sold.
That's incredible for a one-time event like this. We couldn't be
more excited.''
	   Turner said the losses of the first three Goodwill Games did not
bother him.
	   ``This is a little over dlrs 1 million a day. One NFL game on
ESPN this fall, 2 1/2 hours, costs dlrs 35 million. This is small
potatoes because we do it so efficiently. This was one of the best
ideas I ever had. It's a small scale Olympics.''
	   Turner said he planned to visit as many New York venues as he
can. ``I like to sample a little of all of it,'' he said, ``like
Chinese dinner.''
	   Brisbane has experience in planning and carrying out
international events. The city previously had the 1982 Commonwealth
Games, the 1988 World Expo and the 1994 World Masters Games.
Australia also is celebrating the centennial of its federation in
2001.
	   Turner said the decision to hold the next Goodwill Games in
three years instead of four involved sponsorship dollars. ``We're
moving to a year where we're not head to head with the Olympics or
the World Cup,'' he said. ``This makes more sponsorships available.
It's a smart move on everyone's part.''
	   There is a 60-day window for the 2001 games from Sept. 1 till
the end of October, with the exact dates to be set depending on
other events in the city and country. The event will return to a
four-year rotation after that with the next ones held in 2005.
	   Turner said the games will continue to benefit children's
causes. It's original purpose was to bring together athletes of the
world during the Cold War.
	   ``Until there are no more problems with children, no abuse, no
hunger, no disease and no health care problems, the emphasis will
remain on the children,'' he said.
	   ``We have a pretty good track record. We've only had one cause
and we won that one. In six or eight years, when we solve this,
we'll move on to the next big problem.''

Guerrillas advance, Serbs shell border region

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serb counter-offensive; trims

 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army said it killed 30
	   militants in a border clash Saturday. Elsewhere, secessionists
advanced on a Kosovo town, in what ethnic Albanian sources
described as their largest offensive in almost five months of
combat.
	   The guerrilla offensive at the central Kosovo town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, seemed aimed
at expanding the estimated 30-40 percent of territory held by the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Reporting the 30 dead, a Yugoslav army statement said some 1,000
``terrorists'' had tried to cross from Albania into Kosovo, west of
Decani town. The attack was foiled and about 30 guerrillas were
``liquidated,'' said the statement.
	   In another border clash, Yugoslav forces shelled the region of
Padesh village on the Albanian border in an attempt to further
disrupt the guerrillas' gun-smuggling network into Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, which makes up most of present-day Yugoslavia.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
that crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb
attack on their villages. It is also believed used by the KLA to
smuggle guns and ammunition from northern Albania into Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 and demand
independence from Serbia.
	   The Padesh shelling ended by afternoon. Albanian border guards
reported seeing the bodies of dead and wounded victims but gave no
casualty count, said Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior
ministry, which controls the border police.
	   He said 19 wounded KLA members crossed into Albania to escape
the intense barrage. And Albania's state TV said that 80 others _
apparently civilians _ had strayed into a deadly border minefield
in their headlong rush to flee the violence. They were later
evacuated by Albanian border troops, said state TV.
	   The wounded guerrillas were helicoptered to Tirana, Albania's
capital for medical treatment. Some wore military uniforms with KLA
insignia. Reporters in Tirana said most were blood spattered, but
in most cases their wounds appeared relatively minor.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said that two
Serb mortar rounds had landed inside Albanian territory.
	   ``These dangerous incidents (could) have very dangerous
consequences,'' said Cano, hinting at the danger of a possible
Albanian military response to such violations of the country's
territorial sovereignty.
	   He said a protest had been lodged _ and a meeting demanded _
with Yugoslav authorities.
	   The Yugoslav army denied violating Albania's border.
	   None of the reports could be verified independently. But both
Serb and Kosovo Albanian sources spoke of intense fighting at
Orahovac. with the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center
calling the guerrilla assault there the largest since smoldering
ethnic hostilities flared into open warfare in February.
	   The center said the KLA offensive wrested at least one kilometer
(more than 1/2 mile) of hilly terrain from Serb control and may
have entered Orahovac, a town of 20,000.
	   A Pristina-based local journalist, who asked for anonymity, said
upon returning from the Orahovac fighting that the much of the town
had fallen to the KLA. The militants took 20 policemen into custody
and held off police reinforcements attempting to breach their
lines.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center described the fighting as a
``dramatic'' KLA assault ``from several directions'' that sent
civilians streaming from the area.
	   It said more than 40 Serb civilians had been kidnapped by ethnic
Albanian fighters. Telephone lines to Orahovac, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southwest of Pristina, went dead Saturday morning.
	   The advances provoked a Serbian counter-offensive. Reliable
witnesses near Orahovac saw Serb tanks and artillery pieces moving
to back up the counter-attack. Hundreds of civilians fled on
tractors and horse-drawn wagons.
	   In Pristina, British Embassy officials said a British aid worker
earlier feared missing was located in the southwestern town of
Djakovica, where she had been detained by Yugoslav military.
	   British officials said Sally Becker, known as the Angel of
Mostar for her humanitarian efforts in that Bosnian city during the
war, was accused of illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav border
while attempting to assist Kosovo refugees. She heads a small
humanitarian organization called Operation Angel.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said she was in
contact with ``terrorists'' in Albania and in posession of a video
tape ``undoubtedly ... meant to present a distorted situation of
Kosovo.''
	   The Yugoslav _ and Serbian _ five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash in
Kosovo not only against the government but also against Kosovo
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose commitment to nonviolence has
failed to end the bloodshed or win self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA.

71 dead after tsunami hits Papua New Guinea coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of first name of relief organizer to Austen,
establishes Sunday time element in third graf. Trims. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami swamped Papua
New Guinea's remote north coast, crushing at least four villages
and killing 71 people, the country's National Disaster Center said.
	   The 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following a magnitude-7 earthquake about 12 miles (30
kilometers) off the coast, according to the Australian Geological
Survey Organization.
	   Hundreds were missing and thousands were without food and
shelter, the disaster center said late Saturday. The Papua New
Guinea Defense Force was on standby Sunday, and police and health
services officials expected the death toll to rise.
	   ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless, and
there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,''
Austen Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of Australia's northeast tip.
	   Disaster authorities said the wave struck west of the town of
Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at least four villages _
Sissano, Warapu, Arop and Malol _ in an area spotted with homes
built with jungle materials on beaches.
	   ``At Warapu, there is no house standing. It's a village of 1,800
people,'' Crapp said. ``Arop, again, is 1,800 to 2,000 people.
There's nothing standing there. They (the two villages) are both
clean sand. It's complete devastation.''
	   A helicopter pilot who landed Saturday in nearby Aitape reported
seeing bodies floating among the debris in the lagoon, he said. A
helicopter was picking up injured people and doctors had been flown
in to treat them, Crapp said. The injured, mostly suffering cuts
and fractures, were being taken to a mission hospital at Aitape.
	   Rob Parer, a businessman who lives near Aitape, said some
villagers who fled into the jungle after the tsunami struck are
still hiding there.
	   ``The people have never heard of anything like it. They thought
the world had ended,'' Parer told ABC radio.
	   In Canberra, Australian seismologist Kevin McCue from the
Australian Geological Survey Organization said the earthquake's
epicenter was just off the town of Aitape. It struck at 0849 gmt
Friday.
	   ``It was a shallow, major earthquake,'' he said.
	   The last tsunami in the area had been in December 1930 when a
magnitude-6.5 earthquake struck the Admiralty Islands, McCue said.
	   Meanwhile, Australia said Saturday it will provide transport for
relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal
Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft now in Papua New
Guinea on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief
supplies such as tarpaulins and food.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army said it killed 30
militants in a border clash Saturday. Elsewhere in separatist
Kosovo province, secessionists advanced on a town in what ethnic
Albanian sources described as their largest offensive in almost
five months of combat.
	   The guerrilla offensive at the central Kosovo town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, seemed aimed
at expanding the estimated 30-40 percent of territory held by the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Reporting the 30 dead, a Yugoslav army statement said some 1,000
``terrorists'' tried to cross from neighboring Albania into Kosovo,
west of Decani town. The attack was foiled and about 30 guerrillas
were ``liquidated,'' said the statement.
	   In another border clash, Yugoslav forces shelled the region of
Padesh village on the Albanian border in an attempt to further
disrupt the guerrillas' gun-smuggling network into Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, which makes up most of present-day Yugoslavia.
	   Padesh served as the main route for about 13,000 Kosovo refugees
who crossed the border into Albania in June, escaping a Serb attack
on their villages. It is also believed used by the KLA to smuggle
guns and ammunition from northern Albania into Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   The Padesh shelling ended by afternoon. Albanian border guards
reported seeing the bodies of dead and wounded victims but gave no
casualty count, said Artan Bizhga of the Albanian interior
ministry, which controls the border police.
	   He said 19 wounded KLA members crossed into Albania to escape
the intense barrage. Albania's state TV said 80 others, apparently
civilians, strayed into a deadly border minefield in their headlong
rush to flee the violence. They were later evacuated by Albanian
border troops, said state TV.
	   The wounded guerrillas were flown to Tirana, Albania's capital
for medical treatment. Some wore military uniforms with KLA
insignia. Reporters in Tirana said most were blood spattered, but
in most cases, their wounds appeared relatively minor.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said that during
the most intense period of shelling, two Serb mortar rounds landed
inside Albanian territory.
	   ``These dangerous incidents (could) have very dangerous
consequences,'' said Cano, hinting at the danger of a possible
Albanian military response to such violations of the country's
territorial sovereignty.
	   He said a protest had been lodged and a meeting demanded with
Yugoslav authorities.
	   The Yugoslav army denied violating Albania's border.
	   None of the reports could be verified independently. But both
Serb and Kosovo Albanian sources spoke of intense fighting at
Orahovac. The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center called the
guerrilla assault the largest since smoldering ethnic hostilities
flared into open warfare in February.
	   The center said the KLA offensive wrested at least one kilometer
(more than 1/2 mile) of hilly terrain from Serb control and may
have entered Orahovac, a town of 20,000.
	   A local journalist based the provincial capital Pristina, who
asked for anonymity, said upon returning from the Orahovac fighting
that the much of the town fell to the KLA. The militants took 20
policemen into custody and held off police reinforcements.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center described the fighting as a
``dramatic'' KLA assault ``from several directions'' that sent
civilians streaming from the area and resulted in the kidnapping of
more than 40 Serb civilians. Telephone lines to Orahovac, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, went dead Saturday
morning.
	   The advances provoked a Serbian counter-offensive. Reliable
witnesses near Orahovac saw Serb tanks and artillery pieces moving
to back up the counter-attack. Hundreds of civilians fled on
tractors and horse-drawn wagons.

	   MADISON, Miss. (AP) _ Mike Brisky shot a 66 Saturday, including
a birdie at the 17th hole where two other leaders faltered, to earn
a share of the lead after three rounds of the Deposit Guaranty Golf
Classic.
	   Fred Funk followed his second-round 64, the best of the
tournament, with a 69 on Saturday to match Brisky at 14-under 202.
	   On Annandale Golf Club's signature hole, Brisky hit his drive
into the island fairway. A pitching wedge to four feet set up a
birdie putt that gave him the lead at 14-under.
	   No. 17, a 409-yard (374-meter) par 4, gives players the option
of the island fairway that Brisky chose or a supposed safe play
down the left fairway that Doug Tewell chose.
	   ``It is a tough fairway to hit and is a risk-reward with not
only the water, but the rough,'' said Brisky, who has birdies there
the last two days. ``The way the PGA Tour is setting it up, the tee
is all the way to the right, trying to force us down the left.''
	   Tewell's drive wound up in the rough, forcing him to approach
over water and a three-putt dropped him to 12-under.
	   Tewell, who shot 72, was tied with Franklin Langham and Paul
Goydos two strokes behind the leaders. Five others were at 11-under
205.
	   Langham, playing in the same group with Brisky, had just taken a
one-stroke lead after a birdie at No. 16 got him to 15-under. But
he had a triple bogey at No. 17 when his drive hit a tree and fell
short into the light rough just short of a hazard.
	   His second shot flew over the green into a washed-out area among
several trees. His shot out of the pines raced about 75 feet (23
meters) past the hole to set up a three-putt.
	   Brisky was just 1-under on the day until an eagle-3 at the 11th
hole when he holed a sand wedge from 83 yards (75 meters). He was
5-under the final eight holes.
	   ``Before No. 11, I was not doing anything and guys were passing
me,'' Brisky said. ``It took me a while to get something going. I
hit every green on the front nine. No. 11 jumped-started me, and I
got a birdie on the next hole.''
	   Brisky has never won on the PGA Tour, his best finish a loss in
a playoff to playoff.
	   Funk, who has had three top-five finishes in his last four
tournaments, had a two-putt birdie on the 532-yard (486-meter) 18th
hole for a share of the lead.
	   ``I was trying to figure out how I could get into the last
group, but it didn't look like it was going to happen,'' Funk said.
``Franklin had his trouble at 17 and then Doug had his trouble
there. The field came back and allowed me to jump up.''
	   Funk was just 1-under before making a 25-foot (7 1/2-meter)
birdie putt on the 176-yard (160-meter) 15th hole. He missed a
short birdie putt at 16 before getting a shot back at 18.
	   Tewell, who entered the third round tied with Goydos for the
lead, started with four pars before a chip-in eagle at No. 5, a
522-yard (477-meter) par-5. He played even par from there until his
trouble at No. 17.
	   Goydos, who like Tewell had consecutive 66s to start the
tournament, was even Saturday before bogeys at the par-5 11th and
the par-3 12th. He got the two strokes back down the stretch to end
with a 72.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Tropical storm Celia moved away from the Baja
California coast Saturday and headed out into the Pacific,
prompting Mexican authorities to lift a tropical storm warning for
the southern part of the peninsula.
	   The storm will continue to travel out to sea and weaken, the
National Hurricane Center in Miami predicted, while noting that
``rough seas and gusty winds are likely to persist over adjacent
marine areas for the next day or two.''
	   Celia's winds weakened to about 50 mph (80 kph) by Saturday,
when the storm was located about 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of
Cabo San Lucas, Baja California, moving in a generally western
direction at about 14 mph (22 kph).
	   The ports of Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo were closed to
sea traffic as a result of the 12-foot (3.6-meter) waves kicked up
by the storm, local media reported.

	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Purdue center Brad Miller paced five
players in double figures with 17 points as the USA Basketball
Men's World Championship team routed France 93-63 Saturday night in
an exhibition game.
	   The U.S. jumped to a 10-2 lead in the first five minutes and led
all the way. Miller and Wendell Alexis, a former Syracuse standout,
had 11 points each as the Americans built a 47-21 halftime
advantage.
	   ``I was extremely pleased with our performance, especially on
the defensive end,'' USA coach Rudy Tomjanovich of the Houston
Rockets said. ``This team hasn't been together for a long time and
we have to establish an identity and a style of play that is best
for us to be successful and I feel that it has to start on the
defensive end. We're probably going to be smaller than most teams,
so we have to be very aggressive on that end of the court.''
	   The exhibition was one of three scheduled in Europe for the USA
team before it begins World Championship play. The Americans will
play the Spanish National Team on Sunday in Monte Carlo, and the
Italian National Team in Rome on July 25.

Pottery suggests tourist beach may hold ruins of Indian chief's
</HEADLINE>
house &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A hunk of pottery dug up by
a vacationing college student suggests an Indian chief's house once
stood on one of the most popular beaches in the U.S. Caribbean.
	   Archaeologists said Saturday that the shard from Cinnamon Bay on
the island of St. John shows a ``zemi,'' a god worshipped by the
Taino, a pre-Colombian Indian tribe. Only Taino nobles were allowed
to have such figures in their homes.
	   ``It represented prestige,'' said archaeologist Sharon Fulcome.
``It represented social hierarchy, even fertility. So it's an
interesting symbol and leads us to believe that we have found
perhaps the chief's house.''
	   The fragment was hidden under about 20 centimeters (8 inches) of
sand on Cinnamon Bay beach. It was found by Destin Schnell, a Texas
A and M University student who volunteered to work on an
archaeological dig at the site.
	   Researchers recently received a dlrs 250,000 grant to search the
beach for signs of a Taino encampment.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Appealing to the United States to sign on, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday hailed a treaty creating
the world's first international war crimes tribunal as a ``giant
step forward.''
	   Annan spoke at a signing ceremony in Rome for the historic
treaty, which won overwhelming approval Friday night after nearly
five weeks of talks and years of preliminary negotiations. The
United States delegation did not attend the ceremony.
	   France was among the first to sign the document, but U.N.
officials declined to say how many other countries did so. Many of
the delegations did not have representatives with the power to sign
the treaty. The nations have until 2000 to sign.
	   ``It's a great hope and a giant step forward in the rule of law
that a few years ago nobody would have thought possible,'' Annan
said.
	   The new court will be a permanent tribunal for what the treaty
calls ``the most serious crimes of international concern'' _
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression. The
treaty will define ``agression'' at a later date, and until then it
would not fall in the court's jurisdiction.
	   The idea was born half a century ago with the Nuremberg
tribunals that tried Nazi war criminals. It languished during the
Cold War, then was reborn with the ad hoc tribunals set up a few
years ago for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
	   Ironically, the United States _ a moving force behind these
earlier tribunals _ fought hard to limit the reach of the new
court.
	   Failing to curb the court to its satisfaction, the United States
was one of only seven nations voting against the treaty; 120
countries, including most of America's best allies, voted for it.
	   Humanitarian and human rights groups lobbied hard for the court
and they praised the final treaty, although many had hoped for even
broader jurisdiction.
	   ``No doubt many of us would have liked a court vested with even
more powers,'' Annan said. ``But we must not minimize the
breakthrough of this achievement.''
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday urged
governments to ratify the treaty. It goes into effect once 60 have
ratified it.
	   ``The road ahead of us is still long and war criminals must be
swiftly and relentlessly prosecuted so that the law has a deterrent
effect for the benefit of all those whom they would otherwise
massacre, loot, rape and torture,'' it said.
	   Like the United States, France went into the talks seeking to
protect its troops abroad from politically motivated prosecutions
and at first it seemed France would be a powerful ally for the
United States in its bid to limit the court.
	   But France, unlike the United States, ended up happy with the
numerous safeguards built into the pact.
	   U.S. negotiators wanted more than safeguards; they wanted the
option to veto the prosecution of any American citizen. With U.S.
troops deployed in hot spots around the world, Washington fears
they could become targets of politically motivated charges.
	   The United States tried several strategies to accomplish its
goal, but without success. One would have given the Security
Council ultimate say over the court. Since the U.S. has a veto on
the council, it would have been able to veto a prosecution of an
American.
	   But such escape hatches wouldn't have been exclusive; many
feared the Hitlers of the world could also jump through them.
	   The question now is what the United States will do. It has
repeatedly warned that the court would have a tough time without
U.S. money and muscle and some fear it will try and discourage
countries from ratifying the treaty.
	   ``I hope the U.S. and other countries will come aboard,'' Annan
said. ``I hope the U.S. position is not final. I regret we couldn't
bridge all the differences.''

United States delegation did not attend the ceremony.
	   France was among the first to sign the document, but U.N.
officials declined to say how many other countries did so. Many of
the delegations did not have representatives with the power to sign
the treaty. The nations have until 2000 to sign.
	   ``It's a great hope and a giant step forward in the rule of law
that a few years ago nobody would have thought possible,'' Annan
said.
	   The new court will be a permanent tribunal for what the treaty
calls ``the most serious crimes of international concern'' _
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression. The
treaty will define ``aggression'' at a later date, and until then
it would not fall in the court's jurisdiction.
	   The idea was, 6th graf pvs.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new games. DELETES outdated material &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 
 &UR; Dodgers 10, Cardinals 8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Gary Sheffield and Matt Luke each hit two-run
homers in the eighth inning and the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied
past the St. Louis Cardinals 10-8 Saturday.
	   Raul Mondesi and Tripp Cromer also homered for the Dodgers, who
tied a season high with four homers.
	   Ray Lankford and newcomer Pat Kelly connected for the Cardinals,
who led 7-2 after four innings.
	   After hitting two home runs the day before, Mark McGwire went
0-for-4 for St. Louis. He also drew his 100th walk.
	   The Cardinals led 8-6 going into the eighth, but the Dodgers
came back against Jeff Brantley (0-5), who blew his sixth save in
20 chances.
	   Mark Guthrie (2-1) pitched a scoreless seventh to get the win.
Jeff Shaw pitched the eighth and ninth for his 25th save and second
with the Dodgers.
 &UR; Mets 7, Phillies 0
	   In New York, Mike Piazza homered twice and Al Leiter pitched six
scoreless innings in his first start since spending three weeks on
the disabled list as the New York Mets beat the Philadelphia
Phillies.
	   Leiter (10-4) went on the disabled list on June 27 after he
partially tore a tendon in his left knee covering first base
against the Yankees. In his return, he allowed two hits and struck
out four.
	   Greg McMichael and Dennis Cook finished off the three-hitter as
the Mets recorded consecutive shutouts for the first time since May
1996 when they blanked San Francisco and San Diego.
	   The Phillies have been shut out five times this season, four by
the Mets.
	   Leiter is 7-1 in his last eight starts, losing the game in which
he was injured. He lowered his ERA to 1.76, second best in the
majors.
	   Piazza homered twice in a game for the third time this season,
and for the first time since joining the Mets in late May. He hit a
two-run shot in the first and solo shot in the sixth, his 16th, off
Tyler Green (6-6).
 &UR; Astros 7, Giants 2
	   In Houston, Ricky Gutierrez and Derek Bell hit home runs and
Sean Bergman pitched seven strong innings, leading the Houston
Astros over the San Francisco Giants.
	   The Giants have lost seven of eight games since the All-Star
break.
	   The Astros broke open the game by scoring four times in the
eighth. Bell and Carl Everett hit RBI doubles, Gutierrez had a
sacrifice fly and another run scored on a wild pitch.
	   San Francisco starter Danny Darwin (6-7) allowed only one runner
to reach second base until Gutierrez led off the fifth inning with
a home run, breaking a scoreless game.
	   Bergman (9-5) allowed seven hits, struck out five and walked
one.

Scientist dies trying to swim around Channel island, aged 74
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British scientist aged 74 died Saturday after
trying to swim around the Channel island of Sark to repeat a
challenge he had successfully undertaken for the first time 25
years earlier.
	   Police said Sir James Lighthill, an expert in aerodynamics, was
found in rough seas off the island's coast, more than nine hours
after he began the 9 mile (15 kms) swim around Sark, one of a group
of small islands in the English Channel.
	   ``He had apparently swum around the island six times over the
years, but this time he didn't make it,'' said Inspector Paul Gill,
from the neighboring island of Guernsey. ``The tides are pretty big
around Sark and there are some ferocious currents. The last time he
was seen he was swimming against a strong tide.''
	   Gill said he did not know a cause of death for the scientist,
who was on holiday on the island with his wife Nancy, and their
son.
	   ``He may have drowned, but he could have had a heart attack or
hypothermia,'' Gill said.
	   Sir James won a scholarship to Cambridge University aged 15 and
joined the teaching staff of the university when he was 21. He
later worked at the National Physics Laboratory, southwest London,
and was director of the Royal Aircraft Establishment from 1959 to
1964.
	   One of his main interests was fluid dynamics _ the science of
the movement of water _ and he used his expertise to calculate the
best way to swim round Sark in 1973.

71 dead after tsunami hits Papua New Guinea coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS some breakdown of deaths, damage in villages hit by
tsunami. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami swamped Papua
New Guinea's remote north coast, crushing at least four villages
and killing 71 people, the country's National Disaster Center said.
	   The 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following a magnitude-7 earthquake about 12 miles (30
kilometers) off the coast, according to the Australian Geological
Survey Organization.
	   Hundreds were missing and thousands were without food and
shelter, the disaster center said late Saturday. The Papua New
Guinea Defense Force was on standby Sunday, and police and health
services officials expected the death toll to rise.
	   ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless, and
there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,''
Austen Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of Australia's northeast tip.
	   Disaster authorities said the wave struck west of the town of
Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at least four villages _
Sissano, Warapu, Arop and Malol _ in an area spotted with homes
built with jungle materials on beaches.
	   ``At Warapu, there is no house standing. It's a village of 1,800
people,'' Crapp said. ``Arop, again, is 1,800 to 2,000 people.
There's nothing standing there. They (the two villages) are both
clean sand. It's complete devastation.''
	   A helicopter pilot who landed Saturday in nearby Aitape reported
seeing bodies floating among the debris in the lagoon, he said. A
helicopter was picking up injured people and doctors had been flown
in to treat them, Crapp said. The injured, mostly suffering cuts
and fractures, were being taken to a mission hospital at Aitape.
	   Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said in a
statement that a community school, government station, Catholic
mission station and the Nimas village in the Sissano area west of
Aitape was completely destroyed. Thirty people were confirmed dead.
	   The Warapu village was completely destroyed, with 11 confirmed
deaths and many missing, Igara said. Sixteen people were confirmed
dead in the devastated Arop village, and two children died in
Malol, which was wiped out. Five people died in the Teles-Lambu
villages.
	   Igara said reports indicated 15 homes were destroyed in the
Yakoi village, but there was no deaths or injuries. Six houses were
damaged in Aitape and an adjoining settlement was completely
destroyed, but there were no reports of deaths or missing people.
	   Igara said the population in the area affected by the tsunami
was 8,000 to 10,000 people.
	   ``Officers are now visiting the affected villages and areas to
establish the whereabouts, safety and health of the population,''
he said.
	   Rob Parer, a businessman who lives near Aitape, said some
villagers who fled into the jungle after the tsunami struck are
still hiding there.
	   ``The people have never heard of anything like it. They thought
the world had ended,'' Parer told ABC radio.
	   In Canberra, Australian seismologist Kevin McCue from the
Australian Geological Survey Organization said the earthquake's
epicenter was just off the town of Aitape. It struck at 0849 gmt
Friday.
	   ``It was a shallow, major earthquake,'' he said.
	   The last tsunami in the area had been in December 1930 when a
magnitude-6.5 earthquake struck the Admiralty Islands, McCue said.
	   Meanwhile, Australia said Saturday it will provide transport for
relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal
Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft now in Papua New
Guinea on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief
supplies such as tarpaulins and food.

Irwin extends lead in Ameritech Senior
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONG GROVE, Illinois (AP) _ Hale Irwin continued his assault on
the record books Saturday, shooting a 66 and taking an eight-stroke
lead after two rounds in the Ameritech Senior Open.
	   His 16-under 128 tied the record for 36 holes in relation to par
set by Irwin in last year's Vantage Championship. He also tied the
Senior PGA Tour record for largest lead, initially set by Arnold
Palmer in the 1984 Seniors Championship and tied three other times.
	   Irwin, the senior tour's money leader, set a course record with
a 10-under 62 Friday.
	   ``He's beating the tar out of all of us,'' said Bruce
Summerhays, who is at 8-under 136 after shooting a 68. ``It appears
we're all playing for second.''
	   Joining Summerhays at 136 was Larry Nelson, who shot a 67
Saturday. Tied at 137 were Ray Floyd (66), Leonard Thompson (68)
and Hugh Baiocchi (71).
	   Defending champion Gil Morgan had a rough day, shooting a 73
that left him 14 strokes back.
	   As in his record-setting first round, Irwin's strong short game
carried him Saturday. On the par-4 fourth, after putting his second
shot into a sand trap on the right of the green, he blasted out to
within six feet (1.83 meters) of the pin. He sank it for a birdie,
and then made another short birdie putt on No. 5.
	   He finished the front nine with two spectacular birdie putts. He
sank a 15-foot (4.57 meters), slightly uphill putt on the eighth.
On No. 9, his 18-footer (5.5-meter) from the fringe hit the back of
the cup and dropped in as the crowd roared.
	   After parring the 10th, Irwin took a little break. He headed
into the gallery and sat in an empty lawnchair, chatting with
spectators as he watched playing partners Baiocchi and Joe Inman
finish out the hole.
	   Irwin might have gotten a little too relaxed. He bogeyed the
par-3 13th _ his first of the tournament _ after his 10-foot
(3-meter) putt hit the right edge of the cup and skipped out.
	   Looking disgusted, Irwin tapped in for bogey, which left him at
14-under. He got the stroke back with a birdie on the next hole.
	   He birdied No. 18 for the second straight day, putting his
second shot five feet from the pin. The crowd cheered as he knocked
it in and Irwin tipped his baseball hat as he walked off the green.
	   With Irwin so far ahead, Nelson, Summerhays and Floyd's fine
rounds went practically unnoticed. Nelson had birdies on Nos. 2, 4,
8, 11 and 15, and made it through the day without a bogey.
	   Summerhays eagled No. 7. After his second shot sailed past the
green onto the fringe, about 45 feet from the hole, he chipped in
for a 3 on the par-5 hole. He also had four birdies.
	   Floyd's 66 tied Irwin for the best round of the day. He had
seven birdies, including back-to-back on Nos. 17 and 18.
 &UR; Divots: &LR;  Irwin has now shot 10 consecutive sub-70 rounds, and is
79-under through his last 18 rounds. ... Don Bies (1989 Murata
Seniors Reunion), Isao Aoki (1998 BellSouth Senior Classic) and
Nelson (Pittsburgh Senior Classic) also share the record for
largest lead. Aoki also tied Irwin's record for 36 holes in
relation to par. ... Ameritech announced Saturday it will continue
sponsoring the Senior Open at Kemper Lakes Golf Club through 2001.
... Gary McCord, part of CBS' announcing crew, will make his senior
debut in next week's U.S. Senior Open at Riviera. ... Kemper Lakes
pro Emil Esposito's woes on his home course continued. Esposito,
who opened with a 14-over 86, shot a 78, putting him at 20-over 164
after two rounds.

Brazilian police shut down clandestine pharmacies

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian police have launched a
nationwide sweep aimed at curbing the illegal trade in prescription
medications by arresting the sellers and seizing medicines.
	   Police in Brazil's two major cities on Friday and Saturday
seized hundreds of boxes of prescription drugs, phony drugs and
medicines stolen from hospitals, the news media reported Saturday.
	   The police campaign to ferret out illegal drug vendors began
early this month after at least 13 women became pregnant after
taking fake contraceptives.
	   ``Nobody is safe,'' Dr. Antonio Carlos Zanini, a consultant for
the World Health Organization, told Veja, the nation's leading news
magazine.
	   The problem of stolen and counterfeit or fake drugs stems partly
from the Brazilian propensity to overmedicate. Half of all
prescribed medicines in Brazil are considered unnecessary, Veja
quoted the Ministry of Health as saying.
	   Brazil currently has 55,000 pharmacies, but Veja quoted World
Health Organization officials as saying that 25,000 pharmacies
would be an ideal number. Brazil is the world's fourth largest
consumer of pharmaceuticals.
	   Health authorities also concede that lax enforcement has caused
a proliferation of false and stolen drugs in recent years.
	   Moreover, the federal government has only 1,400 inspectors to
monitor all pharmacies, 400 laboratories, 7,000 distributors, and
600 airports and ports, according to Veja.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, police confiscated drugs found at two illegal
selling sites Friday in the city's largest slum, Rochina. Most of
the medicines were taken from public hospitals.
	   Also on Friday, Sao Paulo police closed down an illegal drug
distribution center in the Sapopemba neighborhood. On Saturday,
authorities discovered 400 boxes of medicines with expired labels
in an abandoned field.
	   The Justice Ministry recently formed a special federal police
agency to combat counterfeit drugs and created a special hot line
for consumers to report illegal operations.

Talks end without agreement between Orangemen, Catholic residents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS thruout with talks ending without agreement

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Negotiators said Saturday that
talks between the Orange Order and residents of a Catholic
neighborhood who don't want the Protestant fraternal order marching
down their street had ended without agreement.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said his chief of staff,
Jonathan Powell, oversaw the contacts, in which the two sides
communicated through mediators but did not speak directly to each
other. Similar talks broke down after a few hours a week ago.
	   Some progress was made in the talks, which lasted throughout the
day and evening Saturday, a statement from the go-betweens said.
	   ``We were negotiating on a text today. Some progress was made
but we were unable to reach agreement,'', the statement said. ``We
will stay in close contact with the parties with the aim of
resuming talks when further progress can be made.''
	   Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, had said that the prime
minister did not expect all the issues dividing the two sides to be
settled in one day.
	   Earlier Saturday, Breandan MacCionnaith, leader of the Catholic
residents' association, said the talks had been constructive.
	   ``We have had a couple of very good sessions this morning,'' he
said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio. ``We
will come back as often as it takes.''
	   Police and soldiers, enforcing an order by Northern Ireland's
Parades Commission, prevented the Orange Order from marching down
the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast, on July 5.
	   Orangemen massed on the hillside near a rural church every night
for a week, underlining their determination to follow their
traditional parade route. The numbers of protester fell sharply
after a firebomb killed three children of a Catholic woman last
Sunday, and police moved in on Wednesday to search the fields for
weapons.
	   The Portadown Orange lodges have been allowed to maintain a
token presence near the church, although the Church of Ireland said
earlier this week that the Orangemen were no longer welcome to use
church property.

	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami crashed against
Papua New Guinea's north coast, crushing several coastal villages

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles,
Luciano Pavarotti, David Hasselhoff, Spain's Princess Elena. Some
items may also have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles dined
with friends at an exclusive club Friday, on the eve of her 51st
birthday.
	   The meal with 10 friends was to celebrate the birthday of the
host, travel company boss Geoffrey Kent, a polo-playing friend of
the prince, according to a spokesman for Charles, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   According to the Daily Mail, the prince and Mrs. Parker Bowles
arrived separately, but left together at 10.30 p.m.
	   After spending the night at St James's Palace, Mrs. Parker
Bowles returned to her home, the paper said. The prince went to
Buckingham Palace.
	   Last year Charles organized a party at his Gloucestershire home
to mark Mrs. Parker Bowles's 50th birthday.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jim Poulos, the narrator in the Broadway musical
``Rent,'' knew that Luciano Pavarotti would be attending the show.
	   So, while singing one line, Poulos pulled out a big white
handkerchief, like Pavarotti does in concerts, and flapped it
around, dramatically Thursday. He hoped the famous tenor would
accept that as the homage it was meant to be and not be offended,
Poulos said Friday.
	   Pavarotti went backstage at the intermission and met Poulos and
didn't mention it, which Poulos took as acceptance.
	   Pavarotti complimented the production for having young
performers and told Poulos the original _ 1897 _ cast of ``La
Boheme,'' the opera on which ``Rent'' bases its plot, was young.
``He seemed excited about the show and hugged me,'' Poulos said.
	   Poulos saw his first ``La Boheme'' in San Francisco in 1985 and
saw the Australian Opera's video of the opera. ``The singers were
young and thin,'' he said. ``You believed all these people were
probably starving.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``Baywatch'' star David Hasselhoff celebrated
his 40th birthday in TV hero style _ by plummeting from an
airplane.
	   The actor made his first parachute jump on his birthday Friday.
He became one of the few civilians to jump with the Army's elite
parachute team, the Golden Knights.
	   Wearing a gold-colored jumpsuit, Hasselhoff's jump included a
60-second free fall before his chute opened and he landed at Van
Nuys Airport.
	   During the tandem jump his instructor, U.S. Army Sgt. Shane
Hollar, was fastened to the actor's back and they shared a
parachute.
	   He was met later by his wife, two daughters and his father, all
holding handmade ``Happy Birthday'' signs.
	   Hasselhoff, also a singer, said the jump wasn't too scary.
	   ``I was more terrified at the Princess Diana benefit concert
because I didn't know all the words to my song,'' Hasselhoff said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Princess Elena gave birth Friday to
a boy, the Spanish royal couple's first grandchild, the Zarzuela
Palace said.
	   Elena, in her mid-30s, the eldest daughter of King Juan Carlos
and Queen Sofia, gave birth shortly after 2 a.m. in a Madrid
clinic.
	   The child is to be called Felipe Juan Froilan de Todos los
Santos, the palace said in a statement.
	   Elena is married to banker Jaime de Marichalar. A teacher and
skilled equestrian, she is second in line to the Spanish throne
after her brother Prince Felipe, who is single.
	   The family's younger daughter, Princess Cristina, is married but
childless.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami swamped Papua
New Guinea's remote north coast, crushing at least four villages
and killing 71 people, the country's National Disaster Center said.
The 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following a magnitude-7 earthquake about 12 miles (30
kilometers) off the coast, according to the Australian Geological
Survey Organization. Hundreds were missing and thousands were
without food and shelter, the disaster center said late Saturday.
The Papua New Guinea Defense Force was on standby Sunday, and
police and health services officials expected the death toll to
rise. ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless,
and there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or
missing,'' Austen Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio. (PAPUA NEW GUINEA-TIDAL WAVE)
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ On the eve of the first high-level
contact in months, the Palestinian's chief negotiator said his side
is willing only to listen to the Israelis _ not to renegotiate a
U.S. pullback plan. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy
Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai were
to meet Sunday in Tel Aviv at the urging of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. ``Our agenda is to listen to what Mr. Mordechai
tells us,'' said chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat,
referring to an American initiative for an Israeli pullback from
the West Bank. ``We just don't want to be blamed for not going, and
that's why we're going,'' he said. The Palestinians have accepted
the proposal for Israel to withdraw from another 13 percent of the
West Bank and the PLO Executive Committee to annul parts of the PLO
charter calling for Israel's destruction. Israel has balked,
insisting the covenant be rescinded by the much larger Palestine
National Council. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces shelled villages along a
gunrunning route used by ethnic Albanian guerrillas and the
Yugoslav army claimed to kill 30 rebels in a separate operation
that foiled a mass infiltration from neighboring Albania. The
secessionists, meanwhile, also claimed successes in their fight for
independence for Kosovo province, part of the Yugoslav republic of
Serbia. Kosovo Liberation Army fighters launched a major offensive
Saturday on a Serb-held town that appeared to be a grab for
territory. Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo,
control an estimated 40 percent of Kosovo. In reporting the 30
dead, a Yugoslav army statement said 1,000 ``terrorists'' tried to
cross from Albania into Kosovo, west of Decani town. About 30 were
``liquidated'' and the incursion was foiled, it said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Exchanging diamond-studded
gold rings and a lingering kiss, President Nelson Mandela capped
his 80th birthday by marrying Graca Machel, the widow of a
Mozambican president and black liberation leader. Just hours after
the president's press aides denied the marriage would happen _
saying Mandela would quietly celebrate his birthday at home _
Mandela wed the 52-year-old Machel. Relatives and close friends,
including fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu, were
present Saturday as the couple were married by Methodist Bishop
Mvuve Dandala. Mirroring a spirit of multi-cultural diversity
Mandela has fostered in South Africa, the Jewish, Hindu and Muslim
communities also gave their blessings to the marriage. Tutu, a
retired Anglican archbishop who had chided Mandela for setting a
bad example for the nation's youth by carrying on a relationship
with Machel outside marriage, helped officiate. A magistrate was
also present. (SOUTH AFRICA-MANDELA WEDDING)
	   ROME (AP) _ Appealing to the United States to sign on, U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan hailed a treaty creating the world's
first international war crimes tribunal as a ``giant step
forward.'' Annan spoke Saturday at a signing ceremony in Rome for
the historic treaty, which won overwhelming approval Friday night
after nearly five weeks of talks and years of preliminary
negotiations. The United States delegation did not attend the
ceremony. France was among the first to sign the document, but U.N.
officials declined to say how many other countries joined did so.
Many of the delegations did not have representatives with the power
to sign the treaty. The nations have until the year 2000 to sign.

Palestinians: no renegotiation of U.S. pullback terms

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Palestinian's chief negotiator
says his side is willing only to listen to the Israelis, not to
renegotiate a U.S. pullback plan, as the two sides head into their
first high-level contact in months.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas and
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai were to meet Sunday in
Tel Aviv at the urging of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
	   ``Our agenda is to listen to what Mr. Mordechai tells us,'' said
chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, referring to an American
initiative for an Israeli pullback from the West Bank.
	   ``We just don't want to be blamed for not going, and that's why
we're going,'' he said Saturday. ``Albright told us that the
Israelis have ideas.''
	   The Palestinians have accepted the proposal for Israel to
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank and the PLO
Executive Committee to annul parts of the PLO charter calling for
Israel's destruction. Israel has balked, insisting the covenant be
rescinded by the much larger Palestine National Council.
	   Erekat said the Palestinian delegations have been assured that
the initiative is not up for renegotiation and said the
Palestinians ``will not accept that the initiative's separate
elements be revisited.''
	   Israeli media speculated Mordechai planned to suggest setting up
joint Palestinian-Israeli committees to discuss redeployment, the
PLO charter and security issues. The committees would conclude
their work within a week, according to the reports.
	   The United States has urged the sides to hold two or three
meetings within a week to try to resolve their differences over the
Israeli troop withdrawal and procedures for amending the
Palestinian national covenant.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians
``will not back down one inch.''
	   ``If the Israelis don't accept the U.S. initiative tomorrow, we
will go to our American friends with a very clear message: `We have
accepted the minimum, the minimum is not attainable _ you take the
next step,''' Shaath said.
	   Meanwhile, in the tense West Bank town of Hebron, Palestinians
clashed Saturday with Israeli soldiers. Two Palestinian youths were
detained after throwing rocks at Jewish settlers, Israeli police
said. In another incident in Hebron, an Israeli soldier was
slightly wounded when hit by a fire bomb thrown at his patrol, the
army reported.
	   Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani also met Saturday with
Arafat in Ramallah to review the latest developments in the peace
process ahead of Anani's meeting Sunday with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``The current situation is sensitive and the region will witness
changes on the different tracks,'' said Anani, who also serves as
deputy prime minister. He refused to go into detail, but implied he
was referring to separate talks involving Syria and Lebanon.

Watts holding steady in fierce winds of British Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Now comes the real test.
	   Brian Watts walked off the 18th green Saturday, the wind
whistling in his ears one last time on a day when it refused to let
anyone break par in the third round of the British Open.
	   It carried a message for Watts, the last survivor of par at
Royal Birkdale, and for Jim Furyk, who finds himself in contention
for the first time in a major.
	   Justin Rose heard the wind, too. The 17-year-old was carried
along by the cheers of an ecstatic gallery, wondering if he can
become the first British amateur to win the Open since Harold
Hilton in 1897.
	   The cruel conditions, which knocked out Nick Price with an 82
and stymied Tiger Woods with a 77, now have an ally: the Sunday
pressure of winning a major championship.
	   ``I've never been in the last group of any major championship,
much less the Open,'' said the 32-year-old Watts, who salvaged a
3-over 73 that left him alone in the lead, the only player at
even-par 210.
	   ``I felt a lot of pressure from the get-go, ever since
yesterday, actually,'' he said. ``I think I handled it pretty well.
Obviously, it's going to be tough again tomorrow.''
	   Furyk showed he has the game it takes to win such a tough test
of golf. He made 11 pars and a birdie over the last 12 holes for a
72, putting him two strokes back with Jesper Parnevik and Masters
champion Mark O'Meara.
	   ``This is the closest I've been to a lead in a major, so I'm
looking at all the positive sides,'' Furyk said. ``I have a chance
to win my first major, so I'm excited.''
	   Nothing can top the excitement of Rose, who was met with cheers
at every turn of an otherwise torturous third round. His 75 put him
three strokes back at 213.
	   ``It's going to take a monumental effort, but I'm not predicting
anything,'' Rose said.
	   Among those trying to chase Watts down _ or hope that he passes
them going the other direction _ are two guys who have been there
before: O'Meara, who finished third at Birkdale in 1991; and
Parnevik, the Open runner-up in 1994 and last year at Royal Troon.
	   Parnevik made a 6-footer (1.83-meter) for bogey on No. 18 for a
2-over 72. ``This was all I asked for today, another chance,'' he
said.
	   O'Meara, trying to become the first player since Nick Faldo in
1990 to win the Masters and the British Open in the same year,
played the difficult back nine in 2 under for a 72.
	   His biggest break came on No. 6, when he presumed his ball was
lost. Spectators found it at the last minute, but then a fan put
the ball in his pocket. O'Meara was given a free drop and left with
a bogey.
	   ``I like my position,'' O'Meara said. ``You've got to have a lot
of patience out there.''
	   Carried along by cheers of ``Go on, Justin'' by Brits who leaned
over the ropes to pat him on the back, Rose was tied for the lead
at even-par through nine holes until his errant tee shots finally
caught up with him.
	   ``I just felt tremendous,'' said Rose, who doesn't look like he
needs to shave yet. ``It was amazing how many people knew my name.
Obviously, I felt great. But I wasn't uncomfortable with the
situation.''
	   Neither was Watts, who earns his keep on the Japanese tour.
	   Starting the day at 3 under, he finally lost his lead with
back-to-back bogeys starting on No. 6, but never lost his
composure. He birdied the 498-yard (455-meter) 13th hole, a par 4
that plays downwind, with an approach that stopped 2 feet (0.61
meters) behind the cup, then got back to even-par with a two-putt
birdie on the par-5 17th.
	   ``I can't say I enjoy playing in situations with these winds,''
he said. ``I'm just trying to handle the conditions.''
	   The average score was 77.5 and some of them were shocking.
Defending champion Justin Leonard stretched out his arms and smiled
when a 12-foot (3.6-meter) par putt fell on the 18th hole for an
82.
	   ``I'm going to go home and watch TV, and laugh at the guys
playing,'' Leonard said.
	   Indeed, the joke was on anyone still on the course.
	   ``When you've got 82 of world's greatest professionals and
nobody breaks par, something is amiss,'' said Price, who was in the
lead until he made bogey or worse on six consecutive holes.
	   The last time a score over par won the British Open was in 1985,
when Sandy Lyle had a 2-over 282 at Royal St. George. That almost
certainly will be the case on Sunday unless the wind relents.
	   ``You're upset because your score is so high, but you're happy
it's over _ the suffering is over,'' Woods said.
	   With whitecaps dancing across the Irish Sea and the flagsticks
whipping so hard it was a wonder they stayed in the holes, only
Costantino Rocca came close to breaking par, until his 20-foot
(6.10-meter) birdie putt stopped an inch (centimeter) short on No.
18. He and Katsuyoshi Tomori were the only players to match par at
70.
	   Curtis Strange finished his round of 74 and was headed toward
the broadcast booth when he was stopped by Butch Harmon, Woods'
coach.
	   ``There's a bunch of guys who would love to have that score
today,'' Harmon told him.
	   He was right, and Woods was one of them.
	   In contention for the first time since winning the Masters in
1997, Woods lipped out a 70-foot birdie putt and then missed a
5-footer (1.52-meter) for birdie on the third hole that would have
put him in the lead.
	   He proceeded to bogey the next two holes, then took a double
bogey on No. 6 and began his procession down the leaderboard.
	   He finished at 215, along with John Huston (73), Brad Faxon (74)
and Denmark's Thomas Bjorn (76).
	   ``Just trying to hit shots out there was very difficult,'' Woods
said. ``I'm in pretty good shape _ only five back. I'll try to post
a good number and see what happens.''
	   Paired with Price, this figured to be the twosome that put up
the best fight _ Woods with his talent and length, Price with his
savvy in the wind. Both struggled to maintain their balance over
putts, and they didn't make many.
	   ``When it's windy like this, you walk a very fine line,'' Price
said. ``And I just got on the wrong side of the line.''
	   He wasn't alone. Davis Love III shot a 77 and was at 217. Fred
Couples hacked his way to a double bogey on the first hole with
Prince Andrew watching and shot a 7-over 41 on the front. He closed
with a birdie for a 78 and was at 218.
	   Tom Kite, who won the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in 1992 in
conditions just as bad, wasn't up to the task Saturday. He shot a
79 and was in a large group at 220 that included Faldo, Lee
Westwood and Ernie Els.
	   ``I've had enough of this place,'' said Els, who managed a 74.
	   Not so fast. Birkdale isn't through with them yet.

Guerrillas advance in Kosovo, Serbs shell border region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Rebels in separatist Kosovo province
appeared to be losing on one front and winning big on another this
weekend.
	   The Yugoslav army claimed to have killed 30 guerrillas, but the
insurgents were said to have made a major advance on a central
town.
	   A guerrilla offensive Saturday at the central Kosovo town of
Orahovac, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina,
appeared aimed at expanding the estimated 40 percent of territory
held by the militant Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Elsewhere, reporting the 30 dead, a Yugoslav army statement said
some 1,000 ``terrorists'' tried to cross from Albania into Kosovo,
west of Decani town. The attack was foiled and about 30 guerrillas
were ``liquidated,'' said the statement.
	   In another border clash, Yugoslav forces shelled the region of
Padesh village on the Albanian border in an attempt to further
disrupt the guerrillas' gun-smuggling network into Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, which makes up most of present-day Yugoslavia.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
demanding independence from Serbia.
	   Albanian border guards near Padesh reported seeing the bodies of
dead and wounded victims but gave no casualty count, said Artan
Bizhga of the Albanian interior ministry, which controls the border
police.
	   Bizhga said 19 wounded KLA members crossed into Albania to
escape the barrage. Albania's state TV said 80 others fleeing the
violence, apparently civilians, strayed into a deadly border
minefield. They were evacuated by Albanian border troops, state TV
reported.
	   The wounded guerrillas, some wearing uniforms with the KLA
insignia, were flown to Tirana, Albania's capital, where reporters
said most of the wounds appeared relatively minor.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said two Serb
mortar rounds landed inside Albanian territory.
	   ``These dangerous incidents (could) have very dangerous
consequences,'' said Cano, hinting at a possible military response
to such violations of Albania's territorial sovereignty.
	   He said Albania lodged a protest and demanded a meeting with
Yugoslav authorities. The Yugoslav army denied any border
violations.
	   The guerrilla offensive at the central town of Orahovac, about
30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of the provincial capital,
Pristina, was described by ethnic Albanian sources as their largest
in almost five months of combat against Serb security forces.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said the KLA
wrested more than a kilometer (half a mile) of hilly terrain from
Serb control and may have entered Orahovac. A local journalist from
Pristina said on return from the region of the clash that the
guerrillas managed to advance deep into the town and took 20
policemen hostage.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center described the fighting as a
``dramatic'' KLA assault ``from several directions'' that sent
civilians streaming from the area. It said more than 40 Serb
civilians was kidnapped by ethnic Albanian fighters.
	   None of the reports could be verified independently. But both
Serb and Kosovo Albanian sources spoke of intense fighting at
Orahovac.
	   The advances provoked a Serbian counter-offensive. Reliable
witnesses near Orahovac saw Serb tanks and artillery pieces moving
to back up the counter-attack. Hundreds of civilians fled on
tractors and horse-drawn wagons.

Riot police out on prayer day for dead Nigerian opposition leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ With police helicopters hovering low and
hundreds of officers on patrol, thousands of people joined a day of
prayer services for late opposition leader Moshood Abiola, whose
death has sparked rioting in Nigeria.
	   More than 5,000 people, including religious leaders and
pro-democracy activists, attended a ceremony Saturday at the Abiola
family's business offices in Lagos, the West African nation's
commercial capital. Another group met at a smaller gathering
outside the family's palatial home.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993's annulled presidential
elections, was imprisoned in 1994 after declaring himself
president.
	   There was no sign of the rioting that surged for several days
after Abiola's death July 7, killing dozens of people and leaving
many homes and vehicles destroyed. Dozens of people, including more
than 30 youth, were arrested.
	   Nigerian authorities, as well as a team of independent
pathologists, say Abiola apparently died of a heart attack. But
some members of Abiola's family, and many of his supporters, say he
was poisoned.
	   As Saturday's prayer ceremonies went ahead, many streets in
Lagos were filled with people going about their usual weekend
business although the city's public markets remained closed in
honor of Abiola.
	   Helicopters kept watch from the sky while police with automatic
weapons and tear gas patrolled throughout Lagos, including a
racetrack where Abiola's family had initially planned to hold the
services.
	   The original venue for the prayers had been changed Friday after
police forbade use of the track, fearing an upsurge of violence by
large crowds of grieving supporters.
	   Muslim cleric Jamiu Ekunga, who led the ceremonies, paid tribute
to Abiola as a ``martyr of democracy'' whose death had highlighted
the pro-democracy cause to all ``Africans at home and in
diaspora.''
	   Many Muslims traditionally hold prayers seven days after someone
is buried.
	   Since taking over from dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died of
heart failure in early June, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar has released
dozens of political prisoners. He has also promised democratic
reforms but has provided no details or timetables for those
changes.
	   Nigeria has been ruled for all but 10 of the 38 years since
independence from Britain by successive military governments.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Since the murder of Gianni Versace a year ago, the
question circling the fashion world was, Who could keep up the
energy?
	   But it was clear from Donatella Versace's haute couture debut at
winter shows Saturday that she imbibed her brother's messages of
provocative, outrageous fashions and innovative techniques.
	   Sex and glitz were always big selling points for Gianni Versace,
the famed designer for stars like Madonna and Elizabeth Hurley.
	   Donatella _ showing at the Ritz just like her brother _ mastered
the finer points of just-tight-enough dresses and short suits in
shiny or tweedy-feathery new fabrics that got catcalls throughout
the show.
	   Always form-fitting and then some, the clingy suits looked great
on Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and other beauties. Some dresses were
strapless.
	   Fabrics were the latest, with ostrich feathers stuffed into
nubbly white tweeds, and copper thread effects that almost
translated into cotton-candy weaves.
	   The message was modern, with synthesized electronic music by
Frederic Sanchez, and the moment was never boring.
	   Especially when a model sashayed out in a red satiny-synthetic
micro-mini with matching boots and spurts of feathers here and
there.
	   The strange silhouette of tiny elastic skirt or nearly-bare
derriere behind a beautiful long apron-front in an evening dress
was witty. And at least you won't rumple the back skirt.
	   Come-hither mermaid looks, wrapped chiffon sheaths with wiry
embroidery, sizzling hot tops and pants gave it all that
incomparable Versace pizazz.
	   ``Loved it,'' said Dolores Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie
Chaplin. ``We like that sexy thing,'' said her sister Ema. Both of
them, lean and tall as models, looked right for the part of Versace
slinks.
	   Also making his haute couture debut, for his own house, was
Ocimar Versolato.
	   Suave mambo music from Versolato's native Brazil traveled
through the air, and models moved through the sunny courtyard of
his new premises on the Place Vendome.
	   The clothes were clean, clever and modern, from a boxy white
wool crepe jacket with mirror-embroidered straight skirt through
the soft, long gray evening gowns with jet-like mirror sequins
around the generous cut-outs over body-stockings to beautifully
draped dresses with bare backs.
	   The subtle and beautiful clothes also included touches of
plexiglass over light taffeta, white quilted chiffon and an
occasional Japanese reference in an obi-style inset belt or a
ribbon effect down the back.
	   With all these details and much more, it was a show of
deliciously light new fabrics from taffeta to silks woven or
embroidered with paper, and icy winter shades of silvery white,
gray, and touches of deep ruby or ebony iridescence in taffetas. It
all looked new, modern and yet quite romantic.
	   ``I'm looking toward the future,'' Versolato said, ``since
couture needs to look ahead now. I made no conscious references to
the past.''

	   Jean Birchall politely declines to discuss the subject. A woman
who identified herself as Birchall's daughter-in-law said the
family was ``under advisement'' not to talk. But family friend and
defender, Jacqueline Dooley, a member of the bicentennial
committee, is sick of hearing the Birchall name besmirched. The
latest talk around town is that the chicken and cow have been
spirited away to a hiding place in Florida.
	   ``A lot of the people doing the talking weren't even here in
1971,'' Dooley says. ``Nobody knows the truth except Harold and
Calder. And the talk is getting wilder and wilder.''
	   The wild talk led to action. The chicken and the cow no longer
hang on the Birchall living room wall. Dooley believes they might
be with a relative _ in Florida.
	   Calder died in 1976. The Calder Foundation has kept its distance
from the controversy, although it has permitted the town to use the
chicken and cow as its symbol. First Selectwoman Barbara Henry says
she will contemplate legal action only if there is a ``mass
uprising.'' She is hoping that the Calder family will ask the
Birchall family to restore the chicken and the cow to the town.
	   Meanwhile, another committee is busy planning another
celebration. On July 22, Roxbury will honor the 100th anniversary
of Calder's birth, a deliberately low-key affair for family,
friends and aficionados.
	   The invitations are appropriately tasteful. On the cover: a
cheerful chicken and a prancing cow.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The troop carrier surges into the surf of
Omaha Beach, Normandy. The landing ramp flops open. And for the
next 30 relentless minutes, hell comes to the multiplex.
	   German machine-gun fire rips apart young soldiers. Explosions
send body parts flying. Faces get blown off. Bodies are
disemboweled by shrapnel. A soldier drags a wounded buddy across
the battlefield only to look down and see a tattered torso.
	   Easily, it all could have been more brutal.
	   ``As hard as this movie is to get through, I held back,'' says
Steven Spielberg of his World War II film, ``Saving Private Ryan,''
which graphically re-creates the D-Day invasion. ``I could have
made it a lot worse than it was in terms of the combat action. But
I also didn't want to hold back so much that the film became
another excuse to use World War II as fodder for action
adventure.''
	   Opening July 24, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' with Tom Hanks, Edward
Burns and Matt Damon, tells the story of a squad of grunts led by
Hanks who embark on a reluctant mission to find and send home a
young soldier named Ryan (Damon) whose brothers have all been
killed in action.
	   With ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which was inspired by real-life
stories of parents who lost all their sons in the war, Spielberg
continues his transformation from maker of mass-appeal adventures
to gritty realist. Three of his last four films have dealt with the
Holocaust, slavery and now war, interrupted only by a ``Jurassic
Park'' sequel that he says he didn't enjoy making.
	   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is also part of a renewed Hollywood
interest in what, in the cynical post-Vietnam era, is sometimes
called The Last Good War. At least a half-dozen World War II
pictures are in production, including a remake of ``The Thin Red
Line,'' based on the James Jones novel and starring John Travolta,
Sean Penn, George Clooney and Nick Nolte. HBO is broadcasting
``When Trumpets Fade,'' about the battle of the Hurtgen Forest that
cost 23,000 American casualties.
	   The issue of violence in World War II movies confronted
filmmakers even before the war ended, when Hollywood was churning
out patriotic films with government-approved scripts. Those movies
shunned violence to emphasize heroism and to sell war bonds. Late
in the war _ and postwar _ the better films obscured actual scenes
of violence but seriously addressed its psychological cost.
	   Even the film considered to be one of the greatest about D-Day,
``The Longest Day,'' the three-hour 1962 epic with dramatic
cinematography and an all-star cast headed by John Wayne, clung to
Hollywood war movie conventions, with soldiers either suffering
minor flesh wounds or dying quickly without suffering, and a
stirring score instead of harsh battle noise. Mysteriously, when
Wayne spoke his lines, all went quiet on the movie front so the
audience could hear him.
	   Television brought the Vietnam War into America's living rooms,
but it took more than a decade for Hollywood to pick up on the
theme. ``The Deer Hunter,'' ``Platoon'' and ``Full Metal Jacket''
all drew dramatic power from disturbing scenes of the Vietnamese
jungle and rice paddies.
	   By then, movies were already engaged in a long, gradual
stretching of the limits of screen violence, from ``Psycho,'' ``The
Wild Bunch'' and ``Bonnie and Clyde'' in the 1960s to ``The
Godfather'' in the '70s and ``Raging Bull'' in 1980. They broke
Hollywood taboos with almost operatic _ some still say gratuitous _
depictions of gore.
	   ``I have a lot of mixed feelings about violence on screen,''
says Rick Jewell, a film professor at the University of Southern
California. He notes that at one time it was enough to see John
Wayne's reaction to the slaughter of his family in ``The
Searchers'' to drive home the emotional impact of violence.
	   ``I just think that we've come so far that you can't do that
anymore. It's unfortunate. I think that if Spielberg tried to do
that today, he would be accused of copping out, of not showing it
the way it really was.''
	   DreamWorks' dlrs 60 million ``Saving Private Ryan'' was designed
from the start to show World War II as honestly as possible through
the eyes of the GIs on the ground, even if its audience is limited
by a strong R rating for ``intense, prolonged, realistically
graphic sequences of war violence.''
	   ``The audience goes to war. The audience is not a passive
participant,'' Spielberg says. ``I ask a lot of the audience. In
'Schindler's List' I asked a lot of the audience. And when you ask
a lot of the audience, you're not going to get the whole world
racing to see your movie.
	   ``But those who do,'' he adds, ``will be shaken. But I think
they will also be stirred.''
	   Hanks adds: ``The authenticity of the violence that we depict is
only what truly happens when you pull the trigger and send a piece
of hot metal through somebody's skull. It isn't a pleasant thing to
witness. And to downplay it, or to bypass it, or to sugarcoat it,
or to make it more palatable in any way, shape or form, would have
been a sin against the memory of the guys who went through it.''

	   Spielberg drew in part on the stories told to him by his father,
a World War II radio operator and air transport crewman who served
in Burma in the fight against the Japanese.
	   ``My dad was never political about the war,'' Spielberg says.
``He would always tell me that World War II was the only war where
it was very clear that it was good against evil, right against
wrong. My dad has always been very proud of his small contributions
to the war effort and he instilled in me a love for this period.''
	   Indeed, Spielberg has set several of his movies in the 1930s and
1940s, and has tended to treat World War II playfully, from the
blockbuster ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' to the disastrous ``1941.''
When he was 14, he made a 35-minute, 8 mm war picture, ``Escape to
Nowhere,'' based on war movies he saw on television.
	   ``I was inspired by watching Humphrey Bogart and John Garfield
and Van Johnson and John Wayne go to war,'' the director says. ``I
wanted to go to war right along with them. I had no idea about the
cruel, harsh, realities of combat. I just thought those war
pictures were really cool.''
	   It wasn't until after his Academy Award-winning ``Schindler's
List,'' about the Holocaust, that Spielberg felt able to make a war
movie that could capture the cruel realities of the battlefield.
	   ``I began to value, certainly through my father's eyes, what the
war meant to him and his buddies,'' he says.
	   And what that meant was long periods of boredom and discomfort
interrupted by flashes of unspeakable terror and gore. Such scenes
appear throughout the nearly three-hour ``Saving Private Ryan,''
the realism heightened by the use of a shaky, handheld camera,
giving the film a documentary feel.
	   For some audience members, it will be a difficult experience.
Spielberg even says that younger teens should not watch it, that
14- or 15-year-olds should only go after ``a lot of consultation
and collaboration'' with their parents.
	   ``I made this movie as much for the 70- to 80-year-old vets of
those engagements as I did for the older teens that I think would
be edified to just experience a molecule of what they had to go
through,'' he says. ``There is a real story to be told to honor the
memories of these guys who did this for us.''

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ It's easy to see why Roy Rogers is
considered one of the world's greatest slide guitarists.
	   Strolling onto the stage of the Great American Music Hall, the
bearded blues man in his trademark brown felt Borsalino hat grabs a
1957 Gibson ES-125 3-4 guitar and starts in.
	   By the time he tears into a cover of blues legend Robert
Johnson's ``32/20 Blues,'' all eyes stare in awe at Rogers' hands.
With a cylinder glass slide on his left pinkie, his fingers dance
effortlessly over the neck of the guitar _ like a furious centipede
_ then graceful like a ballerina, then furious again.
	   ``That's, like, the lick. I'm kind of known for that,'' he says
backstage after the 90-minute performance with his two-piece backup
band, the Delta Rhythm Kings.
	   The audience consists of couples and middle-aged men, including
one fan wearing a T-shirt and blue jeans who sways in a corner
while occasionally demonstrating an air guitar riff. Most sit
quietly until the end of the show when they stand and clap,
hollering for an encore.
	   Rogers' latest album, ``Pleasure and Pain,'' is his 10th studio
release in a career that has spanned more than 25 years. He has
played in John Lee Hooker's band, produced Hooker's last four
albums and is revered by some of the biggest names in American
roots and blues music.
	   His new album is certainly eclectic, ranging from the
straight-ahead rocker ``You Can't Stop Now'' with Sammy Hagar to
the playful ``Gertie Ruth'' with Van Morrison's daughter, Shana,
singing backup. There's even a beautiful ballad, ``My Lost Home in
Your Arms,'' written by Connecticut schoolteacher Donna Johnston,
Rogers' longtime friend.
	   ``He's an authentic blues man,'' says Bonnie Raitt, who
contributed to ``The Healer,'' the Grammy-winning Hooker album
produced by Rogers. ``He's been pushing the parameter of
traditional blues for a long time. He's not trying to duplicate
what the masters did. He's creating something completely new.''
	   Rogers' first album includes this testament from Hooker: ``When
I hear Roy play his slide guitar, he makes me feel good. He gets
real deep and funky. He's got it and it's got to come out!''
	   For all that, the 47-year-old Rogers remains a somewhat
undiscovered talent outside blues circles. The San Francisco show,
at a cozy place that once housed a brothel, does not sell out and
he even takes time to sign autographs afterward.
	   Raitt guesses that despite the crossover success of Eric Clapton
and a few others, blues music remains fragmented and gets little
radio airplay.
	   One thing that clearly sets Rogers apart is his name. It wasn't
easy growing up in an era with the same name as the famous late
movie and TV cowboy, constantly razzed by his friends.
	   ``My parents thought it would be real cute,'' Rogers says,
sitting cross-legged in an armchair at his home in Northern
California.
	   But he soon grew to embrace his namesake and found that it
opened more doors than it closed. And unlike Roy Rogers the star,
whose real name was Leonard Slye, Roy Rogers the blues guitarist
was actually born Roy Rogers.
	   Mississippi is nowhere near Northern California, yet the delta
blues region first attracted Rogers when his older brother came
home from college one day with the classic album, ``Robert Johnson:
King of the Delta Blues.'' He was hooked.
	   ``We all have those experiences, and that was like one of the
ones that put me in this direction,'' he says. ``He put music
together in a way that made this profound statement _ incredibly
moving and as powerful today as the first time I ever heard it.''
	   When he wasn't playing in his teen-age band, Rogers often took a
Greyhound bus from his hometown of Vallejo to San Francisco, 35
miles (55 kilometers) away. There he saw his idols in person _ Bo
Diddley and Hooker at the old Fillmore, Howlin' Wolf, B.B. King and
Muddy Waters at the Avalon Ballroom.
	   He got a break in 1975 when an assistant producer for the movie
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' saw him and harmonica whiz
David Burgin playing in a small San Francisco club and asked them
to contribute to the soundtrack.
	   An even bigger break came seven years later when an acquaintance
got him the biggest gig of his career as the slide-rhythm guitarist
for Hooker's band, the Coast to Coast Blues Band. He remained with
the group for four years before deciding to break out on his own.
	   Soon others were catching on.
	   One of his earliest reviews came from a Minneapolis music critic
who came up with a unique way to differentiate Rogers from the
other Rogers. ``Roy Rogers came to town. No, not that one,'' the
critic wrote. ``This Roy Rogers' got chops, not chaps.''
	   Rogers liked it so much that ``Chops Not Chaps'' became the name
of his first album and his logo, as well.
	   Today, apart from his own recording, Rogers produces others' (he
recently oversaw Ramblin' Jack Elliott's acclaimed ``Friends of
Mine'') and performs at blues festivals around the world.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``This Tristan is becoming something terrible,''
Richard Wagner wrote in April 1859 as he struggled to finish his
latest music drama.
	   ``I fear the opera will be banned. ... Only mediocre
performances can save me. Completely good ones will drive people
insane.''
	   That dire prophecy has had little chance to be tested in recent
years.
	   A lack of singers who can do justice to the strenuous demands of
the title roles has created something of a crisis in the performing
history of ``Tristan und Isolde,'' which music historians count
among the very greatest of operas.
	   The Metropolitan Opera hasn't performed it with an ideal cast
since 1974 _ and hasn't staged it at all in 14 seasons, the longest
gap in the company's history. Sopranos and tenors who have
attempted the roles in other large opera houses have mostly come to
grief after a few years.
	   That's why a new production by the Seattle Opera is creating so
much excitement. In English soprano Jane Eaglen and Canadian tenor
Ben Heppner, the company may have found the successors to a long,
but thin, line of great Wagnerian singers.
	   ``Everybody's holding their breath,'' said Patrick J. Smith,
editor-at-large of Opera News magazine. ``This is the finest cast
there's been in some time in terms of vocal resources. We're all
hoping it will work.''
	   Eaglen comes to the role following raves for her performances as
another Wagnerian heroine, Brunnhilde, in the Lyric Opera of
Chicago's ``Ring'' cycle two years ago. Heppner has been building a
reputation as a Wagnerian heldentenor and triumphed in the title
role of ``Lohengrin'' at the Met this spring.
	   But since neither will have sung a complete performance of
``Tristan'' before the Aug. 1 opening, no one can really be sure
how they will meet what many consider the most daunting test in all
of opera.
	   Why is ``Tristan'' so difficult? And why should the prospect of
a world-class revival be cause for feverish anticipation?
	   The composer had been immersed in his ``Ring'' cycle in 1856
when he found himself increasingly distracted from the exploits of
his superhero, Siegfried. ``My musical feeling,'' he explained in a
letter to a friend, ``already roves far beyond it to where my
spirit is more at home _ in the realm of melancholy.''
	   He found a perfect entry to that realm in the ancient legend of
the romance between the Irish princess Isolde and the Cornish
knight Tristan. Though they are in love with one another, Isolde is
engaged to Tristan's uncle, King Marke. Freed of their inhibitions
by a love potion, they betray Marke, only to be discovered.
Tristan, in remorse, allows himself to be mortally wounded, and
eventually dies in Isolde's arms.
	   Writing his own libretto, as he always did, Wagner created a
pair of mature lovers with a range of emotion and a psychological
depth hitherto unknown in opera. Every nuance of passion, jealousy,
longing, ecstasy, guilt and despair is explored as the tragedy
plays out.
	   And in his musical setting, Wagner invented a revolutionary
orchestral language, a texture seething with chromatic dissonance
that graphically conveys the lovers' sensuality and suffering _ and
that points the way for later composers' more extreme chromaticism
and atonalism.
	   ``The most subtle, flexible, inspired and consummatively
achieved score of music in existence,'' Olin Downes, a critic for
The New York Times, wrote in 1939 in reviewing a performance of Act
2. ``There is the sense of the restless flight of time, in the
midst of a universe eternally unmoved and unchanging. The music
seems to ascend from profound depths, to hang over the world, a
prophecy.''
	   Against this emotionally supercharged score that rises often
full blast from the orchestra pit, most sopranos and tenors must
struggle to make themselves heard through nearly four hours of
singing.
	   On those rare occasions when the singers have the vocal
equipment to sing their parts with apparent ease and maintain
beauty of tone and phrasing, the audience experiences something of
a miracle.
	   In the years surrounding World War II, this miracle was on
frequent display, where Kirsten Flagstad and then Helen Traubel had
the good fortune to find an equal in Lauritz Melchior.
	   But the last great Isolde, Birgit Nilsson, was not so blessed.
Her frequent partner in Europe, Wolfgang Windgassen, had a voice
that was smaller than ideal for Tristan. Only once, on Jan. 30,
1974, did a Met audience get to hear Nilsson with a tenor who could
do the part justice _ Canadian Jon Vickers.
	   Since then, the world has been waiting for lightning to strike
again. And Seattle Opera general manager Speight Jenkins thinks
that finally, with Eaglen and Heppner, the wait may be over.
	   ``Jane's got the perfect Isolde voice,'' Jenkins said. ``She's
got the top, but she's also got that beautiful, rich middle where
most of the music lies. And she's got the power.''

	   As for Heppner, Jenkins said, ``He's a very rare heldentenor, in
that he is really a tenor and not a baritone who sings high. He's
come to us through Bach and Mozart, so the Italianate side of
Tristan, all the legato in the second act, is second nature to him.
Where he had to work on it was the low voice; there's so much of
it.''
	   The advance critical consensus seems to be that Heppner has the
artistry to be a great Tristan, if only he can get through the long
love scenes in Act 2 and the psychologically grueling third act
without fading. With Eaglen, stamina is less a concern than whether
she can summon the range of emotion and vocal coloration to capture
Isolde's many shadings of mood.
	   If they do pull it off, Eaglen and Heppner could be singing
their roles for many years to come. She is 38, younger than Nilsson
or Flagstad when they first sang at the Met; Heppner is 43.
	   ``What I'm hoping is that this will put the opera back on the
gold standard again the way it was in the '30s,'' Jenkins said.
	   He's not alone in such hopes. Opera lovers from 44 states and 13
foreign countries have bought tickets to one of the eight
performances Eaglen and Heppner will sing together (tenor Gary
Lakes takes over for Heppner for two performances at the end of
August). Critics from around the world will be there, too.
	   And Eaglen and Heppner are scheduled to repeat their roles in
late 1999 in a new production at the Met.
	   For Jenkins, who attended that Nilsson-Vickers performance 24
years ago as a critic for the New York Post, the fondest wish is
that history repeat itself. As he wrote in his review then:
	   ``As long as there can be a night such as this, there has to be
a continually refreshed army fighting to keep this incredibly
impractical entertainment called opera alive. It's worth it.''

	   From the beginning, ``Tristan und Isolde'' has taken a toll on
singers.
	   Aloys Ander, the tenor who was to have sung at the world
premiere in Vienna in 1861, lost his voice before opening night,
causing the production to be canceled.
	   But Ander was lucky compared to the man who finally did create
the role four years later in Munich, Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld.
He complained of icy drafts as he lay on stage perspiring and out
of breath from his arduous monologues in Act 3. Within six weeks,
he was dead.
	   A less grim illustration of the perils of singing Tristan
entered operatic legend nearly a century later. Swedish soprano
Birgit Nilsson had just made her Met debut as Isolde to great
acclaim, when her scheduled partner for the third performance fell
ill. Worse, his standby was also sick _ and even the backup for the
backup had a cold.
	   ``None of them felt up to an entire 'Tristan,''' Met general
manager Rudolf Bing wrote in his memoirs. ``Could each of them take
an act? They agreed.'' So it was that on Dec. 28, 1959, Nilsson
cursed Ramon Vinay in Act 1, made love to Karl Liebl in Act 2 and
mourned the death of Albert Da Costa in Act 3.
	   Many Isoldes, like Helen Traubel during the 1940s, have had
problems coping with the high notes the part requires, especially
two high B's in the first act and two high C's at the beginning of
the second-act love duet. Often in performance Traubel merely
hinted at them or left them out altogether.
	   Even the legendary Kirsten Flagstad, when she recorded the opera
late in her career, felt uneasy about the demands of the second
act. So the record producer volunteered his wife's services, and a
young Elisabeth Schwarzkopf interpolated the high C's.

Mickey Gilley trades in the mechanical bull for a treadmill

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRANSON WEST, Missouri (AP) _ Right away, something looks amiss.
For one thing, there's not a mechanical bull in sight _ just a room
full of weight machines, treadmills and sweating bodies.
	   But sure enough, in the midst of it all, is Mickey Gilley. He's
trimmer and his hair a bit grayer now than during his ``Urban
Cowboy'' days. But the craggy, smiling face looks about the same.
And, anyway, who could miss the guy with the big, jeweled ``MG''
hanging around his neck?
	   ``You're just in time to watch me break my record,'' he says as
he shakes hands. ``I'm going to press 300 pounds (136 kilograms) 10
times.''
	   Then he sits down at the weight machine and does it. Ten leg
presses, 300 pounds (136 kilograms) apiece. And he lets out a
well-earned whoop of satisfaction.
	   ``He is just 60 pounds (27 kilograms) away from doubling his
weight,'' says Ron Crooks who, when he isn't running the gym where
Gilley works out in this quiet Ozarks town, is playing keyboards in
Gilley's band.
	   ``I'll get there! I'll get there!,'' Gilley shouts. ``Just give
me another two weeks.''
	   If he sounds confident, he has a right to be. Lately, times have
been good for Mickey Gilley. He has a new biography, ``The Life and
Times of Mickey Gilley'' airing on The Nashville Network. He has a
950-seat theater on Branson's strip that he comes close to filling
most nights of the week, nine months of the year. There's a
Gilley's Texas Cafe right next door, another one in Myrtle Beach,
South Carolina, and there are plans for another theater in Texas.
	   ``I'm talking to some people in Houston about opening up a real
classy Gilley's,'' he says. ``It won't be anything like that joint
that I had.''
	   That joint, of course, was the legendary Gilley's. It may not
have been classy, but it put country music squarely on the minds of
a lot of people in the 1970s and '80s and helped make Mickey Gilley
a star. It didn't do badly for John Travolta, either. He won a pile
of prize money, as well as Debra Winger's heart, riding the
mechanical bull there in the 1980 movie ``Urban Cowboy.''
	   But those were the good old days and these are the good new
days. Mickey Gilley has found a new life in Missouri after things
went sour in Texas.
	   By the time Gilley's burned down in 1990, it had been closed for
months and Gilley and his former partner, Sherwood Cryer, were on
the outs. The club had gotten run down, Gilley said, and Cryer
wouldn't fix it to his satisfaction.
	   ``One day he looked at me and he said, `Let me tell you
something, Gilley. I don't tell you how to sing. Don't you tell me
how to run this club.' Well that was like your wife saying she
don't love you anymore and don't want you living with her anymore.
It was over after that.''
	   So he came to Branson just as it was taking off, opening his
theater in 1989.
	   ``I was only interested in one thing, make a lot of money and
move on,'' he says now. ``But I fell in love with the place and the
people.''
	   So he stayed, even though he went through some rocky times when
his theater burned in 1993 and he had to spend a season doing
afternoon shows at BoxCar Willie's place while he rebuilt.
	   ``I finally decided I just needed to take care of Mickey Gilley
and let the money take care of itself,'' he says, pausing from his
workout. And after that, things seemed to go all right.
	   It was not altogether unlike his approach to music, the way he
started out playing for fun on an old church piano in Ferriday,
Louisiana, the same one his cousins, Jerry Lee Lewis and the Rev.
Jimmy Swaggart, learned on.
	   When they grew up, Swaggart became a TV evangelist, Lewis a rock
star and Gilley a construction worker. Then one day Lewis dropped
by for a visit.
	   ``He came to Houston to do a show when `Whole Lotta Shakin' was
hot,'' Gilley recalls. ``I had a chance to go to the airport with
him, and I remember when he reached into his pocket to buy his
ticket he pulled out more money than I'd ever seen in my life.
	   ``Well, I said if he can do it, I can, too. I didn't realize at
the time that everyone would just look at me as a copy.''
	   Indeed, it seemed to take him forever to become a star, even
though he had 39 Top 10 country singles, including such classics as
``Don't the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time,'' and ``Roomful
of Roses.''
	   But it took ``Urban Cowboy'' to make Gilley a household name,
and he thinks the early comparisons to Lewis might have hurt him.
He remembers the time a stage manager refused to let him near a
beautiful grand piano after Conway Twitty let it slip that he was
Lewis' cousin.
	   ``I had to tell him I'm not going to smash the piano,'' he
recalls, chuckling.
	   Told of a performance at which Lewis ripped off a keyboard cover
and sent it flying toward the audience, Gilley snorts and shakes
his head as if to say that's nothing.
	   ``I've seen him reach inside the piano and pull the strings
out,'' he says, still shaking his head. ``I don't know why he does
it.''
	   Although they were close as children, Gilley, Lewis and Swaggart
have drifted apart over the years.
	   Gilley does six performances a week in Branson, flying home to
Texas after a Thursday matinee, then back in time for Saturday
night's show.
	   Since the first of the year, he's been pumping weights five
mornings a week, seeking to ensure that at age 62 he stays in the
shape needed to keep up that pace.
	   ``I'll never retire,'' he says. ``To me, doing the shows is not
work.''

A record album becomes folklore for Lucinda Williams

 &UR; By DAVID BAUDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lucinda Williams calls it ``a little bump in the
road.'' Seldom has an album of music taken such a tortured trail to
the public as her ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.''
	   Seldom has it seemed to matter so little when the destination
was reached.
	   The appealing blend of rock, blues, folk and country that
Williams tops with her Louisiana twang is both passionate and
well-crafted. With no weak links, it will be hard to find a better
collection of music released this year.
	   For a while, though, it was looking like a 1990s version of
``Smile,'' the legendary aborted Beach Boys album of 30 years ago.
	   She recorded one version and scrapped it. Worked with Steve
Earle but didn't finish. Worked with another producer, former E
Street Band member Roy Bittan. Had Rick Rubin tweak it. Finally,
the music sat in limbo for a year due to a business dispute that
didn't involve her.
	   During the wait, a New York Times article essentially painted
Williams as a neurotic perfectionist who can't finish what she
starts.
	   Six years ... six long years for her fans.
	   ``I happened to go through a little bump in the road with this
thing,'' she says. ``Thank God I did, because it wouldn't be the
album it is now. I'd like to get some credit for once.''
	   She warmed _ no, make that steamed _ to the topic.
	   ``I'm tired of everybody dwelling on this _ she started over and
recorded it over,'' she says. ``You know, so what? It just got 4
1-2 stars in Rolling Stone, so what can you say?''
	   In an odd way, it may have helped Williams' career. Most artists
would disappear from the public's mind if they were gone for so
long. Williams' stature seemed only to increase.
	   She became a patron saint of Americana, a new radio station
format that wore out the records she released in 1988 and 1992.
She'd play the new songs in concert, and fans would buzz about them
on the Internet. Anticipation can be a powerful thing, particularly
when there's a payoff at the end.
	   Born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, Williams grew up with a
suitcase always nearby. Her father, a college professor and poet,
moved the family to Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Fayetteville,
Arkansas, and Mexico City. And that's only a partial list.
	   The sense of shallow roots suffuses her music. ``Child in the
back seat, about 4 or 5 years old,'' she sings in the title cut.
``Lookin' out the window. Little bit of dirt mixed with tears, car
wheels on a gravel road.''
	   She didn't realize the song was about her own childhood until
her father jokingly apologized upon hearing it, she says.
	   The album's song titles read as a travelogue of a youth growing
up in the South: ``Lake Charles,'' ``Greenville,'' ``Jackson.''
	   Williams immersed herself in the guitar as a teen-ager, filling
her room with songbooks to teach her the folk music she heard on
records.
	   ``My whole world was just music,'' she says. ``Listening to
records, playing guitar, listening to other people play. And, as
soon as I was old enough, going out and playing for other people.''
	   She progressed from artists like Bob Dylan, Judy Collins and
Gordon Lightfoot to country singers like Hank Williams and Loretta
Lynn and finally to the Delta blues. The grounding in timeless
musicians is blended in her own work and gives it the same quality.
	   Peers have long admired her songwriting: Mary Chapin Carpenter
turned Williams' song about a woman who can't understand why she
can't have it all, ``Passionate Kisses,'' into a hit. Tom Petty
recorded her embittered ``Change the Locks.''
	   As a writer, she's a pack rat, holding on to ideas and lyrics
for years before waiting for the right moment. ``I don't throw
anything out until I've used it in a song,'' she says.
	   ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' was a title she had for a long
time before writing a song to go with it. Her new song, ``Concrete
and Barbed Wire,'' was inspired by watching the Berlin Wall tumble
down. A decade later it became a song about a couple divided by
prison walls.
	   The song ``Drunken Angel'' is about Blaze Foley, a gifted fellow
musician from Texas who essentially killed himself with drink.
Williams tries to cut through the romanticism of a tortured artist
to see the wasted life.
	   ``There's a fine line between being sympathetic and empathetic
and not being judgmental,'' she says. ``I tried to look at the
overall big picture.''
	   Her new music has a lived-in quality, perhaps because she's been
living with it for so long. Williams will admittedly labor over
words and phrases, using her dad as an editor. The blues song
``Joy,'' however, works because she followed her instincts to stop.
	   The rant against an old lover features the central refrain _
``you took my joy'' _ repeated over and over. She started working
on the song with her band with only a verse written, always
intending to go back and write more lyrics.
	   ``But it took on a life of its own and I just wound up leaving
it right where it was,'' she says. ``In a way, it's sort of true to
the tradition of the old blues songs that would have one or two
verses and kind of stay on the same thing. It's funny how it became
the strong point of the song.''

Five questions with Adam Trese: fear and loving in films and life
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It isn't every day that you get to ride circles
around Claire Danes while on a motorcycle. And it's probably
something Adam Trese wouldn't want to repeat any time soon.
	   In the new film, ``Polish Wedding,'' Trese had to then whisk Ms.
Danes, wearing a wedding dress, onto the bike as he drove off.
Despite some deft driving, he's no biker.
	   ``I had to learn,'' Trese said of his preparation some weeks
before the scene was shot. ``They took me out on this really old
bike. Later I had to ride on a 'giant cop Harley.' And there were a
lot of depressions in the grass that we were shooting on, so I was
trying to not run over Claire in her wedding dress.''
	   ``I kept worrying about killing the movie star by accident,''
Trese said. ``It was a lot of stress.''
	   Trese also admitted to a certain amount of nervousness when
playing love scenes with Ms. Danes, who plays a sexually precocious
teen-ager in the film. ``I didn't know Claire at all before we
started the movie. I had done a sex scene once in a TV pilot and I
was shaking, I was so nervous.''
	   ``Polish Wedding'' was written and directed by first-time
director Theresa Connelly. Trese plays Russell Schuster, a young
Detroit police officer who is smitten with Ms. Danes. The film also
stars Gabriel Byrne and Lena Olin.
	   Trese, who's been acting for about five years, drew favorable
notices in the indie film, ``Laws of Gravity,'' which is part of
the permanent collection at New York's Museum of Modern Art. He
also appeared in ``Illtown,'' ``Palookaville,'' ``The Saint of Fort
Washington'' with Matt Dillon and Danny Glover, and Steven
Soderbergh's ``Underneath,'' a remake of the film noir favorite,
``Criss Cross.''
	   This summer, he appeared in ``The Matchmaker'' at the
Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts. Last year, he
played Marco in the Tony Award-winning play, ``A View from the
Bridge.''
	   Trese, who grew up in Manhattan's Chelsea section, played drums
with a punk band, The Young and the Useless, in the 1980s. He won't
divulge his exact age and smiles shyly before answering,
``somewhere in my 20s.''
	   1. Tell us about some of the love scenes with Claire Danes in
``Polish Wedding.''
	   Trese: The scene with Claire was in the middle of a field in
Detroit. So it was a little bit embarrassing. Claire took her
clothes off, and I think it was probably more embarrassing for her.
But those scenes were removed from the film. We were way in the
middle of this field so there wasn't a crowd of people. Just the
crew.
	   2. Several of your roles to date have been as policemen. Have
you researched these roles in any way?
	   Trese: When I did 'Underneath,' I rode around with police
officers in Austin, Texas. At one point everybody left to chase
these people and I was alone with the car key and the key to the
shotgun. Some guys from the neighborhood were kind of inching
closer to me. And I didn't know if they were going to carjack me.
Of course, nothing happened. I think they were just curious as to
why I was sitting in the cop car.
	   3. Have you ridden a bike since doing the film?
	   Trese: No. I don't want to ride motorcycles. I have a relative
who lost a leg because of an accident he had. I don't want to take
those chances.
	   4. What do you think of the controversy ``Polish Wedding'' has
stirred in the Polish community?
	   Trese: I think that they're upset at possible stereotyping. We
shot in Hamtramck, which is a Polish neighborhood in Detroit. The
director who wrote the script was born and raised in that
neighborhood. She took great efforts to educate us on Polish things
like duck's blood soup. It's actually quite tasty. I'm glad they're
protesting because maybe people will wonder about the film and want
to see it.
	   5. Can you relate to Russell's fears about marriage and
fatherhood?
	   Trese: Well, yeah. How can you know if you're going to be able
to provide? It's scary. But sometimes the thing that you most fear
turns out to be the best thing for you. For Russell, it's her. He
becomes a man, she becomes a woman. They marry and have a child.
It's beautiful but it's terrifying.

Yogatopia: where stars can drop their celebrity and unwind
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo NY343 &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCINE PARNES &QC; 
 &UR; For The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Life in Tinseltown can be tough. Your agent
can't cut a deal, Spielberg's still holding on line one, and if the
paparazzi don't maim you, the critics will.
	   Peer out from the limo, the freeway's a mess. It's all about
stress. You must decompress.
	   The place: Yogatopia, a minimalist enclave in Brentwood,
California. Past white gauze curtains and on a blond wood floor,
Elizabeth Berkley looks graceful in a handstand, Dennis Quaid is
stretching his mind and body with a split, and Woody Harrelson is
perfecting a pose, legs behind head.
	   Yogatopia is ``pretty star-studded'' with ``tons of TV and movie
people,'' says co-owner Steve Ross, 46.
	   But forget the star factor, say Ross and his partner Rod
Stryker, 40, both natives of Los Angeles. ``As much as this is
newsworthy, in class they become anonymous,'' Stryker says.
	   Well, not totally anonymous. Stryker's new bride is, after all,
'70s supermodel Cheryl Tiegs, who attends class three times a week
and met him _ where else? _ at a yoga class.
	   ``Whether it's Goldie (Hawn) or Cheryl,'' says Stryker, ``once
they get in there, the whole idea is to drop all that and blend in.
The focus is for them to forget their celebrity and unwind.''
	   OK, so we'll try to ignore Ellen DeGeneres, Jamie Lee Curtis,
Tea Leoni, Lisa Rinna, Harry Hamlin, Matthew Modine, Kate Capshaw
or Sally Field. We won't tell David Duchovny we hear he's strong on
flexibility and stamina. We promise not to beg Quaid and wife Meg
Ryan for autographs while they perform their Sanskrit chants. And
we won't even tell Jim Belushi to put out his cigar.
	   ``He smokes a cigar right to the last minute before class. Right
'til the bell rings, he's out there puffing away,'' says Stryker.
	   The cool thing is, ``it's L.A., nobody cares,'' says Ross.
``(Celebrities) don't get hassled, generally. People are nonchalant
about them because they're everywhere.''
	   Still, ``the day John John showed up, there was a kind of
buzz,'' says Stryker, recalling last September when John F. Kennedy
Jr. took Ross' mixed-level Saturday evening class.
	   ``People didn't know whether to notice him or do their yoga,''
says Stryker. ``Or figure out how to do both.''
	   If a client drops out, says Ross, it doesn't mean they're lazy.
``They get movies, so they disappear for two months, then they drop
back in every day for two months.''
	   Ross, who's done house calls for Kirstie Alley, Courtney Love
and Richard Gere, teaches athletic-style yoga classes. Stryker
practices more traditional yoga, focusing on controlled breathing,
stretching, visualization and meditation.
	   What draws the stars to yoga?
	   ``It's definitely a life under the microscope, and the stakes
are very high. Most of the people who excel in those careers are
extremely creative, yet on the other hand, the industry itself is
very callous,'' says Stryker. ``They need more than just looking
great. They need ways to unwind from that world and regenerate
themselves.''
	   Why Yogatopia?
	   ``It's the neighborhood yoga place,'' says Stryker.
	   For a mere dlrs 13 per session, you can stretch out, limber up
and calm down. And if you forget to turn off your cell phone and
pager, there's a sign to remind you.
	   And what's the magic?
	   ``They come in, we do the class, it's hard, it's hot, it's
sweaty, it's packed,'' says Ross. ``At the end, everybody files out
and that's that.''

White House garden hosts sculpture exhibits

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and his wife have
turned the White House gardens into a museum for some of the latest
_ and most hip _ sculpture that Americans have cast, carved,
chiseled, molded, whittled or nailed together.
	   The changing exhibits are one of the first things to greet the
thousands of tourists and other visitors to the White House.
	   ``Bill and I have always loved sculpture,'' Mrs. Clinton said
recently.
	   ``At our first date at the Yale art gallery ... we persuaded a
groundkeeper to let us pick up garbage to be able to get in _
because the workers were on strike so that the museum was closed _
and we wanted to see ... a Henry Moore sculpture that was in the
courtyard.
	   ``So for me, starting the first rotating sculpture exhibit at
the White House was a real joy,'' she said. ``I go out and sit in
the garden and ... enjoy it just for myself as well as seeing and
being pleased that we've got a million and a half people going by
and seeing sculpture they never would see otherwise.''
	   Already, the Mall between the Capitol and the Washington
Monument has a sculpture garden at the Hirshhorn Museum. Another is
scheduled to open next spring at the National Gallery of Art.
	   The sculptures in the White House's Jacqueline Kennedy Garden
are seen by thousands of tourists every day who look out the
windows as they walk down a long corridor to reach the formal
rooms.
	   ``Some people slow down as they go by,'' said White House
curator Betty C. Monkman in an interview.
	   The current show, the sixth since the Clintons began the series
in 1994, is the first in Washington to display carving by American
Indians, said Martin Sullivan, director of Heard Museum of Phoenix,
which lent most of the work.
	   All of it was done by living artists except ``Earth Song'' by
Allan Houser, a Chiricahua Apache, and a female nude in polished
walnut, ``Lady of Spring,'' by the late Willard Stone, a Cherokee.
	   Houser was ``widely regarded as the most influential Native
American sculptor and art mentor of our time,'' Sullivan said.
Before he died at 80 in 1994, he came to Washington to accept the
National Medal of the Arts from Mrs. Clinton.
	   Two more exhibits are planned before the Clintons leave the
White House in 2001.
	   The Clintons are only the latest White House residents to turn
their attention to the gardens.
	   President John Kennedy had the Rose Garden outside his West Wing
office redesigned to his taste and for ceremonial purposes. Mrs.
Kennedy began redoing the plots outside the East Wing, and Lady
Bird Johnson dedicated them in her honor.
	   And if the Clintons are still fans of the English sculptor Henry
Moore, whose work they sought out that day at Yale, they can see
examples at the Hirshhorn and the National Gallery.
	   But they won't see his work at the White House _ the sculpture
there is limited to American artists.

<TEXT>
	   RANCHO CUCAMONGA, California (AP) _ Across the land, they turn
up in the oddest places, tucked away at highway rest stops, atop
pay phones, on buses and at motel front desks _ tiny comic booklets
the size and shape of baseball cards, pointing the way toward
salvation.
	   The titles are the first attraction. ``Where's Rabbi Waxman?''
``Gomez Is Coming.'' ``The Death Cookie.'' ``Somebody Goofed.''
Inside, black-and-white drawings that seem a stylistic cross
between ``Mary Worth'' and Mad magazine chronicle people battling
to beat back evil, repent and accept Jesus Christ.
	   This is the life's work of Jack T. Chick.
	   For nearly 40 years, from a small office-warehouse in this
foothill community of the San Gabriel Mountains, he has blended pop
culture and populist religion into a blunt, sometimes downright
intimidating evangelical Christian message _ that only by receiving
Jesus in the exact way the Scripture dictates can humans avoid
being cast into the lake of fire.
	   The 13-cent tracts, with dozens of titles, have been translated
into 43 languages, from Estonian to Tagalog, and distributed free
throughout the world, often by missionaries. But it is in the
United States where they seem omnipresent, part of the background
noise of the culture; anyone who's taken a cross-country trip has
probably seen them lying around, left by local church members to be
picked up by passers-by.
	   Chick keeps a low profile. He gives no interviews; his staff
responded to a list of e-mail questions.
	   But it is clear that Chick Publications Inc., which also
publishes conventional religious books, believes comic art _ a
longtime bugaboo of conservative Christians _ can reach out to more
people than plain old text.
	   ``There are constantly new generations coming along that need to
hear about Jesus,'' the company responded this month. ``Thanks to
television worldwide, minds are more open to illustrated stories
than ever before. People can tuck these little tracts into their
pocket and read them at their leisure.''
	   The messages are memorable, whether by persuasiveness, fear or
both. They usually focus on a person at a spiritual crossroads who
can accept or reject Christ. They use linguistic vernacular. And
they typically end with the person, newly dead, sitting before God
and being welcomed into heaven or dispatched to a graphic hell.
	   The drawings make the biggest impression. Demons and evil or
ne'er-do-well humans are rendered in near-caricature, either as
jowly and corpulent or gaunt and hollow-eyed. They laugh like this:
``HAW HAW HAW!'' Christians, by contrast, are generally
well-groomed, well-dressed and, more often than not, white.
	   Depictions of other groups can veer into the stereotypical.
	   ``Make some chicken soup,'' a Jewish mother says in ``Where's
Rabbi Waxman?'' In the Chinese-language version of ``Hi There!'',
about a construction worker killed without accepting Christ, the
drawings mirror the English version _ except the characters' eyes
in the Chinese rendition are narrow and slanted.
	   Many tracts suggest that other points of view lead to damnation.
Gays are condemned as Sodomites; rock music is Satan's
``masterpiece.'' ``Big Daddy?'' paints evolutionists as ranting,
sweating fanatics. ``The Tycoon'' dismisses Buddhism, ``The
Crisis'' denounces Jehovah's Witnesses as a fake faith, and ``The
Curse of Baphomet'' and ``Dark Dungeons'' equate Masonry and
role-playing games with witchcraft.
	   The attitude of some tracts toward the Roman Catholic church,
particularly, has raised hackles over the years. ``Last Rites''
brands Roman Catholicism a ``false religion.'' ``The Death Cookie''
_ the Roman Catholic communion wafer _ paints the church as a vast
unholy conspiracy.
	   Mike Gallagher, a Roman Catholic, first encountered Chick tracts
when a teacher at his daughters' Christian school distributed them.
One, Gallagher said, misrepresented Catholic last rites, so he
launched a counter-Chick Web page in response.
	   ``Their belief is that only they are saved. And if you don't
believe what they believe, then you're not saved,'' says Gallagher,
a pension actuary in Fairport, New York. ``(Chick) condemns
Catholicism for worshipping idols, yet he uses images much more
than we use them to sway readers to his point of view.''
	   Faiths have distributed text tracts for generations. But the
rise of media-fed mass culture has led religious organizations to
television, popular music, the Internet _ and the comic book.
	   ``The American entrepreneurial spirit really influences how
evangelical-minded Christians will use technology and popular
culture to spread the gospel,'' says Tim Morgan, associate editor
at Christianity Today. ``They'll use everything.''
	   Chick Publications suggests leaving tracts everywhere _ atop
vending machines, in airplane seat pockets, under windshield
wipers, even inside rented bowling shoes and in clear plastic bags
near schools. And ``if you get pulled over,'' says the catalog,
``cheerfully hand one to the officer.''
	   Chick left a science job to draw tracts after he heard how
communist revolutionaries won over Chinese peasants with mass
distribution of cartoon booklets. The road wasn't smooth at first.
	   ``A lot of the bookstores were really outraged at some guy using
these cartoons to present the gospel,'' Chick said in a 1984
in-house magazine interview. ``They thought it was sacrilegious.''
	   M. Thomas Inge, author of ``Comics as Culture,'' suggests the
appeal lies in the tracts' seeming paradox: the idea that comics
are subversive contrasted with the message of good contained
within.
	   ``You could say the Chick publications are trying to be
counterrevolutionary,'' he says. ``They're trying to counter the
subversiveness by co-opting the material for their own use.''

<TEXT>
	   In the spotlight: Willem Dafoe, scary dude
	    &UR; Claim to Fame: Nominated for an Oscar for his performance as
Sgt. Elias in ``Platoon,'' Willem Dafoe has distinguished himself
as one of Hollywood's favorite utility men, taking on such a wide
variety of roles that his film resume is an eclectic soup. Says The
New York Times: ``Dafoe cuts a startling figure under any
circumstance.''
	   Dafoe played an evil computer genius in ``Speed 2: Cruise
Control,'' Madonna's kinky sex partner in ``Body of Evidence,'' a
by-the-book FBI agent in ``Mississippi Burning,'' and the title
role in ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
	   ``To this day, I can't believe I was so brazen to think I could
pull off the Jesus role,'' Dafoe says.
	    &UR; Image: Dafoe says he feels like he's missed out on more
conventional roles because he's perceived as an eccentric actor in
dark little films, kind of the boy-next-door type _ if you lived
next door to a mausoleum.
	   ``I don't think people want to see me as a regular guy,'' he
says. ``Besides, I'm a regular guy in real life. I guess I just
want to be reckless in my work.''
	    &UR; Personal stats: Born in Appleton, Wisconsin, on July 22, 1955,
William was the name his parents gave him at birth. His high school
nickname, Willem, stuck like glue. He joined Milwaukee's
experimental Theater X troupe as a teen, then moved to New York in
1977, where he joined the avant-garde theater company, Wooster
Group.
	    &UR; Other film credits: ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' ``Wild at
Heart,'' ``Clear and Present Danger,'' ``Tom and Viv'' and ``The
English Patient.''
	   His upcoming film, ``Lulu on the Bridge,'' stars Mira Sorvino,
Gina Gershon, Mandy Patinkin, Vanessa Redgrave and Harvey Keitel.
	   ``Casting people feel that they have to get someone who looks a
certain way, and I think that jury is still out whether people find
me attractive or not,'' Dafoe says.

	   July 19: Singer Vikki Carr is 57. Director Atom Egoyan is 38.

At the Movies: 'The Mask of Zorro'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: film opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The tale of Zorro, the Robin Hood of Spanish Los
Angeles, has been a movie staple almost since his emergence in a
cartoon strip in 1919.
	   Douglas Fairbanks Sr. starred in two Zorro silents, Tyrone Power
in an impressive 1940 version, and Guy Williams in the 1957-59
Disney TV series. There was even a ``Zorro and the Three
Musketeers'' with Gordon Scott in 1962, as well as three Republic
serials. And don't forget George Hamilton's ``Zorro, the Gay
Blade'' in 1981.
	   Don Diego de Vega (played by Anthony Hopkins), the aristocrat
known as Zorro, retains all his masculine fascination in a splendid
new version, ``The Mask of Zorro.'' What a delight amid the
midsummer movie madness to see a well-made adventure in which the
men fight with swords instead of laser guns.
	   In a prologue, the citizens of California revolt against the
tyranny of the Spanish governor, Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). As the
governor is about to execute four innocent men, Zorro swoops down
to rescue them and whip the mob into a frenzy.
	   Zorro is captured, his wife is shot and his baby daughter is
seized by Don Rafael to raise as his own.
	   After 20 years in prison, Zorro escapes, at which point Joaquin
Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), a scruffy thief, makes his entrance.
Zorro had befriended Joaquin as a boy, and he sees the young man as
a candidate to continue his good deeds. But to become the new
Zorro, the overconfident young man must learn not only swordplay
but also the ways of a gentleman.
	   The two Zorros have their work cut out for them. The evil Rafael
has plans to use the gold from a secret mine to buy California from
Mexico and set himself up as ruler.
	   ``The Mask of Zorro'' resurrects moviedom's swashbuckling era of
heroes performing dazzling stunts, villains inflicting unspeakable
cruelties, and heroines brimming with spunk and cool beauty. The
dialogue is suitably florid, and the stirring music by James Horner
evokes memories of the classic scores of Max Steiner and Miklos
Rozsa.
	   Spanish-born Banderas, the first Latin to play Zorro, is brashly
romantic. The solid presence of Hopkins distinguishes every film in
which the Welsh actor-knight appears (most recently last year's
``Amistad'' and ``Surviving Picasso''), and he anchors this one
with intense believability.
	   The stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones brightens the screen as the
supposed daughter of Don Rafael and the real daughter of the senior
Zorro. Her verbal dueling with Banderas _ as well as an encounter
with swords _ offers the traditional prelude to romance.
	   Martin Campbell directed ``The Mask of Zorro'' with a careful
eye for movement and period (the film was shot in Mexico).
Sometimes the duels seem overlong, as if he were trying to make the
most of crowd scenes and elaborate sets.
	   Addendum: The Zorros of yesteryear carved the letter Z on the
skin of their opponents with their swords. Fairbanks did this in
the silent films, but it was banned from later versions because too
many youngsters tried it out on their playmates.
	   The Tri-Star Pictures release, in partnership with Steven
Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, was produced by Doug Claybourne
and David Foster. John Eskow, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio wrote
the script from a story by Elliott, Rossio and Randall Jahnson.
Rated PG-13 for violence. Running time: 127 minutes.

At the Movies: `Polish Wedding'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Compromises are a part of human nature, as
reflexive as breathing, loving, hurting or simply existing. For the
Pzoniak family of Detroit, an intense bunch of Catholic,
working-class Polish immigrants, the compromises are many.
	   They come from Jadzia (Lena Olin), the passionate matriarch
trying to erase her emptiness with a hollow affair; from Bolek
(Gabriel Byrne), the father, who works the graveyard shift at a
bakery and chain smokes while pondering his lot; from Hala (Claire
Danes), the pulchritudinous teen-age daughter who brashly chases
ways to be different from _ and similar to _ her parents.
	   ``Polish Wedding,'' an extraordinary, dreamlike film, tells the
story of their compromises. Set in a Detroit that is visually
contemporary but has an unsettlingly ageless feel, ``Polish
Wedding'' is ripe and alive, full of tiny victories and small
moments of anguish.
	   Scored with a whimsical soundtrack that accentuates its hazy
feel, the film follows the Pzoniak family through several weeks in
a crazy summer _ a summer in which the family flirts with falling
apart but ultimately, and sometimes inadvertently, uses every
tactic it knows to stay together.
	   The movie revolves around Hala, who is played perfectly by Danes
as a girl on the threshold of adulthood, just learning to
understand her sexual power but also eager to look inward and, like
her father, contemplate the world and figure out just how crazy it
is.
	   She sneaks out of a basement window at night, abetted by her
precocious little brother, and runs off in bare feet to rendezvous
with various suitors. By day, she prepares to represent the Virgin
in the neighborhood church procession. This is Hala's contrast: She
wants to be seen as a virgin, but not to be one. The wedding of the
title is hers; whether it takes place is the big question
throughout.
	   Jadzia cleans offices by day, and at night has an affair with a
bearded, long-haired executive from the company, dressing in her
``Polish Women's Auxiliary'' uniform to fool her husband. But he
knows, and she knows he knows.
	   In some ways, Bolek is the most complicated of the lot. Stoic
and bitter, but also idealistic and introspective, he is the
watcher _ the man who observes intently as his marriage crumbles
and his daughter falls from what he believes is grace. And yet
Bolek always comes through, pulling wisdom from deep within and
coping with every situation. The Irish-born Byrne, hard to imagine
as a Pole, handles this role with admirable aplomb.
	   ``Polish Wedding'' exhibits a strange arc. On one hand, Hala's
church march functions as the climax. But the film's many plot
spikes and dips make it difficult to predict where things are
going. Surprisingly, instead of undermining, this works to the
movie's advantage for an understandable reason: It reflects reality
rather than neatly packaged Hollywood narrative.
	   In the Pzoniak household, where impetuousness and lust keep
making the family larger, there is one underlying message: Amid all
the compromise, under all the pain and heartache and denial, people
stand by one another.
	   The term ``slice of life'' is often used in a trivial way to
describe entertaining little cross-sections of the world. But
``Polish Wedding'' is that rare breed _ a slice-of-life portrait
with weight, with relevance, with good performances all around and
with enough emotion and whimsy to carry it all off.
	   ``Polish Wedding,'' a Fox Searchlight film, is written and
directed by Theresa Connelly and produced by Tom Rosenberg and
Julia Chasman. Luis Bacalov wrote the music.

At the Movies: `There's Something About Mary'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIKI KAPSAMBELIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ She's a surgeon who looks like a supermodel,
watches ESPN, plays golf and longs to meet a man who'll share her
passion for draft beer and take her to the Super Bowl. No wonder
all the men who meet Mary fall instantly in love.
	   The problem is, they seem to fall a little too hard, and the
half-witted goobers who stalk her are the bizarre and often
hilarious characters who weave in and out of ``There's Something
About Mary.''
	   From Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the Rhode Island-obsessed
brothers responsible for such dubious achievements as ``Dumb and
Dumber'' and ``Kingpin,'' ``Mary'' is a surprisingly fresh comedy
that, save for a few questionable sight gags, consistently hits its
mark. And like the Farrellys' other movies, it takes place in Rhode
Island.
	   Make no mistake about it: This is a guy movie.
	   Mary (Cameron Diaz) is the knockout date that geeky Ted (Ben
Stiller, wearing a spectacularly hideous mouthful of braces and a
taupe polyester tuxedo) never gets to take to the prom.
	   Years later, frustrated by his inability to find a woman and
settle down, Ted hires private detective Pat (Matt Dillon) to find
Mary, his ideal woman. The detective is so infatuated by Mary, he
goes after her himself, using information from his surveillance to
style himself as her ideal man.
	   The problem is, Pat's such a lout that she can't help but notice
a few chinks in the armor, and Ted is such a klutz that he can't
quite get to Mary to woo her _ he keeps getting sidetracked by
things like a psychotic hitchhiker obsessed with cashing in on a
video for ``Seven Minute Abs.''
	   Of course, this being a guy's movie, there are a few things
about Mary that are so incongruous they defy even the most generous
imagination. For a woman who looks like she's never eaten more than
a lettuce leaf with a side of mineral water, she does a lot of
talking about her love of greasy food, brewskis and
meat-on-a-stick. And how come an intelligent woman who's an
orthopedic surgeon can't figure out that one of her patients is
just faking his injuries to be near her?
	   But while Mary is clearly a cartoon version of Joe Six-Pack's
ideal woman, the film doesn't cross the line and become offensive
to women. It is Mary who ultimately chooses her mate, and she picks
the man most interested in honesty and making her happy.
	   A clever running gag is the Farrellys' use of cult
singer-guitarist Jonathan Richman and a nearly catatonic drummer as
a Greek chorus. Richman's offbeat lyrics and overly sincere style
are played to just the right point, then he's shot to death by one
of Mary's many jealous suitors.
	   In an era when formula comedies abound and the funniest thing
Hollywood can come up with is last year's list of Academy Award
nominees, ``Mary'' is a refreshing change of pace, the kind of film
in which the audience can't predict what happens next.
	   The Twentieth Century Fox film was directed by Peter and Bobby
Farrelly, and written by the Farrellys, Ed Decter and John J.
Strauss. Producers were Charles B. Wessler, Frank Beddor, Michael
Steinberg and Bradley Thomas. Running time: 2 hours.

	   ``Mermaid Avenue'' (Elektra) _ Billy Bragg and Wilco
	   ``Mermaid Avenue'' is a magical album that belongs on the shelf
of anyone interested in country or folk music, singer-songwriters
or American roots music in general.
	   Here's the story: Woody Guthrie's daughter, Nora, approached
Billy Bragg about a pile of lyrics without music her father had
written. Bragg, a Brit whose leftist politics made him a natural
choice, enlisted American alt-country rockers Wilco for a bit of
red clay and twang. It worked spectacularly well. The songs they
ended up with easily could have sounded like stilted museum pieces.
Instead, they are vibrant and alive, raucous and bawdy,
introspective and at times gleefully nonsensical.
	   The Guthrie presented here is a mix of legend and real life,
Dust Bowl leftist and Brooklyn lecher. That he is reinvented
musically on ``Mermaid Avenue'' is apt, since he apparently
reinvented himself once or twice in his lifetime. Wilco's Jeff
Tweedy gives us Guthrie as precursor to the Americana movement,
twangy and dry, a forlorn lover and a sensitive singer-songwriter.
Bragg's songs present a more rambunctious Guthrie, a leftist with a
taste for the pleasures of the flesh.
	   Bragg's ``Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key'' stands out as an
instant timeless classic, and guest vocalist Natalie Merchant
sounds sublime on ``Birds and Ships.'' Wilco sounds sharper and
more focused than on its own sprawling albums, with Tweedy
excelling on ``Hesitating Beauty'' and ``At My Window Sad and
Lonely.''
	   ``Mermaid Avenue'' is alchemy that works, that rare instance of
the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``The Player: A Retrospective'' (Columbia/Legacy) _ David
Bromberg
	   In the late 1970s and early 1980s, David Bromberg led one of the
hottest touring bands in the country. That might sound absurd to
anyone unfamiliar with his work, and given that he has fallen _ by
choice _ into obscurity, that probably includes the majority of the
music-buying public.
	   Bromberg led a big, talented band that could play bluegrass, the
blues, folk and rock with a wild, infectious enthusiasm that
brought crowds to their feet. A hotter-than-July horn section,
several multi-instrumentalists, cool backup singing, screaming
slide guitar playing and finger-picking skills that led to constant
demand as a studio sideman added up to a show at least as
entertaining as any put on by the bigger names of the day.
	   That Bromberg's voice was serviceable at best hardly mattered.
So what if he kind of croaked? He was Everyman with wild hair and
google eyes, a crummy voice and killer guitar licks, who played
with cool people like Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead, bluegrass
icon Vassar Clements and country outlaw Jerry Jeff Walker.
	   ``The Player'' collects some of Bromberg's best work, and while
it's possible to quibble over some of the selections, it is an
excellent look at the career of an artist who deserves more renown.

<TEXT>
	   Entertainment highlights during the week of July 19-25:
	   50 years ago: Eve Arden's radio program, ``Our Miss Brooks,''
debuted on CBS. It featured the acerbic wit she had developed for
her film roles.
	   30 years ago: Iron Butterfly, one of the first heavy metal
bands, entered the U.S. chart with ``In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.'' The
album's original name was ``In the Garden of Eden.''

Lonely Hearts Club Band.'' Critics loved ``Buddy Holly'' and hated
``Sgt. Pepper.''
	   15 years ago: Diana Ross performed a concert in New York's
Central Park. Ross had tried to perform the previous night, but was
forced to quit after only three songs because of strong rains and
heavy winds.
	   10 years ago: Quick action by police averted chaos at an outdoor
``Monsters of Rock'' heavy metal concert starring Van Halen.
Thousands of fans surged toward the stage at the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum. About 150 police officers, some on horseback,
were in the concert area; 60 more officers were dispatched to
control the crowd.
	   And ``Cagney and Lacey'' was voted Best Quality Drama for the
fourth straight year in a poll conducted by members of Viewers for
Quality Television, a citizens lobbying group. The series had
recently been canceled by CBS.
	   One year ago: The Nashville Songwriters Association
International named Vince Gill songwriter-artist of the year. His
composition, ``High Lonesome Sound,'' had been a recent country
hit.
	    &UR; Spoken 10 years ago:
	   ``I want to thank everybody I stepped on to get to the top. Now
they can walk on me.'' _ Entertainer Paul Reubens, a k a Pee-wee
Herman, at the unveiling of his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
	   Spoken five years ago:
	   ``I just knew getting married was the right thing to do and I
couldn't be happier.'' _ Singer Lyle Lovett, referring to his new
bride, actress Julia Roberts.
	   ``When I'd mess up, he'd yell at me while promising me bubble
gum if I'd get the scene right so that he could go home.'' _
Eleven-year-old Gaby Hoffman, describing her ``Field of Dreams''
co-star Kevin Costner.
	   Spoken one year ago:
	   ``I'm not really in the beer business. Anything that I make from
this will go to charity, like Paul Newman does with his spaghetti
sauce.'' _ Actor Clint Eastwood, referring to his new beer, Pale
Ale Rider. The brew was named after Eastwood's 1985 Western.

 &UR; Yankees 10, Blue Jays 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Bernie Williams, sidelined for more than five
weeks because of a sprained right knee, homered and singled twice
as the New York Yankees beat the Toronto Blue Jays 10-3 Saturday.
	   Williams, activated from the disabled list before the game,
scored three runs and drove in two. Tim Raines hit a grand slam as
the Yankees stopped a two-game losing streak _ they have not lost
three in a row since the first three games of the season.
	   Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez (4-2) pitched seven strong
innings. New York took advantage of Toronto's season-high five
errors and kept pace with the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates for the best
record in major league history after 91 games (68-23).
	   Juan Guzman (4-12), who now leads the AL in losses, dropped his
third straight decision despite allowing just one earned run in six
innings.
	   Carlos Delgado homered in the Blue Jays second. Mike Stanley and
Ed Sprague hit solo home runs in the Toronto ninth off Mariano
Rivera, who had not allowed a homer in 33 2-3 innings this season.
 &UR; Indians 15, White Sox 9
	   In Chicago, Brian Giles had five RBIs and Travis Fryman hit a
go-ahead single in the eighth inning as the Cleveland Indians blew
an eight-run lead before regrouping to beat the Chicago White Sox.
	   Giles went 4-for-5, hit his first career grand slam and set a
career high for RBIs as the Indians snapped a four-game losing
streak. Cleveland hit five homers, including a two-run drive by Jim
Thome in the ninth.
	   Cleveland, which led 8-0 after three innings, broke a 9-9 tie
with three runs in the eighth against struggling reliever Matt
Karchner (2-4).
	   Paul Shuey (2-1), who gave up a game-winning homer Friday night
to Robin Ventura, got the victory. Mike Jackson went the final 1
2-3 innings for his 21st save.
 &UR; Twins 4, Athletics 3
	   In Oakland, California, Matt Lawton's second double of the game
drove in Paul Molitor with the go-ahead run in the eighth inning as
the Minnesota Twins posted another comeback victory, beating the
Oakland Athletics.
	   Molitor drew a leadoff walk from Mike Oquist (6-6), who retired
the next two batters on groundouts before being relieved by Mike
Mohler.
	   Lawton grounded a 3-1 pitch down the right-field line to score
Molitor and give him his second straight three-hit game.
	   Hector Carrasco (3-1) got one out in the eighth inning to pick
up his second straight win in relief. Rick Aguilera got four outs
for his 21st save.
	   Mike Morgan, scheduled to start for the Twins, was scratched 10
minutes before gametime because of an abdominal strain. Mike
Trombley started instead.
	   Twins right fielder Alex Ochoa threw out two runners at the
plate.

After 159 strokes, Woods and Price just happy it's over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Nick Price looked as if he was
shell-shocked. Tiger Woods stared straight ahead in disbelief.
	   Together they walked off the 18th green Saturday, out of
patience and most likely out of chances to win the British Open.
	   ``I'm just happy it's over,'' Woods said. ``The suffering is
over.''
	   Indeed it was, after a day that began with much promise ended
with only the polite applause of the grandstand galleries.
	   Price had just missed a final putt for par to shoot 82. Woods
tapped in for par and a 77. Between the two, they spent 159 strokes
in a futile attempt to tame wind-swept Royal Birkdale.
	   Now, after four hours of hitting balls in and out of knee-high
rough, missing short putts and generally playing like weekend
golfers, they walked step-in-step to the scoring trailer to make it
official.
	   Price stepped aside to let Woods in first, as if he was
reluctant to formally commit this round to history, and with good
reason. On the scorecard it looked just as ugly as it did on the
course _ 37-45-82.
	   ``I lost a little bit of confidence and suddenly _ 82,'' Price
said. ``I've probably had worse rounds as a pro, but not too
many.''
	   It wasn't supposed to be this way as Price and Woods stepped to
the first tee.
	   One stroke off the lead at 2 under for the tournament and
playing in the next-to-last group, they were supposed to set the
pace and put the pressure on second-round leader Brian Watts and
17-year-old English amateur Justin Rose.
	   If anyone was to blow up, it would be the untested Watts or the
young Rose. Not Woods, and especially not Price, who won the claret
jug in 1994.
	   But in the 35 mph (55 kph) winds of Birkdale, they did. So did
many others on a day when no one shot under par on the coast of the
Irish Sea. Phil Mickelson shot an 85 and 21 others couldn't break
80.
	   ``When you have 82 professionals and no one can break par,
something's amiss,'' Price said.
	   On the course, it was Woods who faltered first. Even-par after
three holes, he had a 15-footer (4.5-meter) for birdie on the
fourth hole but knocked it 4 feet (1.2-meter) too long and then
missed the putt coming back.
	   Woods missed a short putt for par on the next hole, then hacked
a chip shot on the tough sixth and three-putted again for a double
bogey. He was 4 over on the front nine, while Price bogeyed the
ninth to go 3 over.
	   Then, things really fell apart.
	   Over the next five holes, two of the best golfers in the world
could manage only one par between them. Woods bogeyed the first
three holes on the back side, while Price bogeyed one and took a
double bogey on the other two.
	   If Woods hadn't pulled himself together to birdie Nos. 15 and
17, both par-5s, he also might have shot in the 80s.
	   ``If you lose it mentally, you're going to make some high
numbers,'' Woods said. ``People have no idea how hard it is out
there.''
	   Price did. The two double bogeys seemed to take what fight he
had left out of him and, by the time he was done, he was signing a
card with a big fat 45 on the back nine.
	   ``If you lose some confidence like I did on the back nine and
not make any putts, 45 is not out of the picture,'' he said.
	   Woods was at least able to joke about his round after spending a
few minutes in a photographer's area. Asked if he and Price talked
much about their troubles, he said:
	   ``We really didn't. He was either left or right and I was always
in the opposite spot.''
	   Price's 82 put him at 10 over for the tournament, 10 behind
Watts and with far too many golfers between him and the leaders to
be able to mount any kind of charge on Sunday.
	   Woods, though, held out hope, even though rounds of 73-77 had
taken him from 5 under and a tie for the lead after the first round
to 5 over and tied for fourth place.
	   ``I'm in pretty good shape right now. I'm only five back,''
Woods said. ``I'll go out tomorrow and try to put a good number up
and see what happens.''

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A guerrilla leader admitted
Saturday that his group planted bombs at several banks during a
strike by Puerto Rican telephone workers, but not the bomb that
wounded a police officer.
	   Filiberto Ojeda Rios, leader of the pro-independence People's
Boricua Army, made the admission during an interview broadcast on
WKAQ-AM radio.
	   Two of the station's reporters said they were taken blindfold to
Ojeda's hideout, where they conducted the interview.
	   Ojeda said his group planted two bombs at San Juan area branches
of Banco Popular. The bank is joining U.S. telecommunications giant
GTE Corp. in a dlrs 1.9 billion deal to privatize the Puerto Rico
Telephone Co.
	   The deal touched off a strike by telephone employees that began
June 18 to protest the sale of the telephone company. The strikers
are concerned that the sale will result in mass layoffs.
	   During the interview, Ojeda said his group did not plant the
bomb that exploded in a police officer's hands in the southern town
of Santa Isabel on June 25.
	   Ojeda's group carried out a wave of bombings and attacks on U.S.
government installations during the 1970s and 1980s. Ojeda has been
a fugitive since 1991.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Tropical storm Celia moved away from the Baja
California coast Saturday and headed out to the Pacific, prompting
Mexican authorities to lift a tropical storm warning for the
southern part of the peninsula.
	   The storm will continue to travel out to sea and weaken, the
National Hurricane Center in Miami predicted.
	   Celia's winds weakened to about 50 mph (80 kph) by Saturday,
when the storm was located about 200 miles (321 kms) west of Cabo
San Lucas, Baja California, moving west at about 14 mph (22 kph).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian police have launched a
nationwide sweep aimed at curbing the illegal trade in prescription
medications by arresting the sellers and seizing medicines.
	   Police in Brazil's two major cities on Friday and Saturday
seized hundreds of boxes of prescription drugs, phony drugs and
medicines stolen from hospitals, the news media reported Saturday.
	   The police campaign to ferret out illegal drug vendors began
early this month after at least 13 women became pregnant after
taking fake contraceptives.
	   ``Nobody is safe,'' Dr. Antonio Carlos Zanini, a consultant for
the World Health Organization, told Veja, the nation's leading news
magazine.
	   The problem of stolen and counterfeit or fake drugs stems partly
from the Brazilian propensity to overmedicate. Half of all
prescribed medicines in Brazil are considered unnecessary, Veja
quoted the Ministry of Health as saying.
	   Brazil currently has 55,000 pharmacies, but Veja quoted World
Health Organization officials as saying that 25,000 pharmacies
would be an ideal number. Brazil is the world's fourth largest
consumer of pharmaceuticals.
	   Health authorities also concede that lax enforcement has caused
a proliferation of false and stolen drugs in recent years.

Wall of water crashes into remote Papua New Guinean villages

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0
magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast,
crushing villages and leaving hundreds missing, officials said
Sunday.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off
the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean.
	   The National Disaster Center said Sunday that hundreds of people
are missing and thousands have no food or shelter. The Papua New
Guinea Defense Force was on standby Sunday and police and health
services officials expected the official death toll of 71 to rise.
	   ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless and
there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,''
Fr. Austen Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. (ABC) radio.
	   ABC radio, a government-owned corporation, quoted Australian
army officials Sunday as saying the death toll could rise to as
high as 2,000 people, but that figure could not be confirmed by
Australia's government.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
located about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of the northeastern
tip of Australia.
	   Disaster authorities said the wave struck to the west of the
town of Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at least four
villages.
	   The area, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) northwest of the
capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with villages consisting of
homes made of jungle materials built on beaches.
	   Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said in a
statement that a community school, government station, Catholic
mission station and the Nimas village in the Sissano area west of
Aitape had been completely destroyed. Thirty people were confirmed
dead.
	   The Warapu village had also been completely destroyed, with 11
confirmed deaths and many missing, Igara said.
	   Sixteen people were confirmed dead in the devastated Arop
village, and two children had died in Malol, which was wiped out.
Five people died in the Teles-Lambu villages.
	   Igara said the population in the area affected by the tsunami
was 8,000 to 10,000 people.
	   ``Officers are now visiting the affected villages and areas to
establish the whereabouts, safety and health of the population,''
he said.
	   Australia said it will provide transport for relief supplies and
a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea. Other air force transport
planes were on standby in Sydney, ready to fly supplies in if
requested by the Papua New Guinean government.
	   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is
a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
	   ``She said she was shocked at the tidal wave, and that her
thoughts were with the families of the bereaved and injured,'' said
a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Let the games begin.
	   No, not those games. The other ones _ The Goodwill Games, touted
as the alternative to the Olympic experience that offers money, as
well as gold medals, to winners.
	   On Saturday in lower Manhattan, revelry, fireworks and songs
opened the Games' 15 days of multi-sport competition.
	   More than 1,300 athletes from 60 countries, representing sports
like swimming, gymnastics and ice skating (yes, even in the
summer), are expected to compete in the Games.
	   The audience at Battery Park City had a clear view of the Statue
of Liberty as they awaited entertainment as mixed as the
competition: teen singing-sensation Brandy, pop stars Hootie and
the Blowish, Ray Charles and a few Broadway stars.
	   The crowd went wild with the appearance of the Goodwill Games
Dancers performing with a group of kids dressed all in white _ the
Junior Division Students of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center.
As the two groups danced, Natalie Cole and gospel singers BeBe and
CeCe Winans sang ``In the Eyes of a Child.''
	   ``It's really exciting to have one of the world's best sports
events right where you live. I love it. It's like waking up one day
_ and Godzilla's in your back yard,'' said Stoya Ruach, 12, who
lives on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
	   She's rooting for American and Canadian gymnasts, partly because
she got a chance to meet some Canadian athletes in the VIP section.
	   The Goodwill Games were founded by billionaire media mogul Ted
Turner as an olive branch offering to athletes after the Olympic
boycotts in 1980 and 1984 by the United States and the Soviet
Union, respectively.
	   Some of the proceeds of the games will go to The Boys and Girls
Clubs of America to develop programs and activities for youngsters.
	   Vice President Al Gore also got into the act. During a Saturday
morning visit to The Children's Aid Society Boys and Girls Club in
Harlem, he taped a message to the athletes to be played at the
opening ceremonies.
	   Gore refereed a relay race along with OIympic gold medal hurdler
Allen Johnson and former NCAA half-mile (0.80-kilometer) champion
Joetta Clark, both of whom are to compete. The vice president even
managed to shoot hoops with teen-agers, drawing cheers from the
crowds when he sank two consecutive 3-point shots.
	   ``They told me no dunking today,'' Gore said to the crowd after
14-year-old John Jemmett slammed the basketball into the hoop.
	   But the real Goodwill Games competition starts Sunday, with big
names like Olympic champs Michael Johnson, Alexander Popov, Dan
O'Brien and Jackie Joyner-Kersee on hand.
	   Ticket sales have not been impressive, with less than a third of
the 600,000 available sold by the end of last week for events
spread around New York City and Long Island.
	   But there's a bright side to the smaller crowds.
	   ``It's better than the Olympics because it's not as large and
imposing,'' said Eileen Letter, of Boston, sitting in a front row
with her two boys and her husband. The family planned to take in
the swimming events and women's soccer.
	   ``You can come here, actually get tickets and grab a little
piece of the Goodwill Games for yourself,'' Mrs. Letter said.

one of Boston's AL-record four two-out homers in a seven-run fourth
inning.

and Nomar Garciaparra also connected for the Red Sox.
	   The four two-out homers broke the AL record of three held by six
teams, the last by Boston against Seattle in 1977. The major league
mark is five by the New York Giants against Cincinnati in 1939.
	   Steve Avery (7-2) won his third straight decision, and Derek

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 
 &UR; Dodgers 10, Cardinals 8 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Gary Sheffield and Matt Luke each hit two-run
homers in the eighth inning and the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied
past the St. Louis Cardinals 10-8 Saturday.
	   Raul Mondesi and Tripp Cromer also homered for the Dodgers, who
tied a season high with four homers.
	   Ray Lankford and newcomer Pat Kelly connected for the Cardinals,
who led 7-2 after four innings.
	   After hitting two home runs the day before, Mark McGwire went
0-for-4 for St. Louis. He also drew his 100th walk.
	   The Cardinals led 8-6 going into the eighth, but the Dodgers
came back against Jeff Brantley (0-5), who blew his sixth save in
20 chances.
	   Mark Guthrie (2-1) pitched a scoreless seventh to get the win.
Jeff Shaw pitched the eighth and ninth for his 25th save and second
with the Dodgers.
 &UR; Mets 7, Phillies 0 &QC; 
	   In New York, Mike Piazza homered twice and Al Leiter pitched six
scoreless innings in his first start since spending three weeks on
the disabled list as the New York Mets beat the Philadelphia
Phillies.
	   Leiter (10-4) went on the disabled list on June 27 after he
partially tore a tendon in his left knee covering first base
against the Yankees. In his return, he allowed two hits and struck
out four.
	   Greg McMichael and Dennis Cook finished off the three-hitter as
the Mets recorded consecutive shutouts for the first time since May
1996 when they blanked San Francisco and San Diego.
	   The Phillies have been shut out five times this season, four by
the Mets.
	   Leiter is 7-1 in his last eight starts, losing the game in which
he was injured. He lowered his ERA to 1.76, second best in the
majors.
	   Piazza homered twice in a game for the third time this season,
and for the first time since joining the Mets in late May. He hit a
two-run shot in the first and solo shot in the sixth, his 16th, off
Tyler Green (6-6).
 &UR; Astros 7, Giants 2 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Ricky Gutierrez and Derek Bell hit home runs and
Sean Bergman pitched seven strong innings, leading the Houston
Astros over the San Francisco Giants.
	   The Giants have lost seven of eight games since the All-Star
break.
	   The Astros broke open the game by scoring four times in the
eighth. Bell and Carl Everett hit RBI doubles, Gutierrez had a
sacrifice fly and another run scored on a wild pitch.
	   San Francisco starter Danny Darwin (6-7) allowed only one runner
to reach second base until Gutierrez led off the fifth inning with
a home run, breaking a scoreless game.
	   Bergman (9-5) allowed seven hits, struck out five and walked
one.
 &UR; Brewers 7, Braves 1 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Steve Woodard dominated Atlanta on the mound and at
the plate, allowing only three hits in eight shutout innings and
driving in two runs for Milwaukee.
	   Woodard (7-5), a 23-year-old right-hander cheered on by a
contingent of family and friends from his native Alabama, retired
the first 13 hitters before Ryan Klesko doubled to the gap in
right-center. Klesko was thrown out at third trying to stretch the
hit into a triple.
	   Mike Matheny had a career-high four hits, including three
doubles. Fernando Vina homered off Kevin Millwood (10-5).
 &UR; Padres 2, Reds 1 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Joey Hamilton won a matchup of trade-rumored
pitchers and Greg Vaughn hit his third homer in two nights for San
Diego
	   The Padres, a franchise-best 63-34, have won four in a row and
six of seven to open a season-high 10-game lead in the NL West.
	   Hamilton (8-9) got his 50th career win by giving up a run on
three hits in six innings to outpitch Pete Harnisch (7-4). Trevor
Hoffman got the final four outs to remain perfect in 29 save
opportunities this season.
	   Vaughn led off the fourth inning with his 33rd homer.
 &UR; Pirates 5, Expos 2 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Turner Ward and Kevin Young hit consecutive homers
and Jon Lieber retired 19 straight batters at one stretch, leading
Pittsburgh past Montreal.
	   Lieber (7-10) pitched a five-hitter for his second complete game
of the season. He gave up four hits in the first inning, but
Montreal managed only Shane Andrews' leadoff single in the eighth
after that.
	   Lieber struck out four and walked none in the fourth complete
game of his career. He matched his career-best for fewest hits
allowed.
	   Shawn Boskie (1-3) did not get out of the first inning.
 &UR; Marlins 2, Cubs 1 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Rookie Brian Meadows pitched seven strong innings and
Todd Zeile homered as Florida beat Chicago to to stop a three-game
losing streak.
	   Meadows (9-6) won his fifth straight decision. He allowed one
run and six hits, striking out four and walking two. Matt Mantei
finished with 1 1-3 scoreless innings for his third save. Mark
Clark (5-9) took the loss.
	   Henry Rodriguez hit his 23rd home run for Chicago.

 &UR; Eds: SUBS David Hasselhoff item to correct age to 46. Contains
items on Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, Luciano
Pavarotti, David Hasselhoff, Spain's Princess Elena. Some items may

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles dined
with friends at an exclusive club Friday, on the eve of her 51st
birthday.
	   The meal with 10 friends was to celebrate the birthday of the
host, travel company boss Geoffrey Kent, a polo-playing friend of
the prince, according to a spokesman for Charles, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   According to the Daily Mail, the prince and Mrs. Parker Bowles
arrived separately, but left together at 10.30 p.m.
	   After spending the night at St James's Palace, Mrs. Parker
Bowles returned to her home, the paper said. The prince went to
Buckingham Palace.
	   Last year Charles organized a party at his Gloucestershire home
to mark Mrs. Parker Bowles's 50th birthday.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jim Poulos, the narrator in the Broadway musical
``Rent,'' knew that Luciano Pavarotti would be attending the show.
	   So, while singing one line, Poulos pulled out a big white
handkerchief, like Pavarotti does in concerts, and flapped it
around, dramatically Thursday. He hoped the famous tenor would
accept that as the homage it was meant to be and not be offended,
Poulos said Friday.
	   Pavarotti went backstage at the intermission and met Poulos and
didn't mention it, which Poulos took as acceptance.
	   Pavarotti complimented the production for having young
performers and told Poulos the original _ 1897 _ cast of ``La
Boheme,'' the opera on which ``Rent'' bases its plot, was young.
``He seemed excited about the show and hugged me,'' Poulos said.
	   Poulos saw his first ``La Boheme'' in San Francisco in 1985 and
saw the Australian Opera's video of the opera. ``The singers were
young and thin,'' he said. ``You believed all these people were
probably starving.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``Baywatch'' star David Hasselhoff celebrated
his 46th birthday in TV hero style _ by plummeting from an
airplane.
	   The actor made his first parachute jump on his birthday Friday.
He became one of the few civilians to jump with the Army's elite
parachute team, the Golden Knights.
	   Wearing a gold-colored jumpsuit, Hasselhoff's jump included a
60-second free fall before his chute opened and he landed at Van
Nuys Airport.
	   During the tandem jump his instructor, U.S. Army Sgt. Shane
Hollar, was fastened to the actor's back and they shared a
parachute.
	   He was met later by his wife, two daughters and his father, all
holding handmade ``Happy Birthday'' signs.
	   Hasselhoff, also a singer, said the jump wasn't too scary.
	   ``I was more terrified at the Princess Diana benefit concert
because I didn't know all the words to my song,'' Hasselhoff said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Princess Elena gave birth Friday to
a boy, the Spanish royal couple's first grandchild, the Zarzuela
Palace said.
	   Elena, in her mid-30s, the eldest daughter of King Juan Carlos
and Queen Sofia, gave birth shortly after 2 a.m. in a Madrid
clinic.
	   The child is to be called Felipe Juan Froilan de Todos los
Santos, the palace said in a statement.
	   Elena is married to banker Jaime de Marichalar. A teacher and
skilled equestrian, she is second in line to the Spanish throne
after her brother Prince Felipe, who is single.
	   The family's younger daughter, Princess Cristina, is married but
childless.

<TEXT>
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off
the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean.
	   ABC radio, a government-owned corporation, quoted Australian
army officials Sunday as saying the death toll could rise to as
high as 2,000 people, but that figure could not be confirmed by the
Papua New Guinean government.
	   Among the dead are scores of schoolchildren.
	   Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on Papua New
Guinea's northwest coast, said the tsunami that hit the coast west
of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had
almost completely destroyed another.
	   ``The latest death toll for the district is 599,'' district
disaster coordinating chairman Dickson Dalle said. ``But the figure
may increase as more bodies are found.''

	   Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people are missing.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They are scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims of the disaster were old people
and schoolchildren.
	   ``We have assumed that the schools in Arop, the schools in
Sissano and the schools in Warapu will be closed because we don't
have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're dead . . . they're all
dead.''
	   Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu
village and the Arop village had been wiped out and the Malol
village had almost been completely destroyed.
	   At Warapu 500 people had been confirmed dead, while Malol
village had 40 dead and Sissano 41.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate was expected to arrive in Aitape later
this afternoon to assess the situation.
	   Earlier, the National Disaster Center said that hundreds of
people were missing and thousands had no food or shelter.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
located about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of the northeastern
tip of Australia.

	   Disaster authorities said the area, about 600 kilometers (370
miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with
villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials and built on
beaches.
	   Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said the
population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000
people.
	   Australia said it will provide transport for relief supplies and
a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea. Other air force transport
planes were on standby in Sydney, ready to fly supplies in if
requested by the Papua New Guinean government.
	   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is
a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
	   ``She said she was shocked at the tidal wave, and that her
thoughts were with the families of the bereaved and injured,'' said
a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman.

magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast,
crushing villages and killing nearly 600 people, officials said
Sunday.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off
the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean.
	   ABC radio, a government-owned corporation, quoted Australian
army officials Sunday as saying the death toll could rise to as
high as 2,000 people, but that figure could not be confirmed by the
Papua New Guinean government.
	   Among the dead are scores of schoolchildren.
	   Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on Papua New
Guinea's northwest coast, said the tsunami that hit the coast west
of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had
almost completely destroyed another.
	   ``The latest death toll for the district is 599,'' district
disaster coordinating chairman Dickson Dalle said. ``But the figure
may increase as more bodies are found.''
	   Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people are missing.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They are scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims of the disaster were old people
and schoolchildren.
	   ``We have assumed that the schools in Arop, the schools in
Sissano and the schools in Warapu will be closed because we don't
have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're dead . . . they're all
dead.''
	   Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu
village and the Arop village had been wiped out and the Malol
village had almost been completely destroyed.
	   At Warapu 500 people had been confirmed dead, while Malol
village had 40 dead and Sissano 41.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate was expected to arrive in Aitape later
this afternoon to assess the situation.
	   Earlier, the National Disaster Center said that hundreds of
people were missing and thousands had no food or shelter.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
located about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of the northeastern
tip of Australia.
	   Disaster authorities said the area, about 600 kilometers (370
miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with
villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials and built on
beaches.
	   Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said the
population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000
people.
	   Australia said it will provide transport for relief supplies and
a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea. Other air force transport
planes were on standby in Sydney, ready to fly supplies in if
requested by the Papua New Guinean government.
	   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is
a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
	   ``She said she was shocked at the tidal wave, and that her
thoughts were with the families of the bereaved and injured,'' said
a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman.

Japan ponders fate of doomsday cult guru _ and use of gallows

	   TOKYO (AP) _ To many Japanese, he personifies evil.
	   Shoko Asahara is a convicted con man turned self-proclaimed
savior who allegedly sent his followers into the Tokyo subways
during the morning rush hour with bags of deadly nerve gas and
orders to kill.
	   But while much of the public might like to see him go to the
gallows, Asahara, the founder and leader of Aum Shinri Kyo cult,
has assumed an odd new role _ as cause celebre for Japan's
scattered opponents of capital punishment.
	   Defending Asahara are some of the country's most active
opponents of the death penalty. And for Asahara's chief defense
counsel, Osamu Watanabe, the question isn't whether Asahara should
be hanged, but whether anyone should.
	   ``The death penalty is beyond punishment,'' he said. ``It's
revenge.''
	   Three years after Asahara and dozens of his followers were
arrested for the worst terrorist attack Japan has experienced _ in
which 12 people died _ the cult leader's fate remains in the hands
of the courts.
	   Sessions of the trial are currently held four times a month, and
if appeals are filed the final decision could go well into the next
decade.
	   Asahara faces charges that include the subway attack and several
other incidents _ 26 murders in all _ allegedly carried out by
members of his neo-Buddhist doomsday cult. But the Tokyo District
Court has heard testimony on only three of the main charges against
him so far.
	   Part of the blame lies with the defense.
	   Asahara's lawyers have been criticized for trying to drag the
trial out and thus postpone the verdict of death their client may
well face.
	   Meanwhile, Asahara's defiant manner throughout the trial _ he
often erupts in angry outbursts, or sleeps through hearings _ has
outraged the public.
	   Watanabe stressed Asahara's trial should not be influenced by
public emotions.
	   Emotions, however, are an accepted part of Japan's legal system.
	   Ikuo Hayashi, the cult's top doctor, drew much compassion from
the public for confessing to spreading nerve gas on a train and
expressing his regret over and over in court, often breaking down
in tears. Instead of the gallows, he was sentenced to life in
prison.
	   Garnering compassion for Asahara in this country would be a tall
task.
	   ``If Asahara doesn't get the death sentence, I can't imagine who
should,'' said Shizue Takahashi, the widow of the conductor who was
killed in the subway gassing.
	   Even so, opponents of the death penalty see the Aum trials _
there are dozens still underway _ as a golden opportunity to get
people to think about an issue rarely subjected to public scrutiny.
	   Fifty people are currently on Japan's death row, according to
Amnesty International.
	   Though executions were temporarily halted from November 1989
until March 1993, Japan has executed 28 criminals since. Three
convicted murderers were hanged in June alone.
	   A majority of Japanese seem to support the status quo.
	   In a 1994 survey, the most recent available from the government,
73.8 percent of the respondents said they support retaining the
death penalty.
	   ``People think they have nothing to do with the death penalty,''
said Nobuaki Futami, who leads a group of 100 members of Parliament
opposing capital punishment.
	   But among experts, Japan's death penalty has long been
criticized as cruel and secretive. The Japan Bar Association has
for years appealed for a suspension of executions.
	   Prisoners are held in prolonged solitary confinement for years,
then told of their execution just hours before it is to be
conducted.
	   Officials at the Ministry of Justice refuse to confirm when
executions are carried out, which is generally a national holiday
or time when Parliament is not in session.
	   Officials say that the secrecy surrounding executions is
maintained out of respect to the survivors of the crimes and the
families of those put to death.
	   Futami and others say that is not true.
	   ``The idea is just to hush up discussions,'' he said.

Camel races just the ticket for small Outback town

	   BOULIA, Australia (AP) _ As five camels near the end of a race
on a dry and dusty red track, one cantankerous beast decides he's
had enough. He sits down just five meters from the finishing line
and lets out a long, loud roar.
	   Boulia, in Australia's central western Queensland, usually has a
population of 300. On this mid-July weekend, however, it swells to
over 3,000 for Australia's richest professional camel race _ the
Boulia Desert Sands 2,000.
	   A camel race is always an unpredictable event and the crowd in
this tiny Australian Outback town, 1,900 kilometers (about 1,200
miles) northwest of the state capital of Brisbane, loves it.
	   The camel has long had a reputation for being cranky and not
terribly intelligent, but race organizer and camel farmer Paddy
McHugh says the camel is an underrated beast.
	   McHugh owns the Australian Camel Farm, catching and selling
camels, as well as running desert camel treks for tourists.
	   With the Desert Sands 2,000 now an annual event on a growing
national camel racing calendar, McHugh is aiming to boost the
profile of the humped beast.
	   ``In the Middle East they are a multi-billion dollar industry,''
McHugh said Sunday.
	   ``I'm trying to create a professional scene here where the
people who train the animals make money from racing them instead of
putting bullets through their heads.''
	   At the Boulia races, the total prize pool is dlrs U.S. 18,000,
which includes cash prizes and a motorbike. While the professional
jockeys take the racing seriously, there are plenty of amateurs
competing just for fun.
	   Carolyn Annerud, a doctor from Juneau, Alaska who is now based
at a hospital in Townsville, Queensland, spent a week at McHugh's
jockey training school before racing Saturday.
	   ``I was thrown the first ride and it turned into a flying
lesson,'' she said. ``But I think they're beautiful animals.''
	   Former horse racing jockey Ray Lemm took up camel racing after
retiring from horses and now spends much of the year touring the
camel race circuit.
	   ``I ride for free but I still take it very seriously,'' he says.
``It's a prestige thing for us.''
	   John Richardson is the owner of Bullamakanka, Australia's
biggest prize-winning camel. ``Bulla'' as he calls him, has won 35
races and dlrs U.S. 36,000.
	   ``He's a very smart camel,'' said Richardson. ``We train him
like a racehorse and give him runs on the beach.''
	   Camel racing in Australia worth just U.S. dlrs 78,000 in annual
prize money, but McHugh says racing has the potential to become a
primary purpose of raising camels.
	   ``Their meat is worth more but I don't believe it will ever take
off because it's too hard to farm. I think possibly the race
industry may take the lead over tourism in years to come but we've
still got a lot further to go.''
	   McHugh estimates there are between 5,000 and 10,000 camels
within a 200-kilometer (120-mile) radius of Boulia. A conservative
estimate of Australia's total camel population is 100,000 camels,
with the largest numbers in the Western Desert.
	   ``We're the last country in the world with feral camels and
because Australia is such an arid land with a vast amount of
desert, they thrive,'' said McHugh.
	   ``They just don't need the water supply that normal animals
need.''

United beats Fire, Revolution defeats Burn in MLS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Roy Lassiter scored three goals and D.C.
United won its fourth straight game with a 4-1 victory over the
Chicago Fire Saturday.
	   United (17-5) improved to 11-1 at RFK Stadium. Chicago (13-7)
has lost two straight after an 11-game winning streak.
	   All three of Lassiter's goals came in the second half against
Fire keeper Jorge Campos who started in goal for Mexico in the
World Cup.
	   Campos replaced Zach Thornton who started all 11 games during
the Fire's hot streak and leads the league with a 1.00
goals-against average.
	   Jesse Marsch scored in the 38th minute to give the Fire a 1-0
advantage at the half, but the Chicago defense and Campos couldn't
protect the lead.
	   Lassiter, who now has a league-leading 15 goals, tied the game
on a penalty kick in the 53rd minute and then put United in front
with a header in the 69th minute.
	   Jaime Moreno's unassisted goal in the 78th minute broke the game
open and Lassiter completed his hat trick with 29 seconds left in
the match.
	   Marsch scored off a perfect through ball from Francis Okaroh.
 &UR; Revolution 3, Burn 1
	   In Dallas, the New England Revolution won for just the second
time in 13 games Saturday night, beating the Dallas Burn 3-1 behind
Joe-Max Moore's two second-half goals.
	   Moore scored the game-winner for New England (6-14) in the 67th
minute on a cross by Imad Baba. Mike Burns also assisted on the
goal.
	   Moore iced the victory in the 88th minute with a blast from 12
yards (11 meters) out after working a give-and-go with Raul Diaz
Arce.
	   Forward Mickey Trotman broke the Burn's 288-minute scoreless
streak with a goal in the 32nd minute for Dallas (9-11). Chad
Deering chipped a pass over the Revolution defense to set up
Trotman for a shot into an empty net.
	   Ivan McKinley tied the game for New England in the 49th minute,
slotting a shot past Dallas goaltender Mark Dodd.
